Behind the sounds of 'Game of Thrones'
A bag of bones, women screaming at a Chicago bar, and a beloved pet.

A dragon¡¯s rumbling growl, bone-chilling screeches heard from the undead, and a direwolf¡¯s  loud howl: these are just some of the bizarre sounds ¡°Game of Thrones¡± fans have become accustomed to over the past eight years. But what goes into making fantasy characters is sometimes as common as dog barks, screams from your local bar and ¡ª maybe a little less ordinary ¡ª a bag of rattling bones.

All of the tell-tale sounds in ¡°Game of Thrones¡± are the product of lead sound designer Paula Fairfield¡¯s creativity, who layered, pitched and distorted ordinary bits of audio to create the sounds of white walkers, dragons and bears, the Stark direwolves, and more.

¡°I¡¯ve enjoyed so much of it, because it¡¯s such a varied show with so many opportunities for sound,¡± Fairfield said in an interview with NBC News. ¡°It¡¯s beautiful, it¡¯s opulent, it¡¯s over the top in so many way. It¡¯s a delicious feast.¡±

Listen closely to these ¡°Game of Thrones¡± tracks and see if you can trace the ordinary audio element that helped create the sounds you hear during an episode.

Drogon
Even though Drogon, one of the three dragons under Daenerys Targaryen¡¯s wing for most of the series, can finish off a herd of sheep in less than a minute, he¡¯s also a tender and affectionate character, the embodiment of Daenerys¡¯ dead husband, Khal Drogo, and fiercely defensive.

At least that¡¯s how Fairfield sees Drogon. In designing Drogon¡¯s sound palette, she worked to create a track that was just as complex as his character.

¡°I don¡¯t do a roar, I do a character,¡± Fairfield said. ¡°I look at the physicality of the creature, I think about the mechanics of how they breath, how their chest cavity is, I think about all that stuff. Because I want to come up with something interesting and I want you to believe what you¡¯re hearing.¡±

Adult Drogon's growls, rumbles, and roars include a myriad of tracts from alligators and elephants to a touch of Tibetan throat singing for tone, an endangered rhinoceros from the Central Florida Zoo, and even an elephant for Cersei Lannister.

Blue Fire of Viserys
Of all the unusual sounds that Fairfield sourced for her ¡°Game of Thrones,¡± the sounds that went into the dragon Viserion¡¯s blue ice were the most unique.

¡°I like embedding things and layering stuff so you are kind of feeling something, you¡¯re not sure why, but it¡¯s because there is something in there playing,¡± she said.

And that thing playing in the sound of the blue fire are singing quartz crystals, rocks that when rubbed together give off a high frequency tone. The sound and the fact that the crystals are also used in shamanistic healing for transformation, immediately attracted Fairfield.

¡°I took and recorded these crystals with a bat mic to get real high frequencies and then lowered them down. It¡¯s a subtle element, but when you listen to it there¡¯s something bigger. It feels weird in your gut, you¡¯re going to feel a certain way about what you¡¯re looking at and hearing,¡± she said.

Dead Umber Child
The scream of the undead Umber child burning alive from the first episode of season eight echoed in viewers ears long after the final credits rolled. Fairfield brought this bone-chilling sound to life by collecting the screams of several women that are a part of a group that watch ¡°Game of Thrones¡± together at Burlington Bar in Chicago. Fairfield knew they could ¡°scream extremely well,¡± so she called them up and asked them to record their best tortured screams.

¡°The sound is literally the embodiment of a collision of fire and ice right in that moment,¡± said Fairfield. ¡°A lot of pitching and twisting and stuff, and I ended up with that nasty ass thing.¡±

Viserion and Wight Bear
When designing the sound palette for Viserion's post undead-baptism, Fairfield wanted to create something that sounded hollow and lifeless.  

¡°Viserion could be a flying bag of bones basically, and I wanted to get that feel,¡± Fairfield said.

Enter the bone charm, a bag of bones that Fairfield would record smashing on the ground, jostling against one another, etc. A little out there as a concept, but for Fairfield it made sense with Viserion¡¯s story.

¡°I try to find a story that has some kind of logic. So I kind of had in my brain this idea that if they¡¯re frozen, icy, bony beings that their vocal chords also got frozen and boney," Fairfield said. "So you hear that knocking sound and it¡¯s kind of the idea that sound is coming out, but the vocal cords are brittle.¡±

The bone charm came into play with the infamous wight bear that fatally injured Thoros of Myr at the end of the seventh season.

Direwolves
While the direwolves didn¡¯t appear too often in the most recent seasons, they are still notable throughout the entire series. Along with the sounds of traditional wolves, Fairfield wanted to give them a little more dimension: Even though the direwolves are wild animals, they are also beloved members of the Stark family.

This brought Fairfield to use the audio tracks from one of her four-legged family members.

¡°I had this beautiful dog, Angel, who passed a few years ago. She was quite a little character, and one of my joys has been using her voice in the voice of Nymeria and all of her gang.¡±

Fairfield also used a little bit of Angel as well in Drogon: Angel voiced the ¡°intimate nasal whistle¡± of Drogon whenever he purred at Daenerys.

The fans¡­
Fairfield also used the Burlington bar fans in Viserion¡¯s blue fire sound. Their screams make up the backbone of the sound and for Fairfield represent the ¡°tortured souls of the dead army.¡± The screams not only worked artistically in her sound design, but also fit with the symbiotic relationship Fairfield saw behind the ¡°Game of Thrones¡± production team and their audience.

¡°This series was born of the hearts and souls of creators and viewers alike. The viewers have held us, fed our work. It is a collective on the level of both creators and audience alike: We all reach for this experience of awe and wonder,¡± Fairfield said.
