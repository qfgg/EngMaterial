摩妮卡 别这样 你疯了吗

你知道还要多久 
Do you know how long it's gonna be, 

23
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,002
你才会遇到这个问题吗
before you actually have to deal with this problem?

24
00:01:22,602 --> 00:01:24,472
我是说 你连男朋友都还没有
I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet.

25

I don't know. Butter and eggs and flour and lime and kiwi...

36
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:53,876
奇异果 你说它是个青柠派的
Kiwi? Kiwi? You said it was a key lime pie. 

37
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,485
不 我说是奇异果柠檬派 
No, I didn't. I said kiwi lime. 

38
00:02:56,486 --> 00:02:58,210
所以才特别
That's what makes it so special.

39
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,131
所以才可以害死我
That's what's gonna kill me.

40
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,596
我对奇异果过敏
I'm allergic to kiwi.

41
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:07,384

42
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,822
天啊      
Oh my God!         

43
00:03:11,823 --> 00:03:13,265
愈来愈严重了
It's definitely getting worse.

44
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,933
你舌头肿起来了吗
All right, is your tongue swelling up?

45
00:03:15,994 --> 00:03:19,067
要不然就是我的嘴变小了
Either that or my mouth is getting smaller!

46
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,823
去穿外套 我们去医院
All right, get your coat. We're gonna go to the hospital.

47
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,669
他会没事吗      
Is he gonna be okay?         

48
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,653
会的 他只是需要打一针
Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.

49
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:27,867
事实上 我已经慢慢好起来了 真的 真的
You know, actually, it's getting better. It is. It is.

50
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,453
我们别去了 谁想玩拼字游戏
Let's not go. Anyone up for Scrabble?

51
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,289
快去穿外套
Jacket, now!

52
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:37,081
那小本呢 我们不能带个小婴儿去医院
What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to the hospital.

53
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,590
我们可以照顾他
We'll watch him.

54
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,464
不行
I don't think so.

55
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,767
怎么 我有七个天主教姐妹 
What? I have seven Catholic sisters. 

56
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,299
我照顾过上百个孩子
I've taken care of hundreds of kids.

57
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,308
拜托 我们愿意帮忙 对吧
Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?

58
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,603
我原本想打篮球的
Well, I was looking forward to playing basketball.

59
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,726
但现在球没了 打不成了
But I guess that's out the window.

60
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,976
好吧 你们要是带他出去散步 
Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, 

61
00:03:56,977 --> 00:03:58,060
记得带上他的帽子
just remember bring his hat, okay?

62
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,147
牛奶在冰箱里 尿布在袋子里
And there's extra milk in the fridge, and extra diapers in the bag.

63
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,940
帽子 牛奶 记住了
Hat, milk. Got it!

64
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,655
咱们走      好的
Le's go.         Okay.

65
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,826
包在我们身上
Consider it done!

66
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,211
你听懂了吗
You understood that?

67
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,168
我舅舅萨尔是个大舌头
My uncle Sal has a really big tongue.

68
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,593
是那个 有个漂亮老婆的舅舅吗
Is he the one with the beautiful wife?

69
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,349
嘿 瑞秋
Hey, Rach.

70
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,011
想不想听听 我下午要表演的歌
Wanna hear the new song I'm thingking of singing this afternoon?

71
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,057
我今天早上洗澡时写的      好的
I wrote it this morning in the shower.         Okay.

72
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:42,571
我在洗澡 我在写一首歌
I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song.

73
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,862
你若已听过 请提醒我
Stop me if you've heard it.

74
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,915
我全身都是泡泡 我的头发已湿透
My skin is soapy and my hair is wet,

75
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,495
秀发倒过来写是发秀
And Tegrin spelled backward is nirget,

76
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:05,381
瑞秋 你可以过来一下吗
Rachel, sweetheart, could I see you for a minute?

77
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,678
什么事
What's up? 

78
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:15,646
我要告诉你 我决定付钱请专业的歌手 
FYI, I've decided to pay a professional musician

79
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,110
每周日下午 来这里唱歌
to play here on Sunday afternoons.

80
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,625
她叫史黛芬妮 
Her name is Stephanie something. 

81
00:05:19,626 --> 00:05:21,393
应该很出色
She's supposed to be very good.

82
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,277
那菲比呢
But what about Phoebe?

83
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:27,361
瑞秋 我不是说 你朋友唱得烂
Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad.

84
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,444
事实上是 她非常烂
It's that she's so bad.

85
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:35,137
以至于我想用手指戳进眼睛 
She makes me want to put my finger through my eye 

86
00:05:35,138 --> 00:05:38,581
穿透我的脑子 把里面搅成浆糊
into my brain, and swirl it around.

87
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,086
好吧 这么说你不是她的歌迷
Okay, okay, so you're not a fan.

88
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,760
但是 拜托 你不能这样对她
But I mean, come on. You cannot do this to her.

89
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,509
喔 不 不 不
Oh, no, no, no.

90
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,424
得由我来告诉她吗
I have to do this to her? 

91
00:05:52,602 --> 00:06:00,816
涂抹 冲水 重复 涂抹 冲水 重复
Lather, rinse, repeat. And lather, rinse, repeat...

92
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,772
视需要而定
As needed.

93
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,243
我觉得 我们东西没带全
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff.

94
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,737
你是不是忘了带宝宝的铁砧
Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?

95
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,993
我跟你说 这是值得的
I'm telling you, it's gonna be worth it.

96
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,420
女人都喜欢小宝宝 好吧
It's a known fact that women love babies, all right?

97
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,555
女人喜欢爱小孩的男人 
Women love guys who love babies. 

98
00:06:21,556 --> 00:06:22,993
这是感性的问题
It's the whole sensitive thing.

99
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,692
快点 把他朝向那边那些美眉
Quick, aim him at that pack of babies over there. 

100
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:27,626
说不定待会儿有一个会过来 
Maybe one of them will break away.

101
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,759
等等 别管她们了 这里有一个 左边
Wait, forget them. We got one. Hard left.

102
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,719
宝宝给我      不 我抱就好
All right, give me the baby.         No, I got him.

103
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,179
别这样 我说真的
Come on, seriously.

104
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,218
你是真的想抱他
Oh, seriously, you want him?

105
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,022
你好
Hello.

106
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,742
这个小可爱是谁呀
Who is this little cutie pie?

107
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,279
别认为我不懂得谦虚 你是指 我吗
Well, don't think me immodest, but me?

108
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,781
你想闻闻他吗
You wanna smell him?

109
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,113
我想你指的是宝宝吧
I assume we're talking about the baby now?

110
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,661
喔 是的
Oh, yeah. 

111
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,120
他身上有股很棒的宝宝味道 你闻他的头
He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.

112
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,203
我想 我的子宫刚刚痉挛了一下
I think my uterus just skipped a beat.

113
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,664
我就说吧
What'd I tell you?

114
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,378
我认为 你们这么做很好
I think it's great you're doing this.

115
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,918
我们是好男人
Well, we are great guys.

116
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,363
我弟弟和他男朋友 
You know, my brother and his boyfriend 

117
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,054
三年来一直想领养一个孩子
have been trying to adopt for three years.

118
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,010
你们找的是哪个中介机构
What agency did you two go through?

119
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,971
但那是我的节目
But this is my gig.

120
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,481
我一直在这里表演
This is where I play.

121
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,355
我的名字用粉笔写在外面的黑板上
My name is written out there in chalk.

122
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,145
你不能就这样轻易地擦掉粉笔字
You know, you can't just erase chalk.

123
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,900
亲爱的 我很抱歉
Honey, I'm sorry.

124
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,365
而且他还打算付钱给那个女人
And he's going to be paying this woman?

125
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,625
他干嘛不直接送她一个宝座和一个皇冠
Why doesn't he just give her, like a throne and a crown?

126
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:44,746
再加上 一个上面有颗大球的黄金权仗 
And like, you know, a gold stick with a ball on top?

127
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,530
泰利是个混蛋 
Terry is a jerk! Okay? 

128
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:49,125
所以我们才一直都骂 "泰利是个混蛋"
That's why we're always saying, "Terry's a jerk!"

129
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,044
那句话就是从这儿来的
That's where that came from.

130
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:57,053
好吧 你大概已经尽力了
Yeah, okay. You probably did everything you could.

131
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,104
我再看看 还有没有其他办法可想
Okay, you know what? Let me just see what else I can do.

132
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,890
听着
All right, look, look.

133
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,060
你让她在史黛芬妮表演完再之后上场啦
Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever her name is.

134
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,295
你又不在这里 又不用付她钱
I mean, you won't be here. You don't pay her.

135
00:08:10,295 --> 00:08:11,155
你又不会有什么损失
It's not gonna cost you anything.

136
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,567
我不知道
I don't know.

137
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,698
拜托 泰利 我会帮你清洗卡布奇诺机的
Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine!

138
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,235
你平常都不清洗卡布奇诺机吗
You don't clean the cappuccino machine?

139
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,532
我当然都有清洗
Of course I clean it.

140
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,577
我是说 我会清洗的
I mean, I will clean it.

141
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,085
我会清洗的
I mean, I will clean it.

142
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,544
好吧 好啦 好啦 好啦
All right, fine, fine, fine!

143
00:08:34,189 --> 00:08:35,879
成了      真的吗
Done.         Really?

144
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,638
当然  看谁出马嘛 宝贝
Yeah, who's working for you, babe?

145
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,518
老天 太棒了      是啊
Oh my God! This is so exciting!        I know.

146
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,053
我可以拿多少钱
How much am I gonna get?

147
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,596
什么
What?

148
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,311
他说他付钱给在这里表演的人
Well, you said he's paying the people who were playing, so...

149
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,989
不是的 他付钱给那女人
Oh, no, no, no. I meant he's gonna be paying that other woman. 

150
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,279
因为她是职业歌手
Because she's a professional.

151
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,657
我才不要当那个唯一没报酬的歌手
I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.

152
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,158
可是 菲比
But, Pheebs...

153
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,614
很抱歉 我不接受
No, I'm sorry, no!

154
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:04,408
我才不是什么二流的慈善乐队
No, I'm not some like sloppy second, you know, charity band.

155
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,171
这城里有成千上万个地方
You know what, there are thousands of places in this city,

156
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:10,084
有人愿意付钱听我唱歌
where people would be happy to pay to hear me play.

157
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,169
我只为我自己弹唱
When I play, I play for me.

158
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,459
我才不需要你的怜悯
I don't need your charity.

159
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,922
谢谢
Thank you!

160
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,993
别想让我打针 
There's no way I'm gonna get a shot. 

161
00:09:25,994 --> 00:09:27,699
或许他们可以用针筒 
Maybe they can take the needle.

162
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,858
把药水往我嘴里喷 就像玩喷水枪
And squirt it into my mouth, y'know, like a squirt gun.

163
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,442
你们好 我是卡林医生      嗨
Hello there. I'm Dr. Carlin.        Hi!

164
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:38,609
看来 今天有人有一点点过敏反应
I see someone's having a little allergic reaction.

165
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,529
医生 能借一步说话吗
Doctor, can I see you for just a moment, please?

166
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:47,159
我哥哥有一点针头恐惧症
My brother has a slight phobia about needles.

167
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,987
你有没有告诉他 我的喷水枪的点子
Did you tell him about my squirt gun idea?

168
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,215
我这个博士哥哥想知道
My brother, the PHD., would like to know,

169
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,592
这个药有没有可能用口服的
if there's any way to treat this orally?

170
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:57,843
不行
No.

171
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,634
在这种情况下 必须要打针 
Under these circumstances, it has to be an injection.

172
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:02,132
而且必须现在就打
And it has to be now.

173
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,597
怎么样
So?

174
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:10,812
坐下来 医生说必须要打针
That's good, have a seat. The doctor says it's got to be a needle.

175
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,975
你只需要勇敢一点 
You're just gonna have to be brave, okay? 

176
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:15,820
就当是为了我 好不好
Can you do that for me?

177
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,448
好吧      好的
Okay         Okay.

178
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,451
很好 你做得非常好
Oh, boy! You are doing so good.

179
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,162
你要捏住我的手吗      要
You wanna squeeze my hand?         Yes.

180
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:28,370
好吧 罗斯 别捏太紧
Okay! All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.

181
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,877
亲爱的 我说真的 别捏太紧
Honey, really. Don't squeeze it so hard!

182
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,170
噢 罗斯 快放手
Oh Ross, let go of my hand!

183
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,953
真是好点子 乔伊 
That's a good plan, Joe. 

184
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:39,321
下次咱们想要泡妞
Next time we want to pick up women,

185
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:42,134
干脆直接去公园亲热一下就好了
we should just go to the park and make out.

186
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,007
出租车 出租车
Taxi! Taxi!

187
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,054
嘿 瞧那两个辣妹

00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,024
等等 等等
Wait, wait, wait!

191
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,531
嘿 小宝宝 他好可爱
Hey, you. He's just adorable.

192
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,983
你可以直接告诉他吗 
Can you tell him that? 

193
00:11:02,984 --> 00:11:05,036
他觉得自己脸色太粉
Because he thinks he looks too pink.

194
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,367
你们今天出来做什么      
So, what are you guys out doing today?         

195
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,115
我们不是出柜
We're not out.

196
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,250
不是的
No no no.

197
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,672
我们只是两个异性恋男人
We're just two heterosexual guys,

198

照顾我们另一个异性恋朋友的儿子 
hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend,

不会吧 我们也在这站下车
Get out of here! This is our stop.

203
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,956
你们也住在这附近吗      
You guys live around here too?         

204
00:11:28,957 --> 00:11:32,389

Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the sidewalk.

You know it?

206

208
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,697

00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,556
太好了 或许他会听到你喊 拉铃下车
That's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord!

214
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,890
快停车 喂
Stop the bus! Hey!

Hey, there's a baby!        Wait, wait, wait!

216
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,402
你确定没被他弄断吗 因为真的很痛
Are you sure he didn't break it? Because it really hurts.

217
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,988
没有 只是瘀伤
No, it's just a good bone bruise.

218
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:30,747
这是 你的戒指造成的刺伤
And right here is the puncture wound from your ring.

219

We're the guys that called about the baby! Is he here?

他在这里
He's here. 

261

That one has ducks on his T shirt and this one has clowns.

267
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,269
小本的衣服上的图案绝对是鸭子
And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.

268
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,930
或小丑
Or clowns.

269
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,391
等等
Oh, oh, wait.

270
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,832
那个绝对是小本 
That one's definitely Ben! 

271
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,818
记得他嘴巴旁有颗可爱的小痣
Remember he had that cute little mole by his mouth!

272
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,069
是吗      是的
Yeah?         Yeah.

273
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,276
嘿 小本 记得我们吗
Hey, Ben! Remember us?

274
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,983
痣掉下去了
Okay, the mole came off.

275
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,407
我们该怎么办 我们该怎么办
What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? 

276
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,827
我们抛硬币决定 鸭子或小丑
We'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.

277
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,444
抛硬币决定 
Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?         

278
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:03,290
你有更好的点子
You got a better idea?

279
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,036
好吧 丢上去就喊
All right, call it in the air.

280
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,838
正面
Heads.

281
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,374
正面      万岁
Heads, it is.         Yes.

282
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,212
我们得先决定正面代表什么
We have to assign heads to something!

283
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,673
对 好的
Right! Okay.

284
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,342
好的
Okay.

285
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,813
鸭子代表正面 因为鸭子有头
Ducks is heads because ducks have heads.

286
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,278
给你庆祝生日的小丑没有头 不会吓坏你吗
What kind of scary ass clowns came to your birthday?

287
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:43,624
叫我清晨的天使
Just call me angel of the morning, angel.

288
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:48,629
在离开我之前 轻触我的脸颊  宝贝
Just touch my cheek Before you leave me, baby.

289
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,213
叫我清晨的天使 
Just call me angel of the morning, angel.

290
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:57,630
然后慢慢转身离去 
Then slowly turn away. 

291
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:04,520
我不会求你留下来 陪我 
I won't beg you to stay with me. 

292
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,693
嘿      嗨
Hey         Oh. hi.

293
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,654
来 我想你一定冷了
Here. I thought you might be cold.

294
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,531
谢谢
Thank you.

295
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,690
瞧瞧你 收获不少呢
Oh, look at you. You did pretty well.

296
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,831
八块二毛七
Eight dollars and twenty seven cents.

297
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,237
不完全是 因为我一开始放了两块钱
But not really, because I put in the first two.

298
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,423
一点彩头 同时也让我自己好过些
Just to, you know, get the ball rolling and to make myself feel better.

299
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,807
你有好过些吗
Do you?

300
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,434
没有
No.

301
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:47,893
卖唱这码子事 实在不适合我
You know, this whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me.

302
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,650
我唱"我要自杀"那首歌时
You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su su suicide"

303
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:56,573
赚到一块七毛五
I got a dollar seventy five.

304
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,904
可是"臭猫"呢
But then "Smelly Cat"? Oh.

305
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,947
我只赚到两毛五和一个安全套
I got 25 cents and a condom.

306
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:09,168
所以 我替"臭猫"觉得很难过
So, you know, now I just feel really bad for "Smelly Cat".

307
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,538
你知道
Well, you know.

308
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,875
亲爱的 我认为不是每个人都听得懂"臭猫"
Honey, I don't think everybody gets "Smelly Cat", you know?

309
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:22,182
如果他们只养过健康的宠物 八成完全听不懂
I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then whoosh!

310
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,468
不光只是那样
But it's not even that, you know?

311
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,521
以前我唱我写的歌 是因为那让我很开心
It's just, I used to do my songs because it made me happy.

312
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:32,684
现在却变成 完全是为了钱
Now it's like, it's just all about the money, you know?

313
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,484
店里有人想念你
Well, people missed you in there.

314
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,908
事实上 有人点唱"臭猫"
And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat."

315
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,784
真的吗 谁
Really? From who?

316
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:44,662
我
Well, me.

317
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,752
我知道那不是你最卖座的歌 
And I know it's not your, y'know, big money song.

318
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,456
但那是我的最爱
But it's my favorite.

319
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,547
嗨
Hi.

320
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,174
我刚才是否不小心 掉了一个安全套在箱子里
Did I accidentally drop a condom in your case?

321
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,427
情况紧急
It's kind of an emergency.

322
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,057
是的
Yeah.

323
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,767
拿去吧      多谢
Here you go.         Hey, thanks a lot.

324
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,220
克莉丝汀 我拿到了
Hey, Christine! I got it!

325
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,358
谢谢你 今天一直陪着我
I just wanna thank you for being there for me today.

326
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,940
很抱歉 我差点捏断你的手
And I'm sorry I almost broke your hand.

327
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,144
没关系 很抱歉 我害你中毒
That's okay. I'm sorry I poisoned you.

328
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,161
还记不记得 我以前用铅笔刺你的手
Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?

329
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:33,999
记不记得 你认为这是什么 雀斑吗
Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?

330
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:38,591
记得我曾经 用西尔维亚的南瓜 往你脸上扔
What about the time I hit you in the face with Sylvian's pumpkin?

331
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,173
你记得我把扫帚 插进你的脚踏车轮里
Remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes,

332
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,884
害你翻倒 头撞到路边那次吗
and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?

333
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,298
不记得
No.

334
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,128
不过我记得大家老是告诉我那件事
But I remember people telling me about it.

335
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,729
真希望小本有个妹妹
I hope Ben has a little sister.

336
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,309
是啊
Yeah.

337
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,520
我希望她能好好管教他
And I hope she can kick his ass.

338
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,852
我去换个新的创可贴
I'm gonna get a new Band Aid.

339
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,823
记得我曾经 把你的马利布肯娃娃脚剪掉吗
How about the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?

340
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,904
原来是你
That was you?

341
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:10,498
他的脚感染了 不剪掉不行
They were infected. He wouldn't have made it.

342
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,417
噢
Oh!

343
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,995
我的小侄子
My little nephew.

344
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,921
过来 小宝贝
Come here, little one!

345
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,376
我的小宝贝 小本
Oh. There's my little baby, Ben!

346
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,012
我的小乖乖
Hey, my little boy. Oh.

347
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,008
他没哭耶
Hey, he's not crying!

348
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,723
他没哭耶
Hey, he's not crying!

349
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,852
万岁
Yes.

350
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,280
还有派
There's still pie!

351
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,526
我来了 我来了
I'm here. I'm here.

352
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,116
我的小宝贝好吗
How's my little boy, huh?

353
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:53,741
你要爸爸替你换尿布吗 我知道
You want Daddy to change your diaper? I know. I know.

354
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:58,041
你今天和乔伊叔叔 钱德叔叔玩得开心吗
So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?

355
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,295
当然啦
Oh, yeah.

356
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,549
他今天还坐巴士了呢
He rode the bus today.

357
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,514
大男孩坐巴士
Big boy riding the bus... 

358
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,012
我有个问题
Hey, I have a question.

359
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,723
为什么他的屁股上面写着 "公共事业财产"
How come it says "Property of Human Services" on his butt?

360
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,565
你 你一定会喜欢这故事的
You, you are gonna love this.

361

362
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,408
过来 过来
Come here. Come here.

363

退后 我手上有奇异果 快跑 乔伊 快跑
Stay back! I've got kiwi! Run, Joey, run!

364
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,959
臭猫 臭猫
Smelly cat, smelly cat

365
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,545
他们喂你吃了什么
What are they feeding you?

366
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,550
不 很抱歉 应该是

Smelly cat, smelly cat...

369
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,605
好多了      是吗
Better!        Yeah?

370
00:21:58,776 --> 00:21:59,856
好多了 很好
Much better. Good.

371
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,651
别难过 因为这首歌挺难的
Don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.

372
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,107
是啊
Yeah.

373
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,531
要再来一次吗      从头
You want to try it again?         Yeah, from the top?

374
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,783
没有"从头" 好吧
Okay, there is no "top", all right?

375
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,866
那便是"臭猫"的美妙之处
That's the beauty of "Smelly Cat".

376
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:17,203
你跟我唱好了
Why don't you just follow me?

377
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,917
好吧
Okay.

378

臭猫 臭猫
Smelly cat, smelly cat,

379
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,795

臭猫 臭猫
Smelly cat, smelly cat,

381
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,799

It's not your fault.

382
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:36,098

That's too much. Sorry.
