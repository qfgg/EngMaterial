Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Heh.

136
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,036
好
Okay.

137
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,463
你刚刚做了什么?
What did you just do?

138
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,419
我舔了手臂啊 干嘛?
I licked my arm, what?

139
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,926
是母乳啊!
It's breast milk!

140
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,336
那又怎样?
So?

141
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:20,598
菲比 那是人身上挤出来的奶
Phoebe, that is juice squeezed from a person.

142
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,223
那又怎样?      不...
 What is the big deal?         No, no...

143
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,999
你做了什么好事?
What did you just do?

144
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,899
你们可以不要再喝母乳了吗?
Can people stop drinking the breast milk?

145
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,319
连尝尝都不肯?      不要
 You won't even taste it?         No.

146
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:40,237
连假装它是牛奶都不行?
Not even if you just pretend it's milk?

147
00:09:40,237 --> 00:09:43,488
就算卡萝的乳房贴了牛奶广告都不行
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.

148
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,875
嘿      嗨
 Hey.         Hi.

149
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,382
大家都去哪了?      带小班去公园玩
 Where is everybody?         They took Ben to the park.

150
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,918
你去哪了?      出去一下
 Where have you been?         Just out.

151
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:01,386
吃了午餐 只有我一个人 与自己共度的美好时光
Had some lunch. Just me. A little quality time with me.

152
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,135
谢谢你的外套      噢 没问题
 Hey, thanks for your jacket.         Oh, no problem.

153
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,554
对了 你也可以向我借
 You can borrow it, by the way.

154
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,224
你的钥匙在这里      谢谢
 Oh, here are your keys, honey.         Thank you.

155
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,481
摩妮卡?      嗯?
 Mon?         Mmhmm?

156
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:18,490
如果你是一个人吃午餐 怎么会花了53块?
If, uh, you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you $53?

157
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,071
你知道发生什么事吗?
You know what probably happened?

158
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:27,161
大概有人偷了我的信用卡
 Someone must have stolen my credit card.

159
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,334
然后把帐单放回你的口袋?
And put the receipt back in your pocket?

160
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:34,798
这是个非常好的问题
Huh. That is an excellent, excellent question.

161
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,674
真的非常好
That is excellent.

162
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,883
你怎么了? 你跟谁一起吃午餐?
What's with you? Who did you have lunch with?

163
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,464
茱蒂      谁?
 Judy.         Who?

164
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,133
茱莉、乔迪?      什么?
 Julie. Jody?         What?

165
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,522
你跟朱莉出去?      听着
 You were with Julie?         Mm. Look.

166
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,308
开始 我只是想对她好一点...
When it started, I was just trying to be nice to her...

167
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,353
因为她是我哥的女朋友
because she was my brother's girlfriend.

168
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,739
然后事情接着发生...
And then one thing led to another...

169
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,776
在我搞清楚之前... 我们就...
and before I knew it, we were...

170
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,907
一起逛街了
shopping.

171
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,330
天啊
Oh, my God.

172
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,362
慢着 我们只去了一次
Wait we only did it once.

173
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,112
对我一点意义也没有
It didn't mean anything to me.

174
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,799
是啊      是真的
 Yeah, right. Sure.         Really!

175
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,840
瑞秋 我一直想的是你
Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time.

176
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:32,097
听着 我真的很抱歉 好吗? 我从来都不想让你发现
Look I'm sorry, all right? I never meant for you to find out.

177
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:35,984
拜托!你很想被逮到
Oh, please! Please! You wanted to get caught!

178
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,686
才不是!
That is not true!

179
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:41,113
所以你是不小心把收据留在这里?
So you just happened to leave it in here?

180
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:45,118
你有没有想过我或许就是那么笨?
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?

181
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,326
好 摩妮卡 我需要知道一件事
Okay, Monica, I just have to know one thing.

182
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,165
你有跟她一起去布鲁明戴尔吗?
Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?

183
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,966
好吧 好吧
Okay. Okay.

184
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:13,226
好 我只是... 现在无法跟你在一起
Okay, I just really... uh  I just need to not be with you right now.

185
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,111
喂 哪位?
Hi who's this?

186
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,448
嗨 乔安妮 瑞秋有上班吗? 我是摩妮卡
Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica.

187
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,825
我知道我做了很糟糕的事
Yes I know I did a horrible thing.

188
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,908
乔安妮 事情不是那么简单
Joanne it's not as simple as all that, okay?

189
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,838
不 我不在乎史蒂夫怎么想的 嗨 史蒂夫
No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.

190
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,173
嘿! 嗨!
 Hey! Hi!

191
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,928
情况如何?
How did we do?

192
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,806
我尝了小班的母乳 罗斯吓坏了
Oh, I tasted Ben's milk and Ross freaked out.

193
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,842
我没有吓坏
I did not freak out.

194
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,137
为什么你会吓坏?      因为那是母乳
 Why would you freak out?         Because it's breast milk.

195
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,936
很恶心!
It's gross!

196
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,646
我的母乳很恶心?
My breast milk is gross?

197
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,486
这会很好玩
This should be fun.

198
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,357
不是 卡萝 你的母乳没有问题
No, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it.

199
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:10,154
我只是...我只是觉得母乳不是成人喝的
I just... I just don't think breast milk is for adults.

200
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,698
当然母乳的容器 大人小孩都喜欢
Of course, the packaging does appeal to grownups and kids.

201
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,912
罗斯 别傻了 我试过了 这没什么
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it. It's no big deal.

202
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,547
来嘛 尝一点
 Come on, just taste it.

203
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,549
我不要
That would be no.

204
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,505
别这样      试试看
 Come on.         Try it.

205
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,296
是天然的      味道不错啊
 It's natural.         It doesn't taste bad.

206
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,386
喝起来甜甜的 有点像...
Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet. Sort of like. uh...

207
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,677
像什么?      哈蜜瓜汁
 Like what?         Cantaloupe juice.

208
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,391
没错
Exactly.

209
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,986
你有喝过
You've tasted it.

210
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,196
你有喝过
You've tasted it.

211
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,242
噢 你有喝过
Oh, you've tasted it.

212
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:56,050
你怎么重复 这句话也不会变成假的
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.

213
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,627
瓶子给我
Give me the bottle.

214
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:11,923
毛巾给我
Get me the towel.

215
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,076
你好啊?
Howdy.

216
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,455
给我一瓶果汁
Give me a box of juice.

217
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,126
他们把我换到原野奇侠
Well, they switched me over to Hombre.

218
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,384
或许是因为你的打扮
Maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.

219
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:53,507
又或许是因为这家伙很厉害 他们要增加人手
Or maybe this guy's doing so good they want to put more people on it.

220
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,972
你该看看这家伙 他现在一天可以用掉两瓶
This guy goes through two bottles a day now.

221
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,683
你在乎什么?
What do you care?

222
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:04,859
你是演员 这只是你的副业 没什么大不了
You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything.

223
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,562
我知道 但我以前是最棒的
I know, but I was the best.

224
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,899
我喜欢当最棒的
You know? I liked being the best.

225
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,321
不知道 或许我该退出了
I don't know. Maybe I should get out of the game.

226
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,663
厨具部门需要有人切乳酪
They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.

227
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,706
假如你这么做了
Say you do that.

228
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,964
迟早有人乳酪会切得比你好
Sooner or later, somebody will come along that slices a better cheddar

229
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,589
到时候你要逃到哪里去?
And then where you gonna run?

230
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,799
你说得没错      我当然是对的
 I guess you're right.         You're damn right. I'm right.

231
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,511
让这家伙看看你的能耐 你得捍卫你的领土
I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground.

232
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:40,179
让他知道你是内衣部西边最厉害的原野奇侠
I say you show him that you're the baddest Hombre west of the lingerie!

233
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,976
我这就去!      好!
 I'm gonna do it!         All right!

234
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,814
现在去找猫咪小姐 她会介绍个好妓女给你
Now, go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker

235
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,689
我不知道还能说什么
I don't know what to say.

236
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,200
很好 因为我根本没在听
That works good because I'm not listening.

237
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,777
我觉得糟透了 真的
I feel terrible. I really do.

238
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,675
噢 抱歉 我的背伤到你的刀吗?
Oh,I'm sorry. Did my back hurt your knife?

239
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,623
瑞秋!
Rachel!

240
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,911
我跟她交朋友 一起去逛街
Say that I'm friends with her We spend time together

241
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,171
有那么糟吗?      对
 Is that so terrible?         Yes.

242
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,923
有那么糟?      是的 摩妮卡!你根本不懂
 It's that terrible         Yes, Monica! You don't get it.

243
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,800
她偷走我的男人已经够糟了
It's bad enough she stole the guy...

244
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,675
一个我可能会长相厮守的男人
who may be the person I'm supposed to be with.

245
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,051
但是现在...
But now...

246
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,925
她竟然...
she's actually...

247
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,554
她竟然连你也抢走了!
But now she's actually stealing you!

248
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:25,977
我?
Me?

249
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,108
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

250
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,736
没人能把我从你那里抢走
Nobody could steal me from you.

251
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:34,406
我跟她交朋友不会影响你跟我的感情
I mean. Just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you.

252
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,609
亲爱的
Honey

253
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,073
你是我...
I mean, you're my...

254
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,951
我们...
And we're...

255
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,332
噢 我爱你!      我也爱你!
 Oh I love you.         I love you too!

256
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,803
两位 我知道这跟我一点关系都没有
You guys, uh, I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me.

257
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,510
但我也好爱你们!
But, uh, I love you guys too!

258
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,646
我真的很需要纸巾
Ugh, I really needed that.

259
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,522
我知道你现在的情况...
Look I know you're in a place right now...

260
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,278
让你很讨厌茱莉
where you really need to hate Julie's guts.

261
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,324
但是她并没有做错任何事
But she didn't do anything wrong.

262
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:20,946
她只是认识了一个男生 又跟他交往
She's just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out.

263
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,999
如果你给她点机会 你也会喜欢她的
I think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her.

264
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,786
你愿意给她一个机会吗?
Will you give that a chance?

265
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:30,914
就为了我?
For me?

266
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,925
你知道为了你 我愿意做任何事
I'd do anything for you, you know that.

267

为了你 我愿意做任何事!
I'd do anything for you!

268

275
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,223
我准备好了
Yeah, I'm ready.

276
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,265
你这白痴! 白痴牛仔!
You idiot! You stupid cowboy!

277
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,650
你害我看不到了 我要告你!
You've blinded me! I'm suing!

278
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,529
天啊! 陶德! 你干了什么好事?
Oh, my God! Todd! What the hell did you do?

279
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,530
对不起 我真是笨手笨脚
1m sorry. I'm such a doofus!

280
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,071
我真的很抱歉
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

281
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,077
天啊 发生什么事了?
My God, what happened?

282
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,456
这些菜鸟都待不久
Eh, these new kids, they never last.

283
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,993
他们迟早都会...
Sooner or later they all...

284
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,416
捅娄子
stop lasting.

285
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,167
不如我现在就请你 喝杯咖啡如何?
Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?

286
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,918
好啊
Sure.

287
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,982
那么      那么 
 So.         So.

288
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,236
我想说我们两个人应该多多亲近
I just thought the two of us should hang out a bit.

289
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,197
你知道 我们没有真的好好谈过
I mean, you know, we've never really talked.

290
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,613
我想你也知道 毕竟你也是当事人之一
I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us. Ha, ha, right?

291
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,782
我知道
 I know.

292
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,293
我大概不该跟你讲这个...
I probably shouldn't even tell you this...

293
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:17,622
但是我还蛮怕你的
but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.

294
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,133
真的吗? 怕我?
Really? Me?

295
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,168
天啊 开什么玩笑?
Oh, my God, are you kidding?

296
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,178
罗斯超迷恋你的...
Ross is so crazy about you...

297
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,591
我真的很希望你能喜欢我 我又...
and I really wanted you to like me. and I...

298
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,602
大概只是我自己乱想吧...
It's probably me just being totally paranoid...

299
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:36,050
我觉得你好像不想喜欢我
but I kind of got the feeling that maybe you don't.

300
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,780
嗯...
Well...

301
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,987
你并不是在乱想
you're not totally paranoid.

302
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,039
天啊
 God. Uh...

303
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,591
你跟罗斯一开始交往的时候...
When you and, uh, Ross first started going out...

304
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:06,220
我真的很难过...
It was really hard for me, uh...

305
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:12,435
有很多原因 细节就不多说了...
for many reasons of which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but, uh...

306
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,644
我看到他很快乐 你们两个人很相配
I see how happy he is and how good you guys are together.

307
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:25,857
而且摩妮卡老是说你人很好...
And, uh, Monica's always saying how nice you are...

308
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,367
我真讨厌她是对的
and God, I hate it when she's right.

309
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,287
谢谢      嗯
 Thanks.         Yeah.

310
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,167
嘿 你想不想一起去看电影或出去玩?
Listen. Would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?

311
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:39,295
好啊 那会很棒      是吗?
 Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.         Yeah?

 I'd love it too. Okay.         Okay.

313
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,715
噢 我该走了      好
 Oh, shoot, I gotta go.         Okay.

314
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,002
晚点再聊了      好 茱莉
 So I'll talk to you later         All right, Julie.

315
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,841
拜      拜
 Bye.         Bye.

316
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,980
真是个会玩弄人的贱人
What a manipulative bitch.

317
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,800
还不赖嘛
It's not bad.
