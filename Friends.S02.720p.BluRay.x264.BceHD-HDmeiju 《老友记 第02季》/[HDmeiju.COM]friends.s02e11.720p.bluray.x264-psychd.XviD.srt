1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:05,123
好了 这是他的尿布袋
Okay, here's his diaper bag.

2
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,623
这是他的温奇先生
And his Mr. Winky. 

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,915
还有
And...

4
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,208
噢
Oh!

5
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,421
他 嗨
Him. Hi!

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,863
一切都还好吧
So how did everything go?

7
00:00:14,863 --> 00:00:19,501
很好 有一次喷射性的呕吐事件 
Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile throwing up incident.

8
00:00:19,502 --> 00:00:21,267
但是他先开始的
But he started it.

9
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,474
我们要走了      好的
We've gotta go.         Okay.

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,890
噢 对了
Oh, right.

11
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,526
我有个消息要宣布 是关于我们的
I've got some news. It's about us.

12
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,813
你和我吗      不 苏珊和我
Oh, you and me?         Uh, no. Susan and me.

13
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,697
另一个我们
The other "us".

14
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:36,696
好吧
Okay.

15
00:00:37,696 --> 00:00:38,696
我们
We're...

16
00:00:39,022 --> 00:00:40,703
我们要结婚了
We're getting married.

17
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,998
就像 "现在宣布你们成为妻子和妻子" 那种结婚吗
As in "now pronounce you wife and wife" married?

18
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,415
我们希望你能参加 
Anyway, we'd like you to come. 

19
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,506
如果你不想来 我们也完全能够理解
But we totally understand if you don't want to.

20
00:00:54,663 --> 00:00:56,912
当然 我为什么会不想去呢 
Yeah, well, why wouldn't I want to come? 

21
00:00:56,913 --> 00:00:58,847
第一次婚礼我很开心
I had fun at the first wedding.

22
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,342
我只是想说
Look I just thought that...

23
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:05,075
不 不 不 我为什么不能替你们高兴呢 
No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you.

24
00:01:05,076 --> 00:01:09,308
我怎么会 不为你们的喜悦而狂欢呢
You know, I mean, what would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy?

25
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,027
我会狂欢的 相信我
And I'm reveling, baby. Believe me.

26
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,838
你的手指被椅子夹住了吗
Is your finger caught in that chair?

27
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:16,694
嗯哼
Hmm

28
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,284
要我们走吗      嗯哈
Want us to go?         Uhhuh.

33
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,710
你好像有烦恼 
You're clearly bothered by something. 

34
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,210
告诉我是什么
Why don't you tell me what it's.

35
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,937
太酷了 你真的要上电视了
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.

36
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,180
我知道 我昨晚才真的感觉到 
I know. It really hit me last night. 

37
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:18,050
我要参加"我们的日子"的演出
I'm gonna be on "Days of our Lives".

38
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,595
然后我开始想我们的事
Then I started thinking about all of us.

39
00:02:21,596 --> 00:02:24,092
这还真是属于我们的日子
And how these are the days of our lives.

40
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,644
好耶      什么
Yes!         What?

41
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,836
帮卡萝儿和苏珊办婚宴的人 骑山地车出意外了
Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend.

42
00:02:31,837 --> 00:02:34,267
全身都打了石膏
And she's in a fullbody cast.

43
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,778
好耶
Yes!

44
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:41,361
她们要我帮忙 太酷了 我从来没办过婚宴
They want me to do it, which is really cool since I've never catered before.

45
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:43,653
并且我真的需要钱 这对你不构成问题吧
And I really need the money. And this isn't a problem for you, is it?

46
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,996
这重要吗      真是太好了
Would it matter?         Oh, you are so great!

47
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,448
谢谢
Thank you!

48
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,159
你真的不去吗      我真的不去
You're really not going?        I'm really not going.

49
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,161
我搞不懂
I mean, I don't get it. 

50
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:54,129
她们已经同居了 为什么还要结婚呢
They already live together. Why do they need to get married?

51
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,956
因为她们彼此相爱
Because they love each other.

52
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,714
而且 她们想跟亲朋好友一起分享那份爱
And they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.

53
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,637
你要硬这样讲就算
If you wanna call that a reason.

54
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:07,009
谁是客厅里最苦情的男人
Who's the bitterest man in the living room?

55
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,186
客厅里最苦情的男人
The bitterest man in the living room?

56
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,768
你好 邻居
Hi, neighbor!

57
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,359
罗斯 我以为你已经不在乎了      
Ross, I thought you were over this.         

58
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,927
跟这个没有关系好吧 她是我的前妻
Look, that has nothing to do with this, okay? She's my ex-wife.

59
00:03:19,928 --> 00:03:21,565
如果她和一个男人结婚
If she were marrying a guy,

60
00:03:21,565 --> 00:03:23,192
你们谁都不会觉得我应该去 
none of you'd expect me to be there.

61
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:24,675
如果她嫁给一个男人
Hey, if she were marrying a guy,

62
00:03:24,675 --> 00:03:27,200
那她就是史上最烂的女同志了
she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.

63
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,775
我错过了吗
Did I miss it?

64
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,958
没有 这个家伙自杀后就换我了
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.

65
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,255
哇 她很漂亮
Whoa, she's pretty.

66
00:03:37,493 --> 00:03:39,503
是呀 而且她人也很好
Yeah. Oh, and she's really nice too.

67
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,632
她教我怎么样在镜头前演戏
She taught me all about, you know, how to work with the cameras

68
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,713
还有闻屁演戏法
and smell the fart acting.

69
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,593
抱歉 你说啥     你说什么
I'm sorry, what?         Excuse me?

70
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,816
要在这么短的时间内 记住这么多台词
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast that

71
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,684
有时候需要一点时间想下一句
sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one.

72
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,609
所以 当你想的时候呢
So while you're thinking of it,

73
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:02,280
你停顿一下 要看起来很专注
you take this big pause where you look all intense.

74
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,527
就像这样
You know, like this...

75
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,741
了解
Oh. Okay.

76
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,495
到我了 我出来了
Oh, here's my scene! Here's my scene!

77
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,919
华莱士太太      是的
Mrs. Wallace?         Yes.

78
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,627
我是德瑞克雷莫瑞医生 令妹的神经外科医生
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.

79
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,959
她会没事吧
Tell me, is she gonna be all right?

80
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:26,047
恐怕 情况比我们预计的还要糟
I'm afraid the situation is much more dire than we'd expected.

81
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,552
令妹罹患了
Your sister's suffering from a

82
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,477
颅下血肿
subcranial hematoma.

83
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:42,229
或许 我们可以边喝咖啡边聊
Perhaps we can discuss this further over coffee.

84
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,448
很不错
Nice!

85
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,625
刚有那么一会儿 我还以为 你真的在闻什么东西呢
For a minute, I thought you were actually trying to smell something.

86
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,832
再来一次     
Do it again!  

87
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,290
太棒了       再来一次      
That was so good!        One more time.

88
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,290
好吧 好吧
All right, all right.

89
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:05,052
可恶 毕佛曼 就在病历上
"Damn it, Braverman! It's right there on the chart!"

90
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,801
太精彩了 好了 我要去上班了 
That's great. All right, I gotta get to work. 

91
00:05:08,802 --> 00:05:10,640
我还有一个大的恐龙骨头要检查
I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.

92
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,887
不 那是我
No no no, that's me.

93
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,388
对喔
Oh, right.

94
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,101
噢      噢
Oh!        Oh!

95
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,561
谢谢 我没办法
Oh, thanks. Couldn't...

96
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,687
你还好吧
Is everything okay?

97
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,866
不好
No.

98
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:31,369
今天我有一个客人 死在按摩床上
One of my clients died on the massage table today.

99
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,988
我的天啊
Oh my God.

100
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,537
你也让他们太放松了吧
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.

101
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,746
是啊
Yeah.

102
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:41,709
她已经82岁了
She was, you know, 82 years old.

103
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,250
她叫艾道曼太太
And her name was Mrs. Adelman.

104
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,463
亲爱的
Oh, honey.

105
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,809
感觉好奇怪
Yeah, it's just so strange.

106
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,056
她早上醒来时 说不定在想
I mean, y'know, she probably woke up this morning and thought,

107
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:53,382
我先吃点早餐 再去散会儿步
All right, I'll have some breakfast. And I'll take a little walk. 

108
00:05:53,383 --> 00:05:55,678
然后去按摩一下
And, and you know, then I'll have my massage.

109
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:59,363
但是她不知道上帝想说 "好的 但是到此为止"
Little did she know God was thinking "Okay, but that's it".

110
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,400
但是最诡异的一件事就是
Oh, but the weirdest thing was

111
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:09,324
她死的时候 我正在帮她清理灵气
okay, I was cleansing her aura when it happened.

112
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,243
当她的灵魂离开身体后
And when her spirit left her body,

113
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,662
我认为它没有走远
I don't think it went very far.

114
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,363
这是什么意思
What do you mean?

115
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,043
我想它上了我的身
I think it went into me.

116
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,095
天哪 真的好难
God, this is so hard.

117
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,389
我没法决定要选羔羊肉还是鸭肉
I can't decide between lamb or duck.

118
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,262
当然 羊羔比较恐怖
Well, of course, lambs are scarier.

119
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,844
要不然那部电影 就会叫做"沉默的鸭子"
Otherwise the movie would've been called "Silence of the Ducks".

120
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,018
好了 谁点了什么
Okay, who ordered what?

121
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,362
我相信我点了 喝了一半
Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk

122
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,565
杯缘还有口红印的卡布奇诺
cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.

123
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,444
这杯里面有烟屁股的 是无咖啡因的吗
Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?

124
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,274
我的天啊
Oh God.

125
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,610
我真不相信你妈过来 你会这么紧张
I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom coming.

126
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,333
我知道 但是这是她第一次来 我只是不想让她认为
I know, but it's just it's the first time. And I just don't want her to think that

127
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,871
因为我没嫁给巴瑞 我的生活就完全是垃圾
because I didn't marry Barry that my life is total crap, you know?

128
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,919
说到垃圾 你该听听史黛拉尼德曼
Talk about crap, try listening to Stella Neidman

129
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,419
讲她跟施洛德的 老掉牙的故事
tell her story about Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.

130
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,799
菲比 你觉得这位女士 会跟我们在一起多久
Pheebs? How long do you think this lady will be with us?

131
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,718
不知道 很显然她还有未完成的心愿
I don't know. She obviously has some kind of unfinished business.

132
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,765
坐直
Sit up!

133
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,311
乖女儿
There she is.

134
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,313
妈      甜心
Mom!        Hey, sweetie!

135
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,151
这就是你工作的地方
So this is where you work!

136
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,533
真是太棒了
Oh, it's wonderful!

137
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,750
这是客厅还是餐厅 谁分得出来呢
Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell?

138
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,001
我想这就是乐趣所在吧
I guess that's the fun.

139
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,250
差不多 来 看看我的朋友们
Pretty much. Here, meet my friends.

140
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,333
摩妮卡 你看起来真美
Monica! You look gorgeous!

141
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,841
天啊 我上次看到你 你还在拼了命地吃
Oh, my! The last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.

142
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,264
这位是乔伊
This is Joey.

143
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,556
这位是菲比
This is Phoebe.

144
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,017
这位是钱德
And this is Chandler.

145
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,350
你记得罗斯吧
And you remember Ross?

146
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,770
你好 罗斯      你好 葛林太太
Oh, hello, Ross.         Hi, Mrs. Green.

147
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,770
那么
So,

148
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,635
你们觉得我女儿如何
what do you think of my daughter

149
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:09,815
穿着围裙 有份大事业
in the apron with the big job!

150
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,438
妈
Oh, Mom!

151
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:17,536
没有你来倒咖啡 大家都休想喝到东西
If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.

152
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,455
相信我 有时真的会这样
Believe me, sometimes that happens.

153
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:25,911
这真的太让人兴奋了 我从来都没工作过
This is just so exciting! You know, I never worked.

154
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,986
我从我父亲的家直接
I went straight from my father's house 

155
00:08:27,987 --> 00:08:31,212
到女生联谊会宿舍 然后到我丈夫家
to the sorority house to my husband's house.

156
00:08:31,213 --> 00:08:33,343
我真是以你为傲
I am just so proud of you!

157
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,045
真的吗      真的
Oh, Really?        Yes.

158
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,547
我知道你让我想起了谁
I know who it is you remind me of.

159
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,306
艾芙林邓末
Evelyn Durmer.

160
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,154
当然是在她做拉皮手术失败之前 
Of course that's before the lousy facelift. 

161
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,434
现在她长得像苏比赛尔斯
Now she looks like Soupy Sales.

162
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,723
菲比 艾芙林邓末是谁
Pheebs? Who's Evelyn Durmer?

163
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,238
我不知道 谁是苏比赛尔斯
I dont know. Who's Soupy Sales?

164
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,905
我的天
Oh my God!

165
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,738
那边有一个丑男人 光着身子在拉大提琴
There's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.

166
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,246
是啊 还好他不是在演奏一个比较小的乐器
Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.

167
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,683
你的确有了自己的生活 甜心
You have some life here, sweetie!

168
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,237
我知道 妈 我知道你和爸爸都很生气
I know. And Mom, I realize you and Dad were upset

169
00:09:15,237 --> 00:09:16,294
我没嫁给巴瑞
when I didn't marry Barry

170
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,113
住在郊区的大房子里
and get the house in the suburbs

171
00:09:18,113 --> 00:09:20,098
过着又安全又衣食无忧的生活
 with all the security and everything.

172
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,392
但是现在对我来说更好 你知道吗
But, God, this is just so much better for me, you know?

173
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,558
我知道 你根本不爱巴瑞 亲爱的
I do know. You didn't love Barry, honey.

174
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,312
我从来没看到过 你这么开心
And I've never seen you this happy.

175
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:33,065
我看着你 然后想 这就是我想要的
I look at you and I think, "Oh, this is what I want."

176
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,861
是说我吧
For me.

177
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,193
不只是你
Well, not just for you.

178
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,532
什么意思
Well, what do you mean?

179
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:46,791
我正考虑离开你爸爸
I'm considering leaving your father.

180
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,046
好了 告诉我这是不是太赞了
All right, tell me if this is too cute.

181
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,133
女同志婚礼 鸡胸肉
Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.

182
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,265
天啊 我想我快吐了
Oh God! I think I'm gonna be sick.

183
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,977
怎么了 我又没在上面加乳头
What? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.

184
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,974
你不知道他们感情不好吗      
And you had no idea they weren't getting along?        

185
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:12,925
完全不知
None.

186
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:14,064
他们不常吵架吗 
They didn't fight a lot?

187
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,987
才不会 他们根本不说话
No, they didn't even talk to each other.

188
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,237
天啊 我怎么会知道 他们之间有问题啊
God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems.

189
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,325
在我的年代 是不能离婚的
You know, in my day, divorce was not an option.

190
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,411
看是谁来了
Hey, look who's up!

191
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,871
我真不敢相信会发生这种事
Oh, I just can't believe this is happening.

192
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,798
我小时候 每个人的父母都在离婚
I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced, y'know?

193
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,127
我想我已经长大了 就不用担心这个问题了
I just figured as a grownup, I wouldn't have to worry about this.

194
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,259
你可以把这件事当做是种赞美吗
Well, is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering?

195
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,511
她这么做是想变得更像你
I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.

196
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,890
那她学我的发型不就行了
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?

197
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,099
好玩的是 我父母离婚时 他们带我去看心理医生
You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to a shrink.

198
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,401
她跟我说 所有的孩子都会责怪自己
And she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves.

199
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,320
就你而言 这真应该怪你呢
But in your case it's actually kinda true.

200
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,565
他来了
Oh,that's him.

201
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,619
可恶 我邮购订的爷爷还没寄到
Damn. My mailorder grandfather hasn't come yet.

202
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,538
菲比      是的 你好 艾道曼先生
Phoebe?         Yes. Hi, Mr. Adelman.

203
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,703
很高兴见到你      谢谢你过来
Nice to see you.         Hi, thanks for meeting me.

204
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,537
没关系 但你的确打扰了我 忙碌的呆坐一天
Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.

205
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,298
要不要坐下
Do you wanna sit?

206
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,419
不用了 我花了大半个上午才站起来
Oh, no, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up.

207
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,802
我能为你做些什么 亲爱的
What can I do for you, my dear?

208
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,176
好吧 我不知道该怎么说
Oh, okay, I don't know how to say this, but,

209
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,138
我认为 当你太太的灵魂脱离身体时
I think when your wife's spirit left her body,

210
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,978
她转移在了 我的身体里
it kind of stuck around in me.

211
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,936
你是说 我老婆附在你身上
You're saying my wife is in you?

212
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,281
对 你不用相信我
Yeah. Okay. You don't have to believe me.

213
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:45,300
但是 你知道她有什么没完成的愿望吗
But can you think of any unfinished business she might have had?

214
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,952
她逗留人间的原因
Like any reason she'd be hanging around?

215
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,082
我不知道该怎么说 亲爱的
Well, I don't know what to tell you dear.

216
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,324
我唯一想到的就是
The only thing I can think of is that

217
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,503
她常说 在死之前 她想要看遍世上的一切
she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.

218
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,165
一切      一切
Everything?         Everything.

219
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,299
那是很多事情耶
Whoa. That's a lot of stuff.

220
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,626
等等
Oh, wait, I...

221
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,805
我记得她也说过 她想跟我上最后一次床
I remember she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.

222
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,980
对不起 我脑袋里出现了笑声
I'm sorry. There's laughing in my head.

223
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,946
值得一试 对吧
Worth a shot. huh?

224
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,362
看看这个
Look at this.

225
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,739
这些是三年前的万圣节
These are all Halloween three years ago.

226
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,867
你看 这是巴瑞
Oh, and look, here's Barry.

227
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,162
他直接从诊所过来吗
Did he have to come straight from the office?

228
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,880
不 那是他的变装服
Oh. no. That was his costume.

229
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:46,134
他其实是牙齿矫正医生 但是他装扮成一般的牙医
See he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.

230
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,884
两位      啥事
You guys?        Yeah.

231
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,051
记得我之前说 谢谢 我不需要你们帮忙
Remember when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?

232
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,969
事实上 你说的是
Actually, what I think you said was

233
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,726
别碰那个 滚出我的厨房
"Don't touch that and get the hell out of my kitchen."

234
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:59,537
真的吗 真奇怪 不管怎样 
Really? Weird. Anyway...

235
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:01,391
我本来计划得很好
See,I planned everything really well.

236
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:02,998
我计划 计划再计划
I planned and I planned and I planned.

237
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,732
结果是 我没有计划好足够的烹饪时间
It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.

238
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,826
嘿 摩妮卡 你需要帮忙吗      你想帮的话
Hey, Mon, you want some help?         If you want.

239
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,452
大家好      你好
Hey.         Hey.

240
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,957
好累的一天
What a day.

241
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,872
我带她到处跑
Oh, I took her everywhere.

242
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,874
现代艺术博物馆 洛克斐勒中心
The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center,

243
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,584
自由女神像
the Statue of Liberty.

244
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,089
她还跟着你吗
She's still with you?

245
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:30,140
对啊 我想她还没看完吧
Yes. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet.

246
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,102
我马上回来 她又要去洗手间了
I'll be right back. She has to go to the bathroom again.

247
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,689
这脸蛋真漂亮
Such a pretty face!

248
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,772
真的好好玩喔 只有女生
Oh, this is so much fun. Just the girls.

249
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,010
你知道我们该做什么吗
Do you know what we should do? 

250
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:49,701
你们有大麻吗
Does anybody have any marijuana?

251
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:50,906
天啊
God!

252
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,288
听着 不准在这些食物旁抽大麻
All right, look, no one's smoking pot around all this food.

253
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,334
那就算了
Well, that's fine.

254
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,456
我从来没抽过 我只是想试试看
I never did it. I just thought I might.

255
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:04,456
那么
So,

256
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,425
有没有新的性爱招式
what's new in sex?

257
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,463
有没有新的性爱招式
What's new in sex?

258
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,140
我只跟你爸在一起过
The only man I've been with is your father.

259
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,227
我在切 我在切 什么都没听到
I'm dicing. I'm dicing. I don't hear anything.

260
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,978
这不是不尊重你爸 
I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie.

261
00:14:18,979 --> 00:14:20,181
但是我在想
But I was thinking,

262
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,863
可能有更精彩的
there might be more.

263
00:14:21,863 --> 00:14:25,236
抱歉 你知道吗 我没有办法跟你谈这个话题
Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you.

264
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,441
好啦 好啦 好啦
All right. All right.  All right.

265
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:30,655
老天 你还没告诉爸爸 就先跟我丢这个炸弹
I mean, god, you just come in here and drop this bomb on me before you even tell Daddy.

266
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,917
怎么样 你到底要怎么样 想要得到我的祝福吗
What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?

267
00:14:32,918 --> 00:14:33,496
不是
No.

268
00:14:33,496 --> 00:14:34,706
那你要我说服你别这样吗      不是
You want me to talk you out of it?        No.

269
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,117
那你到底想怎样
Then what? What do you want?

270
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,666
我只是以为所有的人中 只有你会理解
I guess, I just figured of all people, you would understand.

271
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,335
为什么我会理解
Why on earth would I understand this?

272
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,252
你没嫁给你的巴瑞 亲爱的
You didn't marry your Barry, honey.

273
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,379
但是我嫁了我的
But I married mine.

274
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,674
噢
Oh!

275
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,889
各位 我们有麻烦了 
All right people, we're in trouble here. 

276
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,761
我们只剩下12小时36分钟了
We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left.

277
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,683
快 快 快
Move, move, move!

278
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,100
摩妮卡 我觉得你应该配上德语字幕
Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.

279
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,736
乔伊 加快速度
Joey, speed it up!

280
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,857
对不起 都是猪的错 它们不想被卷进去
I'm sorry! It's the pig. They're reluctant to get in the blanket!

281
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:15,445
摩妮卡 怎么会这样 我以为你都计划好了
Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.

282
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,746
你想让我哭吗
Do you want me to cry?

283
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,787
你就是想要我哭 对吗
Is that what you want?

284
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,868
你想看我哭吗
Do you wanna see me cry?

285
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,499
不想 长官
Sir, no, sir!

286
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,254
好了 你
All right, you!

287
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:33,221
不 我跟你说过 我不参与这件事
What? No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.

288
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,521
好吧 罗斯 我知道你跟卡萝儿和苏珊 之间有心结 
All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan. 

289
00:15:36,522 --> 00:15:37,802
我很同情你 真的
And I feel for you, I do.

290
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,103
但如果你不帮忙 我会用一堆热狗
But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs

291
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,227
创作一道新开胃菜 叫做"罗斯猪肉卷"
and create a new appetizer called "Pigs In Ross".

292
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,813
好 挖香瓜球
All right, ball a melon!

293
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,146
喂 为什么我得切丁 而他只要挖香瓜球
Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon?

294
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,635
嗨      进行得怎么样      
Hi!        Hi, how's it going?         

295
00:15:56,636 --> 00:15:58,487
很好 照进度进行得很好
It's going great! Right on schedule.

296
00:15:58,487 --> 00:15:59,759
我有一群快乐的小帮手
Got my little happy helpers.

297
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,872
很好 随便啦
That's fine. Whatever.

298
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:05,874
怎么了
What's the matter?

299
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,083
没事
Nothing.

300
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:12,385
好吧 有事 我想我们要取消婚礼了
Okay, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding. 

301
00:16:12,385 --> 00:16:13,385
什么
What?

302
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,717
你还是会付我钱的 对吧
You're still gonna pay me, right?

303
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,218
或者不这么自私
Or something a little less selfish.

304
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,394
卡萝儿 怎么了 发生什么事了
Carol, what's the matter? What happened?

305
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,681
我父母今天下午打电话来说 他们不来      
My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.        

306
00:16:25,682 --> 00:16:25,974
天啊
Oh my God!

307
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,519
我知道他们不能接受这件事
I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing.

308
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:31,112
但他们是我父母
But they're my parents.

309
00:16:31,112 --> 00:16:33,141
他们应该在婚礼上把我交出去
I mean, they're supposed to give me away and everything.

310
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:34,028
我很遗憾
Okay, I'm sorry.

311
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,487
因为我说应该取消婚礼
And then Susan and I got in this big fight

312
00:16:36,487 --> 00:16:38,330
苏珊和我大吵了一架 
because I said maybe we should call off the wedding.

313
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,500
她说 这不是为了他们 是为了我们
And she said "we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us".

314
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,914
如果我不了解这个的话 或许就真的应该取消婚礼
And if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding.

315
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,085
我不知道该怎么做
I don't know what to do.

316
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:52,963
我不敢相信我会这么说 但是苏珊说的对
I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.

317
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:54,798
真的
You do?

318
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:59,804
你爱她吗 你不需要太强调这件事
Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.

319
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,056
我当然爱她
Of course I do.

320
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,895
那就是了
Well then, that's it.

321
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:09,225
如果乔治和艾德莱不能接受 那就别管他们
And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them.

322
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:13,563
如果我父母不希望我娶你
Look, I mean, if my parents didn't want me to marry you,

323
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,739
他们也无法阻止我
no way that would've stopped me.

324
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,985
这是你的婚礼
But this is your wedding.

325
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,074
就结吧
Do it.

326
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,409
你说得对 你当然是对的
You're right. Of course you're right.

327
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,002
那我们继续
So we're back on?

328
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,749
我们继续吧
We're back on.

329
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,874
你们听到她说的 剥 切 
You heard the woman! Peel! Chop! Devil!

330
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,257
真不敢相信 我损失了两分钟
Can’t believe I lost two minutes.

331
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,599
看起来 毫无意义
It just seems so futile.

332
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,523
虽然有这么多女人 但是跟没有一样
You know? All these women, and nothing!

333
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:59,450
我觉得就好像 失去了神力的超人 
I feel like Superman without my powers, you know?

334
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,955
我有披风 却不能飞
I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.

335
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,577
现在你知道 我每天都是什么感觉了吧
Well, now you understand how I feel every single day.

336
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,048
这个世界就是我的女同志婚礼
Okay? The world is my lesbian wedding.

337
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,556
要奶油糖吗
Butterscotch?

338
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,183
没人要吗
No one?

339
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,104
好吧 你们等下会后悔的
All right, you'll be sorry later.

340
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,594
谢谢你      不客气
Thank you.         Anytime.

341
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,269
罗斯
Ross.

342
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,110
没有任何一件事比
You know, nothing makes God happier

343
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:24,069
两个人能够彼此因爱而结合 更能让神感到快乐
than when two people, any two people, come together in love.

344
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,739
亲朋好友 我们今天齐聚一堂
Friends, family, we're gathered here today

345
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,540
参加卡萝儿和苏珊神圣的婚礼
to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.

346
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,126
我的天
Oh my God!

347
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,670
现在我什么都看过了
Now I've seen everything!

348
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,928
她走了 她走了 她走了
Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone.

349
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,676
继续结婚吧 继续 继续
Go ahead, get married. Go, go!

350
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,475
你看看她们
Would you look at them?

351
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,102
对 忍不住不看
Yeah. Can't help but.

352
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,570
觉得这个热狗卷不错吧
How's that pig in the blanket working out for you?

353
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,705
那是我卷的喔
I wrapped those bad boys.

354
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,667
我好想萝丝      是吗
I miss Rose.         Oh, yeah?

355
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,050
我知道有点奇怪 但是
I know it's kind of weird, but I mean,

356
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,714
她曾经是我生命很重要的一部分
she was a big part of my life there, you know.

357
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,674
不知道 我只是觉得有点孤单
And I don't know. I just feel kind of alone.

358
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:26,305
我刚不小心听到你说的话
You know, I couldn't help overhearing what you just said.

359
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:31,595
我想你应该忘记萝丝 继续你的人生
And I think it's time you forget about Rose, move on with your life.

360
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,512
我们去拿杯酒好吗
How about we get you a drink?

361
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,473
好啊 你真好
Okay. So nice!

362
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,617
我连想句搭讪的话都不用 对吗
I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?

363
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,238
妈 开心吗
Hey, Mom, you having fun?

364
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,210
我刚跟一个很棒的魁梧女人跳舞
Oh am I! Ijust danced with a wonderfully large woman.

365
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,547
还有三个女生 在自助餐吧对我暗送秋波
And three other girls made eyes at me over at the buffet.

366
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,342
我不是说 这是我想追求的东西
Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue.

367
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,803
但是很高兴知道 我还有别的选择
But it's nice to know I have options.

368
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,800
还有酒 对吧
There's more alcohol, right?

369
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,056
你好吗
How you doing?

370
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,145
很好
Okay.

371
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,988
你今天做了好事      对
You did a good thing today.        Yeah.

372
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:28,987
想跳舞吗
You wanna dance?

373
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,241
不用 没关系
No, that's fine.

374
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,201
来吧
Come on.

375
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,616
我让你带舞
I'll let you lead.

376
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,792
好吧
Okay.

377
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,891
听着 有没有鸟不重要
All right look, penis schmenis!

378
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,934
好吗 我们都是人
Okay? We're all people.

379
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:11,987
我们之中谁会最先结婚
Okay, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?

380
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,113
摩妮卡 我结过婚了
Mon, I was married.

381
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,200
我也是 技术上来说      我办过婚礼
Yeah, me too, technically.         I had a wedding.

382
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,831
好吧 我只是想找个有趣的话题聊天
All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.

383
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:24,488
我有一个 我们之中谁会最晚结婚
All right, I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?

384
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,137
小本也算吧
Isn't Ben in this?

385
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,214
当然      绝对的
Of course!         Absolutely.
