1
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:05,168
妈 你别紧张好吗?
Mom, would you relax?

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,941
那里离这有十条街远
That was 10 blocks from here,

3
00:00:06,941 --> 00:00:09,207
而且那女的是晚上自己一个人走
and the woman was walking alone at night.

4
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,045
我从来不会那样做
I would never do that.

5
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,877
妈 拜托 别担心了
Mom, come on, stop worrying.

6
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:17,423
这条街很安全 这楼也很安全 没什么
This is a safe street. This is a safe building. There's nothing...Aah!

7
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:20,638
哦 天啊 你飞进来干什么
Oh, my God! What are you doing in here?

8
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,552
妈 我得挂了 我得挂了
Mom, I gotta go. I gotta go.

9
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,936
天啊
Oh, my God.

10
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,190
没关系 你只管看报纸
That's fine, you just read the paper.

11
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,818
我去拿个锅
I'm gonna get a pot.

12
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,115
不是给你用的
It's not for you.

13
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,824
没问题 很好
Okay, that's fine.

14
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,790
看家庭马戏团的漫画
Read the Family Circus...

15
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:51,340
享受温馨的喜剧
enjoy the gentle comedy...

16
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:58,009
哦 天呐 天呐 天呐
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

17
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:04,395
哦 哦 哦 天呐
Ugh. Oh, God. Oh, God.

18
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,687
门没关
It's open, you guys.

19
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,232
嗨      嗨 有什么事吗?
Hi.        Hi. Can I help you?

20
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,568
我找菲比 她还住在这里吗?
I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?

21
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,108
她不住这了 但我可以给她传个信息
Uh, no, she doesn't. But I can get a message to her

22
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:21,279
太棒了! 就跟她说 她的老公来过
Great. Uh, just tell her her husband stopped by.

23
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,946
她的什么?
Her what? Aah!

24
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,363

29
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,920
这太扯了 菲比 你怎么结婚了?
This is unbelievable, Pheebs. How can you be married?

30
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,237
我不是那种"结婚"的结婚
Well, I mean, I'm not "married" married, you know?

31
00:02:22,237 --> 00:02:23,969
他只是个朋友 他是同性恋
He was just a friend, and he's gay

32
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,940
他是加拿大人 只是需要绿卡
and he was from Canada, and he just needed a green card.

33
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,058
我真不敢相信你嫁给了邓肯
I can't believe you married Duncan.

34
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,878
你怎么不告诉我呢? 
I mean, how could you not tell me?

35
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:32,983
我们住在一起 我们告诉彼此任何事
 We lived together, we told each other everything.

36
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:37,112
对不起 摩妮卡 但如果我跟你说 你就会批评我
I'm sorry, Monica, but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgmental

37
00:02:37,112 --> 00:02:39,456
也不会赞成我      我当然不会赞成
and would not approve.        Of course I wouldn't approve.

38
00:02:39,456 --> 00:02:45,575
你深深的爱着那个同性恋 你到底在想什么啊?
I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?

39
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,705
看? 你还以为她只是批评
See? And you thought she'd be judgmental.

40
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:53,208
我不爱他 我只是帮一个朋友
Okay, I wasn't in love with him. And I was just helping out a friend.

41
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:56,624
拜托 他离开后你一个月没下床
Please. When he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month.

42
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,362
而且我还看到你吃了一个起司汉堡
And I saw you eat a cheeseburger.

43
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:03,972
难道没有吗?
Well, didn't you?

44
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,221
可能有吧
I might have.

45
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,987
真不敢相信你不告诉我
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

46
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,222
难道你告诉了我一切事情么?
Come on. Like you tell me everything?

47
00:03:11,222 --> 00:03:13,065
我有什么没告诉你么?
What have I not told you?

48
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,191
我不知道 额
Ooh, I don't know. Urn...

49
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:19,230
比如说外面电线杆上的内衣是你的
How about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours

50
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,070
是你和搞笑巴比在阳台上做爱时丢下去的
from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby on the terrace.

51
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:26,175
什么?      等等 谁告诉你的?
What?        Wait a minute. Who told you?

52
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,113
你死定了
You are dead meat.

53
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,961
我不知道那是个大秘密
I didn't know it was a big secret.

54
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,088
哦 没什么大不了 一点关系也没有
Oh, it's not big. Not at all.

55
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,840
那就像 比如说
You know kind of on the same lines as, say,

56
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,509
我不知道...有人有第三个乳头一样
I don't know, having a third nipple.

57
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,926
你有三个乳头?
You have a third nipple?

58
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,680
你这贱人!
You bitch.

59
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,598
秀一秀!秀一秀!
Whip it out. Whip it out.

60
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:59,065
没什么好看的 只是很小的突起 完全没有用处
No, come on. There's nothing to see. It's just a tiny bump. It's totally useless.

61
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,481
难道你其他的乳头是多功能的?
Oh, as opposed to your other multifunctional nipples?

62
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,073
真不敢相信你 你跟我说那只是个小包
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.

63
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,914
乔伊 你以为小包是什么样子?
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?

64
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,300
我不知道 你看到什么东西
I don't know. You see something,

65
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,124
然后听到一个词 我就以为是那样了
 you hear a word, I thought that's what it was.

66
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,790
让我再看一次      秀一下你的小包
Let me see it again.        Yeah, show us your nubbin.

67
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,549
乔伊演过色情片
Joey was in a porno movie.

68
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,940
如果我死 我也要拖大家下水
If I'm going down, I'm taking everybody with me.

69
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,217
天呐 你演过色情片?
Oh, my God. You were in a porno?

70
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:35,238
好啦 好啦 那时我还年轻 只想要份工作
All right, all right. I was young and I just wanted a job, okay?

71
00:04:35,238 --> 00:04:36,982
但最后一刻我没法做下去
But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it.

72
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:40,269
所以他们就让我演修影印机的人 但我没法修
So they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't

73
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,314
因为有人在上面做爱
because there's people having sex on it.

74
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,690
哇哦
Wow.

75
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,117
真狂野!
That is wild.

76
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,570
那是什么形状?      有长毛吗?
So, what's it shaped like?        Is there a hair on it?

77
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,739
你弹它时会有什么反应?
What happens if you flick it?

78
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,883
额 它有什么特殊之处?
So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?

79
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:06,386
按下我的第三个乳头可以通往
Why yes, Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance

80
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,138
纳尼亚的神奇国度
to the magical land of Narnia.

81
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,050
你们知道么 有些文化里 
You know, in some cultures,

82
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,595
第三个乳头象征着男性雄风
having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility.

83
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:18,050
你可以住最好的地方 还有裸女围着你跳舞
You get the best huts, and women dance naked around you.

84
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:22,231
哈 这些文化 有没有可能恰巧在美国中部?
Huh. Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the Tri-State area?

85
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:27,317
你太厉害了 有什么是你不知道的吗?
You know, you are so amazing. Is there anything you don't know?

86
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,738
哦 "茱莉好聪明"  "茱莉好特别!"
Ooh. Julie's so smart. Julie's so special.

87
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,825
亲爱的 我跟你一样希望你和罗斯复合
Look, honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did.

88
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,461
但他现在有她了 你必须忘了他
But he's with her now. You're just gonna have to get over it.

89
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:43,544
哦 我必须得忘了他
Oh, I'm going to have to get over it.

90
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:47,176
我都不知道该怎么办 原来我只要忘了他就好了
God see I didn't know that's what I had to do. I just have to get over it.

91
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,351
漂亮小姐!      你要去哪?
Sassy lady.       Where are you going?

92
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:58,013
我要去见邓肯 他今晚在花园广场溜冰
Urn, I'm gonna go meet Duncan. He's skating tonight at the Garden.

93
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,147
他是冰上剧团的
He's in the Capades.

94
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,050
冰上溜冰?      不 不 在柏油路上溜
The Ice Capades?        No, no, the Gravel Capades.

95
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:09,999
转弯不会很快 但史努比跌倒时 非常好笑
Yeah the turns aren't as fast, but when Snoopy falls? Funny.

96
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:15,118
真不敢相信你竟然为他打扮 你这是在重蹈覆辙
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.

97
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,490
不是的
Okay, no.

98
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:22,546
我告诉你 我见他就是为了能彻底忘了他
For your information, I'm going to see him so I can put all those feelings behind me.

99
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,880
我这样打扮是因为我觉得这样很好
And the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice

100
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,795
为同性恋老公打扮
to look nice for your gay husband.

101
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,431
该死 牛奶没了
Darn it, we're all out of milk.

102
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:36,309
钱德 帮我加点好吗?
Hey, Chandler, will you fill me up here?

103
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:47,230
哦 我懂了 原来是因为我有第三个乳头
Oh, I see, I see. Because of the third nipple thing.

104
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,245
亲爱的 晚点见      再见
Okay, sweetie, I'll see you later.        Bye.

105
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,792
瑞秋 待会儿见      拜拜 茱莉
See you later, Rach.        Byebye, Julie.

106
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,505
嗨      嗨
Hey.        Hey.

107
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,138
拜托 别闹了
Hey, come on, cut it out.

108
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,216
嗨      什么事?
Hey.        What?

109
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,636
我能问你一件事吗?      当然可以
Can I ask you something?        Sure.

110
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,726
什么?
What?

111
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,772
快点 跟我说说      好吧
Come on. Talk to me.        Okay.

112
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:31,857
你恋爱时 花的最久时间
What's the longest you've been in a relationship before

113
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,157
在发生关系之前?
having, having, having the sex?

114
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,952
什么? 谁没有? 你跟茱莉还没有?
Why? Who's not? Are you and Julie not?

115
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,208
你跟茱莉还没上床吗?
Are you and Julie not having sex?

116
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,460
额
Well

117
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,675
技术上来说?
Technically?

118
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,545
没有      哇哦 
No.        Wow.

119
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,925
是因为她在床上很冷淡吗?
Is, is it because she's so cold in bed?

120
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:58,475
还是她有点挑剔 让你感觉像是在学校?
Or is it because she's kind of bossy, makes it feel like school?

121
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:03,738
不! 她很好 我们不是什么都没做
No. No. She's great. And it's not like we haven't done anything.

122
00:08:03,738 --> 00:08:08,022
我们做了很多其他的事 很多事 比如...
I mean, we do plenty of other stuff. Lots of other stuff like...

123
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,778
不 不! 我不需要知道细节
no, no. Don't need to know the details.

124
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,528
不 只是...
No. It's just...

125
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,193
是我的原因
It's me.

126
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,488
我这辈子就只跟过一个女人
You know, I've only been with one woman my whole life

127
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,033
结果她变成一个同性恋
and she turned out to be a lesbian.

128
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:27,420
所以现在我很害怕
So now I've got myself all psyched out.

129
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,421
这就像是...
It's become like, this...

130
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,675
这件事...我...
this thing, and I...

131
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,089
你一定觉得我很怪
You must just think I'm weird.

132
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,179
不不不不 我不觉得很怪
No. No, no, no. I don't think it's weird.

133
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,890
我认为 我想 事实上
I think, I think, urn, in fact

134
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,022
事实上 你知道我怎么想吗?      怎么想?
In fact, you know what I think?        What?

135
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,898
我认为这很性感
I think it's sexy.

136
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,435
性感?
Sexy?

137
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:56,153
我告诉你 作为女人 没有任何事情比
Let me tell you something. As a woman, there is nothing sexier

138
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,069
让男人不想上床更性感
than a man who does not want to have sex.

139
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,243
别开玩笑了      是的 你知道我会怎么做吗?
No kidding.        Oh, yeah. In fact, you know what I'd do?

140
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,955
怎么做?      我会等待
What?        I'd wait.

141
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,296
你会等待?      没错 我会等待
You'd wait?        Yes, absolutely. I would wait

142
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,423
等待
and wait

143
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,510
然后再等下去
Then I'd wait some more.

144
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,638
真的?      没错
Really?        Oh, yeah.

145
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,800
不管她说她有多想要 她怎么乞求你
I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if she begs

146
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,847
她说她要和别的男人做爱
she pleads, she tells you she's gonna have sex with another man.

147
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,316
那只表示收到效果了
That just means it's working.

148
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,925
女人真的想要这个?
Women really want this?

149
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,277
比珠宝还渴望
More than jewelry.

150
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,923
嗨
Hi.

151
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,175

Hi.

153
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,464
看看你! 你看起来真棒
Ah, look at you. You look great.

154
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,804
是吗? 谢谢
Do I? Thank you.

155
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,849

So do you. Sparkly.        Thanks.

156
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,140
那么...
So...

157
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:15,608
这真是太棒了 溜冰男主角
Wow. This is pretty wonderful, huh, Mr. Major Capades Guy.

158
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:21,444
我还记得你以前只是个跑龙套的
I remember when you were just like King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice Is Nice.

159
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,821
你总是说我会成功的
You always said I'd make it.

160
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,412
是啊 我总是有这方面的怪才能
Yeah, well, you know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Woo.

161
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,127
天啊 我好想你
God, I missed you.

162
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,708
我得去换件衣服      好的
I'm gonna get changed.        Okay.

163
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,761
额 我是说现在
Urn, now.

164
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,389
什么?      菲比
What?        Pheebs.

165
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,724
哦 好的
Oh. Right. Okay.

166
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,978
什么?
What?

167
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,931
斗牛士
The Matador so

168
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,905
亲爱的 帮我拿一下好吗?      当然
Sweetie, can you hold this for a second?        Sure.

169
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,490
谢了
Thanks.

170
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,042
茱莉?      嗯?
Uh, Julie?        Yeah.

171
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,207
对不起 你脸上有个古生物学家
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face.

172
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,169
但是现在没了 你没事了
But, uh, it's gone now. You're all right.

173
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,633
大家好      嗨
Hi, everyone.        Hi.

174
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:29,265
听着 听着 我要谢谢你之前跟我的聊天
Oh, listen, listen...I wanted to thank you for, uh, our little talk before.

175
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,893
哦不客气 所以你会等下去么?
Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the waiting thing?

176
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,480
我本想这么做 但跟你谈过后 我又跟乔伊谈了
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.

177
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,274
那很好 他怎么说?
Good. Ahem. What did he say?

178
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,988
基本上 他告诉我别想太多 去做就好了
Basically, he told me to get over myself and just do it.

179
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,956
于是我想了想你说的和他说的
So I thought about what you said and thought about what he said.

180
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,084
照他的说法 我今晚就可以和她上床 所以
And, well, his way, I get to have sex tonight, so

181
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,630
我口袋里的是什么?
What is this in my pocket?

182
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,508
天啊 是乔伊的色情片
Why, it's Joey's porno movie.

183
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,216
放进去播吧
Pop it in.

184
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,363
我无所谓 
I'm fine with it,

185
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:14,059
只要你们愿意看里面全是只有两个乳头的人
I mean, if you're okay watching a video, filled with two nippled people.

186
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,278
太棒了 大家都在做爱 那正是我想看的
Great. People having sex. That's just what I need to see.

187
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,689
做爱有什么不对?
What's wrong with people having sex?

188
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,737
嗯...
Well...

189
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:30,038
你知道 这种片子很冒犯人
Well, urn, you know, these movies are offensive

190
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,790
侮辱女性
and, uh, degrading to women

191
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,747
和女性
and females

192
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:39,081
灯光总是很呆板
And, uh, the lightings always unflattering.

193
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,420
还有...
And...

194
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,928
摩妮卡 帮我一下啊      管他的 我想看乔伊!
Monica, help me out here.        Hell I wanna see Joey.

195
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:56,940
这是有故事情节的 还是他们直接就开始做
So is there, like, a story, or do they just start doing it right

196
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,021
当我没说
Oh. Never mind.

197
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,938
等等 那是我见过最疯狂的打字测试
Okay, now, wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.

198
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,033
我只能说 她最好能得到这份工作
All I say is, she better get the job.

199
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,941
依我看 是他被"聘用"了
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.

200
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,073
我来了 我来了
Shh. Hey, here I come. Here I come.

201
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,992
我来修影印机了
See I'm coming to fix the copier

202
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,662
我没办法走到影印机那 我心想"我该怎么办"
I can't get to the copier. I'm thinking, "What do I do? What do I do?"

203
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,550
于是我就看着他们做爱
So I just watch them have sex.

204
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,238
然后我要说台词了
And then I say. Wait, here's my line.

205
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,846
那样对进纸盒不好
You know, that's bad for the paper tray.

206
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,895
干得好 朋友      谢谢
Nice work, my friend.        Thank you.

207
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:39,899
等等 我又出现了 等等 那家伙的屁股把我挡住了
Wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.

208
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,984
我出现了...出现了...出现了...
There I am. There I am. There I am.

209
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,248
额 有什么事吗? 你昨天去找我
So, urn...So, what's up? You came to see me yesterday.

210
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,283
哦 对 额
Oh, yeah, urn...

211
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,794
好吧
All right.

212
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,335
我需要离婚
I kind of need a divorce.

213
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,502
好的
Okay.

214
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,628
怎么了?
How come?

215
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:12,173
其实我又要结婚了
Urn, actually, I'm getting married again.

216
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,809
什么?      天啊 我真不知道该怎么告诉你
What?        Oh God I don't know how to tell you this.

217
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,347
我是异性恋
I'm straight.

218
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,645
我知道
Yeah. I know.

219
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,105
我不懂 我不懂 你怎么会是异性恋?
I don't understand. I don't understand. How can you be straight?

220
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:32,903
你是如此聪明和风趣 又那么会办奥斯卡金奖派对
I mean, you're so smart and funny, and you throw such great Academy Award parties.

221
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,663
我知道 我也是一直那样告诉自己的
I know. That's what I kept telling myself.

222
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,540
但到了某个程度 你再也无法活在谎言里
But you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.

223
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,621
那你知道多久了?
So how long have you known?

224
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,838
我想在某个程度上 我一直知道自己是异性恋
I guess on some level I always knew I was straight.

225
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,845
我以为自己不是
I thought I was supposed to be something else.

226
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,550
我是冰上舞者
You know, I'm an ice dancer,

227
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,475
我所有的朋友都是同性恋 我只是想融入他们
all my friends are gay. I was just trying to fit in.

228
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,928
额
And, urn.

229
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,814
那你真的爱上了一个女人?
And there's actually a woman?

230
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,581
她叫黛柏拉
Her name's Debra.

231
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,399
那她是你第一个女人么?
Well is she the first that you've been with?

232
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,860
我从没告诉过你...
Well I've never told you this...

233
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:19,624
但我大学时曾经有一 两次
but there were one or two times back in college

234
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,113
喝得醉醺醺的跑去单身酒吧
when I'd get really drunk and go to a straight bar,

235
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:24,379
醒来发现身旁躺着女人
and wake up with a woman next to me.

236
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,237
我告诉自己那是酒精的缘故
But I told myself it was the liquor

237
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:29,669
大学每个人都在摸索体验
and everyone experiments in college.

238
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,340
当然
Sure.

239
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,757
现在我知道自己没有选择 我生来就是如此
But now I know I don't have a choice about this. I was born this way.

240
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,550
我不知道要说什么
I don't know what to say.

241
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:46,109
你和一个人结婚六年 以为自己很了解他
I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years, and you think you know him.

242
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,146
但有一天他突然说"哦!我不是同性恋
And then one day he says, "Oh, I'm not gay."

243
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,823
我还是我啊
I'm, I'm still me.

244
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,367
你为什么在六年前没发现这件事呢?
Why couldn't you just have figured this out six years ago?

245
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:07,622
里面闻起来还是有猴子的味道
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.

246
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,009
我们又有话可聊了
Well, that saves us the conversation.

247
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,843
今晚很棒 但我好累
Well, this has been great, but I'm officially wiped.

248
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:19,753
我也是 我们该走了      不
Me too. We should get going.        No.

249
00:16:19,753 --> 00:16:22,099
不!拜托
No. I mean. No. Come on, you guys.

250
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,724
别这样 看 现在才十一点半
Come on, look, it's only 11:30.

251
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:30,066
我们来聊天 我们好久没一起聊天了
Let's just talk. We never just hang out and talk anymore.

252
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,821
瑞秋 我们总在一起聊天
Rachel, that's all we do.

253
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,197
我们或许经常那样 但茱莉呢?
Maybe that's all we do. What about Julie?

254
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,154
茱莉怎样?
What about Julie?

255
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:44,372
你加入我们将近两个月了
Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now

256
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,831
但我们并不真的了解你
and we don't really know you.

257
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:52,295
我是说 茱莉是谁? 你喜欢什么? 讨厌什么?
I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like? What don't you like?

258
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,669
我们想知道一切
We want to know everything.

259
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,921
那要花点时间
Well, heh, that could take a while.

260
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,718
所以呢?
So?

261
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,136
这里有谁没时间了解茱莉?
I mean who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?

262
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,313
我有时问      我有
I got the time to get to know Julie.        I got time, yeah.

263
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,568
瑞秋 额 我很了解她 我可以走吗?
Uh, Rach, ahem, I know her pretty well. Can I go?

264
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:14,822
好吧
That's fine.

265
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,743
我们从你的童年开始吧 你的童年如何?
Okay, Julie, so let's start with your childhood. What was that like?

266
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,122
简而言之
Well in a nut shell

267
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,286
那你告诉你父母了吗?
So, urn, have you told your parents?

268
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,790
还没 但那没问题 他们都很好
No, but it'll be okay. They're pretty cool.

269
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,425
我哥也是异性恋 所以...
My brother's straight, so...

270
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,378
好了
Here you go.

271
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,048
对了 我还有个问题
You know what? I just have one more question. Urn...

272
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:45,513
如果你早点发现 而我又在你身边
If you had figured this out sooner and, urn, I had been around

273
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,352
你觉得我会不会是...?
do you think I would have been the one who...?

274
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,518
不 不 别告诉我
No, no. That's all right. Don't tell me.

275
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:55,655
不管是哪个答案都不会让我好过些 拿去吧
I don't think either answer would make me feel better. Here.

276
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:58,782
我爱你 菲比
I love you, Phoebe.

277
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,050
所以你哥是异性恋 是吗?
So your brother's straight, huh?

278
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,629
我是认真的
Seriously.

279
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:26,018
我二年级的老师是汤姆斯小姐
And my second grade teacher was Miss Thomas

280
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,999
一年级老师是柯比太太
and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.

281
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:31,315
额 葛比太太?
Ahem. Mrs. Gobb?

282
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,772
不 柯比 柯比沙拉的柯比
No, Cobb. Like cobb salad.

283
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,778
哦好
Hmm, okay.

284
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,490
那 柯比沙拉里面到底有什么?
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?

285
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,116
我要回家了
I'm going home.

286
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,616
天啊 茱莉还真能聊
Boy, that Julie's a talker, huh?

287
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:51,961
晚安
Good night.

288
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,547
那么     晚安
So...        Good night.

289
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,551
时候不早了 你或许不打算...
It's pretty late. You're probably, uh, not still planning on...

290
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,341
不 我还是想
Oh. No, no, I am.

291
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,598
你紧张吗?
Well, hey, are you nervous?

292
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,760
不不 我 额
No no. I, uh

293
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,893
我以前做过
I have done it before.

294
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,800
我是说 你打算怎么做?
Well, okay I mean how are you gonna handle it?

295
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,020
你会先跟她谈一谈 或者就直接扑上去?
Are you gonna talk about it before hand? Are you just gonna pounce?

296
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,024
我不知道 我想我就...
I, uh I don't know. I guess I'm just gonna...

297
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,409
顺其自然
see, see what happens.

298
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,575
好吧 祝你好运
Okay. Good luck.

299
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,497
怎么了?
What? Uh...

300
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,960
怎么了?      没什么
What?        Nothing. I mean, urn...

301
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,284
这是你和她的第一次 你也知道
It is your first time with her, and, you know,

302
00:19:36,284 --> 00:19:38,591
如果第一次不顺利的话...
if the first time doesn't go well..

303
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:42,219
以后再想恢复好就很难了
Well then, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.

304
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,383
额 现在我紧张了
Okay, now I'm nervous.

305
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,515
或许你应该推迟
Maybe you should put it off.

306
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,523
不 我不想延期了
No, no, I don't want to put it off.

307
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:01,281
我去年一整年都很悲惨
God, I'm just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable.

308
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,237
现在我真的很快乐
And now, now I'm actually happy.

309
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,238
真的很快乐
You know I mean, really happy.

310
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,953
我只是不想...
I just don't wanna...

311
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,914
我不想搞砸 你懂吗?
I don't wanna mess it up, you know?

312
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,254
我懂
I know.

313
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,461
对
Yeah.

314
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:24,136
对不起      不是你的错
I'm sorry.        No, it's not your fault.

315
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,592
是啊
Right.

316
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,393
也许不必这么困难
Maybe it doesn't have to be this tough.

317
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:36,350
或许你说的"顺其自然"是最好的做法
Maybe you were on the right track with that whole, you know, spontaneous thing.

318
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:39,314
女人喜欢那样      真的?
I mean women really like that.        Really?

319
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,945
是啊 我是说 如果
Yeah. I mean, you know, if

320
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:45,529
我是说如果是我的话 我会希望你      什么?
I mean if it were me, I'd, you know, want you to        What?

321
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:50,367
我也不知道 趁我没防备时给我 就像 一个真正的
I don't know, catch me off guard. You know, with, like, a really...

322
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,951
很棒的吻
good kiss.

323
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,538
就是
You know, really...

324
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:58,751
刚开始是轻柔的吻
sort of, urn, soft at first.

325
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:04,799
然后拨开我脸上的头发
And then maybe, urn, brush the hair away from my face.

326
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:09,348
然后深情的看着我的眼睛
And then look far into my eyes

327
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,430
让我知道有件
in a way that let me know something

328
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,729
非常美妙的事情就要发生
amazing is about to happen.

329
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,229
然后 我不知道...然后
And then, I don't know, then...

330
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,524
你会把我拉得更紧
you'd pull me really close to you so that

331
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:31,287
那样我就紧紧贴着你
So that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you.

332
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:35,871
那样就会有种...
And, urn, it would get kind of...

333
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,211
汗涔涔
sweaty...

334
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,919
朦朦胧胧的感觉
and, uh. And blurry

335
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,337
于是就这样自然而然发生了
And then it's just happening.

336
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,472
谢了 瑞秋 晚安
Thanks, Rach. Good night.

337
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,227
哦 天啊!
Oh, God.

338
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,165
早安!
Good morning.

339
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,336
昨晚有人爽到了
Well, somebody got some last night.

340
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,592
两次!
Twice.
