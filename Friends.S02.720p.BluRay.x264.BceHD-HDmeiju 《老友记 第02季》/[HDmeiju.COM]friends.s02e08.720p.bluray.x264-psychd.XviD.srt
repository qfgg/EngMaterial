1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,246
罗斯吻了我      不会吧
Ross kissed me.         No!

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,756
我的天啊 我的天啊 我的天啊
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

3
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,000
太不可思议了      
It was unbelievable! 

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,757
我的天啊 我的天啊 我的天啊
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God！

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,495
我们要听整个经过 
Okay, all right. We wanna hear everything. 

6
00:00:16,496 --> 00:00:19,057
摩妮卡 去拿酒 拔掉电话线
Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone.

7
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:20,359
好      
Okay.         

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,179
瑞秋 结局好不好 我们需不需要纸巾
Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?

9
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,268
结局非常好      噢
Oh, it ended very well.         Oh.

10
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:29,898
等我来了再开始 等我来了再开始
Do not start without me! Do not start without me!

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,301
先说说那个吻
Okay. All right. Let's hear about the kiss. 

12
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:35,032
是像 拂过你嘴唇的轻吻呢
Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips.

13
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:38,740
还是像 "我现在就要你" 的那种吻呢
Or was it like a, you know, "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?

14
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:43,324
刚开始很热烈 然后
Well, at first it was really intense, you know? And then...

15
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,877
天啊 后来我们就沉醉在里面了
Oh God! And then we just sort of sunk into it.

16
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:48,893
他是抱着你的吗 
Oh! So, okay, was he holding you? 

17
00:00:48,894 --> 00:00:50,707
还是把手放在你背后
Or were his hands like on your back?

18
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:54,384
不 事实上 刚开始他的手放在我的腰上
No, actually, first they started out on my waist.

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,639
然后游移上来 到我的头发
And then they slid up and then they were in my hair.

20
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:04,268
后来我吻了她      舌吻
And, and then I kissed her.        Tongue?

21
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,646
没错      太酷了
Yeah.         Cool.

31
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,460
打电玩之类的
Games and stuff.

32
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,260
没工作 没有适合我的工作
There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.

33
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,338
喔 等等 这里有一个
Oh, wait, here's one.

34
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:20,150
你愿意裸体煮菜吗      
Would you be willing to cook naked?         

35
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:21,996
有人要找裸体厨师吗
There's an ad for a naked chef?

36
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,989
不是 但如果你愿意裸体煮菜 
No, but if you're willing to cook naked, 

37
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,019
那或许就能裸体跳舞
then you might be willing to dance naked.

38
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,271
然后就
And then...

39
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:32,663
嘿      嘿     
Hey!        Hey！

40
00:02:32,664 --> 00:02:35,401
对了 你昨晚亲热得怎么样
Oh, so how'd you make out last night?

41
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:42,451
很风趣 痛苦的风趣 不 等等
That is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait, wait.

42
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,569
没错 就只是痛苦而已
Yeah, that's just painful.

43
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:48,282
等等 我以为昨晚很愉快
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.

44
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,688
对 没错 但当我到回家 
Yeah, it was. But I get home, okay.

45
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:54,130
看到茱莉放在我床头柜上的盐水
And I see Julie's saline solution on my night table.

46
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,464
我就想 天啊 我这是在干什么
And I'm thinking to myself, "Oh my God! What the hell am I doing?"

47
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,827
我跟茱莉这么好的女人在一起 
I mean, here I am with Julie, this incredible great woman, 

48
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:02,336
我喜欢她 她也喜欢我 
who I care about and who cares about me. 

49
00:03:02,337 --> 00:03:04,844
难不成我就这样 把这一切都抛掉吗
and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?

50
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,640
一瓶盐水 就给你这么大的启示
You got all that from saline solution?

51
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,000
等等 我们现在谈的是瑞秋 
Wait a minute. We're talking about Rachel here. 

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,381
你跟瑞秋的事
You and Rachel.

53
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,586
相信我 我梦想能跟瑞秋在一起 想了有十年了 
Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for like ten years now. 

54
00:03:15,587 --> 00:03:17,356
但现在我跟茱莉在一起
But now I'm with Julie.

55
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,398
就好像 到底是我跟茱莉 还是我跟瑞秋
You know? So it's like, me and Julie, me and Rachel.

56
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,733
我跟茱莉 我跟瑞秋
Me and Julie, me and Rach.

57
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,577
瑞秋 瑞秋
Rachel! Rachel!

58
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,863
嘿 你好      你好吗
Hey, you.         How are you?

59
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,078
很好 你呢      很好
Good. How are you?         Good.

60
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,710
嗨 亲爱的      嗨 茱莉 茱莉
Hi, honey.         Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie?

61
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,462
茱莉
Julie!

62
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,373
你好吗
How are you?

63
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,799
很好      很好
Good.        Good.

64
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,586
这么说 大家都在这儿
So every body's here.

65
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,005
大家都很好
Everybody's good.

66
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,094
你要弹点什么吗 菲比
So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?

67
00:03:50,138 --> 00:03:52,561
事实上      弹吧
Oh. Well, actually...        Play it!

68
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,770
好吧
All right.

69
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:59,695
茱莉 我不知道你戴隐形眼镜      什么
Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.         What?

70
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,655
好的 各位好
Okay. Hi.

71
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,488
各位好 可以了
Hello. Hi. Okay.

72
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,072
这是一首关于三角恋爱的歌
So, this is a song about a love triangle

73
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,913
发生在我虚构的三个人物之间
between three people that I made up.

74
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:20,420
歌名是 "其中两人昨晚接吻了"
It's called, "Two of Them Kissed Last Night."

75
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:26,259
有个女孩名叫贝蒂
There was a girl we'll call her Betty.

76
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,758
还有个男孩名叫尼尔
And a guy let's call him Neil.

77
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,313
我想特别郑重声明
Now I can't stress this point too strongly.

78
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,516
这故事不是真的
This story isn't real

79
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,374
现在尼尔必须决定 
Now our Neil must decide. 

80
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,607
他要放弃哪个女孩
Who will be the girl that he casts aside?

81
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,527
是他深爱的那个贝蒂
Will Betty be the one who he loves truly?

82
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:51,788
还是那个叫露俐的女孩
Or will it be the one who we'll call Loolie?

83
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,538
他必须决定 他必须决定
He must decide. He must decide.

84
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:01,131
虽然他纯属虚构 但他必须决定
Even though I made him up, he must decide.

85
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:08,881
这履历写得很好 很好 很好
This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice.

86
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,508
非常令人印象深刻
Muy impressivo.

87
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:15,767
莱斯特先生 这工作具体是要做什么 
So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? 

88
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:17,474
广告里没说清楚
The ad wasn't too clear.

89
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,184
摩克力      什么
Mockolate.        I'm sorry?   

90
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:25,654
摩克力 这是一种完全人造的巧克力的替代产品
Mockolate. It's a synthetic chocolate substitute.

91
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,349
别客气 试一块
Well, go ahead, try a piece.         

92
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,912
我们认为摩克力比巧克力更好吃
Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.

93
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,993
好的
All right.

94
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,205
对吧
Yeah.

95
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,378
我喜欢它碎掉的感觉
I love how it crumbles.

96
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:48,257
那是巧克力不会有的  
You see, chocolate doesn't do that.    

97
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:53,137
我们很快就能得到食品认证
Anyhoo, we should be getting our FDA approval any day now.

98
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,677
希望能在感恩节前上市
Hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving.

99
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,684
在我们看来 巧克力已经占据了
See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates

100
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:03,561
几个要吃大餐的节日 复活节 圣诞节等
your major food preparation holidays, Easter, Christmas, what have you.

101
00:06:03,637 --> 00:06:05,862
但我们相信 只要有适当的市场营销
But we're thinking given the right marketing,

102
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,741
我们可以把感恩节变成摩克力的节日
we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.

103
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,071
哇
Wow.

104
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,450
你不吞下去吗
Do you wanna swallow that? 

105
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,206
我在等泡泡消失
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.  

106
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,995
是啊 那很棒对吧
Yeah. Isn't that great?

107
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,895
总之 我们想找几个大厨
Well, anyhoo, we are looking for a couple of chefs,

108
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:26,215
创作出一些感恩节主题的食谱
who can create some Thanksgiving themed recipes.

109
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:27,668
你有兴趣吗
You think you might be interested?

110
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,964
绝对 有 
Abso... lutely!

111
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,794
我喜欢创作食谱 
See, I love creating new recipes. 

112
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:38,098
也喜欢感恩节 现在我还爱上了摩克力
I love Thanksgiving. And well, now I love Mockolate.

113
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,391
真的
Really?

114
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:42,270
尤其是那余味 我敢说
Especially that aftertaste. You know, I tell you,

115
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:45,060
可以撑到圣诞节
that'll last you till Christmas.

116
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,948
摩克力慕思如何
How about Mockolate mousse?

117
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,445
感觉不像感恩节的味道
It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.

118
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,455
那么清教徒摩克力慕思呢
Okay, how about Pilgrim Mockolate mousse?

119
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,616
要怎么跟清教徒扯上关系
What makes it Pilgrim?

120
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,327
放些金属扣在上面
We'll put buckles on it.

121
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,871
嘿     嘿      嘿      
Hey.         Hey.        Hey.        

122
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:08,417
罗斯来电话没      对不起 没有
Did Ross call?         No, I'm sorry.

123
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,410
他为什么不打 
Why didn't he call? 

124
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:12,679
他要跟茱莉在一起 对吧
He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he?

125
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:13,866
他会选择她
He's gonna stay with her.

126
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,025
而她会说 
And she's gonna be all, 

127
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:17,343
嗨 我是茱莉 罗斯选择了我
Hi, I'm Julie. Ross picked me.

128
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,343
我们会结婚生子
And we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids. 

129
00:07:20,344 --> 00:07:22,356
一起老死
And dig up stuff together!

130
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:27,106
无意冒犯 但听起来一点都不像她
No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.

131
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,301
我不知道该怎么办 我该怎么办 
I don't know what am I gonna do. What am I gonna do?

132
00:07:31,302 --> 00:07:32,999
这简直就是个恶梦
I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.

133
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,429
我知道 这一定很难 
Oh, I know. This must be so hard. 

134
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,201
不要啊 有两个女人爱我
Oh no! Two women love me!

135
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,373
她们两个都漂亮又性感 
They're both gorgeous and sexy.

136
00:07:40,374 --> 00:07:42,208
我的钱包太小 装不下这些50块的纸币
My wallet's too small for my 50s.

137
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,079
我的钻石鞋也太紧了
And my diamond shoes are too tight!

138
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,560
我想到了 罗斯      
Hey, here's a thought, Ross... 

139
00:07:47,561 --> 00:07:50,171
别碰电脑 永远别碰
Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.

140
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,838
罗斯 送你三个字
Ross, listen, I got two words for you:

141
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,839
三人行
Threesome.

142
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,012
好 我们理性一点 
Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, okay? 

143
00:08:02,013 --> 00:08:07,066
我们列张单子 写出瑞秋和茱莉的优缺点
We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons.

144
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,696
名字可以用不同字体的粗体字
We'll put their names in bold with different fonts.

145
00:08:11,697 --> 00:08:13,565
然后每一栏 可以用不同的颜色来写
And I can use different colors for each column.

146
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:18,240
不能用笔写的吗      不行 你个土老冒儿
Can't we just use a pen?         No, Amish boy.

147
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,683
我们先从缺点开始 那样比较好玩 
All right, let's start with the cons because they're more fun. 

148
00:08:23,684 --> 00:08:24,869
先说瑞秋吧
Rachel first.

149
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,792
不知道 我是说
I don't know. I mean...

150
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:33,503
好吧 我想你可以说 她有时候有一点被宠坏了
All right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.

151
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,429
没有错
You could say that.

152
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,510
有时候她还有点没脑子
I guess, you know, sometimes she's a little ditzy, you know?

153
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:45,306
有时候她也太注重外表了
And I've seen her be a little too into her looks.

154
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,088
茱莉和我有很多共同点 
Oh, and Julie and I have a lot in common.

155
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:50,694
因为我们都是古生物学家
Because we're both paleontologists, right?

156
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,816
瑞秋只是个服务生
But Rachel's just a waitress.

157
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,356
服务生
Waitress.

158
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:58,110
了解 你们想玩《毁灭战士》吗
Got it. You guys wanna play "Doom"?

159
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,072
我们也可以继续写
Or we could keep doing this.

160
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,995
还有什么
What else?

161
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,001
我不知道
I don't know.

162
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,006
噢 她的脚踝有点肉肉的
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.

163
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,760
好吧 说说茱莉吧 她有什么不好
Okay, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?

164
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,800
她不是瑞秋
She's not Rachel.

165
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,352
好 这是摩克力酥皮南瓜派
Okay. This is pumpkin pie with a Mockolate crust.

166
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:32,235
这是摩克力蔓越莓蛋糕 那是碎摩克力饼干
This is Mockolate cranberry cake, and these are Mockolatechip cookies.

167
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,737
就像当初印地安人做的那样
Just like the Indians served.

168
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,492
哦天啊      是好吃的意思吗
Oh my God!         "Oh my God" good?

169
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:44,372
哦天啊 我不敢相信 你让我吃这种东西
Oh my God! I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.

170
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:49,203
老天爷 这一定就是万恶之味
Oh! Oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!

171
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,128
我告诉你 这个玩意儿不能打印 
I'm telling you, this thing won't print.

172
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,746
是的 那个按钮 我都按了一百回了
Yes, I pressed that button like a hundred times. 

173
00:10:01,747 --> 00:10:04,393
你一点都不热情 这算哪门子的热线电话
You know, for a hotline, you're not so hot.

174
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,519
那是什么声音
What is that in the background?

175
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,352
你是在看"星际迷航"吗
Are you watching "Star Trek"?

176
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,232
嘿
Hey.

177
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,432
你跟茱莉怎么样 她很伤心吗      
So how'd it go with Julie? Did you break her heart? 

178
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:21,489
是啊 场面很糟糕
Yes. It was horrible. 

179
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:26,202
她哭了 我也哭了 她扔东西 砸到我
She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me.

180
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,916
我做了正确的事
I did the right thing.

181
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:32,955
那么 史波克真的拥抱了他的父亲
So, Spock actually hugs his father?

182
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,711
嘿 你们有
Hey, do you guys have...

183
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,093
嗨      嗨
Hi!        Hi!

184
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,590
你要去哪儿
Where're you going?

185
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,973
我刚回来
I just got back from...

186
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:48,019
从茱莉那儿
From Julie's.

187
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:51,481
不 不是你想的那样
No, no. It's not what you think.

188
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,063
是别的事
It's the other thing.

189
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:04,619
什么别的事 我想的是什么
Well, what's the other thing? What do I think?

190
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,954
这个嘛
Well.

191
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,787
他跟茱莉分手了
He broke up with Julie!

192
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:13,670
快去抱她 看在老天的份上
Well, go hug her, for God's sakes!

193
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,626
是真的      真的
Really?        Really.

194
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:22,258
我爱的一直是你 瑞秋      噢 天啊
It's always been you, Rach.        Oh, God！

195
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,766
噢 这太好了 真是太好了
Oh, this is good.  This is really good.         

196
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:39,484
我知道 我几乎
I know I know. It's, it's almost...

197
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:48,655
我们出去走走好吗 就我们俩 不跟他们
What do you say, we go take a walk? Just us. Not them.

198
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,730
好的 我去拿外套      
Okay. Let me get my coat.         

199
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:52,252
好的 不 嘿 等等
Okay. No, hey, whoa, whoa.

200
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,919
我去帮你拿      好
I'll get your coat.        Okay!

201
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,254
他去帮我拿外套  他去帮我拿外套 乔伊
He's going to get my coat. He's going to get my coat, Joey!

202
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,891
我的天啊 我真不敢相信 真是太棒了
Oh my God, you guys, I can't believe this! This is unbelievable!

203
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,974
这是什么      什么 没什么
What's that?         What? Nothing!

204
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:16,858
我看到我的名字了 那是什么      没有 你看
What? I saw my name. What is it?         No no see? See?

205
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,061
嘿 能打印了
Hey, it's printing!

206
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,525
嘿 打出来了
Hey, it's printing!

207
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,995
那是什么 让我看看      
What is it? Let me see!        

208
00:12:23,996 --> 00:12:25,359
有人订外套吗
Hey, someone order a coat?

209
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,016
罗斯 钱德在他的电脑上 写了关于我的东西 
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer.

210
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:28,903
而且还不让我看
And he won't let me see.

211
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,164
他不让你看 他不让你看
He won't? He won't!

212
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:37,709
因为那是你写的短篇小说
Because isn't that the short story you were writing?

213
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:41,712
是的 这是我写的短篇小说
Yes, it is a short story that I was writing.

214
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,842
里面有我吗 那让我看看
And I'm in it? Then let me read it.

215
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,503
不行
No!

216
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,220
拜托      
Come on!         

217
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:52,223
嘿 要不你念给她听
Hey, why don't you read it to her?

218
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,775
好吧
All right.

219
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,241
那是个夏天
It was summer.

220
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,245
天气很热
And it was hot.

221
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,250
瑞秋在那里
Rachel was there.   

222
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,301
一张寂寞的灰沙发 
A lonely gray couch.

223
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,761
尼德大叫 "哦 快看"
"Oh, look!" cried Ned.

224
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,936
然后他就永远的当上了国王 完
And then the kingdom was his forever. The end.

225
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,097
就这样 你就写了这些 
That's it? That's all you wrote? 

226
00:13:39,098 --> 00:13:41,518
你是全世界最烂的作家
You're the worst writer in the whole world!

227
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,655
好了 我不觉得好玩了
All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore.

228
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,774
那纸上一定写了我关于我的什么 我要看
There's something about me on that piece of paper, and I want to see it.

229
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,783
不 不行
No, you don't.

230
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,996
好吧 算了
All right, you know what, that's fine. 

231
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:55,456
你们要是这么幼稚的话 那就算了
If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine.

232
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,118
我不要看了
I do not need to see it.

233
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,718
这是什么      那是
What is this?          That is...

234
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,090
罗斯 这是什么
Ross, what is this?

235
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,631
谢了      祝你好运
Thank you.       Good luck.

236
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,645
好吧 你只要记住 我有多爱你就行了 好吗
Okay. Just remember how crazy I am about you, okay?

237
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:23,776
有点没脑子 太注重外表 被宠坏了
"Kind of ditzy"? "Too into her looks"? "Spoiled"?

238
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,669
是 有一点被宠坏了 
No, that's a little spoiled. 

239
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,981
那个白痴 少打了 有一点
He was supposed to type "little", the idiot!

240
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,866
只是个服务生
"Just a waitress"?

241
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,154
那是
Now, that was,

242
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,074
我是说 相对于
I mean, as opposed to,

243
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,334
好吧 你饶了我吧 瑞秋
The... Okay, is this over yet? Rach?

244
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:44,502
我的脚踝没有肉肉的
I do not have chubby ankles!

245
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,880
不 等等  好吧 好吧 看另一边 
No, no, wait, okay, okay, okay, look at the other side. 

246
00:14:47,881 --> 00:14:49,920
看茱莉的那一栏
Look at Julie's column.

247
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,840
她不是瑞球
She's not Rachem?

248
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,382
不是       瑞球是什么东西
No.        What the hell's a Rachem?

249
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,405
不是 不是 
No, no. 

250
00:14:55,406 --> 00:14:57,237
是古生物学家会用的愚蠢字眼 
Is that some stupid paleontology word

251
00:14:57,238 --> 00:14:59,350
而我没听过 因为我只是个服务生
that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress?

252
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,015
瑞秋 别这样 瑞秋 瑞秋
No. Rach, come on! Rach! Rach!

253
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,399
瑞秋 不是的
Rach! No, no!

254
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:08,105
那写的是 "她不是瑞秋" 她不是
It's "She's not Rachel"! She's not...

255
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,448
瑞秋
Rachel?

256
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,908
我的日记 我的日记 太聪明了
My diary. My diary! That's brilliant!

257
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,571
如果我说 是我的日记的话 
I should have told her it was my diary.

258
00:15:19,572 --> 00:15:21,122
她就不会要我念了
She never would have made me read her my diary.

259
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,421
那倒是真的 
No, that's true. 

260
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,548
你是很好的事后诸葛
You know, you'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.

261
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,755
我不敢相信罗斯会列这种清单
I cannot believe Ross even made this list.

262
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,924
就是说啊      真是个白痴
I know.         What a dinkus!

263
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,846
别再骂他了 那是钱德的主意
Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.

264
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,676
什么      什么
What?         What?

265
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:42,268
很好 我就是在等这一刻
Oh, good. I was hoping that would come up.

266
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,852
那是你的主意      
This was your idea?   

267
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,233
好吧 我们凭心而论 好不好
All right, let's get some perspective here, okay? 

268
00:15:46,234 --> 00:15:48,440
事出必有因
These things happen for a reason.

269
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,321
是啊 就是你
Yeah. You!

270
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,166
菲比 帮我一下 好不好
All right, Pheebs, back me up here. Okay? 

271
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:55,993
你信因果轮回之类的鬼话 是不是
You believe in that karma crap, don't you?

272
00:15:56,155 --> 00:16:01,075
是啊 顺便祝你 下辈子当屎壳郎 生活幸福
Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.

273
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,475
瑞秋
Rach! 

274
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,473
瑞秋
Rach!

275
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,180
打开 好吗
Hey! Open up! Please?

276
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,050
罗斯 当你按门铃 别人不让你进
When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross,

277
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,481
那就是说 让你滚蛋
that means "Go away".

278
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,861
而不是叫你爬消防梯上来
That doesn't mean "Climb up the firee scape".

279
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,730
我只是想念给你听 你的优点      
I just want to read you something, it's your "Pro List".       

280
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:35,400
没兴趣
Not interested.

281
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,609
好吧 好吧
Okay, okay.

282
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:40,029
第一 你看游戏节目时会哭
Number one, the way you cry at game shows.

283
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,038
第二 你很爱你的朋友
Number two, how much you love your friends.

284
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:48,330
第三 你紧张时会玩头发
Number three, the way you play with your hair when you're nervous.

285
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:52,467
第四 你能勇敢地开始你的新生活

第五 你对小本很好
Number five, how great you are with Ben.

287
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,340
第六 你的香味
Number six, the way you smell.

288
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,043
嘿 罗斯 你在干嘛      
Hey, Ross, what are you doing?        

289
00:17:03,044 --> 00:17:04,391
嘿 乔伊 打开窗子 好不好
Hey, Joey, you wanna open the window?

290
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,809
当然
Oh, yeah.

291
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,020
你在外面干嘛      我
What are you doing out there?         I'm...

292
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,274
我的天 你一定冻坏了 你知道你需要什么吗
My gosh, you must be freezing. You know what you need?

293
00:17:12,275 --> 00:17:15,782
来杯热腾腾的摩克力如何
How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?

294
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,829
瑞秋 拜托 开门
Rach, come on, open up.

295
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,408
瑞秋 拜托 你得再给我一次机会
Rach, come on. Come on. You gotta give me another chance.

296
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,417
不要
No.

297
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,746
不要      没有错
No?         That's what I said.

298
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,113
也许我们该离开一下      
Maybe we should go. 

299
00:17:31,113 --> 00:17:33,382
不 不需要 我们讲完了
No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.

300
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,641
瑞秋 我知道 你肯定     
Rach, come on. I know how you must...... 

301
00:17:35,642 --> 00:17:37,007
不 你不知道 罗斯
No, you don't, Ross.

302
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,508
想像你自己最糟糕的缺点
Imagine the worst things you think about yourself.

303
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:46,020
如果换是你 当这个世界上你最信任的人
Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world,

304
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,930
不仅也这样认为
not only thinks them too,

305
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:52,022
还把它们当作不跟你在一起的原因 你有什么感受
but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.

306
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,694
但我想跟你在一起 尽管你有那些缺点
No, but, but see, I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.

307
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:02,282
你还真伟大 罗斯 我说了 不准走
Oh well, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said, don't go!

308
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,952
你知道吗 你知道吗
You know what? You know what?

309
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,290
如果今天我们调换 
If things were the other way around, 

310
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,621
由你来列出我的缺点
there was nothing you could put on a list,

311
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,836
不管我感觉如何受伤 都不会让我 不想跟你在一起
that would ever make me not wanna be with you.

312
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:18,344
我猜那就是我们之间的差异
Well, then I guess that's the difference between us.

313
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,221
我是绝对不会列清单的
See, I'd never make a list.

314
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,237
我总是不懂遇到这种情况 
I never know how long you're supposed to wait 

315
00:18:38,237 --> 00:18:42,236
要等多久才能再开口说话
in this type of situation before you can talk again.

316
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,663
或许再等一会儿
Maybe a little longer.

317
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,637
这其中的一些食谱
Now, in some of these recipes, 

318
00:18:51,638 --> 00:18:53,420
用量可能不太寻常
the quantities may seem just a little unusual.

319
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,625
比如说椰子摩克力坚果棒
like these coconut Mockolate holiday nut bars,

320
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,919
我用四杯椰子粉和四杯碎坚果
I've indicated four cups of coconut and four cups of crushed nuts,

321
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,302
但只有一汤匙摩克力
and only one table spoon of Mockolate.

322
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,804
无所谓了      什么
Doesn't matter.        What?

323
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,313
我们的食品认证没有下来 
Our FDA approval didn't come through. 

324
00:19:10,314 --> 00:19:12,815
实验室老鼠出了问题 
Something about laboratory rats.

325
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,202
天哪 我很遗憾      
Oh gosh! I'm sorry.

326
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:18,480
是啊 不过 这是你的支票
Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check.

327
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,484
感谢你这么费心准备
Thank you for all the trouble you went through.

328
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:26,655
你在准备食谱时 没吃太多摩克力吧
Listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?

329
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,330
我是吃了一些
Well, I ate some.

330
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:32,413
哦 一些 那没关系 没有很多就好
Oh, some. That's fine. Some's fine. Some's not a lot.

331
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,790
你尿尿时没有灼热感吧
So it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?

332
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,894
喂
Hello.

333
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,179
嗨
Hi!

334
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,857
又是他吗
Is that him again?

335
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,363
告诉他 我本想去接电话 
Tell him I'd come to the phone,

336
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:59,771
但我的脚踝太重了 我走不动
but my ankles are weighing me down.

337
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,858
我想现在时机不对
Listen, I don't think this is the best time.

338
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,903
你能帮我一个忙吗
Look, can you do something for me?

339
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,117
可以啊 做什么
Sure. What?

340
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,706
好的
Okay.

341
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,666
可以
Alll right.

342
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,627
听音乐好吗
Music?

343
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,416
好啊      好的
 Sure.         Okay.

344
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,725
下一首是 罗斯要送给瑞秋的歌曲
The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross.

345
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:33,767
瑞秋 他想告诉你 他深感抱歉
Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did.

346
00:20:33,768 --> 00:20:36,658
他希望你能够原谅他
And he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.

347
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,927
看到你眼若冰霜
See the stones set in your eyes.  

348
00:20:40,928 --> 00:20:45,327
看到你浑身带刺
See the thorn twist in your side,

349
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:51,116
我会等你的
I'll wait for you.

350
00:20:54,518 --> 00:20:58,907
上天实在作弄人 
Sleight of hand and twist of fate.

351
00:20:58,908 --> 00:21:03,067
她就让我苦苦的等
On a bed of nails she makes me wait. 

352
00:21:03,068 --> 00:21:07,068
不论你是否在身旁 我会等的 
And I'll wait without you. 

353
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,204
我们刚接到瑞秋来电 
We've just gotten a call from Rachel. 

354
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:12,684
她告诉我们罗斯的恶行
And she told us what Ross did.

355
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,847
那真是令人发指 罗斯 如果你在听的话
It's pretty appalling. And, Ross, if you're listening,

356
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:19,142
我不想再播你的歌了
I don't wanna play your song anymore.

357
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:27,446
我们还是把时间 花在有希望的情侣身上
Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance?

358
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,481
艾佛瑞 蜜雪儿很抱歉用车撞你 
Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car. 

359
00:21:30,483 --> 00:21:32,371
她希望你们俩能够和好
And she hopes you two will work it out.

360
00:21:33,403 --> 00:21:44,663
我有一个房间 可以让你诉说心中的秘密
There's a room where I can go and tell my secrets to.

361
00:21:46,173 --> 00:22:04,588
在我的房间里
In my room.

362
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,070
嗨 谢谢你再度过来
Hi. Thanks for coming in again.

363
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,826
不客气 我没有良心 而且我需要现金
Oh, not at all. I have no morals, and I need the cash.

364
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,155
我好像在照镜子
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.

365
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,493
言归正传 这东西叫开心鱼
Anyway, they're called Fishtachios.

366
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,167
吃起来完全像开心果
Now, they taste exactly like pistachios.

367
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,674
但主要是用鱼肉重新压制的
But they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits.

368
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,656
来吧 尝尝看      好吧
Here, try one.        All right.        

369
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:32,708
你有什么过敏问题吗      猫毛
You're not allergic to anything?        Cat hair.      

370
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:33,909
喔 对不起
Oh, sorry.

371
00:22:34,363 --> 00:23:38,909
