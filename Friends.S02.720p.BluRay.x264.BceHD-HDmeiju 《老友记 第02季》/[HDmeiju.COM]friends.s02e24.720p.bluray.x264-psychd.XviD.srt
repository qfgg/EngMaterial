1
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,921
乔伊 试镜情况如何     非常好
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?        Incredible.

2
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,174
这回我见到导演了
I met the director this time.

3
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:08,705
而你们绝对想不到会是谁
And you'll never believe who it was.

4
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:09,752
谁
Who?

5
00:00:09,793 --> 00:00:11,583
好吧 给你们一条提示
All right. I'll give you one hint.

6
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:14,136
沃伦・比蒂
Warren Beatty.

7
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:15,341
哇
Wow!

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,976
但有件事情可能会成为小问题
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind of a problem. See...

9
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,634
我必须亲一个男人
I had to kiss this guy.

10
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,104
因为他帅得要命
Because he was just so darn cute?

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,121
不是 是试镜的一部分 
No, as part of the audition. 

12
00:00:26,122 --> 00:00:29,309
我试镜的角色是 男主角要亲的男人
See, I'm up for this part of this guy who the main guy kisses.

13
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:33,902
嘿 你是个演员 要我说你就认命吧 亲呗
Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and you do it.

14
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,327
或是你就吻好了
Or you just do it.

15
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,947
我吻了 我很专业的
I did do it. I'm a professional.

16
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,215
那还有什么问题        
So, what's the problem?         

17
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:46,419
那场戏拍完之后 比蒂先生走过来跟我说
See, after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,671
"好演技 差吻技"
"good actor, bad kisser"

19
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,290
你能相信吗 说我吻技差
Can you believe that? Me, not a good kisser.

20
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,999
这就像是说
That's like, like...

21
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,678
特蕾莎修女不是个好修女
Mother Teresa, not a good mother.

22
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,384
拜托 谁在乎那个家伙怎么想
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks, you know?

23
00:01:00,385 --> 00:01:02,892
沃伦・比蒂哪懂什么叫接吻
What does Warren Beatty know about kissing?

24

嘿 你的经纪人怎么说
Hey, what did your agent say?         

29
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,120
接吻这件事绝对是个问题
Yep. This kiss thing is definitely a problem.

30
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,332
比蒂先生周一要再看一次
Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday.

31
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:06,160
老天 我必须得搞清楚 问题到底出在哪儿
Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong.

32
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:09,933
好吧 你们哪个女生过来吻我
Oh, okay. One of you girls come over here and kiss me.

33
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,828
休想      想得真美
Forget it.        Yeah, right.

34
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,240
拜托 我需要帮助
Hey, come on. I need your help here.

35
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,361
好吧 我来 
All right. I'll do it. 

36
00:02:15,362 --> 00:02:17,751
我以前吻过他 再来一次也行
I kissed him before. I can do it again.

37
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,336
看到没 这才叫朋友
See this, huh? This is a friend.

38
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,263
来吧
Uh-huh. Let's go.

39
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,220
等一下 口香糖还在嘴里
Oh, wait. I have gum.

40
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,518
好了
Okay.

41
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,945
好 非常好 坚定又不失温柔
Good. Very good. Firm, but tender.

42
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,864
我会跟朋友推荐你
I'd recommend you to a friend.

43
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,867
那我就不知道问题到底在哪儿了 到底哪儿不对了
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?

44
00:02:43,906 --> 00:02:46,362
乔伊 或许你只是不习惯吻男人
Joey, you know, maybe you're just not used to kissing men.

45
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,715
也许你只是有点小紧张
You know? Maybe you just tensed up a little bit.

46
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,320
也许你要克服这一点
Maybe that's what you need to work on.

47
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,622
对呀 说得有理
Yeah, that makes sense.

48
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,517
除非我死了
Over my dead body.

49
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,925
我会用他的尸体当盾牌
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.

50
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,474
出来吧 亲爱的 你看起来美极了
Come on out, honey! I'm telling you, you look good!

51
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,561
说她美极了 说她美极了
Tell her she looks good. Tell her she looks good.

52
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,067
我的天哪
Oh my God!

53
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,455
你好美喔
You look so good!

54
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,828
我真不敢相信自己 要在两百人面前走上红毯
I cannot believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people,

55
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,130
而自己打扮得却像是 别人恶心想吐时喝的药水
looking like something you drink when you're nauseous.

56
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:41,178
那就别去了 搞不懂我们为什么非去不可
So don't. I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway.

57
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,386
反正是你前未婚夫的婚礼
It's your ex-fiancee's wedding.

58
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,839
因为我答应了敏蒂会去的
Because I promised Mindy I would.

59
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,892
你还答应巴瑞说会嫁给他呢
Yeah well, you promised Barry you'd marry him.

60
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,347
各位 我必须去 我是伴娘
You guys, I have to go. I'm the maid of honor.

61
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,753
除此之外
And besides you know what?

62
00:03:54,754 --> 00:03:57,510
我只是需要跟这些人再聚首时
I just need to be in a room again with these people...

63
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,770
对自己更有信心一点
and feel good about myself.

64
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:11,041
有人今天穿的还是昨天那身衣服
Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. 

65
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,392
看来有人有艳遇哦
Someone get a little action?

66
00:04:12,394 --> 00:04:13,529
没错 有这个可能
Yeah, I may have.

67
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,326
不错嘛 欲望小子
Whoo-hoo! Stud!

68
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,282
她长什么样子
What's she look like?        

69
00:04:17,283 --> 00:04:18,715
我们还没见过面呢
Well, we haven't actually met.

70
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,873
我们只是整晚在网上聊天
We just stayed up all night talking on the internet.

71
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,934
呜呼 怪胎
Whoo-hoo! Geek!

72
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,715
我喜欢她 我真的喜欢她
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl.

73
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,589
你们也知道 有时候我会有点自我保护和爱讽刺人 
You know how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy?

74
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,812
哪有      没有
Get out.        No. Please.

75
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,291
她很直接揭穿我
Well, she totally called me on it, okay? 

76
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:38,734
她说 省省吧 正经点儿
She said "Cut it out, get real."

77
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,402
于是我照做了
And I did.

78
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,777
哇
Wow!

79
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,151
那是什么样子
What's that like?

80
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,943
就像这样 我
It's like this, me.

81
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,365
不嬉皮笑脸
No jokes.

82
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,581
好吧 别这样 你吓到我了
All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.

83
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,334
没错 我不喜欢你这个样子
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way.

84
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,631
好了 晚点儿再见了
All right, I'll see you guys later.

85
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,497
再见 理查      再见
Bye, Richard.        Bye-bye.

86
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,882
再见 甜心 我爱你
Bye, sweetie. I love you.

87
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,675
我也爱你
I love you too.

88
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,594
我觉得我男朋友好棒哦
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy.

89
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,140
我想知道我的婚礼会是什么样的
I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.

90
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,943
说什么呢 什么婚礼
What are you talking about? What wedding?

91
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,020
少来 像是你们从没讨论过似的
Come on, like you never talk that?

92
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,513
没有 从来没有
No! Never!

93
00:05:26,514 --> 00:05:28,575
我们只是享受当下
I mean, we're just living in the moment.

94
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,281
就这么一次 感觉好极了
God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all 

95
00:05:31,282 --> 00:05:32,780
不用老想着"将来会怎么样" 
hung up on "Where is this going?"

96
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,116
害怕问他吧      怕得要命
Afraid to ask him?        Could not be more terrified.

97
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,161
我认为你们应该认真地考虑一下结婚这件事
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing.

98
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:43,169
再给瑞秋一次当泡泡糖公主的机会
Give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess "Bubble Yum".

99
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,886
小本在哪儿呢
Where's Benny?

100
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,885
在这儿呢
There he is.

101
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,515
小本在哪儿呢
Where's Benny?

102
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,513
在这儿呢
There he is!

103
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,510
这大概就是小宝宝要学说话的原因 
You know, that's probably why babies learn to talk. 

104
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:01,938
是要叫大人闭嘴
So they can tell grownups to cut it out.

105
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,941
有个问题想问你
Hey, you know I got a question for you.

106
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,348
小事而已 别有压力
Just a little thing, no pressure.

107
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,445
好
Okay!

108
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,746
你有没有想过将来
Do you ever, uh, like think about the future?

109
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,360
当然想过
Sure I do.

110
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,417
是吗 
Yeah? 

111
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,658
有我吗
Am I in it?

112
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,706
亲爱的
Honey,

113
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,366
你就是我的将来
you are it.

114
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,500
老天 你走大运了
Oh God! You're about to get so lucky.

115
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:27,967
没错
Yeah!

116
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,262
接着说      这个嘛      
Keep talking.        Well...

117
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:37,394
有时候 我想过要卖掉诊所
Sometimes I think about selling my practice.

118
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,356
我们可以搬去法国
We could move to France.

119
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,312
做法式吐司
Make French toast.

120
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,145
这么说
Okay, so...

121
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,846
我们在法国
we're in France and...

122
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,574
我们做吐司
we're making the toast.

123
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,586
你有没有在角落里看到个小摇篮
Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?

124
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,618
像个狗窝吗
Like a hound?

125
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,872
不是狗
Not a basset.

126
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,665
是婴儿摇篮
A bassinet.

127
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,171
你真想要个婴儿摇篮
You really need the bassinet?

128
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:12,592
我只是觉得 宝宝会从狗身上掉下来呀
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog.

129
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,448
我们的未来里 难道没有小孩吗
Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future?        

130
00:07:17,448 --> 00:07:19,148
噢 嘿
Oh! Hey!

131
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,766
我爱孩子
I love children.

132
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,855
我有孩子
I have children.

133
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,680
我只是不想等到七十岁 我们的孩子才刚上大学
But I just don't want to be seventy when our kids go off to college...

134
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,902
然后我们才开始自己的生活
And our life can finally start.

135
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:33,575
听着
Look,

136
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,003
我要你 
I want you... 

137
00:07:36,004 --> 00:07:36,907
就现在
now.

138
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,515
这样很好
That's great. 

139
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,951
其实也不用现在讨论这种事
You know we don't need to talk about this now.

140
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,413
真的 这是许久许久以后的事
Really. I mean, this is so, like, way way way in the future.

141
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:50,338
远得像是猿人接管了地球以后的事
I'm talking hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.

142
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,682
拜托 钱德 我真的很想得到这个角色
Come on, Chandler. I want this part so much.

143
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,810
只是一个吻而已 我不会告诉别人的
Just one kiss. I won't tell anyone.

144
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,142
乔伊 不行就是不行
Joey, no means no.

145
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,686
嘿
Hey!

146
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,220
不好意思 你的羊不在我们这里
I'm sorry, we don't have your sheep.

147
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,768
瑞秋 我觉得你看起来很可爱
Aw, Rach, I think you look cute.

148
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:21,122
而你 你
And you. You...

149
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,755
我真想咬你一口
You, I could eat you with a spoon.        

150
00:08:23,756 --> 00:08:25,703
离我远一点 说了不行了
Get away from me. I said no.

151
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,952
理查按门铃了 他在楼下等着
Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.

152
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:30,955
理查来了
Richard's here? 

153
00:08:30,956 --> 00:08:33,301
我应该下去 跟他道个别
I should run down, say goodbye to him.

154
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,761
再见      祝你们好运      
Bye.        Good luck.

155
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,298
你跟你的网络女友怎么样了
So, how's your date with your cyber-chick going?

156
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,799
那是什么
Ooh, hey, what is all that?

157
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,895
古根海姆博物馆的网站
Oh, it's a web site. It's the Guggenheim Museum.

158
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,227
她喜欢艺术
See, she likes art and...

159
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,154
我喜欢滑稽的字眼
I like funny words.

160
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:55,987
"握握"是什么意思
What does she mean by "HH"?

161
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,990
表示我们手牵着手
It means we're holding hands.

162
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,922
你真是太可爱了
Are you the cutest?

163
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,075
你说对了
I'm afraid I might just be.

164
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,238
你知道我觉得最棒的地方是什么吗
You know, what I think is so great that

165
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:11,031
你完全被这个人迷住了
you are totally into this person.

166
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,049
但你却又知道她可能
And yet for all you know she could be like...

167
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,886
90岁或是有两个脑袋 又或是
ninety years old, or have two heads or...

168
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,801
根本就是个男人
It could be a guy.

169
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,760
不是个男人 好不好 我了解她
Okay, it's not a guy, all right? I know her.

170
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,478
有可能是个大块头的男人
It could be like a big, giant guy.

171
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,337
可恶 就差那么一点点
Man, I got this close to him.

172
00:09:30,338 --> 00:09:32,778
摩妮卡从后面踹了我一脚
And Monica kneed me in the back.

173
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,612
你们在干嘛
What's going on?

174
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,782
我们在猜 钱德的女友是不是女生
We're wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.

175
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,905
那就问问她 她会活多久
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live.

176
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,744
女人比男人长寿
Women live longer than men.

177
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,901
你怎么没多摔两跤
How do you not fall down more?

178
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:53,039
这样好了 问她怎么避孕
Okay, ask her what is her method of birth control.

179
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,499
好吧
All right.

180
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,995
我老公跟他的秘书乱搞
"My husband is sleeping with his secretary."

181
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,849
她结婚了
She's married?

182
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,682
至少我们确定她是女人了
At least we know she's a woman.

183
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,807
真不敢相信她结婚了
I can't believe she's married.

184
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,227
兄弟 我很遗憾
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

185
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,610
你一定很难过
This must be really tough for you.

186
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,681
我那天看过一篇文章 
So, I read this article in the paper the other day,

187
00:10:23,682 --> 00:10:25,999
上面说婚礼上不该撒米
that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings.

188
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,912
因为鸽子吃米会死
Because when pigeons eat rice, it kills them.

189
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,711
难怪你不可能在寿司店看到鸽子
Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars.

190
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,000
瞧 我们这不是很开心吗      当然
See, we're having fun.        Oh, absolutely.

191
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,333
我甚至都没在想 我们不该想的那件事
Yeah, you know, I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not gonna think about.

192
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,634
我也是
Neither am I.

193
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,572
嗨      嗨
Hey, there.        Hi!

194
00:10:44,573 --> 00:10:45,717
你还好吗
Are you all right?

195
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:46,940
还好
Yeah. 

196
00:10:46,941 --> 00:10:47,862
我去洗手间的时候
But when I was in the bathroom

197
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:50,298
看到我结婚时爬出去的那扇窗子
I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding. And...

198
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:53,892
天啊 我开始觉得自己真不该来 不该来
God! I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know? I shouldn't.

199
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,857
大家会看着我
People are gonna be looking at me 

200
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:58,521
对我评头论足  还会想到上一次的事
and judging me and, and thinking about the last time...

201
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,155
亲爱的 不会有事的 这是个婚礼
Sweetie, it's gonna be okay, all right? It's a wedding.

202
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,417
一般来说 大家的焦点都在新娘身上
Generally, people focus on the bride.

203
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,286
我知道 你说的对
God! I know. You're right.

204
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,012
好了 大家都看我 很好 是时候了
Alright. Everybody look at me. Good. All right, it's time.

205
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:12,539
伴娘和迎宾员 请站成两列 谢谢
Bridesmaids and ushers, let's see two lines. Thank you.

206
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,288
仪式结束后见
Okay. I'll  see you after the thing.

207
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,088
好 祝你好运      谢谢 好啦
Okay. Good luck.        Thank you. Okay.

208
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,627
好啦
Okay!

209
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,811
你为什么不告诉我
Why the hell didn't you tell me!

210
00:11:30,812 --> 00:11:32,318
对不起 我不知道应该怎么做
I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?

211
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:35,354
站起来大喊 瑞秋 你的屁股露出来了
Stand up and shout, "Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!"

212
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,481
天哪 丢死人了
Oh my God! This is so humiliating.

213
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:41,374
我想唯一比这个还要丢脸的是  八年级时
I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade...

214
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,893
在全校面前唱"科巴卡巴那"
and I had to sing the"Copacabana" in front of the entire school.

215
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,597
我大概还没唱两句就被吓得逃之夭夭了 
I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out..

216
00:11:47,598 --> 00:11:49,750
我的天啊 我的人生在我眼前闪过
Oh my God! My entire life is flashing before my eyes.

217
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,863
瑞秋 我记得那一次 其实也没那么糟
Rach, hey look, I remember that. It wasn't so bad.

218
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:56,299
罗斯 你不用说好话给我听了 你已经追到我了
Oh Ross, would you stop? You got me. I'm dating you.

219
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,831
瑞秋
Rachel.

220
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,194
嗨 温伯格先生 嗨 温伯格太太
Hi, Mr. Weinberg. Hi, Mrs. Weinberg.

221
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:03,677
很高兴又见到你了 亲爱的
It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear.

222
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,257
老实说 我没想到会看到那么多 
In fact, I hardly expected to see so much.

223
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,987
你说你什么都没看到的
You told me you didn't see anything.        

224
00:12:10,988 --> 00:12:12,525
我跟你说的话多得去了
I tell you a lot of things.

225
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:17,592
真高兴又看到你出来走动了 亲爱的
Well, it's wonderful to have you up and about again, dear.

226
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,943
好好照顾自己
Stay well.

227
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:24,645
类似刚刚那种话 我今天已经听到三次了 
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.

228
00:12:24,705 --> 00:12:26,985
瑞秋 瑞秋       嗨
Rach! Rach!        Oh! Hi!

229
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,920
我的天啊 我结婚了      对啊
Oh my God, I'm married!        I know!

230
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,415
我是巴瑞・亨特・法巴尔夫人
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter-Farber.

231
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,580
我真以你为荣 敏
I am so proud of you, Min.

232
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:36,832
敏
Min.

233
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,422
瑞秋 你还在啊
Oh, Rach. Still here.

234
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,526
我们婚礼的这个时候 他们已经在打包收盘子了 
At our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.

235
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,882
是呀 有趣的故事
Yeah, I love that story.

236
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:48,464
我有个问题要问你们
I have a question for you guys.

237
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,684
为什么大家一直说 很高兴看到我出来走动
Why do people keep saying it's good to see me up and about?

238
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,763
你逃婚后
Well, after you ran out on your wedding,

239
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,191
巴瑞的父母跟大家说你
Barry's parents told people you were sort of...

240
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,563
疯了
insane.

241
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,159
疯了      
Insane?        

242
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,720
因为得了梅毒
From the syphilis.

243
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,106
什么
What?

244
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,087
对 
Yeah!

245
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:09,612
不然你要他们怎么说 说你不爱我了 怎么可能
What are they gonna say? You didn't love me anymore? Come on.

246
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,913
安琪拉
Angela?

247
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,498
乔伊・崔比亚尼
Joey Tribbiani.

248
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,499
是这样 
Listen... 

249
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,370
你今晚有事吗
what are you doing tonight?

250
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,214
我知道你在跟那个家伙交往 
I know you're seeing that guy. 

251
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:22,541
我在想或许你可以带他来
I was thinking maybe you could bring him...

252
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,043
喂 喂
Hello? Hello!

253
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,645
你不打算回她吗
Aren't you gonna answer her?

254
00:13:36,646 --> 00:13:39,224
她已经叮咚你第十次了
That's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent.

255
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,001
她想知道怎么了
She wants to know what's wrong.        

256
00:13:41,002 --> 00:13:44,487
怎么了 怎么了 你结婚了 这就是怎么了
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married! That's what's wrong!

257
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,194
天啊
Oh, my!

258
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:49,540
怎么了      
What?        

259
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,955
她想跟你见面
She wants to meet you in person.

260
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,294
菲比 我也想见她
Hey, look, Phoebe, I wanted to meet her in person too. Okay?

261
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:56,361
但是她结婚了 她有老公
But she's married. She has a husband.

262
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,818
如果她的老公注定是个错误 
What if the husband person is the wrong guy.

263
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:00,480
而你却是真命天子呢
And you are the right guy?

264
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:02,667
这种机会不常有的
You don't get chances like this all the time.

265
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,871
如果你现在不见她 到八十岁时 你会气得踢自己
If you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when you're eighty...

266
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,378
这个动作难度很高 你可能因此摔坏屁股
which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.

267
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,756
好吧 我去见她
Okay. I'll do it.

268
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,752
太好了 太好了
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! 

269
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,606
快穿上鞋 然后走出去见她
Go, man, go put on your shoes and march out there and meet her!

270
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:20,769
等等 天哪 你得先洗个澡 不然很臭
Oh, wait! God! No! Wait, you've got to take a shower because ew!

271
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,277
而我要
And I'll get the...

272
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,414
不对 你应该先回她 先回她
No! You have to answer her, answer her first.

273
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:28,652
不 不 你先煮咖啡 因为压力太大了
No, no, you know what? Make some coffee because it's too much.

274
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,702
再来一次 求你了
Okay, one more, please. 

275
00:14:34,703 --> 00:14:36,402
来嘛 这次一定行 一定
Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.

276
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,290
好吧 最后一次
Okay, last chance.

277
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,832
再一次 对不起
Again, I'm sorry.

278
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,203
知道吗 
You know what? 

279
00:14:51,604 --> 00:14:53,597
或许我不需要有孩子
Maybe I don't need to have children.

280
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,473
也许我之所以认为我需要 是因为这个社会
You know, maybe I just think I do because that is what society.

281
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,724
我说的社会就是指我妈
And by that I mean my mom,

282
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,300
老是向我灌输 说我
has always convinced me that I...

283
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,150
我要
I do.

284
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,032
我必须得有孩子 很抱歉 我就是想要
I have to have children. I'm sorry. I just do.

285
00:15:14,656 --> 00:15:16,592
各位看这里可以吗
Yo! Can I have your attention, please!

286
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,324
伴郎要敬酒了
Best man making a toast here.

287
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,787
谢谢
Thank you.

288
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:26,523
我记得巴瑞第一次跟瑞秋约会回来的时候 
I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel.

289
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,583
干嘛 
What? 

290
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:32,403
你请了同一个乐队 我就不能用同一个演讲稿
You hired the same band. I can't use the same speech?

291
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,264
谢谢 非常感谢
Thank you. Thank you very much.

292
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,351
总之 我希望你们两个
Anyway, I wish you both...

293
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,599
幸福美满地生活在一起
a wonderful life together.

294
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,142
瑞秋
And Rachel.

295
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,642
干嘛      不 不 不 我是非常认真的
What?        No, no, no, now in all seriousness.

296
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,770
没有多少女人有这个胆子 敢在今晚回来这里 
It's not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight.

297
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,906
更别说是光着屁股回来
And even fewer who would do it with their asses hanging out!

298
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,574
就这些了
That's it.

299
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,333
我想补充两句
I'd like to add something to that.

300
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,008
你要补充什么      没事的 没事的
What are you adding?        It's okay. It's okay.

301
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,663
多数人还不认识我
Most of you don't know me. 

302
00:16:07,664 --> 00:16:09,828
我是瑞秋的男朋友
I'm Rachel's boyfriend.

303
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:10,924
我的老天爷啊
Oh, dear God!

304
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,169
罗斯
Ross.

305
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,724
我想说的是
And I'd just like to say that...

306
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:20,219
瑞秋今晚能回来这里 的确是鼓起了很大的勇气
it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight.

307
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,762
而且我要郑重声明
And just for the record,

308
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,945
她不是因为梅毒才悔婚的
she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis.

309
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,862
你们干嘛呢 我是认真的
What are you doing? I'm serious.

310
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,232
之所以
The reason...

311
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,944
瑞秋会离开巴瑞 只是因为
she walked out on Barry is simply that...

312
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,700
她不爱他
she didn't love him.

313
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,582
因此意外地成全了我的美事
Which, incidentally, worked out pretty well for me.

314
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:52,007
干杯
Cheers.

315
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,674
我在停车场等你      别 瑞秋
See you in the parking lot.        No, Rach!

316
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,837
她再一次离开了
And once again, she is out of here!

317
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,060
谁赌了9点45分
Okay, who had 9:45? 

318
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,772
你知道吗 巴瑞
You know what, Bar? 

319
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:20,119
我不会走
I'm not gonna leave.

320
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,240
可能我应该走 但是我不走
I probably should, but I'm not.

321
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,793
因为我答应自己 至少要过完一次你的婚礼 
See 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least one of your weddings.

322
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:34,566
我今天想要的只不过是 
See now, tonight, all I really wanted was 

323
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:40,298
一点优雅跟尊严 来撑过今晚
to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity.

324
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,942
我猜
Well, I guess...

325
00:17:41,943 --> 00:17:44,685
大家也都认同 这种事是不可能发生的
we can all agree that's not gonna happen.

326
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,942
我猜  也没什么可多说的
I guess there's nothing really left to say...

327
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,227
除了
except...

328
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,737
她的名字叫萝拉
Her name was Lola.

329
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,535
她是歌舞女郎
She was a showgirl.

330
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,376
挂着黄色羽毛
With yellow feather...

331
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,420
头发上挂着羽毛
Feathers in her hair.

332
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,666
还有短到不行的裙子
And a dress cut down to there.

333
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,421
她会
She would...

334
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:17,885
梅伦格舞      梅伦格舞
Merengue.        Merengue.

335
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,261
谢谢你 亲爱的
Thank you, honey.

336
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,010
还会跳恰恰
And do the cha-cha.

337
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:26,845
她喜欢当明星的滋味 而托尼则是酒保
And while she'd like to be a star. Tony always tended bar.

338
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,141
等等
Wait, wait!

339
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,722
大家一起来
Everybody!

340
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,900
科巴卡巴那
Copacabana.

341
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,817
是哈瓦那北部最带劲的地方
The hottest spot north of Havana.

342
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,359
在科巴
At the Copa.

343
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,984
科巴卡巴那
Copacabana.

344
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:46,939
音乐与热情永远是科巴的主旋律
Music and passion were always in fashion at the Copa.

345
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,629
好吧
Okay.

346
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:55,585
我愿意
I'll do it.

347
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,249
愿意什么
You'll do what?

348
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,253
如果非得要孩子才能跟你在一起 那就生孩子吧
If kids is what it takes to be with you, then kids it is.

349
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,672
我的天啊
Oh my God.

350
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,383
如果非得这样 我可以重来一遍
If I have to, I'll do it all again.

351
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,844
我会早上四点起来喂奶
I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing.

352
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,975
我会去参加家长会
I'll go to the P.T.A. meetings.

353
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,102
我会当足球队教练
I'll coach the soccer team.

354
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,401
真的吗      没错 非得这样的话
Really?        Yeah, if I have to.

355
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:17,896
摩妮卡
Monica...

356
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,892
我不想失去你
I don't wanna lose you.

357
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,687
如果一定要重来一遍
So, if I have to do it all again,

358
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,117
那我愿意
then I will.

359
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,829
你是我见过的最棒的男人
You are the most wonderful man.

360
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,752
如果你没说那么多次
And if you hadn't of said...

361
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,673
"非得不可的话"
"If I have to", like seventeen times...

362
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,219
我一定会说 "好吧 我们生吧"
then I'd be saying "okay, let's do it."

363
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,892
但是你没有
But you're not.

364
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,592
天啊
Oh my God!

365
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:56,575
真不敢相信我就要这么说了
I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say.

366
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,531
我想要孩子
I wanna have a baby.

367
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:09,744
但我不想跟一个 并不真的想要孩子的人一起生
But I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.

368
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,618
天啊
God.

369
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,000
我爱你
I love you.

370
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,761
我知道
I know you do.

371
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,935
我也是
Me too.

372
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,690
那现在怎么办
So what now?

373
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,652
我们就
I guess we just...

374
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,197
一直跳下去
keep dancing.

375
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,909
她在哪儿 她在哪儿
Where is she? Where is she?

376
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,744
嘿 我有个问题
Oh, hey, I have a question.

377
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:06,754
她在哪儿
Where is she?

378
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,091
钱德 淡定 她会来的
Chandler, relax, Chandler. She'll be here.

379
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,543
她来了
Oh, oh, oh. That's her.

380
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,807
是啊 因为人生就是这么美好 
Yeah, because life's just that kind.

381
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,718
钱德 别再盯着门看了
Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door.

382
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,220
就像一个被盯着看的水壶
It's like a watched pot.

383
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,556
如果你一直盯着看 门永远不会开
You know, if you keep looking at it, the door's never gonna boil.

384
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,652
你必须试着不要去
I think what you have to do is try not to...

385
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,042
我的天
Oh my God!

386
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,005
我
Oh!

387
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,040
的
My!

388
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:44,921
天
God!

389
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,219
我
Oh!

390
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,428
的
My!

391
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,930
天
God!

392
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,527
好吧   
All right.

393
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,811
我一直觉得非常内疚
I've been feeling incredibly guilty,

394
00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:11,568
因为我想当个好朋友
because I wanna be a good friend.

395
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,800
该死 我是个好朋友
And damn it, I am a good friend. 

396
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,448
所以 闭上嘴 闭上眼睛 
So shut up and close your eyes.

397
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,781
你是个好朋友
You are a good friend.

398
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,550
试镜是今天早上 而我出局了
The audition was this morning, and I didn't get it.

399
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,712
但是这个吻很不错
But that was a hell of a kiss.

400
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,806
瑞秋很幸运
Rachel is a very lucky girl.
