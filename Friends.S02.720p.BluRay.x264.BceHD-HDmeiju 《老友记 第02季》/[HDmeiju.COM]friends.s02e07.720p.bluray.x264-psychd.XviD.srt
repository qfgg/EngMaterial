1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:06,165
我到底哪里有问题? 我看起来不够风趣吗?
Okay. What is it about me? Do I not look fun enough?

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,673
我到底哪里让人讨厌?
Is there something repellent about me?

3
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:11,583
派对好玩么?
How was the party?

4
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:15,175
糟透了 有个女人把我当空气一样穿过去
It couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me.

5
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,706
到底怎么了 我真的无可救药的不吸引人吗?
So, what is it? Am I hideously unattractive?

6
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,602
不 才怪 你非常有魅力
No, you are not. You are very attractive.

7
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,478
我也有过同样的经历
You know I go through the exact same thing.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,184
每次我变胖一点点 我就会开始质疑一切
Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everything.

9
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:30,986
哇哦
Whoa, whoa.

10
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,442
我变胖了?
I've put on a little weight?

11
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,986
你想不想?      是的
Did you want to...?        Yeah, uh...

12
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,800
不是变胖 是变得更稳重
No, not weight. You know, more like insulation.

13
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,709
钱德 我现在失业了 我迫切需要做点什么事儿
Chandler, I'm unemployed, indire need of a project.

14
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,211
你想锻炼吗? 我可以打造全新的你
Wanna work out? I can remake you.

15
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:52,091
我很想 但那样我就没时间懒散了
Uh, you know I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.

16
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:55,549
拜托      好啦 让她帮你!
Please?        Come on. Let her do it!

17
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,804
好吧 但穿上紧身衣之后
Okay, all right. But if we put on spandex...

18
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,967
如果我的胸部比你大 我就回家了
and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm going home.

19
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,647
你的胸部没问题 我真不该说这些 过来 过来
Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here!

20
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,313
两只手合抱不起来!
Ooh. Can't make hands meet!

怎么了?
What?

27
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,374
没事 只是以前从没看过你穿紧身裤
Nothing. Just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.

28
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:18,752
我去换衣服
And we're changing.

29
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,319
加油 再来五个      不!
Come on, give me five more!        No!

30
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:38,814
再来五个!      不要!
Five more!        Ugh. Aah!

31
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,404
再来五个我就给你看咪咪
Five more and I'll flash you.

32
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,988
一

00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,741
二
two

二点五
two and a half.

35
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,753
给我看一边吧
Okay. Just show me one of them.

36
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,680
她疯了 那女人疯了
She's insane! The woman is insane.

37
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,520
上班前 下班后 甚至上班时
It's before work, it's after work, and it's during work.

38
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,937
她要我在上班时在办公桌前做收臀运动
She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk.

39
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,114
现在他们都不给我送邮件了
And now they won't bring me my mail anymore.

40
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,613
菲比 和史考特约会怎么样?
Hey, Pheebs. How'd it go with Scott last night?

41
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:28,030
额 不错 带他去了一家很浪漫的餐厅
Oh urn, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restaurant

42
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,119
点了香槟 很好
ordered champagne. Nice.

43
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:34,082
还是没动静?      没 完全没动静
The guy still won't put out?        Nope. Zilch. Nothing. Uhuh.

44
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,834
抱歉 菲比
Sorry, Pheebs.

45
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,759
我不介意慢慢来 我很喜欢他
Well, look, I don't mind taking it slow. I like him a lot.

46
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,921
他很风趣 又很体贴
He's really interesting, and he's really sweet.

47
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,987
他为什么那么矜持呢!?
Why won't he give it up?

48
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,643
也许他是"另外一边的"
Maybe he, uh, drives his car on the other side of the road.

49
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,850
如果你懂我的意思
If you know what I mean.

50
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,525
不懂 什么意思? 他又不是英国人
No. What do you mean? He's not British.

51
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,800
或许他是同性恋
Maybe he's gay.

52
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,742
我觉得不是那个问题
Urn, no, I don't think that's the problem.

53
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,066
我们前几天去跳舞
cause we went, urn, dancing the other night

54
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:12,332
他紧紧抱住我的样子 他凝视我的眼睛的样子
and just the way he held me so close and the way he was looking into my eyes

55
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,868
我觉得他肯定对我有意思
I just definitely felt something.

56
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,503
但是眼神能看出什么呢?
Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?

57
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,630
不 我从屁股感觉到的 我知道
No, I felt it on my hip. I could tell.

58
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,712
哟 宾 二十分钟后去打壁球
Yo, Bing! Racquet ball in 20 minutes.

59
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:30,476
乔伊 行行好 把我的手抬起来给她一拳
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.

60
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:36,014
喔 瑞秋! 别看!      什么?
Ooh. Oh, Rachel! Don't look.        What?

61
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,238
拜托 我才不在乎 我今晚有约会
Come on, guys. I don't care. I have a date tonight.

62
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:43,734
哇 哇 哇 你有约会?      是的 摩妮卡介绍的
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You have a date?        Yeah. Monica's setting me up.

63
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,699
额 那罗斯和...
Heh, now, what about, uh, Ross and...

64
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,202
什么 我很爱乱吃醋的事?
What? My whole insane jealousy thing?

65
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,034
好吧 尽管这还挺有趣
Well, you know, as much fun as that was

66
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,816
我决定不再疯下去了
I've decided to opt for sanity.

67
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,660
你已经不介意了?
So you're okay about all this?

68
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,079
哦 当然 拜托! 我已经往前看了
Oh, yeah, come on! I'm moving on.

69
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:03,045
他想怎么将她压在那扇窗户上就怎么样吧
He can press her up against that window as much as he wants.

70
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,634
他都可以直接将她从窗户扔进来 我各种不介意
For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.

71
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,010
嗨 各位      嘿
Hi, guys.        Hey.

72
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:14,224
摩妮卡 我明早过来拿毛毛以前的猫玩具
Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow and pick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?

73
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,550
除非你说出他的全名
Only if you say his full name.

74
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:22,899
我明天是否能过来拿毛毛喵喵的猫玩具?
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?

75
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,696
好的      你要养猫?
All right.        You're getting a cat?

76
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,950
事实上 是我们要养
Actually, we're getting a cat.

77
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,785
一起?
Together?

78
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,072
你们俩? 一起?      是的
Both of you? Together?        Yup.

79
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,866
它一半时间和我住 一半时间和罗斯住
It'll live with Ross half the time and me half the time.

80
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,667
哦
Oh, well

81
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:43,298
真幸福 你们俩将可以享受
Isn't that just lovely? Ha. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy

82
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,959
这种幸福的感觉很长很长很长一段时间呢
for a really, really, really long time.

83
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,718
希望如此
Hopefully. Oh, wow.

84
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,381
哎呀 看 我得走了! 我要去约会呢!
Whoa! Look at that. I gotta go! I got a date!

85
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,972
和男人约会哈
With a man. Ahem, okay.

86
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,511
祝你们大家晚安
You guys have a really, uh, good night

87
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,603
祝你们俩找到一只很棒的猫
and you two have a, uh, really good cat. Heh.

88
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,356
顺手牵羊是不对的
Okay. We're not supposed to take these when we leave.

89
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:19,619
摩妮卡大概告诉过你 这是我离婚之后第一次约会
I don't know if Monica told you, but this the first date I've gone on since my divorce.

90
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,800
如果我看起来有点紧张
So if I seem a little nervous

91
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,000
事实上我是的
I am.

92
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,612
猫能活多久?
How long do cats live?

93
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,591
什么?      猫 通常能活几年?
I'm sorry.        Cats. How long do they live?

94
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,552
如果不是把它们丢到公共车底下的话?
Figuring you don't throw them under a bus or something?

95
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:40,439
额 大概十五 六年吧      好吧 那真棒
Urn, maybe 15, 16 years.        Well, that's just great.

96
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,441
干杯!
Urn. Cheers.

97
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,318
是啊 干杯!
Right. Clink. Heh.

98
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,738
摩妮卡把我吹得比本人可爱 是吧?
Monica told you I was cuter than this. Didn't she?

99
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,124
噢 不 麦可 和你没关系 只是...
Oh, no. Michael, it's not you. Sorry. It's just..

100
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:04,334
是这样的 可能听起来没那么糟糕
It's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds...

101
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:08,254
但我有个朋友和他的女朋友 正打算养一只猫
but this friend of mine is getting a cat with his girlfriend.

102
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,295
哦 那听起来确实...
Oh, that does sound...

103
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:16,012
他才刚开始和她交往
I mean he just started going out with her.

104
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,724
额 他是你前男友吗?
Ahem. Is this guy, uh, an old boyfriend?

105
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,566
他想的美!
Yeah, he wishes.

106
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,483
真抱歉 我真失礼
Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me.

107
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,524
麦可 咱们来聊聊你吧
Okay, Michael, let's talk about you.

108
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,613
好的      好的
All right.        Okay. Okay?

109
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,611
那么
So

110
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,408
你曾经和女友一起养过宠物吗?
Did you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?

111
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:46,129
我知道为什么了      什么?
So I figured it out.        What?

112
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,756
关于史考特不肯和我上床的原因
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me.

113
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,042
我不够性感
I'm not sexy enough.

114
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,632
菲比 太扯了
Heh, Phoebe, that's crazy.

115
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,423
我刚认识你时 你知道我怎么对钱德说的吗?
When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler?

116
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,809
我说 "前凸后翘 有看头"
I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."

117
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,602
真的吗? 你真好
Really? That's so sweet.

118
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:11,321
我是说我绝对被冒犯了 但那真体贴
I mean, I'm officially offended. But that's so sweet.

119
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,776
如果你真想知道实情 你得亲自问他
Look, if you wanna know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.

120
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,907
你说得对 没错
You're right. You're right.

121
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,447
你真棒
Ugh, you are so yum!

122
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:44,725
只不过是一只猫 你知道么? 一只猫
I mean it's a cat, you know? It's a cat.

123
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:49,609
他们为什么不养虫子? 养果蝇嘛
Why can't they get one of those bugs? You know, one of those fruit flies.

124
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:54,109
那种只活一天 叫什么来着的? 叫什么来着的?
Those things that live for a day. Something. What are they called? What are they called?

125
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,367
果蝇?      没错!
Fruit flies?        Yes!

126
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:58,944
谢谢你
Thank you.

127
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:02,663
你们要吃甜点吗?      不要! 不要甜点
Would you like any dessert?        No! No dessert.

128
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,033
请买单吧
Just the check. Please.

129
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,954
哦 不 你和我在一起不开心吧?
Oh, no. You're not having fun, are you?

130
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,963
不 不 我开心
No, no. I am.

131
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,050
因为刚刚一个半小时以来
But only because for last hour and a half

132
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,254
我脑袋里一直在回忆电影"餐馆"的情节
I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.

133
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,842
哦 我真是的
Oh. Look at me.

134
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,640
看看我
Look at me.

135
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,302
我正在和一个很棒的男人约会
Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy.

136
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:29,066
我心里却只想着罗斯和他的猫
All I can think about is Ross and his cat.

137
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,566
还有他的茱莉
and his Julie.

138
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,234
我只想忘了他 为什么我做不到呢?
I just want to get over him. God why can't I do that?

139
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,948
哦
Oh.

140
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,986
听着 我离过婚 相信我 你会没事的
Look, I've been through a divorce. Trust me, you're gonna be fine.

141
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:44,237
你现在看不出来是因为你和他还没了结
You can't see it now because you haven't had closure.

142
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,866
哈! 了结!
Aah! Closure!

143
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,411
就是那个! 那正是我需要的!
That's what it is. That's what I need.

144
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,375
老天 你真聪明!
God, you're brilliant!

145
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,002
为什么我没想到呢? 要怎么了结呢?
Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?

146
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,635
并没有一定的办法 只是
Well, there's no one way really, it's just

147
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,930
无论什么办法 只要能让你对他说
you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him

148
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,306
"我不在乎你了"
"I'm over you."

149
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,306
不在乎你了
Over you.

150
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,190
那才是关键
That's what it is.

151
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,943
了结
Closure.

152
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,276
嗨 对不起
Hello? Excuse me?

153
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,782

What?        Hi. I'm sorry.

156
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,744
我需要借你的电话 只要一分钟
I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.

157
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,205
我正在讲电话      我看得出来
I'm talking.        I can see that.

It's one phone call, I'll be very quick. I'll even pay for it myself.

159
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,792
你对你的电话有点诡异额
Okay, you're being a little weird about your phone.

160
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,784
好吧
All right. Fine.

161

00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,679
谢谢
Thank you.

163
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,974
好
Okay.

164

是答录机
Machine.

165
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,859
在等哔声      很好
Just waiting for the beep.        Good.

166

everything's fine. And I'm really happy for you

169
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,584
还有你的猫

170
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:20,215
哦对了 你应该给你的猫取名麦可
Who, by the way, I think you should name Michael.

171
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,514
你看 我连名字都想好了
And you know, you see there, I'm thinking of names.

172
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,098
所以明显我已经不在乎你了
So obviously I am over you.

我不在乎你了
I am over you.

174
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:37,774
那就是 我朋友说的所谓的"了结"

00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:09,935
所以他说他想等到他准备好定下来再说
So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be serious.

262
00:17:09,935 --> 00:17:11,190
哇哦      是的
Wow.        Yeah.

263
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:15,656
所以我说"好的 放轻松" 
So I said, "Okay. Relax, please." You know?

264
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:20,657
我是说 性可以只是两个人一时的感觉
I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment.

265
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,300
如果他想再和我约会 他就打电话
If he wants to see me again, he can call.

266
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,744
如果不想也没关系
And if not, that's fine too.

267
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:29,246
然后在我们谈了很久之后
So after a lot of talking, heh...

268
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,215
我说服他了 哈
I convinced him. Heh!

269
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:41,307
让我把这件事搞清楚 他让你去求他和你上床
Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him.

270
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,394
他让你自己说他再也不用打电话给你
He got you to say he never has to call you again.

271
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:48,894
他还让你认为这是个好主意?
And he got you thinking this is a great idea?

272
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,730
嗯哼
Uhhuh.

273
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,275
这人是我的偶像!
This man is my god.

274
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,408
晚安
Good night

275
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,458
嗨      我没领养猫
Hi.        I didn't get a cat.

276
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,546
哦 真有趣
Oh, that's, urn, interesting.

277
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:23,637
不 不 一点也不有趣 非常非常没趣
No. No, it's not interesting. Okay? It's very, very not interesting.

278
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,848
事实上百分之百是有趣的反面
It's actually a hundred percent completly the opposite of interesting.

279
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,354
我懂了 罗斯
I got it, Ross.

280
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,186
你无权告诉我你对我有过感觉
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.

281
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:35,186
什么?      在我发现之前我和茱莉过得好好的!
What?        I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.

282
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,234
在我发现你之前我也过的很好啊!
I was doing great before I found out about you!

283
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,899
你以为我看到你和茱莉在一起很好过么?
You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?

284
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,159
你在我遇见她之前就应该告诉我!
And then you should've said something before I met her.

285
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,618
我不知道啊! 那你怎么从来不跟我说呢?
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me?

286
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,406
因为总是没机会
There was never a good time.

287
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,998
你有一整年的时间 我们每晚都在一起混!
Right. You only had a year. And we only hung out every night!

288
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,163
不 不是
Not not not...

289
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,706
每个晚上
every night.

290
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,127
我不是没有尝试 有太多事情挡在中间
It's not like I didn't try. But you know, all things got in the way.

291
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,223
你知道 像意大利人
You know, like Italian guys

292
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,715
还有前任未婚夫...
or exfiance, or or or...

293
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,176
还有那些意大利男人
Italian guys.

294
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,599
只有一个意大利男人 你的重点是?
Hey. There was one Italian guy, okay? And do you even have a point?

295
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,610
重点是 我现在不需要这个
The point is, I, I don't need this right now!

296
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,566
好吧? 已经太迟了
Okay? It's, it's too late.

297
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,732
我在和别人交往 我很快乐 我这艘船已经出港了
I'm with somebody else. I'm happy. This ship has sailed!

298
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,925
那你是说不管你对我有什么感觉
Okay, what do you say is you're gonna put away feelings

299
00:19:22,925 --> 00:19:24,118
你打算就放在一边?
or whatever it was you felt for me?

300
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,995
我从初三就开始这么做了 我很擅长这个!
I've done it since ninth grade. I've gotten good at it.

301
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,623
好啊 你就继续这么做吧! 罗斯
All right, fine. You go ahead and do that all right, Ross.

302
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,159
我不需要你的蠢船!
I don't need your stupid ship!

303
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,123
很好      很好
Good.        Good!

304
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,205
还有你知道么 现在我已经了结了!
And you know what? Now I got closure!

305
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,056
试试最下面那个
Try the bottom one.

306
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:03,592
摩妮卡 现在是早上六点半
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.

307
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,379
我们不锻炼了 结束了
We're not working out. It's over.

308
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,465
不 只剩一磅了啊 拜托!
No way! With one pound to go? Come on!

309
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:13,261
我们运动 我们移动 我们在其中 我们在舞动
We're working, we're moving. We're in the zone, we're grooving

310
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,271
最后一磅我无所谓
Okay, I don't, I don't mind the last pound.

311
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,275
事实上我还有点喜欢这最后一磅
Okay, in fact I kind of like the last pound.

312
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,233
所以别让我做出我会后悔的事
So don't make me do anything that I'll regret.

313
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:27,404
你打算怎样啊 肥仔? 哈哈
Ha, oh, what you gonna do, fat boy, huh? Ha, ha.

314
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,818
怎样?
What? Heh.

315
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:35,166
没事 除了告诉你 你有这么多精力真棒
Nothing. Except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.

316
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,292
谢谢
Well. Thanks.

317
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,913
尤其是现在你找工作找的焦头烂额
Especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.

318
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,461
你知道
Well, you know. Heh.

319
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,834
是啊 我是说...
You know, I mean...

320
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:50,097
你不能告诉你爸妈你被开除了 因为他们会很失望
you can't tell your parents you were fired, because they'd be disappointed.

321
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:56,391
再说你现在又没男朋友让你有个肩膀可以哭
It's not as if you have a boyfriends shoulder to cry on.

322
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,898
是没错 不过我...      我是说...
Well, no. But I...        I mean...

323
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:03,899
如果换成是我 我一定每天起床都很困难
if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty getting out of bed at all.

324
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,946
你知道我试着保持乐观
You know, I try to stay positive.

325
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:14,659
所以
So you.

326
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,075
你还想去跑步吗?
You feel like going for a run?

327
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,087
好吧
All right.

328
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:27,503
你不用勉强 如果你想 你可以在这里睡个觉
Because you don't have to. If you wnat, you could just take a nap right here.

329
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,845
好吧
Okay.

330
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,342
就睡一会      好的
Just for a little while.        Okay.

331
00:22:35,393 --> 00:23:35,393
