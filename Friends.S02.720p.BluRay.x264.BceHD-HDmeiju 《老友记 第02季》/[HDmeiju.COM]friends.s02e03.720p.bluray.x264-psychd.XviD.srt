1
00:00:05,288 --> 00:00:06,999
嘿      嘿
Hey        Hey

2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,335
琼还好吗      跟她分手了
So how was Joan?        Broke up with her

3
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,916
哦 为什么
Oh, why?

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,878
别跟哥说是因为她鼻孔太大了
Don't tell me. Because of the big nostril thing?

5
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:16,843
真的超大
They were huge.

6
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,050
她打喷嚏的时候 蝙蝠都能飞出来
When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,852
得了吧 没那么大啦
Come on, they were not that huge.

8
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:27,050
真的 她仰头的时候 我都能看到她的脑子
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,060
你还要甩掉多少完美的异性
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,566
只是因为这些鸡毛蒜皮的事
over the most superficial insignificant things?

11
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,528
等等 这次我要站在钱德这一边
Hold it. Hold it. I mean, I gotta side with Chandler on this one.

12
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,323
我刚搬到这里的时候
When I first moved to the city

13
00:00:37,323 --> 00:00:38,623
我和一个女孩约会过几次
I went out a couple of times with this girl,

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,992
身材超棒 吻技超赞
really hot, great kisser...

15
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,374
可是 她的喉结超大
but, she had the biggest Adam's apple.

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,580
哥实在受不了了
It made me nuts.

17
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,797
你来还是我来      我来吧
You or me?        I got it.

18
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:54,050
乔伊 女人是没有喉结的
Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.

19
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,514
你们在耍我吧
You guys are messing with me, right?

20
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,310
对 没错
Yeah. We are.

21
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:12,065
这次不赖啊 差一点哥就上当了
That's a good one. For a second there, I was like, whoa!

22

26
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,617
那么，你说哪个女人
So, you name one woman

27
00:02:02,617 --> 00:02:05,817
是你以正常理由甩掉的
that you broke up with for an actual real reason.

28
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,495
玛琳摩丝拉
Maureen Rasillo.

29
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:11,374
她不讨厌雅尼可不算是正常理由
'Cause she doesn't hate Yanni is not a real reason.

30
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,383
你好 黑考斯先生
Hello, Mr.Heckles.

31
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,673
你们又来了
You're doing it again.

32
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,342
我们什么都没做啊
We're not doing anything.

33
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,516
你们在跺脚 吵到我的鸟了
You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.

34
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,937
你又没有养鸟
You don't have birds.

35
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,355
我当然可以养鸟
I could have birds.

36
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,731
好吧 我们会尽量小声      谢谢
Okay, Mr.Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.        Thank you.

37
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,522
我要回去享受我的晚宴了
I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.

38
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,115
好吧 拜拜
All right, bye-bye.

39
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,322
好吧 珍妮丝 就说珍妮丝好了
Okay, Janice, Janice. You gotta give me Janice.

40
00:02:45,422 --> 00:02:46,822
这总不能算挑三拣四了吧
That wasn't about being picky.

41
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,157
对，珍妮丝确实不算
Yeah, We'll give you Janice.

42
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,166
不过我挺怀念她的
I miss Janice, though.

43
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,487
"哈喽 钱德宾!"
"Hello, Chandler Bing!"

44
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,426
"我了个天啊!"
"Oh, my God!"

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,377
"噢 钱德"
"Oh Chandler"

46
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,300
"快! 快!"
"Now! Now!"

47
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,303
"就是这样"
"That's it."

48
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,602
"对! 再快点!"
"There! Faster!"

49
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,443
别拿扫帚捅我们了! 我们没有制造噪音!
Stop with the broom! We're not making noise!

50
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,620
我们赢了
We won.

51
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,327
我们真的赢了!      喔噢!
We do! We won!        Whoo!

52
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,123
哦不 黑考斯先生
Oh, Mr.Heckles.

53
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,755
这是怎么回事啊      当时他一定是在扫地
How did this happen?        He musta been sweepin'.

54
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,219
他们发现他的时候还拿着扫把
They found a broom in his hand.

55
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,386
噢 不 天呐
Oh, dear God.

56
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,058
太悲剧了      是啊
That's terrible.        I know.

57
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,435
昨天我也有扫地
I was sweeping yesterday.

58
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,441
搞不好我也会挂
It coulda been me.

59
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,194
是啊 扫地而已 真是没想到
Sure, sweeping. You never know.

60
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,567
世事难料啊
Never know.

61
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:10,035
好吧 虽然很微弱 但我还是感到他还在这栋楼里
Okay, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building.

62
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,538
奔向天堂吧 黑考斯先生
Go into the light, Mr.Heckles!

63
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,375
好了 菲比
Okay, Phoebe.

64
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,487
抱歉 不过有时候他们需要指引
I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help.

65
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,590
哦      又来了
Yeah.        Here we go.

66
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,263
没关系 你们尽管嘲笑我
That's fine, go ahead and scoff.

67
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,971
但是 这个世界上我也有很多东西不相信
But, you know, there're a lot of things out there I don't believe in

68
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,306
可并不代表它们不是真的
but that doesn't mean they're not true.

69
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,766
比如?
Such as?

70
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:38,601
比如麦田怪圈 百慕大三角 进化论
Like crop circles, or the Bermuda Triangle, or evolution.

71
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,602
喔噢 喔噢 喔噢
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

72
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,781
什么 你不相信进化论?
What, you don't... you don't believe in evolution?

73
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,278
是啊 不怎么信
No. Not really.

74
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,445
你不相信进化论?
You don't believe in evolution?

75
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,073
我不知道 只是...
I don't know. It's just, you know...

76
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,083
猴子啦 达尔文啦 故事是不赖
monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story.

77
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:58,000
我只是觉得有点儿太简单了
I just think it's a little too easy.

78
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,255
太简单? 太...
Too easy? Too...

79
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,929
地球上所有生物的进化过程
The process of every living thing on this planet

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,475
从单细胞生物开始千百万年的进化
evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms

81
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:12,925
太简单了?
is, is too easy?

82
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,262
对 我就是不相信这套理论
Yeah, I just don't buy it.

83
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:20,358
抱歉 进化论不在于你信或不信 菲比
Excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe.

84
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:24,442
进化论是科学事实 就像我们所呼吸的空气
Evolution is scientific fact, like, like the air we breathe

85
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,194
就像地心引力
like gravity.

86
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,692
别惹我开始谈地心引力
Okay,don't get me started on gravity.

87
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,706
你... 你不相信地心引力?
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?

88
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:41,167
好吧 我并不是完全不信
Well,it's not so much that, you know, like I don't believe in it.

89
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,294
只是我近来觉得...
You know, it's just... lately I get the feeling that...

90
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,673
我不是被引力拉住 而是被什么东西压住了
I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.

91
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,094
被压住?
Pushed?

92
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,112
啊哦 牛顿来了 而且他很火大
Uh-oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.

93
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:59,181
她在这儿 还有另外那个 就在那边
There she is. And over there, that's the other one.

94
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,893
这位是巴迪先生 黑考斯的律师 他要跟你们谈谈
This is Mr.Buddy Boyle, Heckles' attorney He'd like to talk to you.

95
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,569
我们能帮什么忙?
What can we do for you?

96
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,855
好了 孩子们 情况是这样
All right, kids, here's the deal.

97
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,066
根据我客户的遗嘱
According to my client's will

98
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:13,871
他想把他所有的资产留给
he wants to leave all his earthly possessions...

99
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,870
"住在我公寓上方吵人的女孩们"
to "The noisy girls in the apartment above mine."

100
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,539
他的家人呢?
What about his family?

101
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,245
他没有家人      噢
He didn't have any.        Whoa.

102
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,424
好吧 那我们来谈谈钱的问题
Okay, so let's talk money.

103
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,594
好吧 一个子儿都没有
All right, there was none.

104
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,621
现在 我们来签字
Now, let's talk signing.

105
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,888
你是吵闹女孩一号 你是吵闹女孩二号
You be noisy girl number one. You be noisy girl number two.

106
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,596
简直不敢相信 我们居然一直以为他痛恨我们
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us.

107
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,313
这真是不可思议 能对别人的一生有如此大的触动 
I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life

108
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,568
自己却浑然不觉?
without even knowing it?

109
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,270
你们看看这堆垃圾
Would you look at this dump?

110
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,776
他确实痛恨我们! 这是他的终极大复仇!
He hated us! This was his final revenge!

111
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,283
谁曾见过这么多垃圾!
Have you ever seen so much crap!

112
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:56,113
事实上 我认为这间公寓玷污了垃圾的美名
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap.

113
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,786
快看这个
Check this out.

114
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,290
这个可以给我吗?
Can I have this?

115
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,460
你怎么能不相信进化论?
How can you not believe in evolution?

116
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,427
我不知道 就是不信吧 瞧这件怪异的衬衫!
I don't know, just don't. Look at this funky shirt!

117
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,097
菲比 拜托 我整个成年生涯都在研究进化论
Pheebs, I've studied evolution my entire adult life. Okay?

118
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,642
我们从全球各地搜集化石
And I can tell you, we've collected fossils from all over the world

119
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,346
事实证明了不同物种的进化
that actually show the evolution of different species. Okay?

120
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,800
我是说 你真的可以看到这些物种
I mean, you can, you can literally see them

121
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,149
经历了时间的进化
evolving through time.

122
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,318
真的? 你真的看得到?
Really? You can actually see it?

123
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:36,153
千真万确 美国 中国 非洲 全世界都有
You bet! In the U.S., China, Africa, all over!

124
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,784
好吧 我原先不知道
See, I didn't know that.

125
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,492
行 现在知道了吧
Well, there you go.

126
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,084
哼
Huh.

127
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,237
真正的问题在于
So now the real question is,

128
00:07:45,237 --> 00:07:48,737
是谁把那些化石放在那里的 又是为了什么
who put those fossils there and why?

129
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:55,672
嘿 瞧这个 "我的牢骚大合集"
Hey, look at this, "My Big Book of Grievances"

130
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,843
嘿 那是我
Hey, there's me.

131
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,389
"4月17日 噪音过大"
"April 17th, excessive noise"

132
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,517
"意大利佬带了个妞儿回家
"Italian guy comes home with a date." Yeah.

133
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,693
钱德你看 也有你
Chandler, you're in here too.

134
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,529
"4月18日 噪音过大"
"April 18th, excessive noise"

135
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,488
"意大利佬的基佬室友带干洗衣物回家"
"Italian guy's gay roommate brings home dry cleaning."

136
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,205
真是太好了
Well,that's excellent.

137
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,878
摩妮卡 瞧这盏灯
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp.

138
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,547
这俗不俗气 这个我们一定要带回去
Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.

139
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,880
瑞秋 我想我们一般的灯已经够多了
Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.

140
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,261
什么? 拜托 我又不是
What? Oh, Come on,I mean it's not, it's not like

141
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,222
想要这个娃娃型的钟或什么的
I'm asking for this girlie clock or anything.

142
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,347
当然 我觉得这个也很酷
Which, by the way, I also think is really cool.

143
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,562
喂 这跟我的东西都不搭啊
Look, it doesn't go with any of my stuff.

144
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,185
那我的东西呢
Well, what about my stuff?

145
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,734
你什么东西都没有
You don't have any stuff.

146
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,404
你还是认为那是你一个人的公寓 对吧
You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?

147
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,200
呃 不是      是的 你还这么认为
Mmm... No.        Yes, you do.

148
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,000
你认为那是你一个人的公寓
You think of it as your apartment

149
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,742
我只是个租房的
and I'm just someone who rents a room.

150
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,031
呃...
Mmm...

151
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,000
好吧 你就继续支支吾吾吧
Okay, while you "Mmm" on that for awhile

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,050
我要找个地方放我的新台灯了
I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.

153
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,425
好 菲比 看到我是如何摆弄这些小玩意儿的吗?
Okay, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move?

154
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,999
相互对称的拇指!
Opposable thumbs!

155
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:25,137
若非进化论 你如何解释相互对称的拇指
Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?

156
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,979
也许外星舰长需要拇指才能驾驶他们的太空飞船
Maybe the Overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.

157
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,397
麻烦告诉我你是在开玩笑
Please tell me you're joking.

158
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:36,815
这样说好了 你相信某事但我不信
Look, can't we just say that you believe in something and I don't?

159
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,360
不 菲比 不可以 因为       有何不可?
No. No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok? Because...       Why not?

160
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,030
为什么非要每个人都认同你的看法
What is this obsessive need you have to make everybody agree with you?

161
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,044
到底是为什么 你知道我怎么想吗
No, what's that all about? You know what I think?

162
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:52,210
我想是时候你该好好检视下"罗斯"这个生物了
I think maybe it's time you put "Ross" under the microscope.

163
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,590
我的耳朵在喷血吗
Is there blood coming out of my ears?

164
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,888
快看快看 黑考斯的高中纪念册
Check it out, check it out, Heckles high school yearbook.

165
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,681
哇 他看起来很正常
Wow, he looks so normal.

166
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,889
他甚至有点可爱
He's even kind of cute.

167
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,395
"黑考斯 连自然课你都能让我开怀大笑"
"Heckles,you crack me up in science class."

168
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,685
"你是全校最逗的孩子"
"You're the funniest kid in school."

169
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,237
最逗的? 黑考斯?      上面是这么写的
Funniest? Heckles?        That's what it says.

170
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,738
黑考斯被选为班上的活宝 我也是
Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I.

171
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,908
他说得对 你们听听那噪音
He was right. Would you listen to that?

172
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,415
的确非常吵
I'd call that excessive.

173
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,371
哇哦      什么
Whoa.        What?

174
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,379
黑考斯在乐队吹竖笛 我也是
Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet.

175
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,132
他参加模型社 我也...
And he was in the scale modeler's club and I was...

176
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,469
虽然我们学校没有这个社 但是我真觉得模型很酷
well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.

177
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,221
所以你们两个都是书呆子
So? You were both dorks.

178
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,969
有什么大不了的?
Big deal?

179
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,136
我只是觉得很诡异 黑考斯与我...
I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me...

180
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,433
黑考斯与我 我...
Heckles and me, me...

181
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:50,934
我与黑考斯...
Me and Heckles...

182
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,649
嘿 你们别吵了行不行!
Hey, would you knock it off!

183
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,109
啊!
Ah!

184
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,453
你整晚都在这里?
Have you been here all night?

185
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,500
看看这个
Look at this.

186
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,045
所有跟黑考斯交往过的女人
Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with.

187
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,962
看看他写的 "薇薇安 太高"
Look what he wrote on them. "Vivian, too tall."

188
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,838
"玛斯 牙龈太露"
"Madge, big gums."

189
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,053
"太大声"
"Too loud."

190
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,476
"太聪明" "吃东西发出声音"
"Too smart." "Make snoise when she eats."

191
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,303
这 这就是我
This is, this is me.

192
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,396
这就是我的做法
This is what I do.

193
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,525
我会像他一样孤独终老
I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.

194
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,399
钱德 黑考斯是个神经病
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.

195
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,767
拜托 我们的人生轨迹是一样的
Our trains are on the same track, okay?

196
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,000
对 我是比他晚生30年
Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him

197
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,579
但终点都是一样的
but the stops are all the same.

198
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,160
苦逼镇...
Bitter Town...

199
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:49,163
孤独城 隐者村
Alone-ville, Hermit Junction!

200
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,084
好吧 知道我们该做什么吗 带你离开这里
All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here.

201
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,999
来吧 我请你吃早餐
Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.

202
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,988
要是我一直找不到另一半呢
What if I never find somebody?

203
00:11:56,988 --> 00:11:58,363
或者更糟 万一我已经找到了
Or even worse, what if I've found her

204
00:11:58,363 --> 00:12:02,211
但我却因为她的发音是"厚许"就把她甩了呢
but I dumped her because she pronounces it "supposably"?

205
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,923
钱德 好啦 你会找到另一半的
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.

206
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,049
你怎么知道
How do you know that? How?

207
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,931
我不知道 我只是想开导你
I don't know, I'm just trying to help you out.

208
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,930
看吧 你们将来都会离开我去结婚
You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married

209
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,602
而我会孤寂而终
and I'm gonna end up alone.

210
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,059
你能答应我一件事吗?
Will you promise me something?

211
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,612
等你结婚后 过节时能不能请我去你家
When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?

212
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,777
呃 我不知道到时候 我们在做什么
Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doing.

213
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,951
我是指 万一我们得去她爸妈家过节呢
I mean, what if we're over at her folks' place?

214
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,288
好吧 我了解
Yeah, I understand.

215
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,960
你可以过来看超级碗嘛
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl.

216
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,090
每年都来 好吗
Every year, all right?

217
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,637
我不要这样的下场
You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this.

218
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,764
待会儿见 老兄
I'll see you, man.

219
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,775
"厚许"
"Supposably"

220
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,946
"厚许"!
"Supposably"!

221
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,818
他们去动物园了吗
Did they go to the zoo?

222
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,238
"厚许"吧...
"Supposably"...

223
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,135
嗨 是我
Hi, it's me.

224
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:30,010
我 的 天 哪 ！
Oh, my God!

225
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,143
珍妮丝? 你打给了珍妮丝?
Janice? You called Janice?

226
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,975
对 珍妮丝
Yes, Janice.

227
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,144
你们很难理解吗
Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?

228
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,609
你还记得珍妮丝吧?
You remember Janice, right?

229
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,319
对 她聪明 漂亮 而且她真的很关心我
Yes, she was smart, she was pretty and she honestly cared about me.

230
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,239
珍妮丝是我最后的机会
Janice is my last chance to have somebody.

231
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,575
哈罗
Hello.

232
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,335
我 的 天 哪
Oh, my God!

233
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,425
天啊 她真是胖了不少
Jeez look how fat she got.

234
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,841
嘿 大伙儿都在!      嗨 珍妮丝
Hey it's everybody.        Hi, Janice.

235
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,300
珍妮丝 你已经...
Janice, you're...

236
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,507
是的 我有了
Yes, I am.

237
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,184
是不是...      是不是你的? 呵呵
Is it?        Is it yours? Ha!

238
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,474
少作梦了 钱德宾!
You wish, Chandler Bing.

239
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:22,104
我现在可是少妇了
You are looking at a married lady now.

240
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,483
噢
Oh.

241
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,110
是啊
Yeah.

242
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,614
恭喜你
Congratulations.

243
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,075
亲爱的 真抱歉
Aw, sweetie, I'm sorry.

244
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,361
你不能在电话上告诉我吗
You couldn't have told me about this over the phone?

245
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,581
要我错过你惊讶的表情? 才不要!
And what? Miss the expression on your face? Oh, no.

246
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,580
姑奶奶就喜欢找乐子
Janice likes to have her fun.

247
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,890
嘿 端秋 知道我们很久没玩什么了吗
Hey, Rache, you know what we haven't played in a while?

248
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,517
什么?      "把灯藏起来"
What?        "Hide the Lamp"

249
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,267
摩妮卡 算了吧
Hey, Monica, let it go.

250
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,440
你知道我对贝壳类过敏吗?
Did you know I'm allergic to shellfish?

251
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:06,736
那你只好去吃别的台灯了
Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.

252
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,483
啊哦 可怕的科学家来了
Uh-oh. Its scary scientist man.

253
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,904
好了 菲比 这些就是了
Okay, Phoebe, this is it.

254
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,834
在这手提箱中 我带来了真正的科学证据
In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts.

255
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,794
可以算是一整箱的证据
A briefcase of facts, if you will.

256
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:31,007
其中有些化石是超过两亿年之久的
Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.

257
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,468
听着 在你开始前 我先声明 我并不否定进化论
Okay, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, okay?

258
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,807
我只是认为进化论是其中的一种可能性
I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.

259
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,975
菲比 这是唯一的可能性
It's the only possibility, Phoebe.

260
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,597
好吧 罗斯 你能不能稍稍敞开心胸
Okay, Ross, could you just open your mind, like, this much? Okay?

261
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,737
曾几何时
Wasn't there a time

262
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:49,238
世界上最聪明的人不也相信地球是平的吗
when the brightest minds in the world believe the Earth was flat?

263
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,075
追溯到50年之前
And, up until like what, 50 years ago

264
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:54,075
你们还认为原子是最小的粒子
you all thought the atom was the smallest thing

265
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:58,037
直到科学家击碎了原子 才弄出了一大堆鬼玩意儿
until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out.

266
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,540
你现在却告诉我 你是如此难以置信的自大到
Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant

267
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:08,627
完全不肯承认有那么一点点一丢丢的可能性
that you can't admit that there's a teeny, tiny possibility

268
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,175
你们科学家可能是错误的?
that you could be wrong about this?

269
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,554
是有那么...
There might be...

270
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,686
一点点...
a teeny...

271
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,189
一丢丢的...
tiny...

272
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,476
可能性
possibility.

273
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,800
我真不敢相信你屈服了
I cant believe you caved.

274
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,702
什么?      你放弃了你的整个信仰
What?        You just abandoned your whole belief system!

275
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,370
之前我虽然不认同你 但至少我还尊敬你
I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you.

276
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,034
可是...
But...

277
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,712
明天你要怎样继续研究
How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow?

278
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,666
你要如何面对其他科学家
How, how are you going to face the other science guys?

279
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,718
你要如何面对你自己 噢...
How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh...

280
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,442
真欢乐 有谁饿了
That was fun. So who's hungry?

281
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,653
我
I am.

282
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,865
我也是 我去拿外套
Me too. Let me just get my coat.

283
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,877
出什么事了      没事
What happened?        Okay, all right.

284
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:28,665
这是意外 我发誓
It was an accident, I swear, all right?

285
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:32,836
我正在穿外套 那台灯 就破了
I was putting on my jacket and the thing and the lamp and it broke.

286
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:36,461
哦 拜托 摩妮卡! 你一向讨厌我的灯!
Oh, please, Monica! You've always hated my lamp!

287
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:40,931
而突然间 它就奇迹般地破了?
And now, all of a sudden, it's just magically, it's just broken?

288
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,391
菲比 你告诉她
Phoebe, tell her?

289
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,933
我没看到 因为我正在穿外套
Okay, I didn't see it, cuz I was putting on my jacket.

290
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,479
不过我想相信你
But uh, I want to believe you.

291
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:55,859
钱德 摩妮卡打破了我的贝壳台灯
Hey, Chandler, Monica just broke my seashell lamp.

292
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,569
真棒
Neat.

293
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,650
我会孤独终老!
I'm gonna die alone!

294
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,829
好吧 算你赢
Okay, you win.

295
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,328
钱德 你不会孤寂而终的啦
Chandler, you are not gonna die alone.

296
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,827
珍妮丝本来是我最有把握的 好吗?
Janice was my safety net, okay?

297
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,704
现在我只好去养条蛇了
And now I have to get a snake.

298
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,170
这又是为什么
Uh-huh. Why is that?

299
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,507
如果我会成为孤独的老头子 我就需要有个东西
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, Im gonna need a thing.

300
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,379
像是依靠
You know, a hook.

301
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,637
就像地铁上那个吃自己脸的家伙
Like that guy on the subway who eats his own face.

302
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,348
所以我想要成为"养蛇的疯老头"
So I figure I'll be "Crazy Man With A Snake"

303
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:27,846
惊蛇郎君
Crazy-Snake-Man.

304
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,098
然后我会弄更多的蛇 当成我的子女
Then I'll get more snakes, call them my babies

305
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,475
小孩都不敢经过我的门口
kids will walk past my place, they will run!

306
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,895
他们会尖叫 "快跑啊!惊蛇郎君来啦!"
"Run away from Crazy-Snake-Man!" they'll shout!

307
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,943
你得想开点
You've got to get over this, okay?

308
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:43,778
你不会孤苦伶仃的
You're not gonna end up alone.

309
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,576
我当然会
Of course lam.

310
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,576
我甩掉了所有疯狂到愿意跟我交往的女孩
I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me

311
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,458
然后我开始抱怨这世上根本没有好女孩
and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.

312
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,420
钱德 你所描述的
Chandler, you have just described

313
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:01,255
其实就跟我们交往过的所有男人一样
virtually every man that we've ever gone out with.

314
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,930
是啊
Yeah.

315
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,675
你不是异类 你只是个平常人
You are not a freak. You're a guy.

316
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:10,184
她说的没错 你和其他人没什么不同
She's right. She's right. You're no different than the rest of them.

317
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,602
等等 不 他不一样
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Yes he is.

318
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,855
你完全不同      很糟吗
You are totally different.        In a bad way?

319
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,853
不 亲爱的 是好的不一样
No, honey, in a wonderful way.

320
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,855
现在你知道自己要什么了
You know what you want now.

321
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,607
大部分的男人压根儿没明白
Most guys don't even have a clue.

322
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,157
你准备好承担风险了
You're ready to take risks

323
00:19:23,157 --> 00:19:25,657
准备好接受伤害了 愿意与人亲近了
you're ready to be vulnerable and intimate with someone.

324
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,446
对 你不会孤苦伶仃的
Yeah, you're not gonna end up alone.

325
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:33,837
钱德 你打给珍妮丝 这说明你渴望与人白头偕老
Chandler, you called Janice. That's how much you wanted to be with someone!

326
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,498
你做到了      你办到了
You've made it!        You're there!

327
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,130
你准备好做出承诺了
You are ready to make a commitment!

328
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,629
这我还不能确定
Whoa! Don't know about that.

329
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,140
看你拿了什么
Wow, what you got there?

330
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,478
又是个不属于你的 你又想摔坏的东西?
Something else that's not yours that you can break?

331
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,234
不是
No.

332
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:00,397
我知道你喜欢这个 我要你收下
Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it.

333
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,649
我想它在我们公寓里会很搭
I think it'll look good in our apartment.

334
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,659
谢谢你
Thank you.

335
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,326
没关系啦
That's fine.

336
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,665
嘿      嘿
Hey.        Hey.

337
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,378
知道了你们一定会很高兴 明晚我有个约会
Well, you'll all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night.

338
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,008
我的同事艾莉森 人很不错
This woman Allison from work, she is great.

339
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:25,380
她既漂亮又聪明 我一直...
She's pretty, she's smart, and I've been...

340
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,925
没约她出来 因为她有个...
holding off asking her out in the past, because she has a...

341
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,999
硕大无比的头
unusually large head.

342
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,228
但我再也不想因为这种事阻止我了
But I'm not going to let that stuff hang me up anymore.

343
00:20:36,228 --> 00:20:36,861
这才对嘛
All right.

344
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,613
看看我 成熟了
Look at me, I'm growing.

345
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,692
纪念册是不能回收的吧?
Hey, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?

346
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:44,694
这个我要了
I'll take that.

347
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,821
你要他的纪念册?
You want his yearbook?

348
00:20:46,821 --> 00:20:49,205
是啊 有人说了他的好话
Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him.

349
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:50,705
应该保管好
Somebody should have it.

350
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,373
天呐 这真的很奇怪
Gosh, this is so weird.

351
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,919
他的一生都在这间公寓里度过 现在人去楼空
I mean, his whole life was in this apartment， and now it'sgone.

352
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:02,549
我想我们应该为黑考斯先生默哀一会儿
You know, I think it'd be nice if we just took a few moments for Mr.Heckles.

353
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:07,471
他曾经确实是个挺麻烦的人 但他毕竟是位老先生
I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but he was a person.

354
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,096
怎么了
What?

355
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,930
你们全都会下地狱
You're all going to hell.

356
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,394
其实没那么大啦!
It's really not that big.

357
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,813
你要带走那个?      必须的
Taking that with you, huh?        Oh, yeah.

358
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,570
嘿 一起走吗
Hey, you coming?

359
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,326
嗯 待会儿
Yeah, in a second.

360
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,508
再见了 黑考斯先生
Goodbye, Mr.Heckles.

361
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,975
我们会尽量安静点
We'll try to keep it down.

362
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,525
我完全学无所用
Oh, My major was useless.

363
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:10,321
我是说
I mean

364
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:13,821
报纸上什么时候看得到 "征求哲学家"的
how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher Wanted"?

365
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,531
呵呵 是啊
Heh, heh. Sure.

366
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,950
尼玛 好大一个头!
My God, that's a big head!

367
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,714
办公室里看起来没这么大 也许是灯光的缘故
It didn't look this big in the office. Maybe it's the lighting.

368
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:27,126
我的头在公司一定像高尔夫球那么小
My head must look like a golf ball at work.

369
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,965
好吧 别管这些 
All right, don't get hung up on it.

370
00:22:29,965 --> 00:22:31,965
快点 列出你喜欢她的五点
Quick, quick. List five things you like about her.

371
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,224
笑容可掬 穿着有品
Nice smile, good dresser

372
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,932
大头 大头 还是大头!
Big head, big head, big head!

373
00:22:37,237 --> 00:22:56,396
