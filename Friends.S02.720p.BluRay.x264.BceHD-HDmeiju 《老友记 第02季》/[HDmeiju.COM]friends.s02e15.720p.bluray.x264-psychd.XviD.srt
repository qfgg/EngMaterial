1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,498
好了 不准偷看
All right, no peeking. No peeking.

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,537
不许偷看!
No peeking. No peeking!

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:11,550
好吧 不过我睁开眼睛时 你最好穿着衣服
All right, all right, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.

4
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,095
好了 睁开眼睛
All right. Open your eyes!

5
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:24,146
妈妈咪呀 我的老天
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.

6
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,103
不错吧 "我们的日子" 跟我续约了
Huh? "Days of Our Lives" picked up my option!

7
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,893
恭喜啊!      对啊!
Congratulations!        I know!

8
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:34,402
现在我们总算能像样地看 "绿色田野" 了
Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.

9
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:38,202
哪一张是我的
So uh, which one is mine?

10
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:42,240
你爱坐哪张就哪张
Whichever one you want, man, whichever one you want!

11
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,038
那张不行
Not that one.

12
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,210
噢 爽
Oh, yes!

13
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,881
噢 爽啊 这才叫生活
Oh, yeah! That's the stuff.

14
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,391

Do we dare?

15
00:00:59,258 --> 00:01:00,258

00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,689
真不敢相信两头牛做出这么大的牺牲
I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice

23
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,359
只是为了让你们翘起二郎腿来看电视
so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.

24
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,237
不 它们是椅子形状的牛
No, they were chair-shaped cows.

25
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,616
反正它们在野外也难逃贝爷之口
They never would have survived in the wild.

26
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:07,915
这屏幕太炫了
This screen is amazing.

27
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,169
迪克凡・戴克看起来跟真人一样大      对啊
I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.        Uh-huh

28
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:11,719
哇哦!
Woah!

29
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,008
萝丝・玛丽不该上这么大的屏幕 是吧
Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?

30
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:18,881
嗨 各位      嘿
Hi, you guys.        Hey.

So, uh, how was your day?

35
00:02:30,613 --> 00:02:34,777
和平时差不多 风和日丽 莺歌燕舞
Oh, you know, pretty much the usual, uh, sun shining, birds chirping.

36
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,152

Really? Mine too.

37

I gotta get to the museum.

44
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:58,800
喂 喂
Hey, yo.

45
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:01,764

Our first date.

48
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:08,476

Tonight, you're supposed to waitress for me? My catering thing?

51
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:19,362

Any of that trigger anything for you?        God, oh God, Monica. I forgot!

这是我们的第一次约会
This is our first date.

53
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,367
但这事是我妈帮我介绍的
Yes, but my mom got me this job.

54
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:23,950
我可以来当服务生 真的 我可以
Okay, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress!

56
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,699
真的吗 菲比 你得真的当服务生
Really, Pheebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress.

57
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,744
这不是像 "我可以办家庭酒会" 之类的
This can't be like your "I can be a bear cub" thing.

58
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,413
我可以当服务生 看好了
I can be a waitress. Okay, watch this.

是007!
It's James Bond!

62
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,564
抱歉来迟了
Sorry we're late.

63
00:04:00,764 --> 00:04:02,275
没关系 请进
Ah, that's okay. Come on in.

64
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:06,269
对不起 摩妮卡盖勒来不来 我听说她要来
Um, I'm sorry, is Monica Geller coming? I was told she was.

65
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:08,032
柏克医生 我就是
Dr.Burke, it's, it's me.

66
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,571
摩妮卡?
Monica?

67
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,581
天啊 你以前好...
My God! You used to be so...

68
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:15,419
我是说你... 你一定减了...
I mean, you... you, you, you must have lost like...

69
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,488
你漂亮极了
You look great.

70
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:20,791
谢啦
Thanks, thank you.

71
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,300
这是我朋友菲比 今晚她帮我
This is my friend Phoebe. She'll be helping me tonight.

72
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,674
菲比 幸会
Hi, Phoebe, nice to meet you.

73
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,519
近来如何
So how you been?

74
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:32,556
我很好 你呢
I've been great, just great. How have you been?

75
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,298
噢 你大概也知道我跟芭芭拉分手了
Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up

76
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:37,483
不然你不会来歪头那一招
otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.

77
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,983
歪头?
The head tilt?

78
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,361
对 自从离婚之后 当别人向我问好时
Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am

79
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,489
他们总是同情地歪着头问 "你好吗 不要紧吧"
it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. "How you doing? You okay?"

80
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,907
哦
Oh.

81
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,000
对不起
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,577
不 没关系 相信我 我也一样
No, no, it's, it's fine, believe me, I do it too.

83
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:54,458
我总是点头示意 "我没事"
I always answer with the "I'm okay" head bob. "I'm okay."

84
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,665
"你确定?" "对 我没事"
"You're sure?" "Yeah, I'm fine."

85
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,207
我得去放音乐了 我买了个新的CD换片机
Hey listen, I gotta set up the music. I got a new CD changer.

86
00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:03,755
当然了 离婚后我只剩四张CD可换了
Of course, the divorce only left me with four CDs to change.

87
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,545
噢      真惨
Oh.        That's too bad.

88
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,839
死不了的
I'll survive.

89
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,267
"沃德 反身上篮"
"Ward. With a reverse."

90
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,600
两份大的 都要多加起司
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both.

91
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,601
听着
But listen...

92
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,441
不要按19号的门铃
don't ring the buzzer for 19.

93
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,311
按20号 盖勒与葛林的门铃
Ring 20. GeIler/Green.

94
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,232
她们会开门的 懂?
They'll let you in, okay?

95
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,862
按我们的门铃就没小费
If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you.

96
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,573
好 谢了
Okay, thanks.

97
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,578
披萨马上就来 我说不用起来吧
Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.

98
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,915
如果要尿尿呢
What if we have to pee?

99
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,337
我来把汽水退了
I'll cancel the sodas.

100
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,388
你得进去 这是你的派对
You've got to get back out there. It's your party!

101
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,729
但是眼科医生都很无聊啊
But they're so dull, they're all ophthalmologists.

102
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,647
你不也是眼科医生
You're an ophthalmologist.

103
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:03,106
那只是因为我父母要我当医生 我本来想当警长的
Only because my parents wanted me to be. I wanted to be a sheriff.

104
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,360
呵呵 真好笑 白内衣 白内障 我懂了
Ha, ha, that's funny, no, Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it

105
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,654
待那儿别动!
But you stay out there!

106
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,221
看到没
You see?

107
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:13,832
好吧 这样
All right, I tell you what.

108
00:06:14,048 --> 00:06:17,457
五分钟后我来找你 就说烤肉霸出了问题
I'll come get you in five minutes with some sort of, um, kebab emergency.

109
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,707
好吧
Okay.

110
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,120
但愿管用
Ah. You better

111
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,375
壮士一去不复返
Oh, God, here we go.

112
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,503
嘿 要看他们发神经吗
Hey, want to see them go nuts?

113
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,334
看好了
Watch this.

114
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,507
谁要杯子
Who needs glasses?

115
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,155
你被迷晕了
You are so smitten.

116
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:40,188
我才没有
I am not!

117
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,308
你是只神魂颠倒的小猫咪
Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten.

118
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,143
噢
Oh.

119
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,519
你该约他出去      
You should ask him out.

120
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:47,753
柏克医生?
Dr.Burke?

121
00:06:47,753 --> 00:06:51,738
我可不这么想 我是说 他太成熟了
I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grownup.

122
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,612
那又怎样 你们两个彼此都有好感
So? You two are totally into each other.

123
00:06:55,612 --> 00:06:59,745
菲比 他是我爸妈的朋友 他差不多比我大二十岁
Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.

124
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,161
那你就再也不跟他见面了?
OK, so, what, you're just never gonna see him again?

125
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,753
也不能那么说
Not never.

126
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,208
我约他明天帮我检查眼睛
I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.

127
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,845
你不是才检查过吗
Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?

128
00:07:11,045 --> 00:07:12,554
是啊 但是 
Well yeah, but, you know, uh

129
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:17,754
27岁是个应该多注意眼睛的年龄
27 is a... dangerous eye age.

130
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,025
别这样嘛 我不是说这部电影不好看
C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie.

131
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:26,314
我的意思是 这有点
I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . .

132
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,853
难懂
hard to follow.

133
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,271
我说过会有字幕的
I told you there was going to be subtitles.

134
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,486
我知道
I know.

135
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,946
我只是不想 第一次约会戴着眼镜
I just didn't want to wear my glasses on our first date.

136
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,080
摩妮卡
Monica?

137
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,670
接吻的时候拜托不要喊出我妹妹的名字啊
It would really help when I'm kissing if you didn't shout my sister's name.

138
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,013
亲爱的 我只是在试探      噢
Honey, I'm just checking.        Oh.

139
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:00,347
摩妮卡      摩妮卡
Monica?        Mon?

140
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,878
摩妮卡
Monica?

141
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,837
怎么了
What?

142
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,634
怎么了      对不起
What?        I'm sorry.

143
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:37,550
天呐 真对不起 只是当你的手滑到我屁股上时
Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just, when you moved your hands down to my butt

144
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,809
我就想到 "喔噢! 罗斯在摸我屁股!"
it was like, "Whoa! Ross's hands are on my butt!"

145
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,219
抱歉
Sorry.

146
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,763
很好笑 为什么呢
And that's, that's funny. Why?

147
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,732
不 不好笑
Well, it's not, uh...

148
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,143
我是说 抱歉 我猜是有点紧张
I mean, I'm sorry. I guess I'm just nervous.

149
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,403
毕竟是你啊
I mean, it's you.

150
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:53,905
是我们啊      嗯
You know, it's us.        Mm.

151
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:58,193
我们在越过那条线 这是件大事
I mean we're crossing that line. It's sort of a big thing.

152
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,580
我知道 我只是不知道大到让你发笑
I, I know it's big. I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.

153
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,207
好啦
Okay.

154
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,006
好吧 我的手离你屁股还很远
Okay, my hands were nowhere near your butt.

155
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,843
我知道
I know, I know, I know, I know!

156
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,009
抱歉 我只是想到上次你的手在那儿游荡
I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry.

157
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,974
真是太抱歉了 好了 好了 这样 我保证会乖
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay, okay, look, woah, I promise.

158
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,448
我不会再笑了
I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore.

159
00:09:27,048 --> 00:09:28,285
好了 把你的手放回去
Okay, put your hands back there.

160
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:33,524
不 现在换我不行了 因为我觉得太不自然了
No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.

161
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,754
就摸半边
Just one cheek.

162
00:09:34,804 --> 00:09:37,216
不了 感觉没了
Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.

163
00:09:37,394 --> 00:09:39,430
把手伸出来 我自己贴上来
Alright, alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.

164
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,280
那可真 "浪漫"
That's romantic.

165
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,535
来吧 摸一下      不要
C'mon touch it.        No.

166
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,412
来嘛 捏一下        不
Oh, come on, squeeze it.        No!

167
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,698
揉呢      不要
Rub it?        No.

168
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,367
快点抓住老娘的屁股!
Oh, come on! Would you just grab my ass?

169
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,883
看 车子起火了
Wow, look at that, the car is on fire

170
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:02,140
但上面昂贵的烤漆
yet somehow its expensive paint job

171
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,640
在奇迹蜡的保护下完好无损
is protected by the Miracle Wax.

172
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,352
老兄 你脸上粘了个奇多
You got a Cheeto on your face, man.

173
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,486
谢了
Thanks.

174
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,611
嘿      嘿
Hey.        Hey.

175
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,074
你来这儿干嘛 不是要跟瑞秋出去吗
What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?

176
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,490
那是14个小时前的事
That was 14 hours ago.

177
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,752
结果如何
So how'd it go?

178
00:10:28,952 --> 00:10:29,617
怎么说呢
Oh...

179
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,629
听着 你们有没有过跟一个女孩亲热的时候
Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, fooling around with a girl

180
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,587
她却笑了起来
and, uh, she started laughing?

181
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:41,144
有啊 不过那是1982年
Yeah, but, uh, it was 1982

182
00:10:41,144 --> 00:10:44,424
哥的瀑布发型让她的下巴发痒
and my Flock of Seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.

183
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,095
她对你笑了?
She laughed at you?

184
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,852
嗯 从九年级的打字课开始我就在憧憬这一刻了
Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing.

185
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,483
我只是希望一切能完美
You know, and I just want it to be perfect

186
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,146
顺利...
and... right and...

187
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,253
激光束为什么不会穿透烤漆啊
Why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?

188
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,870
因为有了奇迹蜡      绝对是个奇迹
It's the Miracle Wax!        It certainly is a miracle.

189
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,655
嗨 伙计们      嘿

Hey.        Hi.

191
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,251

Listen, I was, um, thinking about...

192
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,958
听着 你们能大声点吗
Listen, can you guys uh, speak up?

193
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:17,124
你们那么小声 真的很难听清楚
It's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.

194
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,465
好吧 听我说
Okay, listen

195
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,676
昨晚的事我很抱歉 我真的很想补偿你
I'm sorry about last night, and I really want to make it up to you.

196
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,885
不 你不用补偿我...
No, you, you know, there's no need to make it up...

197
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:28,935
怎么个补偿法
How?

198
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:34,065
我在想 或许来顿浪漫的晚餐
Well, I was thinking maybe a, um, a romantic dinner

199
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,152
烛光 美酒
with, um, candles and wine.

200
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:40,860
或许 呃 回我那里
and then, uh, maybe going back to my place

201
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,581
来点甜点
for, um, dessert.

202
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,867
嗯
Hmm.

203
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,575
听起来...
That sounds...

204
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,410
很完美
I don't... perfect?

205
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,267
这怎么回事
What's this?

206
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,709

207
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,599
现在我要检查你的眼睛了

208
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,891
真的吗
Really?

209
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,054
对啊 我就是干这个的
Yeah, that's my job.

210
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,107

向下看
Look down.

212
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,275
张开眼睛 向下看
Now, open your eyes and look down.

213

00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,247
又是馆里找我 我可以...
It's the museum again, can I? Oh.

272
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,317
柏克医生亲过我一次
You know, Dr.Burke kissed me once.

273
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:25,917
什么时候
When?

274
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:30,381
7岁时我骑自行车 摔倒在他家门口
When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house

275
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,305
为了让我不哭 他在我这里亲了一下
and to stop me from crying, he kissed me right here.

276
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,492
你太幸福了
Oh, you are so lucky!

277
00:15:36,592 --> 00:15:37,592
那是
I know.

278
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:41,396
南方古猿不应该放在那个展区
Woah, woah, woah, australopithecus isn't supposed to be in that display.

279
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,306
不 不
No, no.

280
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:47,898
不 能人是能竖起来的 南方古猿从来都不能竖起来
No, no, Homo habilis was erect, australopithecus was never fully erect.

281
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,230
或许是他紧张了
Well, maybe he was nervous.

282
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,701
瞧瞧 我真不敢相信
Oh, look, I can't believe this.

283
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,459
能人根本还没学会使用工具
Homo habilis hasn't even learned how to use tools yet

284
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:04,077
他们竟然还把陶壶跟他放一起
and they've got him here wi, with clay pots.

285
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,920
不如直接给他个微波炉算了
Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave?

286
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,125
抱歉耽误了这么久
I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long.

287
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,785
这比我预期中还花时间 我们还是可以去吃晚餐的
You know, I, I, it's just, it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner

288
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:15,435
没关系的
It's okay, it's fine.

289
00:16:15,455 --> 00:16:16,385

Wow! Is that Michelle?        Yep.

292
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,532
高中毕业后就没见过她了
I've not seen her since high school graduation.

293
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,747
天呐 那天晚上她喝得很...
Oh my God, that night she got so dru...

294
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,497
带感儿
Motional.

295
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,212
她又要生了
You know, she's having another baby.

296
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,724
我以为她才生过
I thought she just had one.

297
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,417
不 亨利快两岁了
No no, Henry's almost 2.

298
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:56,380
他讲话啊什么的都会 看
And he's talking and everything. Here.

299
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:00,721
知道吗 前几天他告诉我 他喜欢我胜过他爷爷
You know, the other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa.

300
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:04,270
公平来说 他爷爷是酒鬼 但还是...
Now in all fairness, his other grandpa's a drunk, but still...

301
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,149
哎 你是爷爷辈的人了
Whoa, you're a grandpa.

302
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,312
是啊
Yeah.

303
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,115
我们疯了吗
Are we nuts here?

304
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,363
不知道 或许吧
I don't know, maybe.

305
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:27,411
我是说 我在和一个曾在他泳池里尿尿的男人约会
I mean, I'm dating a man whose pool I once peed in.

306
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,163
我不需要知道那么多
I didn't need to know that.

307
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,465
我猜21年是差太多了
I guess 21 years is a lot.

308
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,680
日啊 老子能喝酒的时候你才刚出生
I mean hell, I'm a whole person-who-can-drink older than you.

309
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,598
是啊
Yeah.

310
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,599

So...

311
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:52,485

So maybe we should just...        Yeah.

This really sucks.

316
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,374
可不是嘛
Yeah, it sure does.

317
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:28,521
我们不必现在就做决定 对吧
Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?

318
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,774
不 我们一点都不用急
No, no, there's no rush or anything.
