What are you guys doing?        Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.

00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,800
你们干嘛这么难过?
Why are you guys upset?

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,635
《老黄狗》是部非常欢快的电影
It's Old Yeller. It's a happy movie.

6
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,305

What?        What are you talking about?

7
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,765

菲比 结局呢?
Pheebs, what about the end?

10
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,608
老黄狗打败野狼 救了大家 大家都很快乐?
Oh when Yeller saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?

11
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:32,988
结局不是那样的
That's not the end.

12
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:37,071
那时我妈妈关掉电视说剧终
Yeah-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say "The end".

13
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,575
他得狂犬症那一段呢?
What about when he has rabies?

14
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,115
他没得狂犬症 他是有了宝宝
He doesn't have rabies. He has babies.

15
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,743
我妈妈是那么说的
That's what my mom said.

16
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:51,545
菲比 我想你妈妈不希望你看到接下来要发生的事
Uh, Phoebe I don't think she'd want you to see what's about to happen.

17
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,167
为什么? 接下来发生什么事了?
Why? What's about to happen?

18
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,174
我从没看过这部分
I've never seen this part.

19
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:59,385
嘿 崔维斯 你拿枪做什么?

你们怎么不问理查德呢?
Why don't you ask Richard?

48
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,613
理查德 如果你多了一张尼克队门票
Uh, Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game...

49

I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game?

57
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,422

He keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.

60
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,314

Richard's really nice. Uh, we just don't know him really well.

61
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,231
而且他很老
Plus, he's older

62
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,983
比一些人老

但比一些建筑物年轻
But, uh, younger than some buildings.

64
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,702
那又怎么了? 他年纪有点大 没什么大不了的
So what, he's a little older. Big deal.

65
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,492
他对我来说很重要
He's important to me.

66
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:13,253
如果你们问他 或许他会开捷豹跑车载你们去
If you ask him, he might take you in his Jag.

67
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,987
我们要怎么答应她
How do we say yes now...

68
00:04:18,987 --> 00:04:22,300
同时装作我们不是为了想搭跑车?
and make it seem like it's not just to ride in the cool car?

69
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,258
好吧 这可能有点难
Okay, this could be tough.

We'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.

72
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,268
你差点就成功了

73
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,860

I'm sorry you missed it, but I did tape it if you wanna see it.

82
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,390
我们已经知道了 上星期他就会这么做了
Uh we know. He already did it last week.

83
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,726
如果你想看的话 可以看我们的录影带
You can watch our tape if you want.

84
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:17,690
听着 我不敢相信 我错过所有的第一次
Ah, see, I don't believe this. I missed the first time of everything.

85
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,730
他第一次翻身和爬行
The first time he rolled over the first time he crawled.

86
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,863
还有什么? 他会说话了? 还是会开车了?
What else? Has he spoken? Is he driving?

87
00:05:23,863 --> 00:05:26,148
他有最喜欢的酒类饮料吗?
Does he have a favorite liqueur?

88

他就快会说话了
He is getting closer on the talking thing.

89
00:05:29,238 --> 00:05:32,541
他还不会说妈妈 可是有一次他说"也门"
He can't quite say "mama" yet,but once he said "Yemen."

90
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:36,375
我不知道 我厌倦了 总是在错过
See I don't know. I'm so sick of missing stuff.

91
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:40,166
我不只要陪他一天 我要陪他一整个周末
I want him for more than a day. I want him for a whole weekend.

92
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,375

真的吗? 我准备了一大套台词呢
Really? I had a whole speech prepared.

95
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,965
真可惜 那应该会很有趣
Oh, shoot, that would have been fun.

96
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,390
你们看到了吗?
Oh, look, did you just see that?

97
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,184
你们看到了吗? 他挥手了
Did you see? He just waved! He just waved!

98
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,690
他从来没挥过手
Hes never waved before!

99
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,147
啊 他挥过手的 太棒了
Yes, he has. Very good.

I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident

104
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,459
她说我妈妈不让我们看悲剧电影的结局
and she said my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies

105
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,382
不希望我们接触到痛苦与悲伤
to shield us from the pain and sadness.

106
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,176
知道吗? 就在她自杀前
You know, before she killed herself.

107
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,850
嘿      嘿

116
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,581

117
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,711
根本没看到他怎么把钱拿出来的
You never even saw the money.

118
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:07,112
钱德勒 谢谢你帮我们领位
Hey, Chandler thanks for showing us to our seats.

00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,612
他把我的钱拿走了
He kept my dollar

128
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,162

129
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,286
我们要去参观殖民时期的威廉斯堡
Ah, we're going to colonial Williamsburg.

130
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,237

They're a little behind the times in colonial Williamsburg.

133
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:52,550
好吧 我们最好在掉眼泪之前走了
Look,I better go before Mommy starts weeping.

134
00:07:53,238 --> 00:07:55,517
我们爱你      再见 妈咪
We love you.        Bye,Mommy.

135
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,303
好好玩吧
Have a good time.

136
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,426
好吧 小班
Okay, Ben.

137
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,684
罗斯      怎么了?
Ross.        Yeah?

138
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,890
快看
Look.

139
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,237
乔伊 你知道我们在这里能看到你吗?
Joey do you know we can see you from here?

140
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,780
为什么理查德这么做就是比我酷?
How come Richard looks cooler with one of these than me?

141
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:19,425
或许你得先把雪茄点着 再把铲子放下
You may wanna light it and lose the spatula.

142
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,704
那真的很可爱 你试着模仿理查德
It's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.

143
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,664
我不是在学他
Not like him, per Se.

144
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,425
只是不想跟他不一样
Just not unlike him.

145
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,237
他是之前叫钱德勒的那个艺术家
It's the artist formerly known as Chandler.

146
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,230
我是在尝试新造型
I'm just trying something here, you know?

147
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,140
为什么你不留胡子?
Why didn't you grow a mustache?

148
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,517
我们抓阄抓的
Oh, we flipped for it.

149
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,560
我抽到雪茄 他抽到胡子
I got the cigar he got the mustache.

150
00:08:51,613 --> 00:08:54,652
如果我们两个都留胡子 看起来会很像呆瓜
If we both grew them, we'd look like dorks.

151
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,193
你们真的不像呆瓜
You really sidestepped that land mine.

152
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,600
我答应理查德到楼下跟他碰面
I promised Richard we'd meet downstairs.

153
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,675
你们跟理查德出去?
You're meeting Richard?

154
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,665
游骑兵队比赛      他没跟你说吗?
Ranger game.        Didn't he tell you?

155
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:08,203
他说他要跟朋友出去 我不知道他是指你们
He said he was going out with the guys. I didn't know that was you.

156
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,587
你听到了吗?
You hear that?

157
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,753
我们是朋友      我们是朋友
Were the guys!        We're the guys!

158
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,863
他留胡子的样子 让我想起了西尔维亚阿姨?
With that mustache, he reminds me of Aunt Sylvia.

159
00:09:15,863 --> 00:09:17,004
没错
Thank you!

160
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,022
嗨 我们来了
Hi, we're visiting.

161
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,772
小班跟爸爸
It's Ben and his dada.

162
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,111
爸爸
Dada.

163
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,572
你会叫爸爸吗?
Can you say "dada"?

164
00:09:36,572 --> 00:09:40,497
我会告诉你的妈咪们你说了 你试试啊
I'm telling your mommies you said it,so you might as well.

165
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,078
运气不好?      没错
No luck, huh?        No.

166
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,534
刚刚我听到他说二
A while ago, I got a "seh" out of him...

167
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:49,662
我以为他是说二褓姆 可是…
which I thought might turn into "seh-condarycaregiver" but...

168
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,675
你能帮我抱抱他吗? 我得把包包放好
Would you, uh, hold him for a sec? I gotta take this off

169
00:09:55,675 --> 00:09:58,462
好的 没问题 
Oh, yeah, sure, okay.

170
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,510
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

171
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,644
我在抱小班
I'm holding Ben.

172
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,565
对 他是小宝宝 不是炸弹
Yeah. well, he's a baby, not a bomb.

173
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,609
好的
Okay.

174
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,566
像抱足球一样抱着他
Hold him like you'd hold a football.

175
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,611
我都是这样抱足球的
This is how I would hold a football.

176
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,026
来吧 好了
Here. Here. There we go.

177
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:25,573
抱歉 我不太会带小孩 我一直跟小孩没什么接触
Sorry, I'm not very good with babies. I haven't been around them.

178
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,908
我是说自从我一岁之后
I mean, you know, since I was one.

179
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,487
没关系 没什么大不了的      真的吗?
It's all right. No big deal.        Really?

180
00:10:30,487 --> 00:10:33,964
当然 我相信我们有孩子后 你会感觉不一样的
Yeah definitely, You'll feel different when it's our baby.

181
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,957
什么?      什么?
What?        What?

182
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,668
你想过那种事了?
You think about stuff like that?

183
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,595
对 我是说...
Uh, yeah. I mean...

184
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,815
事实上我想我们得生两个
Actually, I kind of think that well have two babies.

185
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,971
生两个?
Two babies?

186
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,425
对啊 一男一女
You know, a boy and a girl.

187
00:10:52,425 --> 00:10:55,818
我希望先有个女儿 小班才不会有竞争压力
Hopefully, the girl will come first, so Ben won't feel competitive.

188
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,398
之后呢?
Then what's gonna happen?

189
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,753
我们不想让孩子们在城市里生活 
We wont wanna raise kids in the city,

190
00:11:02,753 --> 00:11:05,050
所以我们会搬到史卡斯戴尔
so well move to Scarsdale.

191
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,113
我们会住得离我们的父母够远
We'll be far enough from our parents

192
00:11:09,113 --> 00:11:10,238
所以不用常常看到他们...
so we don't have to see them all the time...

193
00:11:10,238 --> 00:11:12,668
但又不算远 他们可以过来帮忙照看孩子
but close enough that they can babysit whenever we want.

194
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,425
对 我知道税率比拿索郡高
And yes, I know the taxes are a little higher than Nassau County...

195
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,334
但学区非常不错
but the school systems great.

196
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,881
那真的太棒了
Wow, that's great! Great!

197
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,721
好吧 你知道吗?
Okay, wow! You know what? Hmm?

198
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,848
我的休息时间结束了
I'm off my break now. So. uh...

199
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,730
来吧 你抱着他
Urn, here. You take this.

200
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,148
我要去帮客人倒咖啡
I'm gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee.

201
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,438
好吧
Okay.

202
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,652
好吧 我没拿咖啡壶
Look at that. I don't have a pot.

203
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,283
我没拿咖徘壶 或许我把咖啡壶放在家里
I don't have a pot. Maybe I've got one at home.

204
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,869
或是放在史卡斯戴尔了 那是门吗?
Or in Scarsdale. Hey, is that a door?

205
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,621
瑞秋
Rach.

206
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,441
嘿      菲比 怎么了?
Hey        Hey, Pheebs. What's happening?

207
00:11:55,441 --> 00:11:59,549
哦 杀人 癌症 足球队在安地斯山脉吃掉彼此
Oh, okay, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.

208
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,253
你看了电影?
You watched the movies?

209
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,093
这个世界是怎么了?
What is happening to the world?

210
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,468
我是说…不 因为ET离开了
I mean... No, no, because E.T. leaves...

211
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,345
洛基输了 夏洛特死了
and Rocky loses. Charlotte dies.

212
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,059
哪个夏洛特?
Charlotte who?

213
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,602
织网的那个 蜘珠夏洛特
With the web. The spider.

214
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,984
她死了 她生下宝宝后就死了
She dies. She has babies and dies.

215
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:21,737
就像是刚刚说完欢迎出院回家 然后他就死了
It's like "Welcome home from the hospital" Thud!

216
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,425
你想觉得开心点吗?
You wanna feel better?

217
00:12:24,425 --> 00:12:26,614
对      好吧
Yeah.        Okay

218
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,863
看这个
Here. Watch this.

219
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,703
《美好人生》 我听过这部电影
It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.

220
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,498
你一定会喜欢 片名就说明了一切
So you can't lose. It's there in the title.

221
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,416
剧情保证美好
Wonderfulness is baked right in.

222
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,378
我被《洋基之光》骗了
I fell for that with Pride of the Yankees.

223
00:12:40,378 --> 00:12:42,550
我以为电影描述洋基队的荣耀呢
I thought I'd see a film about Yankee pride.

224
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,712
结果主角得了卢格里克症
And boom! The guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.

225
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:51,719
主角就是卢格里克 你没发现吗?
Uh the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kind of see it coming?

226
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,348
看一下那部电影 它会让你恢复对人性的信心
Watch that. It'll restore all your faith in humanity.

227
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,229
嘿 大英雄 比赛时间
Hey, big guy. Game time.

228

嘿 马上到      有比赛?
Hey! Be right there!        There's a game?

229
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,611
对 我刚去买了戳戳棒
I just got my Pik-Up Stiks back from the shop.

230
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,735
有种放马过来
Bring your nerves of steel.

231
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,035
是篮球季后赛
It's the basketball playoffs.

232
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:17,753
我真的很高兴 但你不必看在我的面子上陪他们
Urn, I appreciate this, but you don't have to hang out with them for me.

233
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,454
他们有彼此的陪伴
They have each other

234
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,839
不 甜心 别担心
Oh, no, honey. I mean, don't worry.

235
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:26,409
我喜欢跟他们在一起 他们跟我其他的朋友不一样
I like hanging out with those guys, it's fun for me. They're different than my other friends.

236
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:27,425
他们不会一开口就说 
They don't start sentences with

237
00:13:27,425 --> 00:13:30,219
你知道谁在铲雪时死掉了吗?
"You know who just died shoveling snow?"

238
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,988
好吧 太棒了 快去吧
All right, that's great. Then just go.

239
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,206
尼克队加油 
Go Knicks!

240
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:37,934
是大学篮球季后赛
Uh it's the college playoffs.

241
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,706
那么瓦萨学院加油      他们没有晋级季后赛
 Then, go Vassar        Uh, they're not in it.

242
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:43,562
好吧 那么快去吧      好的
 Okay, then just go.        Okay.

243
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,655
为什么我觉得很困扰?
Ugh, why does this bother me so much?

244
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:51,699
我不是那种想每天24小时都黏在一起的人
I'm not one of those people who wants to spend 24 hours a day together.

245
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:52,878
当然
Sure.

246
00:13:52,878 --> 00:13:56,269
只是他的空闲时间不多 我该怎么办?
He just doesn't have much free time. What do I do?

247
00:13:56,269 --> 00:14:01,237
那重要吗?反正你会死掉 离婚或轰掉宠物的头
Does it matter? You'll just die or divorce or blow your pet's head off.

248
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,712
我也是
Me too!

249
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:09,345
瑞秋 我有个问题 理查德又跟男生们混在一起
Rachel, I got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.

250
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,471
罗斯做好一辈子的计划
Ross made plans for the century.

251
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:15,635
我要去看看杂志 或许里面提供了一些好方法
I'm gonna go read Cosmo. Maybe theres something helpful in it.

252
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,675
就算没有 我可以学着用剩下的圣诞节蜡烛
If not, I can learn how to do a bikini wax

253
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:20,599
做比基尼除毛蜡
with leftover Christmas candles.

254
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,526
好吧
Okay.

255
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,527
刚刚到底是怎么回事?
What happened back there?

256
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,522
我不知道 你来告诉我吧
I don't know. You tell me.

257
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,081
前一分钟我还像抱足球一样抱着小班
One minute I'm holding Ben like a football,

258
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:30,988
下一秒我就知道了我会有两个孩子
then next thing I know I've got two kids...

259
00:14:30,988 --> 00:14:33,661
住在史卡斯戴尔 抱怨税率问题
I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about taxes!

260
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,497
对不起 我会想很多事
Well, I'm sorry. I think about stuff.

261
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:40,539
我在工作 组合骨头 思绪开始奔腾
You're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.

262
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,376
你为未来二十年做计划 我们才开始交往六星期
You've planned out the next 20 years. We've dated for six weeks!

263
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,461
难道你没想过我们的未来吗?
You never think about our future?

264
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,760
对 我会想明天要到谁家过夜
I think about whose apartment well sleep at tomorrow...

265
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,092
下星期六要到哪里吃晚餐
and where we'll have dinner next Saturday!

266
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,848
我不会去想我们孩子的名字
I do not think about our children's names!

267
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,807
你知道我们孩子的名字?
You know what our children's names will be?

268
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:04,362
不 我看过一本书 里面有个女孩叫艾蜜莉
Ha ha. no. No, I mean, you know. I read a book, and there was a girl named Emily.

269
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,694
我觉得那会是个好名字
And I thought that might be good.

270
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,988
哪本书?
What was the book?

271
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,050
《儿童命名宝典》
The Big Book of Children's Names.

272
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,153
好吧 罗斯
Okay. Ross, Ross.

273
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,491
听我说
Okay, listen.

274
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,159
我们的关系非常好
What we have is amazing.

275
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,251
但我不要别人帮我决定人生
But I do not want everything decided for me!

276
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,036
我一直都过着那样的生活
I spent my whole life like that.

277
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,913
巴瑞跟我就是那样 所以我才会离开
It's what I had with Barry. Thats a reason I left.

278
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,083
现在我不想那样
I like not knowing right now.

279
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:32,300
抱歉吓到你了 但想跟我在一起 你就得接受
Sorry if that scares you, but if you wanna be with me, deal with that!

280
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,259
好吧      谢谢
 Okay fine!        Thank you

281
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,800
我还没有说完      我不知道
 We're not done!        I didn't know that.

282
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:41,738
跟你在一起的男人 一直在计划他跟你的未来
You're with a guy who wont stop planning his future with you.

283
00:15:41,738 --> 00:15:43,753
他知道我们一定会在一起
He knows we'll end up together.

284
00:15:43,753 --> 00:15:46,814
如果那吓到你了 你必须接受
If that scares you, tough! You'll have to deal with that.

285
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,979
我会的      很好 因为我爱你
 l will!        Good, because I love you!

286
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,738
是吗? 我也爱你
Oh, yeah? I love you too!

287
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,149
那是我们第一次那么说      对
 That's the first time we've said that!        Yes.

288
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,818
我要吻你      快来吧
 I'm gonna kiss you!        You better!

289
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,580
嘿      嘿
 Hey.        Hey.

290
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,335
谢谢你推荐的电影
Oh, thanks for the great movie tip.

291
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,417
你喜欢吗?      对
 Did you like it?        Oh, yeah.

292
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:11,176
我不知道我比较喜欢乔治・巴里毁了家族企业
I don't know if I was happier when George Bailey destroyed the business...

293
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:15,800
还是唐娜・里德哭泣 或药剂师害他的耳朵流血
or, urn, Donna Reed cried or when the pharmacist made his ear bleed.

294
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:20,237
我能了解你不喜欢耳朵那一段 但结局不是很棒吗?
I'II give you the ear thing, but wasn't the ending wonderful?

295
00:16:20,237 --> 00:16:22,675
我没看完 我太沮丧了
I didn't watch it. I was too depressed.

296
00:16:22,675 --> 00:16:25,300
剧情越来越可怕 它应该叫:
It kept getting worse! It should've been called:

297
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,356
《去他的鬼人生 你不会相信人生就是这么惨》
"It's a Sucky Life, And Just When You Think It Can'tSuck Anymore, It Does!"

298
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,526
踢球 救球 还有…
Kick. save! And...

299
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,024
挡球
denied!

300
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,119
他接到球 越过中线 带球
He gets it back. Pass to the middle lines it up and barn!

301
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:40,951
太棒了
Yes!

302
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,288
那一球进得很漂亮吧?
Could that shot be any prettier?

303
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,494
天啊 你真的太厉害了
Man, you are incredible.

304
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,458
念大学时我们就玩这个
We had a table in college.

305
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:51,841
真的吗? 我不知道19世纪80年代就有这个
Oh, really? I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800s.

306
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:56,363
很不错的胡子 到了青春期后你的胡子会变多
Nice mustache. At puberty, that thing will really kick in.

307
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,471
甜心 我知道这很煞风景 但晚餐准备好了
Not to sound too Florence Henderson, but dinner's on the table.

308
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,767
再一分就好
One more point.

309
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,063
得分
Score

310
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,195
可以走了吗?
 Now can we go?

311
00:17:13,394 --> 00:17:15,899
所以我们才不让她玩
Uh-That's why we don't let her play.

312
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,868
没事吧?
 Is everything all right?

313
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,699
别生他的气 那都是我们的错
Oh, hey, don't be mad at him. It's our fault.

314
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,868
抱歉我们一直拉着他
I'm sorry we've been hogging his time.

315
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,211
跟他在一起真的很好玩
Hes just really great to hang out with.

316
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,622
那个嘛      不 真的
 Well        No, seriously.

317
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,338
我们谈过这个 他比我们的爸爸酷多了
We just talked about this. He is so much cooler than our dads.

318
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,925
我们的爸爸还不错 但理查德是...
Our dads are okay and all, but Richard is just...

319
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,503
你干嘛踢我?
What are you kicking me for?

320
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:45,974
我在说话
Huh? I'm trying to talk here.

321
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,358
你们把我当成长辈?
Uh, you guys see me as a dad?

322
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,314
对      不是!
 Oh, yeah.        No!

323
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,649
不是
No.

324
00:17:56,117 --> 00:18:00,235
显然你不了解年轻人的用词
You're just clearly not familiar with our young persons' vernacular

325
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,829
我们说爸爸 事实上是指 好兄弟
When we say "dad" we mean "buddy".

326
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,532
我们是说好朋友      对
 We mean"pal".        Uh-huh, yeah.

327
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,373
这是真的 乔伊是我爸
No, seriously. Joey's my dad.

328
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,089
摩妮卡是我爸
Monica's my dad.

329
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,335
我在公司里还有一些爸爸
I've even got some dads down at work.

330
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,798
那真的不错
That's fine.

331
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:23,307
你们的另一个爸爸跟我要一起度过浪漫夜晚
Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening.

332
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,597
后会有期
I'll just see you kids around.

333
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,140
晚安
Nighty-night.

334
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:30,227
你不是爸爸      你不是爸爸
You're not a dad!        You're not a dad!

335
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,642
我不敢相信你害我们惹上麻烦
I cant believe you got us into trouble.

336
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,740
你还好吗?
So are you okay?

337
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,901
没事
Yeah.

338
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,114
我只是…
Just...

339
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,829
我觉得自己像是有一百岁了
I feel like I'm about a hundred.

340
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,166
我以为我跟他们一样年轻
I thought I was just one of the guys.

341
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:50,960
过来
Come here.

342
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,046
我会让你变年轻
I'll make you feel like one of the guys.

343
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,922
就一个酷男人来说 你的桌上足球技巧逊呆了
For a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.

344
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,845
你在说什么? 我痛宰他们
I was killing them.

345
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,261
对 他们也很逊
 Yeah, well they suck too.

346
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:15,017
将便便尿布放在便便尿布桶里
You take the poopy diaper and put it in the poopy diaper pail.

347
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,987
叫它便便尿布也不会让这个显得可爱
Calling it a "poopy diaper" doesn't make this process any cuter.

348
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,155
谁啊?      我们回来了
 Hello?        It's us.

349
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,365
快上来
Come on up.

350
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,200
我去帮他收拾东西
I'll get his stuff together

351
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,753
好吧 现在我们可以那么做 对吧? 小班
Okay, we can do this now, can't we Ben?

352
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,413
对 我们可以的
Yes, we can.

353
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,912
对 我们可以的
Yes we can.

354
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,874
好了 我办到了
There! I did it!

355
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,376
哈哈 我办到了
Ha. ha. I did it!

356
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,300
看吧
Ooh, look at that!

357
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,806
完全没有掉下来
Oh, it stays on and everything.

358
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,721
嗨      嗨
 Hi.        Hi.

359
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,484
对不起  你说什么? 你说嗨吗?
I'm sorry. What did you just say? Did you just say "hi"?

360
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,529
天啊 罗斯 小班刚刚说嗨
Oh, my God! Ross? Ben just said hi!

361
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,064
什么?      小班说 嗨
 What?        Ben just said "hi"!

362
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,781
什么? 他说嗨?
What, the word"hi"?

363
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,783
不 他在叫海叔
No, my Uncle Hi.

364
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,746
太棒了 我又错过了 我错过了一切
Great! And I missed that too. I miss everything!

365
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,833
对不起 我只是逗他说话了
Oh I'm sorry. I guess I just bring it out in him.

366
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,877
他在哪里?      我们想你
 Where is he?        We missed you.

367
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,624
我们好想你 快过来 小班
We missed you so much! Come here, Ben, ha, ha.

368
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,612
你们猜怎么了? 小班说了第一个字
Guess what? Ben just said his first word.

369
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:24,344
他说什么?
What did he say?

370
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,051
他说嗨
Something about hi.

371
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:30,771
真令人兴奋 妈咪为你骄傲
That's so exciting! Mommy's so proud of you!

372
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,012
嗨?
Hi. Hi?

373
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,550
比较像是嗨
You know, actually, its more like, hi!

374
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:40,778
嗨      嗨
 Hi?        Hi.

375
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,688
这可能得花点时间
This could go on for a while.

376
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,858
你说得对 出租车还在等我们
You're right. We've got a cab waiting.

377
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,863
这真的很有趣
Well, this was fun.

378
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,029
我们下次再来玩吧 小班 你觉得如何?
We should do it again sometime, Ben. What do you say?

379
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,242
好的
Okay.

380
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,079
好吧 我何时能去接他?      星期二
 All right, so l've got him?        Tuesday.

381
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,413
大家再见
Bye, you guys.

382
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,294
保重      再见 小班
Take care.        Bye, Ben.

383
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,376
再见
Bye.

384
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,759
他说再见吗?
Did he just say "bye"?

385
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,089
他说再见了
He said bye!

386
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,303
你说 他跟我说再见
You said He said bye to me!

387
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,423
对 没错
 Yes, he did!

388
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,264
突然间我有种他要去念大学的感觉
Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college!

389
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,306
我们得走了 出租车还在楼下等着呢
We've gotta go. We've got that cab downstairs.

390
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,561
再见
See you later

391
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,318
再见      再见

392
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,485

 Bye.        Bye.

393
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,524
再见
Bye.

394
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:40,288
哇 看看我挖的这个大洞 柏特
Wow. Look at this nice deep hole I dug. Hey Bert.

395
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,707

我想我们应该可以应付
