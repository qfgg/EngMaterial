1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,547
无法摆脱工作的压力吗
Can't get the monkey off your back?

2
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,007
那就把它放进嘴里吧
Then put it in your mouth.

3
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:16,930
来杯猴子乐啤酒
with Monkeyshine Beer!

4
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,724
喝吧 猴子乐
Get it, monkey!

5
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,761
喝吧 猴子乐
Get it, monkey!

6
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:26,273
猴子乐 猴子乐
Monkey! Monkey!

7
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,853
猴子乐啤酒
Monkeyshine Beer.

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,269
因为外面是一片丛林
Because it's a jungle out there!

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,401
每次看到这个广告 我就很难过
That commercial always makes me so sad.

10
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,300
是呀 可是那个男的一打开啤酒
Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,905
女人就对他投怀送抱
and those girls run at him.

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,070
所以结局看起来还不错
So everything seems to work out okay.

13
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,498
我的意思是 那只猴子让我想起了马塞尔
I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.

14
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:43,828
我了解
I can see that.

15
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:48,879
因为他们都有一对棕色的大眼睛跟一个翘下巴
Because they both have those big brown eyes and y'know, the little pouty chin.

16
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,711
而且他们都是猴子
And the fact that they're both monkeys?

17
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,385
有时我会想知道 把他送走到底是对还是错
Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, you know, giving him away.

18
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:56,675
罗斯 你必须把他送走
Oh, Ross, you had to,

19
00:00:56,675 --> 00:00:59,595
他能看见的东西都被他侵犯了
I mean, he was humping everything in sight.

20
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,503
害我的马里布芭比娃娃 
I mean I have a Malibu Barbie

21
00:01:01,503 --> 00:01:03,723
结婚再也不能穿白色的婚纱了
who will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.

22
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,724
还记得他会把你们的帽子借走
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat,

23
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:13,062
等你要回来的时候 里面会有猴大便吗
and when you got it back, there'd be little monkey raisins in it?

24
00:01:13,182 --> 00:01:14,958
他那样做很好玩 
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. 

25
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,025
如果我对我老板那样做的话
When I did it to my boss's hat...

26
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:21,324
突然就变成了我的态度有问题
All of a sudden I had this big "attitude problem".

亲爱的雷莫瑞医生
"Dear Dr. Ramoray,

37
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,891
要知道 我爱你 我愿不惜一切得到你
Know that I love you and would do anything to have you."

38
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:28,641
天啊 你不神秘的仰慕者 艾瑞卡福特
My gosh! "Your not so secret admirer, Erika Ford."

39
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,314
等等
Oh, wait.

40
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:35,478
附注 请收下 我送的14根睫毛
"P.S. enclosed please find fourteen of my eyelashes."

41
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,323
在疯子的世界里 那就表示你结婚了 
You know, in Crazy World, that means you're married.

42
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,008
这封信不是寄到"我们的日子"剧组 
This wasn't addressed to "Days Of Our Lives". 

43
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:47,160
收信地址是你家 上面没有邮票
This is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it.

44
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:49,328
这女的来过咱们大楼  
This woman was in our building. 

45
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:50,245
我的天啊
Oh my God.

46
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,999
我竟然有自己的跟踪者了
I got my very own stalker!

47
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,627
嘿      嘿
Hey, guys.        Hey.

48
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,584
喔 你这是要去哪儿呀
Ooh, where are you off to, Traveling Jake?

49
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,047
在洛杉矶 有一个古生物学研讨会
Well, there's this paleontology conference in L.A.

50
00:03:03,048 --> 00:03:05,425
所以我想我去 然后开车去动物园
So I figured I'd go and drive down to the zoo

51
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:06,891
给马塞尔一个惊喜
and surprise Marcel.

52
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,846
他会很惊喜的 
You know I think he will be surprised. 

53
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:11,396
直到发现自己是只猴子
Till he realizes he's a monkey,

54
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,766
根本不会有那种情绪
and you know, isn't capable of that emotion.

55
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,442
菲比 那个帅哥又来了
Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.

56
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:22,073
噢 这样 各位
Oh, oh, Okay, so everyone,

57
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,168
假装我在跟你们讲故事 
pretend like I'm telling you a story, okay? 

58
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:25,611
而且是很好笑的故事
And it's really funny.

59
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,905
所以大家要笑 快
So everyone just laugh. Now!

60
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,074
我知道 我知道
I know, I know!

61
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,624
你好     嗨
Hello.         Hi.

62
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,289
我是罗伯杜南      你好 罗伯杜南
I'm Rob Donan.        Hi, Rob Donan.

63
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,033
我对音乐一窍不通
I don't know anything about music, 

64
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:41,676
不过我觉得你很赞
but I think you're really really great.

65
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,380
喔 哇
Oh, wow!

66
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,767
我负责给市里的儿童图书馆安排演出
Anyway, I schedule performers for the children's libraries around the city.

67
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:53,434
我想知道 你有没有考虑过给孩子们唱歌
And I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?

68
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,107
我是很想有小孩
Oh. I would love to have kids...

69
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:02,985
听我唱我写给他们的歌
hear me play the songs that I will write for them.

70
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,781
晚餐吃什么
Hey, what do you wanna do for dinner?

71
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,988
我们可以自己煮
Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.

72
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,003
谁呀      我是艾瑞卡
Hello.        It's Erika.

73
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,872
天啊 是那个跟踪者
Oh my God. The stalker!

74
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,374
不用了 门没关
Never mind. It's open.

75
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,383
对 拿平底锅打她 好主意啊
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan is a good idea.

76
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,175
可是还得再有一个备用计划 
We might wanna have a backup plan, though, 

77
00:04:27,176 --> 00:04:29,391
以防她不是卡通人物
just in case she isn't a cartoon.

78
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,348
我们快逃走吧
Let's get out of here!

79
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,688
偏挑这个时候不在家
The one time they're not home!

80
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,108
这样 这样 我们走就好了 
Okay, okay, we'll just leave. 

81
00:04:40,109 --> 00:04:41,324
就算是碰到她
And when we pass her on the stairs,

82
00:04:41,325 --> 00:04:43,856
她也认不出我 因为我们从没见过面
she won't know it's me because we've never met.

83
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,657
只有广播明星能这样摆脱跟踪者
That's how radio stars escape stalkers!

84
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,363
她来了
She's coming!

85
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,665
是我
It's me. 

86
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:02,211
完了 我们就这样没命了
This is it. This is how we're gonna die.

87
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:06,169
准备好没      等等 等等
You ready?         Wait wait wait!

88
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,560
嗨
Hi.

89
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,062
艾瑞卡
Erika!

90
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,691
盖勒先生     是 你好
Mr. Geller?         Yes, hi!

91
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,573
你好 我是迪安利浦森 动物园园长
Hi. Dean Lipson, zoo administrator.

92
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,533
我听说你有个问题想问 
I was told you had a question.

93
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:36,418
我找不到去年捐给动物园的猴子
Well, I, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. 

94
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,286
那只叫马塞尔的僧帽猴
He's a capuchin answers to the name Marcel?

95
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,085
恐怕我得告诉你坏消息
Ah.I'm afraid I have some bad news.

96
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,633
马塞尔已经过世了
Marcel has passed on.

97
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,046
天啊 怎么了
Oh my God. What happened?

98
00:05:50,108 --> 00:05:52,890
他病了 病情越来越严重
Well, he got sick, and then he got sicker.

99
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,094
后来状况稍有好转
And then he got a little better.

100
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,266
可是最后他还是死了
But then he died.

101
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,270
我真是不敢相信
I can't believe this!

102
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,037
我很遗憾 盖勒先生 
I'm sorry, Mr. GelIer. 

103
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:06,234
但是 有句老话说得好
But you know,there's an old saying,

104
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,065
猴子难免一死
"Sometimes monkeys die."

105
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,319
虽然这不是什么至理名言 但是
It's not a great saying. But...

106
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,452
很适合用在今天这种状况
it certainly is fitting today.

107
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,603
你们应该打电话通知我的      
Well, you know, someone should have called me. 

108
00:06:18,604 --> 00:06:19,580
抱歉
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:24,836
我知道这无法让他复活 不过这是我们的一点心意
Look, I know this can't bring him back. But here it's just a gesture.

110
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,963
动物园代金券
Zoo dollars?

111
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,175
是啊 你可以观看四点钟的小鸟表演
Yes, and come see the bird show at four.

112
00:06:31,175 --> 00:06:32,622
金刚鹦鹉戴帽子
The macaws wear hats.

113
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,136
如果你的猴子没死就更好了
Well, if a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.

114
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,943
我知道
I know.

115
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,054
我简直不敢相信 乔伊竟然和跟踪者一起吃午餐 
I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker.

116
00:06:50,055 --> 00:06:51,699
她长得什么样
What is she like?

117
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,490
记得"危情十日"里的凯西贝兹吗
Well, you remember Kathy Bates in Misery?

118
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,831
她跟她长的完全相反
Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.

119
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,284
那她不是疯子吗
And she's not crazy?

120
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,169
不是 她是个超级大疯子
Oh, no, no. She's a total wack job.

121
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:07,837
她认为乔伊就是德瑞克雷莫瑞医生
Yeah. She thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Ramoray.

122
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,589
我的天啊
Oh my God!

123
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,783
这样他还跟她约会
Oh. And he's going out with her?

124
00:07:11,784 --> 00:07:13,551
他不能这样
He cannot pursue this.

125
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,733
我们不能因为这个女人 
Hey, just because this woman thinks 

126
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:18,289
把电视里的乔伊 当作真的
she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room,

127
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,520
就不把她当人看啊
doesn't mean she's not a person.

128
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:23,727
难道她没有权利去爱 不能追求幸福吗
I mean, does she not deserve happiness? Does she not deserve love?

129
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:29,029
你们干嘛瞪我啊 是他自己要去跟疯子约会的
What are you looking at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.

130
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,273
你还好吧
Are you okay?

131
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,316
不好 我很紧张
No. I'm just, I'm nervous.

132
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,828
或许我可以想像他们只穿着内衣裤
So, you know, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.

133
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,570
这样不太好 
That's not a good idea. 

134
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:41,707
上个表演者就是这样被开除的
That's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.

135
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,127
好吧
Yeah.

136
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,710
我只是习惯在大人面前表演
I'm just, I'm used to playing for grownups.

137
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,047
大人会边喝咖啡 边忙着自己的事情
You know, grownups drink their coffee and do their grownup thing, you know.

138
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,133
可是小孩子会认真听
And kids listen.

139
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,054
这个责任太重大了
This is a huge responsibility.

140
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,471
怎么了
What?

141
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,602
你要亲我吗
Are you gonna kiss me?

142
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,055
我是有这个打算
I was thinking about it.

143
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,894
好
Okay.

144
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,734
好耶 咱们来点儿音乐
Yeah, okay. Airighty. Let's play some tunes!

145
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,019
嗨 大家好 我是菲比      
Hi, everybody. I'm Phoebe. 

146
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,494
你好 菲比
Hi Phoebe!

147
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,996
好吧
Okay.

148
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,168
我要唱一首关于爷爷奶奶的歌 好吗
I'm gonna play some songs about grandparents, okay?

149
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,832
大家都喜欢奶奶
Now Grandma's a person who everyone likes.

150
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,135
奶奶会买给你火车 和闪亮的脚踏车
She bought you a train and a bright shiny bike.

151
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,217
可是她最近都没来吃晚饭
But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner.

152
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:41,684
你上次看到她时 她瘦了好多
And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner.

153
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,229
爸爸妈妈说 她搬去秘鲁了
Now your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru.

154
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,858
其实她已经死了 有天你也会死
But the truth is she died and someday you will too.

155
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,158
德瑞克 这真是太好了     对啊
Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?         Yeah. it is.

156
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,376
怎么了
What?

157
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,959
我们现在很轻松地坐在这儿
Well, here we sit, devil may care.

158
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:14,297
但是不久之前 你还在重注西蒙的脊髓
And just a little while ago you were reattaching Simone's spinal cord.

159
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,007
对 那个手术很困难
Yeah, that was a tricky one.

160
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,007
其实那个手术花了十几个小时 
In reality that operation takes like over ten hours, 

161
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:23,264
但是他们只播了两分钟
but they only showed it for two minutes.

162
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,811
他们是谁
Who's "they"?

163
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,148
没什么啦
No one.

164
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,734
德瑞克 你好有才华喔 让我看看你的手
Oh, Drake, you are so talented. Let me see those hands.

165
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,524
这双手真是漂亮
Oh, these hands, these beautiful hands. 

166
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:40,322
我真想把它们给吃了
Oh, I could just eat them.

167
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,903
可是我不会
But I won't.

168
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:46,874
很好 不然我的手表就会掉下来
Good. Otherwise my watch would fall off.

169
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,002
不 我是说真的
No, seriously.

170
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,840
这双手 这双创造奇迹的回春妙手
These hands, these miracle magical lifegiving hands.

171
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,927
只要能靠近它们 触摸它们 也许可以舔一下
Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?

172
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,435
好吧 只舔一只喔
All right. Just one. 

173
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,775
你还真厉害
You're good at that.

174
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,000
天啊 他噎到了 
Oh, my God! Someone! He's choking! 

175
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:22,819
这里有医生吗
Is anyone here a doctor?

176
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,347
有 这里有整个塞伦最优秀的医生
Oh, yes. Yes, the best doctor in all of Salem!

177
00:10:26,347 --> 00:10:28,412
德瑞克雷莫瑞医生
Dr. Drake Ramoray!

178
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:47,682
15分钟后 咱们夜间馆见
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.

179
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:54,902
听着 我不喜欢跟男人做那种接触
Hey, look. I don't really enjoy being with other men that way.

180
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,986
你想要动物园代金券吗
But zoo dollars?

181
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,233
是关于你猴子的事情
It's about your monkey.

182
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,784
他还活着
It's alive.

183
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,959
我不明白 你为什么不帮那个人
I don't understand. Why didn't you help that man?

184
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,920
因为我是神经外科医生
Because, I'm a neurosurgeon.

185
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:18,375
而他的状况显然是
And that was clearly a case of...

186
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,255
食物阻塞症
"foodal chokage."

187
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,844
你知道
You know.

188
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,824
好吧 听着 我有事要跟你说
All right, look, I gotta tell you something...

189
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:30,094
不 不 不 不 你什么都不用说
No no no no.You don't have to tell me anything.

190
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,688
你不需要对我解释
You don't have to explain yourself to me. Oh!

191
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:36,226
我怎么可以质疑伟大的雷莫瑞医生     可是
Who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Ramoray?        But...

192
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,479
能接近你 我就很开心了      嘿
I should just be happy to be near you.        Hey, I...

193
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,779
嘿什么
"Hey" what?

194
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,491
没事 只是随口说声嘿
That's it. Just hey!

195
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,540
就像跳完舞之后也会说声嘿
Like at the end of a dance. Hey!

196
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:57,334
嘿
Hey.

197
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,219
等你们长大之后
There'll be times when you get older.

198
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,004
你会不惜跟喜欢的人上床 
When you'll want to sleep with people.

199
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:06,388
只为博得对方的欢心 可是千万别这么做
Just to make them like you. But don't.

200
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:12,637
因为这是 你不该做的事情 一起来
'Cause that's another thing That you don't wanna do. Everybody!

201
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:17,564
你们不该这样做
That's another thing that you don't wanna do.

202
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,240
太棒了      非常有知识性
Excellent!         Very informative!

203
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,732
一点都没有不恰当
Not at all inappropriate!

204
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,119
谢谢大家的到来 后面有曲奇可以吃喔
Thank you for coming, everybody. There are cookies in the back.

205
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,030
你表演的真棒
That was great.

206
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,374
小孩子都很喜欢你
The kids loved you.

207
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,661
我超酷的吧
Yay! I rock!

208
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,293
你知道为什么吗 因为你跟他们说实话
And you know why? Because you told the truth.

209
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,549
从没有人会跟小孩说实话
And nobody ever tells kids the truth.

210
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,418
你真的太了不起了
You were incredible!

211
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,007
但是
But?

212
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,809
你怎么知道还有"但是"   
How did you know there was a "but"?         

213
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,758
我有感应
I sense these things.

214
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,264
不是"但是"就是"蛋糕"
It was either "but" or "butter".

215
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,618
我想有些父母
The thing is that I think, you know, some of the parents,

216
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:58,138
他们希望 
they were kinda hoping that 

217
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:01,481
你唱一些跟农场动物有关的歌
you'd play more songs about like barnyard animals.

218
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,029
没问题啊
I can do that.

219
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,188
真的吗     当然啦
Really?         Yeah.

220
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,325
这样就太好了      噢
Because that would be fantastic.         Oh.

221
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,741
怎么 你想亲我吗
What? You wanna kiss me?

222
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,705
正有这个打算
Thinking about it.

223
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,206
喔 蝙蝠
Ah the bat.

224
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,538
黑暗使者
Ambassador of darkness.

225
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:23,792
像长了翅膀的使者一般飞出洞中
Flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger.

226
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,550
看不见的幽灵
Sightless specter of the macabre.

227
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,010
老兄 我的猴子
Buddy, my monkey?

228
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,221
喔 对喔
Oh, yeah, right.

229
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:37,851
前几个月发生了一桩盗窃案 是监守自盗
There was a break in a few months back. Inside job.

230
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,603
你的猴子被偷走了
Your monkey was taken.

231
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,439
天啊 可是动物园跟我说我的猴子死了
Oh my God. The zoo told me that my monkey was dead.

232
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,111
动物园
The zoo!

233
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,982
动物园说的话你都相信吗
You believe everything the zoo tells you?

234
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,828
动物园就只跟我说了这一件事
That's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.

235
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,723
他们当然会这样说 
Of course they're gonna say he's dead. 

236
00:13:54,724 --> 00:13:56,454
他们可不想坏事传千里
They don't want the bad publicity.

237
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,368
这是个大阴谋
It's all a great big cover-up.

238
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:02,084
你知道这件事 牵扯到多高层吗
Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?

239
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,003
那个叫利浦森的人
That guy Lipson?

240
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,000
利浦森知道吗
Lipson knows?

241
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,886
利浦森知道啊
Lipson knows, huh?

242
00:14:09,887 --> 00:14:12,136
你好 负鼠先生
Hello, Mr. Possum.

243
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:16,181
树上的谜团 爬上爬下的夜行者
Enigma of the trees, upsidedown denizen of the night.

244
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,351
无视于地心引力      老兄 我的猴子 我的猴子
Taunting gravity...        Buddy, my monkey. My monkey?

245
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,192
道上传闻
Word on the street.

246
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,241
我所说的"道上"
Well when I say "street", 

247
00:14:25,242 --> 00:14:27,485
是指动物园的人行道
I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.

248
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,940
我知道
Of course.

249
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,611
你的猴子找到了新工作
Your monkey found a new career

250
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,123
而且是在娱乐业 我只知道这么多
in the entertainment field. That's all I know.

251
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,034
这真是令人难以相信
This is unbelievable!

252
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:45,089
这样的消息值多少钱呢 朋友
So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?

253
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,459
你是要我贿赂你吗
Are you trying to get me to bribe you?

254
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,295
可能喔
Maybe.

255
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,215
但是你已经把一切都告诉我了
But you already told me everything.

256
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:06,011
你们看 他就是猴子乐啤酒广告里的那只猴子
Check it out. He actually is the Monkeyshine monkey.

257
00:15:06,012 --> 00:15:07,941
你打算怎么办
Oh, wow. So, what are you gonna do?

258
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:11,449
打电话给啤酒公司 询问他的下落
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.

259
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,736
我的马不见的时候 我也是这么做的
That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.

260
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,121
大家好 我们又见面了
Okay, hi again!

261
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,949
你好 菲比
Hi Phoebe!

262
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:25,292
今天我们唱一些跟农场动物有关的歌
Today, we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals.

263
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:30,965
草地上的牛哞 哞 哞
Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo".

264
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,669
农夫打它们的头 并把它们的肉绞碎
Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up. 

265
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,799
汉堡包就是这么来的
And that's how we get hamburgers.

266
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,979
接下来是鸡
Now chickens.

267
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,722
只有你能救她 德瑞克      
You're the only one who can save her, Drake! 

268
00:15:45,723 --> 00:15:48,654
拜托 我只是个医生 不是神仙
Damn it! I'm a doctor, I'm not God.

269
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,072
我的信仰就是这样被推翻了
Well there goes my whole belief system.

270
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,404
我是艾瑞卡
It's Erika.

271
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,761
天啊 快把电视关了      
Oh my God, quick turn off the TV. 

272
00:15:56,762 --> 00:15:58,071
不要 等等 我想知道结果
No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens!

273
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,744
我帮助莱丝莉脱离昏迷 然后我们就亲热
I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.

274
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,204
怎么可能 你刚刚才亲了赛布丽娜
Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina.

275
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:07,255
瑞秋 在那个世界里 乔伊是个神经外科医生
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neurosurgeon.

276
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,085
嘿 艾瑞卡 进来吧
Hey, Erika. Come in.

277
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,718
你怎么这么快就到家了 我刚还看到你在塞伦
How did you get here so fast? I just saw you in Salem.

278
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,759
是哦 他们用直升机送我回来的
Right, they choppered me in. 

279
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,476
怎么啦
What's up?

280
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,721
你们在开派对啊
Oh, and I see you're having a little party too.

281
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,268
她在这里吗     谁啊
Is she here, huh. huh?         Who?

282
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,729
赛布丽娜 我知道你们的事了
Sabrina. I know about you two!

283
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,937
我看到你今天 在医生休息室里亲她
I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.

284
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,106
事情不是你想的那样
It's not what you think. That was...

285
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,943
你还说我是你唯一的爱
You told me I was the only one!

286
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,331
好吧 够了
All right, look. That's it.

287
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,618
我们不该再继续交往了
I don't think we should see each other anymore, all right?

288
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,123
我知道 我应该早点告诉你的
Look, I know I  should have told you this a long time ago.

289
00:16:47,124 --> 00:16:49,414
我不是德瑞克雷莫瑞
But I am not Drake Ramoray, okay?

290
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,877
我不是医生 我只是个演员 
I'm not even a doctor. I'm an actor. 

291
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,460
我只是假装自己是个医生而已
I just pretend to be a doctor.

292
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:54,832
我的天啊 
Oh my God! 

293
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,971
医院的人知道这件事吗
Do the people at the hospital know about this?

294
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,810
有人可以帮我一下吗
Somebody wanna help me out here?

295
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,096
我知道 我知道
Oh, I know! I know!

296
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,981
我在哪里
Where am I?

297
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,812
这里是大学附属医院
University Hospital.

298
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,523
你已经在这里昏迷了18年
The same place you've been for the last eighteen years.

299
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,814
你怎么会同时出现在两个地方
How can you be here and there?

300
00:17:14,815 --> 00:17:17,112
因为那是电视剧
Because it's a television show.

301
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,368
德瑞克 你这话是什么意思
Drake, what are you getting at?

302
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,163
我不是德瑞克
I'm not Drake!

303
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,246
没错 他不是德瑞克 他是
That's right. He's not Drake. He's...

304
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,704
汉斯雷莫瑞 德瑞克的邪恶双胞胎兄弟
Hans Ramoray, Drake'sevil twin!

305
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,798
这是真的吗
Is this true?

306
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,214
是 是真的
Yes! Yes, it is true.

307
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,223
我之所以知道 是因为
And I know this because,

308
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:45,378
他假装自己是德瑞克 跟我上床
because he pretended to be Drake to sleep with me!

309
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,024
他还跟我说 他会跟我私奔
And then he told me he would run away with me.

310
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,480
可是他根本没有
And he didn't!

311
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,910
你还没把马桶座垫放下来 你这个混蛋
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard!

312
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,125
这些都是真的吗
Is all this true?

313
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,425
是的 
Yes.

314
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:14,374
恐怕是真的
I'm afraid it is.

315
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,838
我根本配不上你 艾瑞卡
You deserve much better than me, Erika.

316
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,624
你应该跟真正的德瑞克在一起 
You deserve to be with the real Drake. 

317
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,507
你爱的是他
He's the one you fell in love with.

318
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,974
去塞伦找他吧
Go to Salem. Find him!

319
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,226
他才是你的真命天子
He's the guy for you.

320
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,020
喔 汉斯

邪恶的双胞胎
You evil twin!

323
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,527

祝你在塞伦一切顺利
Good luck in Salem.

325
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,780
保重
Take care.

326
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,662
我永远不会忘记你的 汉斯
I'll never forget you, Hans.

327
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,704
好了 刚泼我水的人      
All right. The people who threw the water! 

328
00:18:55,705 --> 00:18:56,924
我们是在帮你耶
Helping you out!

329
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,459
被炒了
Fired?

330
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,131
为什么
Why?

331
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:03,801
图书馆董事会接到很多来自家长的投诉 
The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents 

332
00:19:03,802 --> 00:19:06,296
抱怨你歌词里的一些内容
about some of the stuff in your songs.

333
00:19:06,297 --> 00:19:08,878
真不敢相信 你有没有跟董事会说
I cant believe it! Did you tell your board 

334
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:11,110
孩子们想听实话
about how the kids want to hear the truth?

335
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,474
没有
No.

336
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,894
我明白了
I see.

337
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:21,073
或许 你可以唱一些一般的儿歌
Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs?

338
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,701
不要 你希望我变成什么样子 像那些
No. What do you want me to be? Like some

339
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:28,407
白痴的紫色大恐龙吗
stupid, big, like purple dinosaur?

340
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,722
我不是说 你要变成巴尼(紫色暴龙角色)     
I'm not saying you have to be Barney.

341
00:19:31,723 --> 00:19:33,164
巴尼是谁
Who's Barney?

342
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,018
我查到了马塞尔 并且得知
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this. 

343
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:41,552
他很健康也很快乐
He's healthy, he's happy.

344
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:42,992
而且他现在就在纽约
And he's right here in New York 

345
00:19:42,993 --> 00:19:45,757
拍 "极度恐慌2: 病毒侵袭曼哈顿"
filming "Outbreak 2. The Virus Takes Manhattan".

346
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,141
不会吧      我的天啊
You're kidding!        Oh my God!

347
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,306
真是太棒了      对啊
This is amazing.         I know.

348
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,466
我好不容易混进了电视圈 
I finally get a part on TV.

349
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:53,018
这猴子都开始拍电影了
And the monkey's making movies.

350
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,897
瑞秋 我准备好了      好
Okay. Rachel, I'm ready.        Okay.

351
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:05,277
不好意思 请问这里有个会说实话的女歌手吗
Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is who tells the truth?

352
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:07,445
应该就是我
Yeah, I guess that's me.

353
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,122
她在这里
She's here!

354
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,630
有时男人爱女人
Sometimes men love women.

355
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,598
有时男人爱男人
And sometimes men love men.

356
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,226
还有人是双性恋
And then there are bisexuals.

357
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:31,561
有些人却会说 他们只是在欺骗自己
Though some just say They're kidding themselves.

358
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:43,064
太兴奋了 我差不多一年没看到我的猴子了
This is so exciting. I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.

359
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,779
怎么 你洗澡的时候都没往下看喔
What, you never look down in the shower?

360
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:50,614
我连说个"猴子等于命根子"的笑话都不可以吗
Oh, please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the "monkeyis penis"genre?

361
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,456
请退后
Back up, please.

362
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,162
退后 快点 快点
Back up. Come on, come on.

363
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,952
不好意思 哪里可以找到那只猴子
Excuse me. Where can we find the monkey?

364
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,583
不好意思 今天的拍摄不开放
I'm sorry. It's a closed set.

365
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,007
你不了解 我是他的朋友
I'm sorry, you don't understand. I'm a friend of his.

366
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,339
我们以前住在一起
We used to live together.

367
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,755
对 我在波科诺斯也跟飞宝一起住过

马塞尔 马塞尔

371
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,865
在丛林里 广大的丛林里
In the jungle, the mighty jungle,

372
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,826
今夜狮子睡着了

373
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,700
丛林里 广大的丛林里
In the jungle, the mighty jungle,

374
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,790
今夜狮子睡着了
The lion sleeps tonight.

375
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,614
他们不带你去看兽医
They won't take you to the vet

376
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,322
很显然 你不是他们最爱的宠物
You're obviously not their favorite pet.

377
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:18,163
臭猫 臭猫      臭猫 臭猫
Smelly cat, smelly cat.         Smelly cat, smelly cat.

378
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,625
这不是你的错      这不是你的错
It's not your fault.         It's not your fault.

379
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:26,210
不  
No.

380
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,336
怎么了     抱歉
What?        I'm sorry.         

381
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,802
有什么问题
What's wrong with that?

382
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,225
我想你应该选择一个 更男性化一点的调子比较好
I think you might wanna, like pick a more masculine note.
