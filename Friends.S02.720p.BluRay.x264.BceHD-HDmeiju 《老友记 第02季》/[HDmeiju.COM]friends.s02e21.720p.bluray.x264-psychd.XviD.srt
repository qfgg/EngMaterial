1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,452
股票与债券水涨船高...
Stocks and bonds are moving higher...

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,121
摩妮卡 我们为什么在看财经频道?
Hey Monical, why are we watching the Business Channel?

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,050
因为那天我无意中看到 
'Cause I was going by it the other day

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,238
有支股票跟我的名字缩写一样 MEG
and I saw there was a stock with my initials, MEG on it.

5
00:00:12,238 --> 00:00:14,800
有时要等23个小时才能看到它再出现
Sometimes it takes two or three hours before it comes up again.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,340
但当它出来的时候 相当爽
But when it does, it's pretty exciting.

7
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:22,057
额 亲爱的 你真的得找份工作了
Hmm, okay, honey, you really need a job.

8
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,175
摩妮卡 说到这 老爸说他认识个人
Mon, speaking of which, Dad says he knows someone

9
00:00:24,175 --> 00:00:25,863
你要是想面试可以打电话给他      真的么?
you can call for an interview.        Really?

10
00:00:25,863 --> 00:00:29,488
就是这个! 这是今天第三个征兆了 就是这个
Okay, right there! That's the third sign today. Right there.

11
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:33,689
我替在座的各位问一句...什么?
On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say, "Huh?"

12
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,316
不是 是因为你刚才说"老爸" 
No, cause you just said "dad".

13
00:00:36,316 --> 00:00:38,050
而且今天不论我去哪里
 And everywhere I go today...

14
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,878
我不停得到让我去见我爸爸的征兆
I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father.

15
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:42,300
就好像当我过来这里时
Like when I was walking over here,

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,238
经过一家自助餐厅"布菲"
and I passed a buffet.

17
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,999
"布菲" 那是我爸爸的姓
Which is my father's last name.

18
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,691
他们当时正在上法兰克福香肠
And they were serving franks

19
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:53,922
结尾去掉"福"后 法兰克就是他的名字
which is his first name, minus the "s" at the end.

20
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,677
没错
Yes.

21
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:59,681
而且那里的烤肉架上 有只烤鸡在上面转
And there was a rotisserie with a spinning chicken.

22
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,467
他的印度名字?
His Indian name?

23
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:07,148
不 因为我上次"胆小如鸡"
No. Because I chickened out the last time

24
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,351
没有去见他 这都是巧合吗? 我可不这么认为
when I tried to meet him. So coincidences? I don't think so.

25
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,858
很古怪      诡异
Very freaky.        Eerie.

26
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,780
好吧 谁想要最后一个汉堡?
Okay, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?

27
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,112
哦 好吧 够了 现在我必须要去见他了
Oh, alright, that's it. Now I have to go see him

28
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,408
为什么?
Why?

29
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,822
汉堡? 麦当劳?
Hamburger? McDonald's?

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,191
老麦当劳有个农场 我爸爸是个药剂师
Old McDonald had a farm. My dad is a pharmacist.

31

40
00:02:27,425 --> 00:02:29,378
哦 不好意思 我们不知道
Oh, sorry, we didn't know.

41
00:02:29,378 --> 00:02:30,643
嗨 我们刚才坐在这里的
Hey, we were sitting there.

42
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,976
好吧 还有另外一种说法
Okay. There is one more way to say it.

43
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,860
谁知道? 
Who knows it?

44
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,300
你说这话是自以为风趣么? 
Is that supposed to be funny?

45
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,076
不 只是想说得生动而已
Actually, I was going for colorful.

46
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,076
这家伙是怎么回事?      你是怎么回事?
What's with this guy?        What's with you?

47
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,743
没什么 他没怎么样
Uh, nothing. Nothing's with him.

48
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,373
慢慢享受你们的咖啡吧
Enjoy your coffee.

49
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,006
刚才怎么回事?
What just happened?

50
00:02:58,387 --> 00:02:59,988
我只是拿了你的帽子
I just took your hat.

51
00:03:00,612 --> 00:03:01,961
你看 我也可以很风趣
See, I can be funny too.

52
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,098
我的笑话就是 我拿了你的帽子
My, my joke is that I took your hat.

53
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,634
那很好笑
That is funny.

54
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,637
我能拿回来吗?
Can I have it back?

55
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,971
不行
No.

56
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,141
不行?      不行
No?        No.

57
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,398

Okay. Okay.

58
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,860
你们知道吗? 我认为你很风趣
You know what? I think you're very funny.

59
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,946
那个帽子笑话很不错
Kudos on that hat joke.

60
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:29,363
但是 兄弟 把帽子还给他吧
But come on, guys, just give him back the hat.

61
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,457
为什么?
Why should we?

62
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,869
因为那是一顶很特别的帽子
Because it's a special hat.

63
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,175
他买这顶帽子是因为那天他情绪低落
See, he bought it because he was feeling down one day.

64
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:39,124
所以他才买了这帽子
So he got the hat

65
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,463
让自己高兴一点 你知道么?
to cheer himself up, you know?

66
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:45,551
钱德他...      别说了 不要再说了
Now, Chandler...        Stop talking. Stop talking now.

67
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,878
我直说了吧 你真的偷我的帽子?
Let me get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?

68
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:50,893
有问题吗?
You got a problem with that?

69
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,771
我只是想确认一下我们达成共识了
I just want to make sure we're on the same page.

70
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,484
面试如何?
How'd the interview go?

71
00:03:58,697 --> 00:03:59,982
糟透了
It bit.

72
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,323
那是个50年代主题餐厅
It was a 50's theme restaurant.

73
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:07,077
我得穿着戏服做饭 还要在柜台上跳舞
I'd have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter

74
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,579
我以前是艺术家咖啡馆的二厨
I mean, I was a sous-chef at Cafe des Artistes.

75
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,289
我怎么能在这样的快餐店做东西?
How can I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?

76
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,786
那就别干了      我怎么能不干?
Don't do it.        How can I not do it?

77
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,796
我只剩下127块存款了
I have $127 in the bank.

78
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,004
摩妮卡 放轻松 去拿瓶啤酒
Monica, relax. Go get a beer.

79
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,510
我不想喝啤酒
I don't want a beer

80
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,136
谁说是要给你的?
Who said it was for you?

81
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,765
大家好      大家好
Hi.        Hi.

82
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,142
你们怎么了?
What's the matter with you?

83
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:38,525
有两个烂人在咖啡厅拿走了我的帽子
Some mean guys at the coffeehouse took my hat.

84
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,443
不会吧      开玩笑吧
No.        You're kidding.

85
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,067
太荒谬了 他们是流氓
It was ridiculous. These guys, they were bullies.

86
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,194
真正的流氓
Actual bullies.

87
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:49,050
我们都是成人了 这种事情不应该再发生了
You know, we're grown ups. This kind of stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.

88
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,620
嗨      嗨
Oh, hi.        Hi.

89
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,242
哦...
Oh..

90
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,033
不对 等等 我身边一个人也没有
Oh, no, wait a minute. I have no one.

91
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,464
我们下去把你的帽子拿回来
Let's go down there and get your hat back.

92
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:05,844
算了吧 很可能都已经剥开分块卖了
Forget it. It's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.

93
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,889
嗨 我涨了!      什么?
Hey. I went up!        What?

94
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,427
我的股票 MEG 它升了两点
My stock, MEG, it went up two points.

95
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:17,848
嗨 你们意识到如果昨天我把127块投资到我身上
Do you realize that if I'd invested my $127 in myself yesterday...

96
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,735
现在我就有...额...比现在多得多的钱了
that I'd, like, have a lot more than that today.

97
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,999
你们猜怎么着? 我要做这个
You know what? I'm gonna do it.

98

做什么?      把钱都投资到我身上
Do what?        Put all my money in me.

99
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:31,070
摩妮卡 你在说什么? 你对股票市场一无所知
Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know a thing about the stock market.

100
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,206
有什么要知道的? 买啊卖啊 高啊低啊 熊市 牛市
What's to know? Buy, sell. High, low. Bears, bulls.

104
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,434
看吧 我就跟你说带枕头来是个好主意
See? Didn't I tell you these pillows would be a good idea?

105
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,894
哦 天呐

Olive loaf and ham spread. No mayo.

Okay, Joey. The dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich.

127
00:07:09,316 --> 00:07:10,800
这说明什么?
What does that tell you?

128
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,503
他要是不吃的话 我还想吃呢      你疯了吗?
If he's not gonna eat it, I will.        Are you crazy?

129
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,550

Do you have to be a Century 21 real estate agent

132
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,735
才能穿那些很酷的外套?
to get to wear those really cool jackets?

133
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,574
你就跟姑娘们说这个?
Do you say this stuff to girls?

134
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,488
嗨 那不是以前戴你帽子的家伙吗?
Hey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?

135
00:07:42,488 --> 00:07:45,086
看他们现在坐在哪儿
And look where they're sitting.

136
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:51,711
你开玩笑吧? 你们才刚刚进门
You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.

137
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,174
也许我们没跟他们说清楚      对
Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.        Yeah.

138
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,613
这沙发属于我们
This couch belongs to us.

139
00:07:57,613 --> 00:08:00,765
好吧 这么办吧 你们叫这沙发
I'll tell you what, you call the couch

140
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,863
然后我们也叫它沙发
and then we'll call the couch

141
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,524
然后看它会走向谁
and we'll see who it comes to.

142
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,863
你们知道我在想什么吗? 你们怎么还坐在这里?
You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.

143
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,815
够了
All right, that's it.

144
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,362
我受够了
I have had enough of this, all right?

145
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,618
阿甘
Gunther.

146
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,253
这两个家伙想抢我们的座位
These guys are trying to take our seat.

147
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,160
兄弟 他们先来的
Fellas, these guys were here first.

148
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,211
不好意思 没注意到
Oh, sorry, didn't realize.

149
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,709
行了
There you go.

150
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,166
谢谢你 阿甘
Thank you, Gunther

151
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,803
我们不是一定要这样才行的
We didn't want to have to go and do that.

152
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,512
他告我们的状?
He told on us?

153
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,175
你告我们的状?
You told on us?

154
00:08:41,175 --> 00:08:44,392
额 兄弟 你们没给我别的选择
Well, pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.

155
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,391
别玩他的东西      我知道
Don't play with his thing.        I know.

156
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,149
好吧
All right.

157
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,861
我们到外面谈谈吧
Let's take this outside.

158
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:00,453
"我们到外面谈谈"?
"Let's, let's take this outside"?

159
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,494
谁这么说话啊?
Who talks like that?

160
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:09,125
马上就要痛宰你的人这么说话
The guy who's about to kick your ass talks like that.

161
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,665
你一定要问是吧?      是的
You had to ask.        Yeah.

162
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,049
好吧 知道么
Okay, okay, look. See

163
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,425
我们并不打算跟你们打架
the thing is, we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.

164
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,680
那有个条件
Then here's the deal.

165
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:29,566
只要你们永远不在这里出现 就不用跟我们打架
You won't have to, so long as you never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.

166
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,152
我认为你用阿甘用得太早了
I think you played the Gunther card too soon.

167
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,581
嗨 菲比 我想你现在能去了
Hey, Phoebs, I think you're good to go.

168
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,534
好的 我不知道
Yeah, I don't know.

169
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,627
怎么了?
What's the matter?

170
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,737
我只是觉得这是一个很糟的征兆
I just think that this was a really bad sign.

171
00:09:53,737 --> 00:09:56,960
你知道 就像一开始就是野兽
You know, I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know.

172
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:03,346
只是除了祖母以外 我没有别的亲人了
It's just I have no family left, you know, except for my grandmother

173
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,478
但是面对现实 她不可能一直都在
But let's face it. She's not gonna be around forever.

174
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,104
不管她怎么说
Despite what she says.

175
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,112
我还有个妹妹 
And I have a sister

176
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:15,855
从我们待过同一子宫后 我几乎不怎么和她说话
who I've barely spoken to since we shared a womb.

177
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,193
我不知道 这是我真正的父亲
I don't know. This is my real father...

178
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,201
我只希望事情顺利
and I want things to be, like, just right.

179
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,862
菲比 我完全理解
Yeah Phoebes I completely understand.

180
00:10:23,862 --> 00:10:25,612
你想怎么做都好
Yeah, whatever you need.

181
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,675
你想回家吗?
Hey, you want to go home?

182
00:10:28,675 --> 00:10:31,175
好吧 多谢了 再一次 对不起
Okay, thanks. Sorry again.

183
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,064
那是什么?
What was that?

184
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:59,239
我想一开始的路障已经清掉了
Uh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.

185
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,925
我要买5股SGJ 现在就要
I want to buy five shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now.

186
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:08,202
快点 时间就是金钱 朋友!
Come on, time is money, my friend!

187
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,367
多谢! 哇哦
Thank you! Whoo!

188
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,293
"时间就是金钱 朋友"?
"Time is money, my friend"?

189
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,315
是呀 你错过了"钱能生钱"
You missed "Takes money to make money"

190
00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:20,093
还有"别逼我过去痛宰你们这些华尔街浑蛋"
and "Don't make me come down there and kick your Wall Street butt"

191
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,843
我在早餐之前赚了17块 你呢?
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast. What have you done?

192
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:27,642
我在这里吃的早餐 所以从技术角度看 我省了3块5
Well, I had breakfast here, so technically I saved $3.50.

193
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,561
你怎么赚到17块的?
How did you make $17?

194
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,059
嗯 我的金融常识有待加强的朋友
Well, my financially challenged friends...

195
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,999
我用我的钱分别买了些CHP和ZXY
I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.

196
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,732
为什么要买这些?
How come those?

197
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:43,697
嗯 CHP是因为我以前很喜欢Erik Estrada这个演员
Well CHP because I used to have a crush on Erik Estrada.

198
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,746
ZXY是因为我觉得它听起来像"zexy"(性感)
And ZXY because I think it sounds "zexy"

199
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,074
那MEG呢?
Ahem, what happened to MEG?

200
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,706
MEG不错 但是我甩了她
MEG was good for me, but I dumped her.

201
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,338
你知道 我的座右铭是"下跌之前滚开"
My motto is "Get out before they go down."

202
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,042
这绝对不是我的座右铭
That is so not my motto.

203
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,128
嗨      嗨 菲比
Hey.        Hey, Phoebes.

204
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,050
那狗怎么样了?
Oh. hey, how's the dog?

205
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,938
我跟兽医谈过了 北边的人真是很友善
Okay. I talked to the vet. People are so nice upstate.

206
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,599
他说小家伙会没事的 我明天就可以去接他
Oh, anyway he said the little fellas gonna be okay, and I can get him tomorrow.

207
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,400
很好      多谢老天
Good.        Oh, thank God.

208
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,812
不过他不得不多缝几针
But he did have to have, like, a bunch of stitches.

209
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,738
而且他说除非太阳从西边出来 
And he said that only once in a blue moon

210
00:12:23,738 --> 00:12:24,925
狗的耳朵才可能重新长出来
does a dogs ear grow back.

211
00:12:24,925 --> 00:12:29,033
所以我还在期望中
So still hoping.

212
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,238
菲比 现在你会打电话给你父亲
Ok, so Phoebes, now are you gonna call your dad

213
00:12:34,238 --> 00:12:36,441
让他知道他的狗没事了吧?
to let him know that his dog is okay?

214
00:12:36,441 --> 00:12:39,581
我不想跟我爸在电话上相认
I don't want to meet my father over the phone.

215
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,925
我要说什么? "我是菲比 你抛弃的女儿
What will I say, like "Hi, I'm the daughter you abandoned.

216
00:12:42,925 --> 00:12:45,090
哦 顺便说一句 我弄伤了你的狗"
Oh, by the way, I broke your dog."

217
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,719
菲比 如果你愿意 我来帮你打
Hey, Phoebes, if you want, I'll do it.

218
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,015
好的
Okay.

219
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:54,179
听着 别说任何关于我的事情
Listen, just don't say anything about me, okay?

220
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,105
别...
Don't...

221
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,352
用太久电话
be too long with the phone.

222
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:04,318
股票市场关了后她会是个更好的朋友
She'll be a much better friend once the market closes.

223
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,949
是个女人
It's a woman.

224
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,577
跟她说话
So talk to her.

225
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,498
你好 布非太太
Uh, hello, Mrs. Buffay.

226
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,666
我知道你的狗在哪里
I know where your dog is.

227
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,715
我想让你知道 它会在24小时内回到你身边 
I want you to know he'll be returned to you almost as good as new

228
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,237
完好无损 跟全新的一样
within 24 hours.

229
00:13:26,237 --> 00:13:27,762
再见
Uh, goodbye.

230
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,596
为什么是那种声音?      很难说
Why the voice?        Hard to say.

231
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,605
先生 您的卡布其诺
Your cappuccino, sir

232
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,440
谢谢
Thank you.

233
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:50,444
我觉得这里比咖啡店好多了      绝对的
You know, I think this is much better than the coffee house.        Absolutely.

234
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,371
这怎么不会溶在水里?
How come it's not mixing with the water?

235
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,086
包装上说你要不停的搅动
The package says you have to keep it moving.

236
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,797
边搅边喝  边搅边喝 千万别停下来
Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.

237
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,099
这太荒谬了
This is ridiculous.

238
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,019
这样吧 等我从我侄女的洗礼回来后
I tell you what, after I get back from my nieces christening

239
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,628
我跟你们一起到咖啡厅
I'll go down to the coffee house with you

240
00:14:19,628 --> 00:14:21,988
我们一起享受一杯好咖啡 好吧
and we'll have a nice cup of coffee alright.

241
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:24,318
没问题 有乔伊在哈
No problem. Joey's there, hmm?

242
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,397
好      不行
Okay.        No.

243
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,274
不行?      不行
No?        No.

244
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:34,412
我不想要每次想喝杯好咖啡 都要有乔伊陪着
I don't want to have to have Joey with me every time I want a decent cup of coffee.

245
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:38,082
我不想我后半生都喝这"K"开头的卡布其诺
And I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappuccino with a "k"

246
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,460
我说 你和我下去勇敢面对那些家伙
I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.

247
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,084
等等 猛男
All right, hang on a second there, Custer.

248
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,488
罗斯 你以前被痛揍过吗?
Yeah really Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?

249
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:49,339
当然
Yeah, sure.

250
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,677
被摩妮卡以外的人?      没有
By someone besides Monica?        No.

251
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,764
那又怎样?
So what?

252
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,050
被痛揍又怎样? 
So we get beaten up.

253
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,925
也许那是每个男人一生中都要经历的事情
Maybe that's something a man has to go through once in his life.

254
00:14:58,925 --> 00:15:01,894
就像成年礼之类的东西
You know, like a, like a right of passage or something.

255
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,231
我们能不能只是再次失去我们的童贞?
Couldn't we just lose our virginities again?

256
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,106
因为我觉得我的又长回来了
You know, because I think actually mine's growing back.

257
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,197
我要借一百块      什么?
I need $100.        What?

258
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,612
欢迎回家
Hi. Welcome home.

259
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,496
我要借一百块      为什么?
I need $100.        For what?

260
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,050
我要重新回到游戏之中
To get back in the game.

261
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,550
为什么? 你什么时候退出这个游戏的?
Why? When did you get out of the game?

262
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,328
我全赔了 赔光了      不会吧
I lost it all. Okay, I lost it.        Oh. no.

263
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,956
我已经跟他们达成协议了 你也要
I've come to terms with it, you have to too.

264
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,508
好吧
Okay.

265
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,087
看 额 摩妮卡 我很抱歉
Look, uh, Mon, I'm really sorry.

266
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,968
我们的一百块呢?
Where are we on the $100?

267
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,390
我没有一百块
I don't have it.

268
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,388
但是我需要!
But I need it!

269
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,349
不然我就不得不去做那份很烂的餐馆工作了
Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job.

270
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:46,564
你知道就是穿着戏服跳舞
You know, with the dancing and the costumes.

271
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,198
我不想戴阻燃剂做的假胸
I don't want to have to wear flame retardant boobs.

272
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,028
没人会想 亲爱的
Nobody does, honey.

273
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,496
你好
Hi.

274
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,998
面条!
Noodle!

275
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:05,629
老天 我的狗怎么了?
Oh, my God. What the hell happened to my dog?

276
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,038
那是个意外
It was an accident.

277
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,769
干了这个的人绝对不是故意伤害狗狗的
And the woman who did this would never hurt a dog on purpose.

278
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,467
她是个素食者
She's a vegetarian.

279
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,008
这是缝针么?
Are these stitches?

280
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,808
是的 8针 它身上总共缝了56针
Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him

281
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,690
另外如果下雨 不能让他向上看太久
You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long

282
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,814
因为那个圆锥形护颈很快就会满
because that cone will fill up really really fast.

283
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:28,518
多谢你把它剩余的部分带回来
Well, uh, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.

284
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:32,112
弗兰克在家吗?      你怎么会认识弗兰克?
Sure, is, is Frank home?        How do you know Frank?

285
00:16:32,112 --> 00:16:35,025
额 认识很久了 他在吗?
Just from a long time ago. Is he here?

286
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,365
他在 弗兰克
Yeah. Frank.

287
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,617
干嘛?
Yeah.

288
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,323
干嘛?
What?

289
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,410
哦 好吧 额 我是指老弗兰克
Oh, okay, urn, I mean Frank Senior.

290
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,870
他出去买菜了
He went out for groceries.

291
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,834
那他会很快回来吗?
Will he be back soon?

292
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,862
他四年前就离开了 
He left four years ago.

293
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:53,363
所以我们估计他很快就会回来了
 We're expecting him back any minute.

294
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,049
好吧 我得走了
Alright, I, I'm gonna go.

295
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,753
关于狗的事 非常对不起 所有事
I'm sorry about the dog. Everything.

296
00:16:58,753 --> 00:17:00,471
对不起
I'm sorry.

297
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,846
嗨 女士!
Hey, lady!

298
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,228
嗨 等等!
Hey, wait up!

299
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,107
你怎么认识我爸的?      额 其实我不认识
How do you know my dad?        Urn well, I don't really.

300
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,364
只是从基因角度看
Just genetically.

301
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,950
他也是我爸
He's kind of my dad too.

302
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,451
好沉重
Heavy.

303
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:20,949
是啊
Yeah.

304
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,625
他说起过我吗? 菲比?
So, urn, did he ever talk about me? Phoebe?

305
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,373
没有 但是他其实什么都不说的
No, but he didn't really talk about anything.

306
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,079
哦
Oh.

307
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,206
除了高跷
Except stilts.

308
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,710
高跷?      对 他喜欢踩高跷
Stilts?        Yeah. he loved stilts.

309
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,889
有一次我在楼上从我妈的包里面偷烟
One time, I was upstairs stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse...

310
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,888
然后 忽然间我向外看...
and, uh, all of a sudden I look over...

311
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,895
我爸的脑袋正一蹦一跳地经过窗口
and there's Dad's head, bobbing past the window.

312
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:51,191
在他脸上有很开心的笑 他还向我挥手
He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving

313
00:17:51,191 --> 00:17:53,812
因为他踩高跷的时候总是很高兴
because he was always happiest when he was on his stilts.

314
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,945
哇噢      是的
Wow.        Yeah.

315
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,443
我不知道怎么玩那东西
I don't know what to do with that.

316
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,654
我也不知道
Me neither

317
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,792
那么 你就是我的姐姐?      是的
So are you, like, my big sister?        Yeah.

318
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,917
那太好了 你可以给我买啤酒
This is huge. You can buy me beer

319
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,003
我不会买啤酒给你      哦
I'm not gonna.        Oh.

320
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,800
但是你知道什么事情很酷么? 
But you know what's cool though?

321
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,440
如果你有叫皮特的朋友 我就可以说
Okay If you had a friend named Pete, I could say

322
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,718
"我认识皮特 他是我弟弟的朋友"
"I know Pete. He's friends with my brother."

323
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,476
我有个叫马克的朋友      那也可以
I got a friend named Mark.        That'll work too.

324
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,227
酷 真不错
Cool. All right.

325
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:32,316
或许 偶尔我可以给你电话
So maybe, you know, I could give you a call sometime.

326
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,192
我们可以聊聊什么的
We could talk or something.

327
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,738
没问题 那没问题      好的
Yeah, that'd be okay.        All right.

328
00:18:36,738 --> 00:18:38,050

Okay yeah.        Okay, all right.

330
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,621
那么 高跷是吧?
So, urn, stilts, huh?

331
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,378
如果你愿意 我可以带你到后面 
Yeah Hey you know, If you want, I can take you around back

332
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,293
看他的脑袋是在哪里撞到排水槽的
and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter

333
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,290
好啊
Okay.

334
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:59,385
我们做到了 我们来到这里 站在我们的领地上
We did it. We're here. We are standing our ground.

335
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,691
弄杯咖啡要花多长的时间?
How long does coffee take?

336
00:19:02,691 --> 00:19:04,504
你能不能快点! 快点!
Would you come on? Come on!

谢谢
Thank you.

338
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,769
我们做到了      我想我们已经证明了我们的能力
Ah, there we go.        I think we proved our point.

339
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,820
你烫到嘴了?      感觉不到舌头了
You burn your mouth?        Can not feel my tongue.

340
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,159
流氓! 超级流氓!
Bullies! Big bullies!

341
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,872
哦 看看谁在这儿 是小不点们
Oh. Look who's here. It's the weenies.

342
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,335
我们那天没说清楚么?
Did we not make ourselves clear the other day?

343
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,919
那就是我们来的原因
Yes That's why we're here.

344
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,680
对 我们站立在我们的领地上
Yes, we're standing our ground.

345
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,845
显然
Apparently.

346
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,767
我们来吧 哇哦哦
Let's do this already. Whoa, whoa.

347
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,488
你有什么 一个武器?
What'd you got there, a weapon?

348
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,932
这是只好表 我不想碎在你的肋骨上
A nice watch. I don't want to break it on your ribs.

349
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,441
好 我们开始吧
All right, let's do this.

350
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,753
我有问题 如果我不在乎我的手表
Question, If I don't care about my watch,

351
00:19:59,753 --> 00:20:01,815
我能用来作为武器吗?
can I use it as a weapon?

352
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,550
什么意思?      这很尖锐 是金属的
What do you mean?        It's sharp, it's metal.

353
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,245
我想这能用来造成严重伤害
I think I can do, you know, some serious damage with it.

354
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,913
不行 你不能用你的表
No, you can't use your watch.

355
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,286
好吧
Okay.

356
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,868

358
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:19,378
我们把所有的钥匙和表放在帽子里 帽子放到那边
We'll put all keys and watches in the hat, over there.

359
00:20:19,378 --> 00:20:20,549
好么?      好吧

00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,220
好了 来吧
All right, come on, man. Let's do it!

361
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,891
在我忘了之前问一句 我们打脸吗?
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?

362
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,968
当然打脸了 为什么不打脸?
Of course we're hitting faces. Why wouldn't you hit faces?

363
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,430
周一我要上班 我有个很重要的演讲
Well because I have to work on Monday. I have a big presentation.

364

事实上 明天我要展示那个公寓
Actually, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow

365
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,946
不打脸算是个好主意
and, uh, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.

366
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,823
好的 不打脖子以上
Okay, nothing from the neck up.

367
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,571
好的
All right.

368
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,823
或是腰以下
Or the waist down.

369
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,492
戴娜正在排卵期      真的么? 你们又在试了?
Dana's ovulating.        Oh, really? You guys trying again?

Yeah.

371
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,619
我直说了吧 我们就是指中间这部分?
Let me get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?

372
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,500
来呀!      喂! 喂! 哇哦!

You want a piece of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standing here!

374
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,968

老天 太神奇了 刚才真是太不可思议了
God, that was amazing. That was incredible.

377
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,394
你们狠狠揍了那家伙一下! 
You guys, you guys kicked butt!

378
00:21:15,394 --> 00:21:16,362
我们? 你们才厉害
Us? What about you guys?

379
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:19,024
你从后面 "砰" 给了那家伙一下
You really, bing, gave it to old Mr. Clean back there.

380
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,561
那可是个大家伙      对 他是个大家伙 不是吗?
He was a big guy.        Yeah, he was, wasn't he?

381
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,196
我哪知道 我错过了所有的事情
I wouldn't know, having missed everything.

382
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,607
别这么说自己
Oh, don't do that to yourself.

383
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,737
我们每个人都有可能被那小女孩的跳绳绊倒的
Any one of us could have tripped over that little girl's jump rope.

384
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,288
嗯 听着 兄弟们 我们?
So listen, guys, are we, uh?

Okay, so can I have my hat back?

388
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,006
不行
No.

389
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,238
