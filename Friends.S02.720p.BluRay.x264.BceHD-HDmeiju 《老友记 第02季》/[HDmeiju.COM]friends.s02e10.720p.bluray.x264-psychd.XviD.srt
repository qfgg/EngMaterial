00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,295
乔伊 你可以慢一点吗?
Joey, would you slow down?

2
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:10,378
报纸不会在凌晨一点就卖光的
They're not gonna be sold out of papers at 1:00 in the morning.

3
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:13,043
我好兴奋 第一次有对我的剧评
I'm excited. I've never gotten reviewed before.

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:16,801
你国王演得太精彩了 我很欣赏你 真的
You were so amazing as the king. I'm really impressed. I was.

5
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,299
不过你知道吗
Although, you know what?

6
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,010
我觉得你下次得考虑穿条内裤
You might wanna consider wearing underwear next time.

7
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,930
因为当你登上宝座的时候 大家都能看到你的...
Yeah, cuz when you down sat on your throne, you could kind of see your...

00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,773

"The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction..."

11
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:38,866
"是乔伊崔比亚尼 对国王毫无技巧的诠释
"was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king."

12
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:42,925
别灰心啦 这只是一家之见
Okay, look, that is one guy's opinion, all right?

13
00:00:42,925 --> 00:00:44,449
菲比 念你的      好
Pheebs, read yours.        Okay.

拜托哪位大哥念下别家的报纸好吗
Does anybody have one from a different paper?

16
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,300
罗斯 念你的
Ross, read yours.

17
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,336
我不想念
I don't want to.

18
00:00:56,974 --> 00:01:00,341
乔伊 他们不知道自己在说什么
Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.

19
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:00,811
就是说呀
Yeah.

20
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:01,846
也许他们说的是有道理的
Maybe they do.

21
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:05,062
哥在演艺圈混了十年了 还没混出什么名堂
I've been doing this 10 years, and I haven't gotten anywhere.

22
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,438
不是因为我烂是什么
There's gotta be a reason.

23
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,724
别这样嘛 就当现在是在交学费
Oh, come on, man, you're just, uh, you're just paying your dues.

24
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,105
不 这真的是太难了
No, no, no. It's... it's too hard.

25
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,232
这不值得 我不干了
It's not worth it. I quit.

26
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,688
不是吧      你疯了
What?        That's crazy.

27
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,274
等等 别急
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, one minute. Wait a minute.

28
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:20,243
这评论包你听了回心转意
I believe this will change your mind.

小时候 我的梦想是当兽医
When I was little, I wanted to be a veterinarian.

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,007
但后来我发现 兽医得把手伸进那些动物的身体里
But then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.

39
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,639
哎...
Hi...

40
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,357
嘿
Hey.

41
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,392
怎么啦
Are... are you okay?

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,270
没什么 也就是个水深火热的一天
Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work, you know?

43
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:34,999
一副剑龙的骨架倒下来 困住了一个孩子
A stegosaurus fell over, trapped a kid.

44
00:02:37,172 --> 00:02:40,445
哇哦 我认得这件夹克 是搞笑巴比的
Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, the Fun Bobby's jacket!

45
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,777
他在哪儿 他在这儿 对不对
Where is he? What... he's here, isn't he?

46
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,782
你猜呀      别耍我
Maybe.        Don't toy with me.

47
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,155
盖勒!      嘿 搞笑巴比
Geller!        Hey, Fun Bobby.

48
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,038
嘿 你有去健身哦
Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?

49
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,288
才没有
Not at all.

50
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,002
我爱这家伙
I love this guy.

51
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,838
知道你和我妹妹复合真是太高兴了
I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister.

52
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,168
我也是      我错过了什么 快说
You and me both.        So, what'd I miss, what'd I miss? Come on.

53
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,720
我们只是想让乔伊好过一点
Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.

54
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,216
要不要我把你抱起来
Hey, do you need me to pick you up?

55
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:05,716
不 我没事 真的
No, I'm all right, man, really.

56
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,301
不 我要把你抱起来
No, I'm picking you up.

57
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,803
不 说真的 真的不用...
Hey, no, seriously. I don't need you to pick me...

58
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,487
好吧 这招还是很有用
All right, it still works.

59
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:18,353
好啦 在我走之前 还有谁想让我抱起来的
Okay, now, before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up?

60
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,988
我还是走好了
I'm still gonna go.

61
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,550
好啦 待会儿见 宝贝儿
Okay, I'll... I'll see you later, babe.

62
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:28,159
我们要公开亲热 你们可以回避一下
Public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes.

63
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,372
再见      再见      待会儿见
See you.        Bye.        See you later.

64
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,590
搞笑巴比真棒
Fun Bobby is so great.

65
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:40,918
可不是嘛
Oh, isn't he?

66
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,843
我觉得这次我们是有未来的
Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him.

67
00:03:43,943 --> 00:03:45,843
他让我觉得很开心
I mean he just makes me feel so good.

68
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,092
这两个月我一直感觉很糟
And I've been feeling so lousy, you know, this last couple of months.

69
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:49,392
既没工作也没爱情
No job, no boyfriend.

70
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,845
但至少现在我有了一样
Well, at least my cup is half full.

71
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,689
有了爱...情
Half full of looooove.

72
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,938
为了庆祝我们的两周庆
And for our two-week anniversary

73
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,938
周末他要带我去他表哥的小木屋
he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.

74
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,114
爱...的小屋
Cabin of looooove.

75
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,573
我们今晚喝了好多酒
We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.

76
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,288
不是吧 我才喝了两杯
Really? I only had two glasses.

77
00:04:09,388 --> 00:04:10,578
我只喝了一杯
I just had a glass.

78
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,349
我两杯
Two.

79
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:12,449
我就一杯
I had one glass.

80
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,458
我用这个可爱的...写着 "我在自然历史
I had about a mug full in this lovely...

81
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,371
博物馆看到骨头了" 的马克杯喝了一杯
"I got boned at the Museum of Natural History" mug.

82
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,792
这么说的话 最多两瓶 
Okay, so that's... that's what, two bottles.

83
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,465
可是这里有五个空酒瓶
And yet somehow we went through five?

84
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,310
原来如此
Oooooh.

85
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,763
对噢
Oh!

86
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,851
那又怎样 他只不过今晚喝多了
So what? So he drank a lot tonight.

87
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,271
是呀 但我现在回想起来
Yeah, but, you know, now that I think about it

88
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:46,317
搞笑巴比从来酒不离手
I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.

89
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,618
对啊
Yeah. Oh, oh, yeah, you know

90
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,747
你们有没有注意过 他故事的开头总是
Did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um...

91
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,291
"我当时醉醺醺的" 或是 "我们都喝高了"
"Okay, I was so wasted" or "Oh, we were so bombed"

92
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:59,831
又或是 "醒来时 发现我在康州的一个垃圾站里"
Or, um, oh oh, "So I wake up and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut."

93
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,752
摩妮卡 你们约会时他有不喝酒的时候吗
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?

94
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,680
没有 但那只是恰巧我们去的地方都会喝酒
Well, we just happen to go to a lot of places where you might drink.

95
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:12,100
我是说比如品酒会 去了总要喝上一杯吧
I mean, how do you go to a wine-tasting without having a drink?

96
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,933
还有夜店 或者是...
Or, or to a club, or to the...

97
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,438
动物园
zoo.

98
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:23,816
谢啦 瑞秋 这里面有脱脂牛奶吗
Thanks. Rach, does this have nonfat milk?

99
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,322
呃... 不知道 你尝尝看
Ehhhummmm, I... I don't know, why don't you taste it?

100
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,031
没有
Mm, no.

101
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,116
太迟啦 不能换了 你已经喝过啦
Oh, well, too late, sorry, you already had some.

102
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,827
我们把它弄成爱尔兰式咖啡 怎么样
What do you say we make these, uh, coffees, Irish?

103
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,589
呃... 我要蛋糕!
Um, cake!

104
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,552
对 我们来吃点蛋糕
Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake.

105
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:50,800
那什么
You know what

106
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,142
最近你似乎把太多的东西都弄成了爱尔兰风味的
it seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.

107
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,896
我也想弄成比利时风味的
Well, I would make them Belgian

108
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:58,130
但是这华夫饼很难塞进酒壶
but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.

109
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,648
拜托 巴比
Bobby.

110
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:01,854
好吧
Yeah, okay.

111
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,441
听着 这或许不关我的事
Look, maybe this is none of my business,

112
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:05,983
或许又和我有关 我不清楚
or, maybe it is, I don't know.

113
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:09,024
但我有点担心你
But, um, I'm kind of worried about you.

114
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:10,799
好吧 是这样
Okay, look

115
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:13,699
这不是第一次有人和我提这事了
this isn't the first time somebody said something to me about this.

116
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,568
但我总是为自己找些借口
But, I don't know, I always made excuses about it

117
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:18,368
像 "我只是交际一下"
like "I'm just a social drinker."

118
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,085
或者是 "拜托 国旗日总得喝点吧"
Or "Hey, come on, it's Flag Day."

119
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,002
那你现在有什么想法
So, what are you saying now?

120
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,384
我想说的是...
I guess I'm saying...

121
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,003
我会试着戒酒
I'll try and quit.

122
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,388
我挺喜欢你担心我的样子
I kinda like that you worry about me.

123
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,018
发生什么事啦
So, what's going on?

124
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,556
我呢 会试着戒酒
I, am gonna try and quit drinking.

125
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,356
这是为什么
Oh! Why?

126
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,191
嘿      嘿
Hey.        Hey.

127
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,110
嘿      嘿
Hey.        Hey.

128
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,948
猜猜谁又回演艺圈了
Guess who's back in show business.

129
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,280
洛恩格林吗
Ooh, ooh. Lorne Greene?

130
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,164
不 菲比 不是 知道为什么吗 因为他早死了
No, no, Pheebs. You know why? Because he's dead.

131
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,624
不是吧
Oh, no.

132
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,045
好吧 我猜这似乎有点喜忧参半
Okay, I guess this is gonna seem bittersweet now

133
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,838
是乔伊 就是他
but Joey, that's who!

134
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,499
太棒了      真的吗
Oh, yay!        Really?

135
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,175
是真的 经纪人要我去 "我们的日子" 试镜
Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for "Days of Our Lives" !

136
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,171
帅呆了
Kick ass!

137
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:14,742
我们得庆祝下
Oh, well, we have to celebrate.

138
00:07:14,842 --> 00:07:17,009
知道我们该干嘛吗 开一个肥皂剧主题的派对
You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.

139
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,628
对 我们可以睡一块儿
Hey, yeah. We could all sleep together

140
00:07:19,628 --> 00:07:20,987
然后其中一人可以忘掉这一切
and then one of us could get amnesia.

141
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,686
瑞秋 你几点下班 今晚一起活动
Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.

142
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:32,233
其实我已经下班了 但我有其他打算了
Um, well, actually, I'm already done. Ahem, but I... I kind of got plans.

143
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,905
你居然还有其他朋友
You have other friends?

144
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,914
我有个约会
Yeah, I, uh, I have a date.

145
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,000
什么
What?

146
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,116
跟男人?
With a man?

147
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,752
干嘛 我有约会很奇怪吗
What? What is so strange about me having a date?

148
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,000
那罗斯怎么办?
What about Ross?

149
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,881
我的意思是 你还在为他列的关于你的单子生气吗
I mean, are you still mad at him cuz he made that list about you?

150
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,506
不 我没有生他气
No, no, I'm not mad at him.

151
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,303
我再也不会对他有什么感情了
I'm... I'm not really anything at him anymore.

152
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,769
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

153
00:07:55,969 --> 00:07:56,969
我也不清楚
I don't know, I...

154
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,063
不管我以前对罗斯是什么感觉 但现在...
What... whatever I was feeling, I'm...

155
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:02,263
不是了
not.

156
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,063
可你们就差一步啊
But you guys came so close.

157
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,050
我明白 抱歉 伙计们
Oh I know, I'm sorry, you guys.

158
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,772
你们要试着接受
You're just gonna have to get used to the fact

159
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,238
我和罗斯已经分手了这个事实
that I will not be dating Ross.

160
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,112
他来了 嗨
Here he is. Hi.

161
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,610
伙计们 这是洛斯
Guys, this is Russ.

162
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,578
嗨...
Hi...

163
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:34,094
不不不 我不是说你没才华 你很有才华
No, no no no no. I'm not saying you're not talented. You're very talented.

164
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:38,507
只是那只鸟死了之后 剩下的戏就很少了
It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left.

165
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,053
亲爱的 饶了我吧 好吗
Oh, honey, give me a break, will you?

166
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,553
等下 我待会儿打给你
Oh, oh. I'll talk to you later.

167
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,637
瞧瞧 是我最爱的客户来了
Well, there's my favorite client.

168
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,432
告诉我 亲爱的 试镜结果怎么样
So tell me, darling, how was the audition?

169
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:51,653
我觉得挺顺利的 他们要我周四去复试
Well, I think it went pretty well. I... I got a callback for Thursday.

170
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,948
乔伊 你看过我欣喜若狂的表情吗
Joey! Have you ever seen me ecstatic?

171
00:08:55,343 --> 00:08:56,156
没有
No.

172
00:08:56,356 --> 00:08:58,256
那就让你见识见识
Well, here it is.

173
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,118
不错 呃 是这样 有件事我想和你谈谈
Okay, uh, listen, there's something I want to talk to you about.

174
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,787
那位电台选角的女士
The network casting lady...

175
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:09,670
罗莉很可爱吧
Oh isn't Lori a doll?

176
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,915
对 她很棒 但是...
Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but...

177
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:16,963
我觉得她好像... 对我有点意思
I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me.

178
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,557
我觉得如果我想得到那个角色 我就得 你懂的...
And, I definitely would get the part if I were to... you know...

179
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,732
如果我愿意单枪赴会
If I would've sent the little general in.

180
00:09:27,782 --> 00:09:28,599
天呐
Oh.

181
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,608
明白了 好吧 我现在就打个电话
I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here

182
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,657
把事情搞清楚 看看究竟是怎么回事
and we'll find out what's going on and straighten it out.

183
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,944
喂 你好 麻烦让罗莉接电话
Yeah, hi. Lori, please.

184
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,869
亲爱的
Hi, darling.

185
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,126
乔伊崔比亚尼适不适合 出租车司机的角色
So how about Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver?

186
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,078
他表现很棒吧
Isn't he terrific?

187
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,913
嗯哼...
Uh-huh...

188
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,173
对
Uh-huh.

189
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,877
好的 美女 待会儿聊
Okay, doll, talk to you later.

190
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,171
对 她要潜规则你
Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her

191
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,228
怎么啦?
What's the matter?

192
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:05,093
还不是巴比
Fun Bobby.

193
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,644
怎么了 他不是没喝酒吗
What? Isn't he sober?

194
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,266
确实没喝
Oh, he's sober all right.

195
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,225
只是我发现 巴比搞笑是有原因的
Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.

196
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,149
噢 明白了
Ah... okay.

197
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,440
拿去吧 亲爱的
All right, here you go, sweetie.

198
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,550
谢谢 要不要听个搞笑的事
Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?

199
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,661
天啊 当然
Oh, God, yes.

200
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:30,487
这附近的五金店一过半夜就全关门了
There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.

201
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,296
好好笑哦
That is funny.

202
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,633
几天前的晚上我要买把榔头
I needed to buy a hammer the other night

203
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,170
我就出门到附近逛逛
and I'm out walking around the neighborhood.

204
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,800
但显然...
But apparently...

205
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:47,487
这附近的五金店一过半夜就全关门了
there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.

206
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,150
呃 亲爱的 你现在不是该去面试了吗
Uh, say, honey, don't you have to be at your interview now?

207
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,776
是啊
Oh, yeah.

208
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,782
再见各位
See you guys.

209
00:10:59,982 --> 00:11:00,782
再见...
Bye...

210
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,697
无聊到令人发指的巴比
Ridiculously dull Bobby.

211
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,506
无法想象
Oh, my God.

212
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:08,039
还没那么糟啦
He's not that bad.

213
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:12,210
没那么糟? 你没听到他买榔头的事吗
Not that bad? Did you not hear the hammer story?

214
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,175
好吧 别那么挑剔嘛
Okay, okay, don't get all squinky.

215
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,092
也许你该亲身经历才会觉得那个故事好笑啊
Maybe, it was just the kind of story where you had to be there.

216
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,635
我会亲身经历的
But I'm gonna be there.

217
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,255
我下半辈子都会
For the rest of my life.

218
00:11:24,238 --> 00:11:27,133
我没办法跟他分手 是我要他戒酒的
I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking.

219
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,512
他变得无趣完全是因为我
He's dull because of me.

220
00:11:28,612 --> 00:11:29,769
嘿 别这么说
All right, don't say that.

221
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:33,348
也许他一向很无趣 你只是... 那个什么
He's probably always been dull. You just... you know...

222
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,565
把他从无趣中解放出来了
set it free.

223
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:37,488
嗨
Hi.

chat with your, uh...

229
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:54,472
似乎是你朋友的人聊聊天
friend-type people.

230
00:11:59,377 --> 00:12:00,177

你知道你在做什么吧
Okay, so you know what you're doing, right?

234
00:12:05,556 --> 00:12:06,469
服务员?
Uh... waitressing?

235
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,217
好吧 我的意思是 呃...
Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, um...

236
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:13,519
洛斯有没有让你想起某人
doesn't... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?

237
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,800
鲍伯萨格特?
Huh, Bob Saget?

238
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,601

243
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,369
我... 好吧 是这样...
I... okay...

244
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:28,578
她不开心是因为
She's just upset because she, uh

245
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,831
她今早把一只蜘蛛涂在吐司上了 没注意吃掉了
She buttered a spider into her toast this morning.

246
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:32,661
了解
Mm-hm.

247
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,995

这其实挺好的
You know, this is actually good...

264
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,198
因为万一我们失去罗斯 还有个备胎
because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.

265
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:17,752

那好 我要去 呃 买杯饮料
Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. Heh.

271
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,602
很高兴 呃 认识你      彼此
Uh, it was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.        Ditto.

272
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:46,191
我 呃 我见过 呃 洛斯了
I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.

273
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,865
好啊
Oh.

274
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:51,050
我怎么不知道 呃 我们还能和其他人约会
Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.

275
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,205
既然我们没有在交柱 所以...      哈
Well, we're not seeing each other, so...        Huh.

276
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,868
那好 我跟你说哦 我们馆里有个女的
Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum

277
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,087
负责蛾类还有其他...
who's curator of moths and other, uh...

278
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,294
有翅生物
winged things...

279
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:09,676
众所周知 她痴迷于我 就像是
who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me, much like a...

280
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,552
你 你知道的
well, you know. Ahem.

281
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,425
至今我一直跟她保持距离 但如果你要这样的话
Well, so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal

282
00:14:15,425 --> 00:14:16,561
是的 没错
Well, yeah, this is the deal.

283
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,767
好吧 晚上玩得开心      谢谢
Okay, well, um, have a nice evening.        Thank you.

284
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,899
洛斯 可以走了吗      走吧
Um, Russ, you ready?        Yeah.

285
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,278
再见      再见
Bye.        Bye.

286
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,732
她约会了?
She's dating?

287
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,405
她就这么开始约会了?
She's dating?

288
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,745
对 但你看到她在跟谁约会了吗?
Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?

289
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,451
什么意思
What do you mean?

290
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,085
你看不出来吗
Do you not see it?

291
00:14:38,385 --> 00:14:39,206
看个球啊
See what?

292
00:14:39,206 --> 00:14:42,362
真搞不懂 她看中那傻帽哪一点
I don't know what she sees in... innnnn that goober.

293
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,717
那家伙讲完一句话 差不多要
And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh...

294
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,841
拜托 难道要 一个礼拜吗
uh, hello... a... week, to get out a sentence.

295
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,550
是啊 烦死人了 是吧
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?

296
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,638
对啊
Yeah.

297
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,935
嘿      嘿
Hey.        Hey.

298
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,987
喔噢 怎么回事
Whoa, whoa.

299
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,031
我猜你是没拿到那个角色
So I'm guessing you didn't get the part

300
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,534
还是意大利打电话来说它饿了
or uh... Italy called and said it was hungry?

301
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,279
不 我要的话那角色肯定是我的
Well, the part's mine if I want it.

302
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:17,868
不是吧
Oh, my God.

303
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,826
没错 只要我愿意被选角的女士潜规则
Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.

304
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,247
哦 不是...
Oh, my...

305
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,203
吧
God?

306
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:28,584
这十年来我一直在等 像这样的机会 钱德 十年啊
Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this, Chandler, ten years!

307
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:32,512
那可是 "我们的日子"  那真的会在电视上播的
I mean, "Days of Our Lives". That's actually on television.

308
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,843
那你要怎么做
So, what are you gonna do?

309
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,550
我可以跟她上床 但是...
I guess I could sleep with her, I mean...

310
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,177
我怎么能那么做
How can I do that?

311
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,227
我有本立体书 我能从上面知道一切关于性爱的事
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.

312
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,187
我从来没为了一个角色跟别人上过床
I've never slept with someone for a part.

313
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:47,519
那她...
Well, is she...

314
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,175
抱歉
Sorry.

315
00:15:51,175 --> 00:15:52,126
没事儿
It's alright.

316
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,987
她漂亮吗      好看
Is she good-looking?        Yeah.

317
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:57,988
非常漂亮 如果我是在酒吧之类的地方碰到她
She's totally good-looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar or something...

318
00:15:57,988 --> 00:16:00,031
我一定会请她吃早餐
I'd be buying her breakfast.

319
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,487
跟她上床之后 你明白吧
You know, after having slept with her.

320
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,634
或许这没什么大不了的
You know, maybe this isn't such a big deal.

321
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:15,000
依我看 你不但能得到一份好工作
I mean, the way that I see it is, you get a great job and

322
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,341
还能有性生活
you get to have sex.

323
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:21,050
你想想 再加上一棵树一个胖子 就是在过圣诞节了
You know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy, and you've got Christmas.

324
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:28,189
我只是不想用那样的方式得到这份工作 明白吗
I just... I just don't think that I want it that way, though, you know?

325
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,175
我是说 如果有一天我真的成功了
I mean, let's say I do make it, all right?

326
00:16:31,175 --> 00:16:34,445
我会怀疑那到底是因为我的才华
I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent...

327
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:37,988
还是因为 你懂的 我的这杆长枪
or because of... you know, the little general.

328
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,740
你以前不是用短枪的吗
Didn't you used to call it "the little major" ?

329
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,550
是啊 但在丹妮丝帝马可后 我就把它升级了
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.

330
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,719
要来点喝的吗
Can I get you something from the bar?

331
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:55,211
好 我要点杯酒
Yes, I would like something.

332
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,306
还是不了 谢谢
No, no, thank you.

333
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,488
没关系 你想喝酒的话 我没问题
If... if you wanna drink, it's okay with me.

334
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:02,863
我必须要习惯这样
I've got to get used to it.

335
00:17:02,863 --> 00:17:05,222
不 真的 我也觉得我说的不合时宜
No, no, really. I... I wouldn't feel right about it.

336
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,976
来杯水吧 谢谢
Just some water, please.

337
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,652
我冰箱里的灯坏了...  
So the light went out in my refrigerator...

338
00:17:09,702 --> 00:17:11,566
来杯威士忌加冰块跟柠檬
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.

339
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:13,984
抱歉
I'm sorry.

340
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,574
这游戏很有趣吧 罗斯?
Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross?

341
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,159
再做一个好不好 洛斯?
Wanna do another one? Huh, Russ?

342
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,823
好吧 11个字母
Okay... eleven letters

343
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,301
元素周期第101位 以 "ium" 结尾
atomic element number 101, ends in "ium".

344
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,378
镝
Dysprosium.

345
00:17:29,872 --> 00:17:30,872
镝你个头
Dysprosium.

346
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,589
应该是钔
Try mendelevium.

347
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,362
小熊维尼二号答对了
And Weenie number two has it.

348
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:36,846
除非第九列的
Unless, of course nine-down

349
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:40,503
"白缎骑士" 是杜迪布鲁斯唱的
"Knights in White Satin" was sung by the Doody Blues.

350
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,095
你看不出来吗 你真的看不出来吗
You don't see it? You actually don't see it?

351
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:46,915
看出来什么
What?

352
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:49,523
你在跟罗斯约会
Okay, honey, you're dating Ross.

353
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,483
不 菲比 我跟洛斯约会
No, Pheebs, I'm dating Russ.

354
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,153
洛斯就是罗斯 洛斯 罗斯
Russ is Ross. Russ, Ross.

355
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,696
史帝夫 大夫
Steve, sleeve.

356
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,445
拜托 哪有人叫大夫的
Okay, no one is named Sleeve.

357
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,201
菲比 你到底在瞎说什么啊
Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about?

358
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,414
抱歉 除了他们的名字以外
Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry

359
00:18:03,614 --> 00:18:05,498
我没看出还有什么相似的地方
I do not see what you're seeing.

360
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,874
老实告诉你吧 是赌圣 不是赌胜
For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.

361
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,670
你敢不敢再蠢点
You could not be more wrong.

362
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,999
你想怎么读就怎么读 但你仍然是错的
You could try, but you would not be successful.

363
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:19,553
我先倒杯咖啡 然后再回来看你们互插双眼
Okay, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.

364
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,875
我知道问题在哪儿了
I know what your problem is.

365
00:18:23,075 --> 00:18:24,217
哦是吗 你知道?
Oh you do, do you?

366
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,238
你嫉妒了
Mm-hm, you're jealous.

367
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,980
嫉妒什么
Uh, of... of what?

368
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,737
你嫉妒我是个真正的医生
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.

369
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,479
别闹了 你只是个牙龈医生
Hey, you're a doctor of gums.

370
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:40,112
那是能够研究的最小的人体器官
That's the smallest body part you can major in.

371
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,570
就像是第一天教你用牙线 第二天你就能毕业了
It's like, day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.

372
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,500
嘿 你给我听好了
Hey, you listen...

373
00:18:44,554 --> 00:18:45,904
不 让我说完
No no, let me finish.

374
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:46,910
不 你让我说完
No, let me finish.

375
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,124
不 你让我说完...
No, you let me fini...

376
00:18:50,824 --> 00:18:51,900
嗨
Hi.

377
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:52,836
嗨
Hi.

378
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,335
咦
Ew.

379
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,217
噢 不
Ew, ew, ew.

380
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,415
乔伊走时有没有说打算怎么做
Did Joey say what he was gonna do when he left?

381
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:05,015
没
No.

382
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,093
我想他自己也不知道
I don't even think he knew.

383
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,850
你会为了一份好工作而献身吗
Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?

384
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,606
不清楚 得看和谁
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?

385
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,274
我
Me.

386
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,187
我为什么要跟你上床
Why would I have to sleep with you?

387
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,652
你要这工作就得听我的
It's my game. You want the job or not?

388
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,155
嗨      嘿
Hi.        Hey.

389
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,330
早上好
Good morning.

390
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,571
去哪儿
Where you going?

391
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,616
我要跟巴比去小木屋度周末 记得吗
Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?

392
00:19:29,656 --> 00:19:30,331
对哦
Oh.

393
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,831
拿那么多酒干嘛
What's with all the bottles of liquor?

394
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,459
怎么了 巴比又开始喝酒了吗
What's going on? Is... uh, Bobby drinking again?

395
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,128
不 这不是给他的 是给我准备的
Oh, no no, this is not for him, this is for me.

396
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,553
这样他既能继续戒酒
That way, he's still sober

397
00:19:40,603 --> 00:19:43,262
而我又能觉得他关于鞋带的笑话好笑多了
but I find his stories about shoelaces more amusing.

398
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:51,228
天呐 他连敲门都这么无趣
Uh, God, even his knock is boring.

399
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,401
我马上就好
Hi, I'll be ready in just a second.

400
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:57,109
呃 我可以跟你谈一谈吗
Uh, could I talk to you a minute?

401
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,436
好啊
Sure.

402
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,916
这真的很难开口
This is really hard for me to say.

403
00:20:02,016 --> 00:20:03,734
天呐 你又喝酒了吗
Oh, God, you fell off the wagon.

404
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,159
不 不是
Oh, no, no.

405
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,573
是关于你的
It's about you.

406
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,324
我怎么了
What about me?

407
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,081
我想你或许有酗酒问题
I think you may have a drinking problem.

408
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,828
不 这些是...
What, these?

409
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:19,248
擦伤口用的
No, these are, urmn, for cuts and scrapes.

410
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,011
听着 我现在没办法
Look, I am just not strong enough

411
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:24,629
扯入一段相互依赖的感情中
to be in a codependent relationship right now, okay?

412
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,016
该死
Oh, shoot.

413
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,020
无论如何 希望我们还能当朋友
Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.

414
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,768
好吧
Okay.

415
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,438
保重
Take care.

416
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:41,153
嗯 你也是      再见
Okay, you too.        Bye.

417
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,692
怎么了
What happened?

418
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,128
我们...分手了
Well, we... we kinda broke up.

419
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,243
噢
Awwwwwwww.

420
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,669
这些酒谁要
Does anybody want these?

421
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,083
我要一瓶
I'll take one.

422
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:03,626
有时候我喜欢拿着这种东西 假装自己是个巨人
Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.

423
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:11,300
嘿      复试结果怎么样
Hey.        Hey. How'd the callback go?

424
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,285
真不敢相信 我刚进去她就开始对我上下其手
Uh, it was unbelievable. I walked in there and she was all over me.

425
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:16,425
那你怎么做的
So, what'd you do?

426
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:17,226
我办不到
Well, I couldn't do it.

427
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,401
我告诉她我不想这样拿到那个角色
I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.

428
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:20,234
好样的      哇哦
Good for you!        Whoa!

429
00:21:20,604 --> 00:21:23,020
等等 等等 但我离开她办公室之后
Oh, wait, wait, wait. But then after I left her office

430
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:26,908
她追我追到电梯 说要给我一个更重要的角色
she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.

431
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,000
然后呢
So, and?

432
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,907
然后 各位面前站的是德瑞克雷莫瑞医生
So... you are now looking at Dr.Drake Ramoray, neurosurgeon

433
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,117
一位至少会在四集中出镜的神经外科医师!
recurring in at least four episodes!

434
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,785
太棒了!
All right!

435
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,749
好了 我要去洗澡了
All right, I gotta go shower

436
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,518
嗨...
Hi...

437
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,349
哦 嘿      嗨
Oh, hey.        Hi.

438
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,936
你们知道我被瑞秋甩了吧
I guess you guys heard Rachel dumped me.

439
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,519
是啊 真遗憾啊 老兄
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

440
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:04,050
她只说是因为我会让她想起另外一个人
Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody.

441
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,128
你们知道那人是谁吗
You have any idea who she's talking about?

442
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:10,242
我知道 是鲍伯萨格特
Oh I do, it's... it's Bob Saget.

443
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,037
她讨厌他
She hates him.

444
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,494
嘿      嘿 茱莉
Hey.        Hey, Julie.

445
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,829
嘿 最近怎么样
Hey, how are you doing?

446
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,712
我不清楚 没有了罗斯 的确感觉很怪
Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross

447
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,006
不过我觉得还不错
but, I guess I'm doing okay.

448
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,093
话说回来 我带了一些他的东西...
Actually, I've got some of his stuff that he um...
