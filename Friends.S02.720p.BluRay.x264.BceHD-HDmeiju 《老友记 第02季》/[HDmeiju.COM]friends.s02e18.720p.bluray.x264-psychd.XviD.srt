布莱就是这样子 嘴巴不认输
It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.

但我们永远不会有结果的
But you and I can never be together that way.

6
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:21,139
什么?      有件事我一直没告诉过你
What?        There's something I never told you.

7
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:24,225
我其实是你的同父异母兄弟
I'm actually your half-brother.

8
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,185
什么?
What?

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,191
接下来怎么样了呢?

但却受到了诅咒
But it's cursed.

15
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,001

Pheebs, play with me!        No!

21
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,550
这游戏太荒诞了
This game is grotesque.

22
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,683
把二十个手无寸铁的人 串成一长条...
Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar...

23
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:51,267
被迫无止境地踢足球?

24
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,652
拜托 简直是侵害人权嘛
Hello? Human rights violation.

不用替他们难过 他们踢完球后...

他不太喜欢桌上足球

你跟那个新来的处得不好吗
Are we not getting along with the new boy?

30
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:15,416
也不是 他只是很多时间都在自己的房间里
No,he's all right.He spends most of his time in his room.

31
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,362
或许是因为你还没花时间去了解他
Maybe because you haven't taken time to get to know him.

32
00:02:18,362 --> 00:02:19,802
我们来补救一下
Let's remedy that, shall we?

33
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,052
我们不用补救      有必要 会很好玩的
 We don't need to remedy that.        Oh, yeah, it'll be fun!

What was that?        Hi!

35
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:31,175
我只是在想我们三个人一起喝点啤酒...
I thought it'd be fun if the three of us had beers...

36
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:32,862
彼此认识一下 应该会很不错
and got to know each other

37

Have fun! Bye!         That was so lame.

42
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,335
我知道啊
I know.

43
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,792
好好跟他聊啊
Okay talk to him.

44
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:02,964
你觉得那个赛车手被开了很多罚单还是...?
So you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets or...?

45
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,767
真好笑 那么是谁甩了谁?
Thats good. So who broke up with who?

46
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,678
开什么玩笑?当然是我甩了她
You kidding? I broke up with her.

47
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,524
她真的以为西恩潘是柬埔寨的首都
She actually thought Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.

48
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:20,050
太好笑了 大家都知道 柬埔寨的首都是…
When everybody knows that the capital of Cambodia is...

49
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,524
不是西恩 潘就对了
It's not Sean Penn.

50
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,989
我有一个好笑的
All right, I got a funny one. All right?

51
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,331
我上一个女友 堤莉 我们正在吃早餐
My last girlfriend,Tilly.We'reeating breakfast,right?

52
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:30,498
我做了很多薄煎饼 大约有五十个
I made these pancakes.Like,50 pancakes.

53
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,835
突然间 她转过来对我说 艾迪...
All of a sudden she turns to me and says,"Eddie...

54
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,038
我不想再见到你了
I don't wanna see you anymore."

55
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,083
那就像是 她把手放进我的胸膛里...
It was literally like she had reached into my chest...

56
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:43,112
把心挖出来 把我的生活搞得一团乱
ripped out my heart and smeared it all over my life!

57
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,238
我像是掉进无止境的深渊
There was this incredible abyss and I'm falling.

58
00:03:47,238 --> 00:03:50,238
我不断地往下掉 好像永远不会着地
I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop!

59
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,691
这故事不太好笑 是不是?
That wasn't such a funny story,was it?

60
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,275
坏脾气的老头 说我会尽量
And a crusty old man Said I'll do what I can

61
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,740
其他老鼠开始摇沙铃
And the rest of the rats Played maracas

62
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,624
结束了 晚安
That's it!Thanks!Good night.

63
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,461
菲比还有别的工作 对吧?

68
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,299
我们每次都去你那边过夜
You know how we always stay at your apartment?

69
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,768
今晚或许可以改在我这边啊
I thought tonight we'd stay at my place.

70
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:35,128
我不知道 我没带睡衣
I dont know.I don't have my jammies.

71
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,753
或许你不需要
You don't need them.

72
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,440

我看起来真棒
Oh,I look good.

111
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:59,566
这是真的吗? 你很多台词都是自己写的?
Is this true? That you write a lot of your own lines?

112
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,159
算是啦
Well,kind of, yeah.

113
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,331
记得上星期亚莉发生意外吗?
Remember last week when Alex was in the accident?

114
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,378
原本的台词是...
The line in the script was...

115
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:11,052
"如果不把她送到医院 她就会死掉"
"If we don'tget this woman to a hospital,she's going to die."

116
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:14,298
但是我把它改成 "如果不把她送到医院...
But I made it,"If this woman doesn't get to a hospital...

117
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,428
她就活不成了"
she's not gonna live."

118
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:21,521
噢 我懂你做了什么了
Oh, okay.I see what you did there.

119
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:28,020
你不怕编剧读到这个时会生气吗?
Aren't you afraid the writers will be kind of mad when they read this?

120
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,068
我真的从没想过编剧 剧本总是送到我家
I never thought about the writers.The scripts just come to my house.

121
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,405

which makes the writers look good.So how could they be mad?

124
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,503
很多台词都是自己写的

00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,844
这什么意思? 我从电梯井跌下去?
What does this mean? I fall down an elevator shaft?

129
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,515
我不知道 我只是送剧本的
Uh,I don't know.I just bring the scripts.

132
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,694
你可以签收吗?
Could you sign?

133
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,864
不要!我才不签
No!No way!I'm not signing that!

134
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,371
我不认为这会影响剧情
I dont think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.

135
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,791
他们怎么可以这样对我?
How can they do this to me

136
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,122
好 我要走了
All right,I'm just gonna go.

137
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,878
很遗憾
Sorry.

138
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,224
也没有那么多啦
Well,it wasn't that many guys.

139
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,389
如果你想想 这世上有多少男人的话...
If you consider how many guys there actually are...

140
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,138
比例其实很小
it's a very small percentage.

141
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,103
没什么大不了的 我只是好奇而已
It's not that big a deal. I was just curious.

142
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,022
晚安      晚安 理查
Good night.        Good night, Richard.

143
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,111
祝你好运 摩妮卡
Good luck,Mon.

144
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:57,050
好吧 在我说之前 先说你和几位女性交往过
All right,before I tell you,you tell me how many women you've been with.

145
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:03,031
两个      两个?两个?
Two.         Two? Two?

146
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,450
怎么可能?我的意思是...
How is that possible? I mean...

147
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,752
你知道自己有多帅吗?
have you seen you?

148
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,255
我能说什么呢?
Well I mean,what can I say

149
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:15,632
我和芭芭拉做了三十年的夫妻 我们高中就认识了
I was married to Barbara for 30 years,my high-school sweetheart.

150
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,800
再加上你 就是两个人
Now you. That's two.

151
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,802
那就两个吧
Two it is.

152
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,613
好 该睡觉了 我先去刷牙
Okay,time for bed.I'm gonna brush my teeth.

153
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:26,017
不行 等等!
No,wait a minute now!

154
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,972
别这样 轮到你了
Come on.It's your turn.

155
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,024
快说呀
Oh,come on!

156
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,378
我不需要确切的数字 差不多就行了
You know,I don't need the actual number.Just a ballpark.

157
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:40,112
好 绝对没有棒球场的人多
Okay,it is definitely less than a ballpark.

158
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,704
哇 真庆幸我不是摩妮卡
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.

159
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,667
那还用说
Tell me about it.

160
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,496
那你的神奇数字是多少?
So,what's your magic number?

161
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:58,588
别这样 我交往过的你都认识 两个都知道
Come on,you know everyone Ive been with. All both of them.

162
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,514
嗯 有你
Well,there's you.

163
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,758
最好不要说我是第一个
Better not be doing these in order

164
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,014
好 比利 彼特
Okay,Billy Dreskin,Pete Carny.

165
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,853
巴瑞
Barry.

166
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,143
还有 巴洛
And,Paolo.

167
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,529
是啊 那个托里尼来的蠢蛋
Oh, yes,the weenie from Turinie.

168
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:21,951
噢 亲爱的 你嫉妒保罗吗?
Oh, honey,are you jealous of Paolo?

169
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,781
我跟你在一起 比跟他快乐多了
I'mso much happier with you than I ever was with him.

170
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,036
真的吗?      拜托
Really?        Oh, please.

171
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,286
跟保罗那段根本就不能算
That Paolo thing was barely a relationship.

172
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,613
充其量只是无意义的 野兽的性关系
All it really was was just meaningless,animal sex.

173
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:44,049
嗯 那句话在我脑海里 听起来好很多
Okay,you know,that sounded so much better in my head.

174
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,431
艾迪 我没有和你的前女友上床
Eddie!I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.

175
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,893
真有趣 跟她睡过的人 就会这么说
That's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.

176
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,184
太疯狂了! 她只待了两分钟...
This is nuts! Crazy! She came over for two minutes...

177
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,728
留下鱼缸就走了 就这样
dropped off a fish tank and left! End of story.

178
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,363
巴迪在哪里?      巴迪?
Where's Buddy?         Buddy?

179
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,149
我的鱼 巴迪
My fish,Buddy.

180
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,489
她来的时候没有鱼啊
There was no fish when she dropped it off

181
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,404
噢 真是无法置信!
Oh.this is unbelievable!

182
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:11,160
你先是跟我的前女友上床 再说谎侮辱我的智商...
You sleep with my exgirifriend,insult my intelligence by lying..

183
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,332
然后杀掉我的鱼? 我的巴迪?
then you kill my fish? My Buddy?

184
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,371
我没有杀掉你的鱼
I didn't kill your fish!

185
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,419
听着 艾迪...
Look, Eddie..

186
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,054
看看我在做什么
Would you look at what I'm doing?

187
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,048
绝对不是明智之举
Now that cant be smart.

188
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,638
所以我们把这个家伙从你身上拿开...
So we're just gonna take this guy right off you...

189
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,315
把他放到口袋先生里
and put him here in Mr. Pocket.

190
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,735
来颗橘子吗?
Tangelo?

191
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,988
就这样?你就这么害怕告诉我那庞大的数目?
Thats it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?

192
00:11:50,988 --> 00:11:51,988
是的
oh yeah

193
00:11:51,988 --> 00:11:53,960
那不会太糟啊
Well,that's not bad at all.

194
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,876
我还以为有一整个舰队呢
You had me thinking it was,like,a fleet.

195
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,423
你真的不介意?
You're okay with it?

196
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,334
亲爱的 我没问题
Oh, honey,Im fine.

197
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,882
好 关于你那两个人
Okay,about that two.

198
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,391
什么?
What?

199
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,597
好
All right.

200
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,641
我那两个人怎么了?
What about my two?

201
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,473
只是真的好少喔
It just seems like a really small number

202
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,728
对啊
Right.

203
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,484
你难道没有欲望到处去采花吗?
Don't you have a lot of wild oats to sow?

204
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:27,490
你现在就是那样对我吗? 天啊 我是花吗?
Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh, my God! Am I an oat?

205
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,120
亲爱的 你不是被采的花
Honey, you are not an oat.

206
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:34,163
我也不知道 我不是那种采花大盗
I don't know,I guess I'm just not an oat guy.

207
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,335
我只和我爱的人上床
I've only slept with women I love.

208
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,751
但你只跟两个人上过床
You've only slept with two people.

209
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,427
对
Right.

210
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,854
你知道我也爱你吧?
You know I love you too, right?

211
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,348
我现在知道了
Now I do.

212
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:02,983
罗斯!
Ross!

213
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,693
罗斯 请你听我说
Ross, please listen to me.

214
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:09,076
罗斯 你比巴洛好太多了
Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was.

215
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,367
你关心我 你爱我 你逗我笑
You care about me,you're loving,you make me laugh.

216
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,911
那样的话 我有个主意
If I make you laugh,here's an idea.

217
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:18,578
你就邀请巴洛过来野性一下 我就站在角落...
Invite Paolo to have a romp in the sack,and I'll stand in the corner...

218
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,418
讲些笑话给你听      罗斯!

219
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,004
天啊 罗斯!
God, Ross!

220
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,261
你和我的关系很特别 巴洛和我只是…
What you and I have is special! All Paolo and I ever had was

221
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,862
野兽的性关系?
Animal sex animal sex?

222
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,681
你是什么意思?
So,what are you saying?

223
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,805
我们之间完全没有野性吗?
There's nothing between us "animal" at all?

224
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,979
连一点兽性都没有吗?
There's not even like,a little animal?

225
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,818
连...
Not even like...

226
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,999
花粟鼠性关系都没有?

227
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,948
好 罗斯…
Okay, Ross...

228
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,944
试着听进我说的话
Try to hear me, okay?

229
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,283
嘿 我不会对你说谎
I Hey.Im not gonna lie to you.

230
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,204
跟巴洛很棒      笑话来了
It was good with Paolo.         Knock-knock.

231
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,422
但你和我的关系比那好太多了
But what you and I have is so much better.

232
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:07,009
我们之间有温柔 有亲密 灵犀相通
We have tenderness,we have intimacy,we connect.

233
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,677
是真的 我发誓
You know? I swear

234
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,013
到目前为止...
This is the best...

00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,929
这是我有过最棒的
I have ever had.

236
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,519
直到这一刻
Until now.

237

理查刚刚告诉我他爱我
Richard told me he loved me.

238

00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:30,992
对啊

我只是找不到...      最上面的抽屉
I just cant find...        Top drawer.

242

你为什么要杀掉他的鱼?
Why would you kill his fish?

280

Did they just kill off Joey?         No!

304

We came over as soon as we saw.         How could you not tell us?

我不知道 我希望 没有人会知道
I don't know.I was kind of hoping no one would ever find out.

313
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,320
或许他们有办法让你起死回生
Well,maybe they could find a way to bring you back.

No,they said that when they found my body,my brain was so smashed in...

315
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,837
唯一能救我的人是我

316
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,878
还说这是某种讽刺之类的
Its supposed to be some kind of irony.

317
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,552
但是乔伊 你不会有事的
But Joey,you're gonna be fine.

318
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:46,178
你不需要那个节目 那只是个蠢肥皂剧
You don'tneed that show. It was just a dumb soap opera.

319
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:49,557
这是我这辈子 最棒的事
This was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.

320

我不知道
No.I don't.

326
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,332
这好像你奋斗了一辈子 追求某样东西...
It's like you work your whole life for something...

327
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,705
当你以为你办到的时候...
and you think that when you get it...

328
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,299
永远不会像你想得那么好
it'll never be as good as you thought would be.

329
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,251
不过这个是啊

330
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,219
它改变了一切
It changed everything.

前几天 我去申请信用卡...
Like,the other day,I got this credit card application...

332

我竟然被预先核准!
and I was preapproved!

333
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:36,100
我这辈子从没被预先核准过!
I've never been preapproved for anything in my life!

334
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,854
真的很遗憾
I'm sorry, man.

335
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,358
我不知道这样 对你有没有意义…
I don't know if this'll mean anything to you...

336
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,190
但你在我们之中 永远都是预先核准
but you'll always be preapproved with us.

337
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,487
没有 一点意义都没有
No,that means nothing to me.

338
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,243

00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,583
这是葡萄干吗?
Are these raisins?

341
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,961
有何不可?
sure,why not?

342
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,385
听着 艾迪
Listen,Eddie.

343
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:17,853
我想过我们目前 住在一起的情况了
I've been thinking about our living situation.

344
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,187
你在笑什么?
Why are you smiling?

345
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,774
我有个小惊喜 有条新鱼
I got a little surprise. Look.There's a new fishy.

钱德 以你为名
Chandler,you know,after you.

348
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,538
那根本不是条真鱼
Well,that's not even a real fish.

349
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,298
那只是金鱼饼干
No,that's a Goldfish cracker.

350
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,840
什么意思?
So.what's your point,man?

351
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,883
好 晚安了
Okay,good night.

352
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,225
你这个大怪胎
You big freak of nature.
