32
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:24,598
不可能      
No way.         

33
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,476
她去机场了
I'm telling you, she went to the airport.

34
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,433
她要去对罗斯表白了
And she's gonna go for it with Ross.

35
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:32,600
哇 我的天啊 这是大事

36
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,064
这比大事还大 这简直是
This is bigger than huge. This is like...

37
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,980
好吧 什么比大事还大
All right, what's bigger than huge?

38
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,865
这件事      没错
This?        Yes.

39
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,409
你们弄了个新发型
Guys, you got new haircuts!

40
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,538
是呀 没错 多亏了这位美发大师菲比沙宣
Yes, yes, we did. Thanks to Vidal Buffay.

41
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:51,251
因为 我们的光彩来自您的风(沙宣广告词)
Because, you know, "If you don't look good, we don't look good."

42
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,419

机场 机场 罗斯 不是一个人
Airport, airport. Ross. Not, not alone.

45
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,716
茱莉 搂着她
Julie. Julie. Arm around her!

46
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:08,010
抽筋 抽筋 抽筋
Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!

47
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,850
我想她可能是想表达什么
Okay, I think she's trying to tell us something.

48
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,935
快 快找出句子的动词
Quick, get the verbs.

49
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,480
你 你
You! You!

你说他喜欢我 你 你
You said he liked me! You! You

51
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,406
你们这两个慢半拍的
You slowpokes!

52
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,192
没错 行李全在我们手上
That's all right, Rach. We got the bags.

53
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,570
嗨 你好
Hi. Hello.

54
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,783

55
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,872
嘿      菲比 嗨

Joey, what up?         Hey.

57
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,670
大家注意 这位是茱莉      茉莉
Everyone, this is Julie.         Julie.

58
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,176
噢喔
Oh!

59
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,754
嗨     
Hi!  

60
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,094
嗨 就当我不在这儿 我们根本没见过面
Hi! But I'm not here, you haven't met me.

61
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,541
等明天 我没有坐20个小时的飞机 
I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow 

62
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:51,012
留给你们的印象会好很多
when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.

63
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,555
还有巴士      哦 我的天
And bus.         Oh my God!

64
00:03:53,556 --> 00:03:55,941
那个尖叫的家伙      还有吐口水的人
With the screaming guy.        And the spitting...

65
00:03:55,942 --> 00:03:57,726
你们一定得听听这个故事
You gotta hear this story.

66
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,070
我们坐了一辆有200年之久的巴士
We're on this bus that's easily 200 years old.

67
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,525
最少200年
Easy two hundred, at least.

68
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,443
有个家伙      后来鸡在她大腿上大便了
And this guy...        And the chicken poops in her lap! 

69
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,870
真是对不起
Oh, I'm so sorry.

70
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,168
我把结局说出来了 是吗
I just gave away the ending, didn't I?

71
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,704
我刚刚在计程车上 听过这个故事
I just heard this story in the cab.

72
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:21,626
然后我就再也忘不了
And it is all I can think about.

73
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:28,746
太令人意外了 怎么会这样子的呢      
This is amazing. I mean, how? How did this happen?

74
00:04:28,747 --> 00:04:30,186
我们一起读的研究生
Ross and I were in grad school together

75
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,462
毕业后就没见过面了 
But we haven't seen each other since then. 

76
00:04:32,463 --> 00:04:35,605
我一到中国 你们猜 负责勘探的人是谁
Well, I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig?

77
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:36,891
茱莉
Julie!

78
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,935
这不是太妙了吗
Julie. Isn't that great?

79
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,089
真是妙得让人想踹你一脚 
I mean, isn't that just kick you in the crotch, 

80
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,153
再对着你的脖子吐口水
spit on your neck fantastic?

81
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,281
只是一种形容的方式
It's an expression.

82
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,455
我们只是过来打声招呼
We just wanted to say a quick hi.

83
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,313
然后我们就要去看宝宝      
Then we're gonna go see the baby.         

84
00:04:54,314 --> 00:04:54,828
然后睡一觉
Then we've gotta get some sleep.

85
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,494
我们现在的时间 其实是明晚六点钟 
Yeah, it's really 6 o'clock tomorrow night, our time.

86
00:04:57,495 --> 00:05:00,320
好 千万别告诉我明天会怎样 
Okay well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though. 

87
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:01,794
因为我喜欢惊喜
'cause I like to be surprised.

88
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,712
再见      再见
Bye!        Bye!

89
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,568
嘿 瑞秋 可以给我来点咖啡吗
Hey, Rach. Can I get some coffee?      

90
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,684
当然好      谢谢
Yeah, Sure.        Thank you!

91
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,853
嗨 瑞秋      你跟他说了没      
Hey, Rach.        Did you talk to him yet? 

92
00:05:22,854 --> 00:05:24,442
没      那就别想喝
No.        Then, no.

93
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,494
你在中国到底发生什么事了
So, what the hell happened to you in China?

94
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,585
上回我们离开这里的时候 你还爱着
I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.

95
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,087
我知道 曾经是那样没错
I know. I know I was.

96
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,844
可是我心中一直有个声音 在提醒我
But there was always this little voice inside that kept saying:

97
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,364
那是不可能的 你要往前走 
"It's never gonna happen. Move on." 

98
00:05:50,365 --> 00:05:52,140
你知道那是谁的声音吧
You know whose voice that was?

99
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,093
上帝吗
God?

100
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,803
是你啊 老兄
It was you, pal.

101
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,644
也许是上帝在模仿我
Well, maybe it was God doing me.

102
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,559
你说得没错 
Look, you were right. Okay? 

103
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,062
在她眼里我只是一个朋友
She looks at me and sees a friend. That's all.

104
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,130
然后我就遇到茱莉 
And then I met Julie and...

105
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:09,990
我们在一起非常开心
I don't know. We're having a great time.

106
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,250
我必须得说 要不是你的话 
And I have to say, I never would have gone for it with her, 

107
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:14,617
我绝对不可能跟她在一起的
if it hadn't been for you.

108
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,416
你欠我一个大人情  大个子
Well, you owe me one, big guy.

109
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,077
你的柠檬汁来了
Here's your lemonade.       

110
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,335
我没叫柠檬汁
I didn't order lemonade.

111
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,767
那就退回去
Oh, well, then you better go take that back. 

112
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:26,257
不然他们会找你收钱的
'Cause they're gonna charge you for that.

113
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,877
但是      快 快 快 快点 快点
But        Go, go, go! Come on, come on!

114
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,135
好了 你了解到了什么
Okay, so, what did you find out?

115
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,011
他说
He said...

116
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:44,157
他说他们在一起非常开心 我很抱歉 
He said they're having a great time. I'm sorry.         

117
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:45,026
什么
What?

118
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,900
不过 只要你愿意看 这也有好的一面
But the silver lining, if you wanna see it,

119
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,316
这完全是他自己的决定
is that he made this decision all by himself,

120
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,573
绝对没有任何外来力量的协助
without any outside help whatsoever.

121
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,789
这哪里是好的一面
How is that a silver lining?

122
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,575
你要非常愿意 才能看得出来
You have to really wanna see it.

123
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,362
讽刺的是 这些家伙都是 上体育课时没人愿意挑的
Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.

124
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,757
嘿 菲比
Hey, Pheebs.

125
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,765
知道我在想什么吗      哦 可以
You know what I'm thinking?         Oh, okay.

126
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,311
在想
How...

127
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,224
你很久没跟人嘿咻了
it's been so long since you've had sex.

128
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,518
所以你在想 现在有没有什么新花招
you're wondering if they've changed it?

129
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,401
不是 不过现在 我真的在想这件事了
No. Although now that's what I'm thinking.

130
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,817
好吧 那你刚才在想什么
All right. So, what were you thinking?

131
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,589
你帮他们剪了很不错的发型 
Well, I was thinking that you gave the guys suchvgreat haircuts. 

132
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,201
我想 或许你也可以帮我剪
So, I thought maybe you'd like to do mine.

133
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,039
哦 不行
Oh! No.

134
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,331
有什么不行      因为我只是
Why not?         Because I'm just...

135
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,998
我非常挑剔 而且是个控制狂
I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.

136
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,793
不 你不是      我知道我不是 不过你是
No, you're not.        I know I'm not, but you are.

137
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,138
我只是不想伤害你的感情
I was trying to spare your feelings.

138
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,175
喂 哦 你好
Hello? Oh, hi.

139
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,060
好 等一下 罗斯 茱莉找你
Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, Julie for you.

140
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,399
喂 嘿
Hello? Hi.

141
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,728
嘿 有人认识什么好裁缝吗
Hey. Anybody know a good tailor?

142
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,988
有衣服要修改吗      不是
You need clothes altered?         No no.

143
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,400
我只是想找个人 拿粉笔在我身上画画
I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.

144
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,122
去找法兰克 
Why don't you go see Frankie. 

145
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:18,904
我家的人一直找他做衣服
My family's been going to him forever.

146
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:23,584
我15岁时第一套西装就是他做的 不 等等 是16岁
He did my first suit when I was 15, no, wait, 16.

147
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:27,371
不 对不起 是15岁
No, excuse me, 15.

148
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,840
好吧 1990年 到底是什么时候
All right, when was 1990?

149
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,970
好吧 掏耳朵时只要棉签碰到东西就别继续挖了
Okay, you have to stop the QTip when there's resistance.

150
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:47,390
好 好的 甜心 我们等会儿见
Okay. Okay. Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

151
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,685

152
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,400

153
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,361

157
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,915
你也没啊
Well you didn't hang up either. 

158
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,126
她没挂掉      她没挂掉
She didn't hang up.        She didn't hang up.

159
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,295
好吧 不行
Okay, no.

160
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,713
不 你来挂电话
No, you hang up.

161
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,473
你 你
You. You. Yo...

162
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,109
对不起 我还以为你是在对我说
Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.

163
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,230
瑞秋      对不起
Rachel.        Sorry.

164
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,569
我再打给她      好吧
I'll just call her back.         Okay.

165
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,361
嗨 亲爱的 对不起 刚刚断线了
Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry. We got disconnected.

166
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,824
不 你挂
No, you hang up.

167
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,456
好吧 我怎么会这样 
Okay, okay, okay. How did this happen to me? 

168
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:45,331
我怎么会这样
How did this happen to me?

169
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,335
一个礼拜前 两个礼拜前 我还好好的
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.

170
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,247
罗斯只是罗斯 就是一个家伙
Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.

171
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,008
如今 突然间 他是罗斯
Now all of a sudden, he's Ross

172
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,634
是我无福拥有的好家伙
this really great guy that I can't have.

173
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,265
以前我也希望你能拥有他
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.

174
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,550
我知道
I know you did.

175
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,138
我会熬过去的 我会熬过去的
I'm just gonna deal with it. I'm just gonna deal with it.

176
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,644
我得离开这里
I gotta get out of here!

177
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,207
我不管你们怎么说 
Okay, I don't care what you guys say. 

178
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,240
她真的有心事
Something's bothering her.

179
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,124
知道吗 我想当时我是16岁
You know, I think I was 16.

180
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,004
拜托 只要后面修一点点就好
Please, just a little bit off the back.

181
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,238
我还是不要
I'm still on "no".

182
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,876
早      嘿
Morning.         Hey.

183
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,046
你们可以先闭上眼睛吗
Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?

184
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:44,341
不 不 不 我不会再上你的当了
Oh, no, no, no. I'm not falling for that again.

185
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,271
怎么了      
What's going on?         

186
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,063
我昨晚做了一件傻事
Well, I sort of did a stupid thing last night.

187
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,973
什么傻事
What stupid thing did you do?

188
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,860
恶心
Ew!

189
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,392
巴洛 你去穿好衣服 
Okay, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed. 

190
00:11:05,393 --> 00:11:08,206
然后就可以走了 再见
And then you'll be on your way. Okay. Byebye.

191
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,992
瑞秋 怎么会这样
Rachel, how did this happen?

192
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,503
我也不知道 我昨晚碰巧遇到他了
I don't know, I kind of ran into him last night.

193
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,794
在哪里遇到的      他的公寓 这是果汁吗
Where?         At his apartment. Is this juice?

194
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:21,170
喂 不是因为他想勾引菲比 你才甩了他的吗
Whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?

195
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,924
哦 天啊 我知道 我真可悲 我是个没用的人
Oh, God, I know. I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.

196
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,847
你不可悲 你只是悲伤
Honey, you're not pathetic. You're just sad.

197
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,387
没错 伤心的人总是会做傻事的
Yeah. I mean, people do stupid things when they're upset.

198
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,648
天啊 如果每个我不该上床的人 都给我五分钱
My God! If I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't...

199
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,276
我们现在谈的 是你犯下的大错
But this is about your horrible mistake.

200
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,858
嗨      嘿
Hi.        Hey

201
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,198
嗨      抱歉我们迟到了
Hi!        Sorry we're late.

202
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,657
我们刚刚在
We were...

203
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,118
哦 是跟触摸有关的
Well, there was touching.

204
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,546
嘿 罗斯      巴洛
Hey, Ross!         Paclo. Ha.

205
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,715
怎么
What a...

206
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,257
你怎么会在这里
What, what are you doing here?

207
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,262
我来上瑞秋      啊
I do Raquel.         Ah.

208
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,520
这么说他回来了
So, he's back?

209
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,182
对 他回来了 有问题吗
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?

210
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,817
不 没有问题
No, not a problem.

211
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,319
很好 很欣慰不构成问题
Good. Glad it's not a problem.

212
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,903
你不能再碰我的屁股
Okay, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.

213
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:31,448
尽管有美味的面包圈 还有一触即发的紧张局势
Well, despite the yummy bagels and palpable tension.

214
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,537
我还是得去改我的裤子
I've got pants that need to be altered.

215
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,280
嘿 钱德 看到法兰克的时候 
Oh, hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, 

216
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:37,374
跟他说乔伊崔比亚尼问候他
tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.

217
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,537
这样子他就会懂了
He'll know what it means.

218
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,214
你确定他能解开 如此深奥的谜题
You sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?

219
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,189
真好玩 
You know, it's funny. 

220
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,591
上次巴洛在这里的时候 我的头发还很短很可爱
The last time Paolo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.

221
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,427
好吧 好吧
All right. Okay.

222
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,789
但你必须得保证 
But, but you have to promise that 

223
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:59,925
你不会管太多 太唠叨 还有别太摩妮卡就是了
you will not be all like controlly and bossy and all, you know, Monica about it.

224
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,567
我保证      好 我看看
I promise.        All right, let's see.

225
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,909
好 你们有些会被修剪 有些不会
Now, some of you are gonna get cut and some of you aren't.

226
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,737
不过我保证 你们全都不会感到痛楚
But I promise, none of you will feel a thing.

227
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,948
好
Okay.

228
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,166
够了 我不干了      
All right, that's it. I quit.         

229
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,467
干嘛 我什么都没说
What? I didn't say anything!

230
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,259
但这不是相信人的表情
Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person.

231
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,474
这种表情是
This is the face of a person who, you know...

232
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,639
不相信人的表情
doesn't trust a person.

233
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,391
我很抱歉 我很抱歉 菲比
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe.

234
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,358
只是这比我们讨论的发型要短多了
It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.

235
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:48,024
你放轻松好吗 我知道自己在做什么
Would you relax? I know what I am doing.

236
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,114
这就是他的发型
This is how he wears it.

237
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,406
谁的发型      黛米摩尔
How who wears it?         Demi Moore.

238
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,501
黛米摩尔不是个男的
Demi Moore is not a he.

239
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,378
哦  他在"亚瑟"和"十全十美"里就是个男的
Well, he was a he in "Arthur" and in "10".

240
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,132
那个人是杜利摩尔
That's Dudley Moore!

241
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,045
我说的是 我要黛米摩尔的发型
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!

242
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,929
哦 哦      哦 我的天啊
Oh. Oh!         Oh, my God!

243
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,095
哦 天啊      哦 我的天啊
Oh, God!         Oh, my God!

244
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,682
哦 我的天 我很抱歉 对不起
Oh, my God! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry！

245
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,187
黛米摩尔是哪一个啊
Which one is Demi Moore?

246
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,362
她是  "桃色机密" "不道德的交易" 
She's the actress that was in "Disclosure", "Indecent Proposal",

247
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:23,227
"人鬼情未了"里的那个女星
"Indecent Proposal", "Ghost"!

248
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,690
她的发型很漂亮的   
Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.

249
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:28,197
我知道      我的天啊
I know!         Oh, my God!

250
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,603
裤管的褶边要多长      
How long do you want the cuffs? 

251
00:14:36,604 --> 00:14:38,867
要跟这件裤子的寿命一样长
At least as long as I have the pants.

252
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,421
我刚听懂
I just got that.

253
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,844
现在要量你的内侧长度
Okay. Now we'll do your inseam.

254
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,209
她的情况怎样      
How is she? 

255
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,612
现在还很难说
It's too soon to tell.

256
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,357
她在休息了 起码这是一个好现象
She's resting, which is a good sign.

257
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,525
头发的情况呢      
How's the hair?         

258
00:15:14,526 --> 00:15:15,455
我不想骗你
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross.

259
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,196
看起来不妙
It doesn't look good.

260
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,248
我夹起了一边的头发 似乎能阻止卷曲
I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.

261
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,288
我们可以去看她了吗
Can we see her?

262
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,300
你的发型看起来太棒了 反而会让她更难过
Your hair looks too good. I think it would upset her.

263
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,381
罗斯 你进去看看她吧
Ross, why don't you come on in.

264
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,936
你还好吗      我没事
Well, how you doing?         I'm okay.

265
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,564
那么糟吗      什么
Ooh. that bad huh?         What?

266
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:47,522
瑞秋 我可以感受到女人的忧伤脆弱
Look, Rach, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable.

267
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,938
这是我的天赋之一 坐下
It's one of my gifts. Sit.

268
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,774
噢
Oh!

269
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:57,953
乔伊 当我看到 他跟她一起走下飞机的那一刻
Joey, when I saw him get off that plane with her,

270
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,412
我真的以为我已经跌到谷底了
I really thought I just hit rock bottom.

271
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:05,170
可是今天的感觉就像 这是谷底
But today, it's like there's rock bottom,

272
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,295
然后下面还有50英尺的垃圾
50 feet of crap,

273
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,298
然后才是我
then me.

274
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,876
把你的感觉告诉罗斯
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.

275
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:15,171
我怎么能去对他说 那茱莉怎么办
Oh, come on, how can I just tell him? What about Julie?

276
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,283
她怎样 
What about her? 

277
00:16:16,284 --> 00:16:18,386
他们在一起才两星期
They've only been going out for two weeks.

278
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,678
罗斯已经爱你快十年了
Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.

279
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,102
我不知道 我不知道      瑞秋 瑞秋
I don't know. I don't know.         Look, Rach, Rach.

280
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,688
我交往过很多女人
I've been with my share of women.

281
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,358
其实我交往过很多很多女人
In fact, I've  been with a lot of people's share of women.

282
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,940
重点在于
But the point is

283
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:38,077
我对任何人的感觉 都不及罗斯对你的感情
I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.

284
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,701
真的
Really?

285
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,088
喂 老乡
Yo, paisan.

286
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,794
我可以跟你谈一下吗
Can I talk to you for a sec?

287
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:02,351
你的裁缝 是一个很坏的人
Your tailor is a very bad man!

288
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,018
法兰克 你在说什么啊
Frankie? What are you talking about?       

289
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,148
嘿 怎么了
Hey, what's going on?

290
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,397
乔伊的裁缝
Joey's tailor

291
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,827
占我便宜
took advantage of me.

292
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,080
什么      不可能
What?         No way.

293
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,754
我去他那里有12年了      
I've been going to the guy for 12 years. 

294
00:17:25,755 --> 00:17:27,872
他说他要量我的内侧长度
Oh, come on. He said he was gonna do my inseam.

295
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,585
然后他就沿着我的腿往上摸 然后就很明显的
Then he ran his hand up my leg and then there was definite...

296
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,215
什么
What?

297
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,675
包住了
Cupping.

298
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,094
他们就是这样量裤子的
That's how they do pants!

299
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,219
首先 量一边 把它推到一旁 
First they go up one side, they move it over.

300
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,090
再量另一边 把它推回来
Then they go up the other side, they move it back, 

301
00:17:48,091 --> 00:17:49,437
然后再量后面
then they do the rear.

302
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,987
干嘛 罗斯 告诉他 
What? Ross, will tell him. 

303
00:17:53,987 --> 00:17:55,490
裁缝不都是这样量裤子的吗
Isn't that how a tailor measures pants?

304
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,973
对 是 没错 在牢里
Yes, yes, it is. In prison!

305
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,783
你有毛病啊
What's the matter with you?

306
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,497
干嘛啦
What?

307
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,247
不是那样子的吗
That's not?

308
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,213
哦 我的天
Oh my God.

309
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,550
即使是玛丽泰勒摩尔的发型 都比我的好看
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.

310
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,398
我喜欢这发型
Well, I like it.

311
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,175
真的 我觉得这是十全十美
Yeah I do. I think it's a 10!

312
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,820
谢谢你
Thank you. 

313
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,531
我的头发很让人开怀 
My hair is very amused.

314
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,934
得了 这也不是最惨的事 
Oh, come on, Monica, things could be worse. 

315
00:18:44,935 --> 00:18:48,954
我是说 你可能会被"困在纽约月光中
I mean, you could "get caught between the moon and New York City".

316
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,917
我知道很疯狂 不过千真万确 (电影主题曲歌词)
I know its crazy, but it's true."

317
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,254
真多谢
Thank you.

318
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,669
嗯 我得走了 再见      待会儿见
Well, I gotta go. Bye.         See you.

319
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,633
再见 瑞秋      
Bye, Rach! 

320
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:02,884
等等 你要走了吗
Oh, wait, are you leaving?

321
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,238
对呀 所以我才说再见
Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye".

322
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:09,478
我可以跟你谈一下下吗      好
Well, can I talk to you for a sec?        Okay.

323
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:15,238
嘿 医生做疝气检查的时候
Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...

324
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,019
那是可以的
That's okay.

325
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,320
有什么事吗      嗯
What's going on?         Hmm...

326
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,571
首先      嗯
Well, okay, first of all...         Mmhm.

327
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,699
巴洛和我并没有复合
Paolo and I are not back together.

328
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,955
那只是我干的一件傻事
That was a stupid thing that I did.

329
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,292
如果我能使时光倒转
And if I could go back in time and do it again,

330
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,502
我绝对不会这么做
well I wouldn't.

331
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,965
其次呢
Second of all,

332
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:43,754
干嘛
What?

333
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,636
好吧
Okay.

334
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,529
说话前 我想先问清楚 
Before I say anything, I just need to know.

335
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:51,229
这是不是又是你与男友分手
Is this one of those things where you break up with a guy.

336
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,178
我告诉你我的想法 
And then I tell you what I think.

337
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:55,437
然后第二天你们又重修旧好
And the next day you get back together with the guy.

338
00:19:55,438 --> 00:19:58,398
然后我就变成一个大傻瓜        不是      
And I look like a complete idiot?         No, no, no.

339
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:02,550
好吧 好 那么 我觉得那家伙是个大浑蛋
Okay. Well, then, I think the guy's scum.

340
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,569
我讨厌他 我真的 真的很恨他
I hate him. I mean, I actually, I physically hate him.

341
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,242
我一直是这种感觉
You know? I always have.

342
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:13,285
你值得一个比他更好的男人
And you are way too good to be with a guy like that.

343
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:15,745
真的      
Really?  

344
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,539
瑞秋 你值得一个能欣赏你的男人
Rach, you deserve to be with someone who appreciates you

345
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:23,678
一个能了解你的 风趣 甜美 温柔
and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing...

346
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,931
可爱和性感的男人
and adorable and sexy you are.

347
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:30,764
你知道吗 就是一个每天早上醒来都会想
You know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking,

348
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:34,362
哦 我的天 我跟瑞秋在一起
"Oh my God. I'm with Rachel!"

349
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,684
知道吗 就是一个让你感觉非常好的人
You know? Someone who makes you feel good.

350
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,612
就像我对茱莉的感觉一样
Like the way I do with Julie.

351
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,277
还有什么话吗
Was there a "second of all"?

352
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:57,127
没有了 我想就这些了
No. I'm... I think that was the whole "all".

353
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,961
我得走了      好 
I gotta go.         Yeah.

354
00:21:00,962 --> 00:21:03,626
好吗 好      谢谢
Okay? Okay!         Thanks.

355
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,799
好
Okay.

356
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,349
不 我对天发誓 老爸 
No, I swear to God, Dad! 

357
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,471
别人不是那样量裤子的
That's not how they measure pants!

358
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,699
我想剪个较短的发型 
I was thinking of doing it shorter. 

359
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,491
就像安蒂麦道威尔那样
You know, like Andie MacDowell's new haircut.

360
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,571
可以 我会剪      真的
Oh, yeah. Oh, I could do that.         Really?

361
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,203
没问题 你要现在就剪吗      太棒了
Yeah. Do you wanna do it right now?         Great!

362
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,453
好啊      好啊
Okay         Okay

363
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:34,866
再见
See you.

364
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,835
好吧 这次我想要非常确定
Okay, I just wanna make really sure this time.

365
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,488
安蒂麦道威尔是 
Andie MacDowell is the girl

366
00:21:40,488 --> 00:21:43,340
"四个婚礼一个葬礼"里的那个女的 对吧
from "Four Weddings and a Funeral", right?

367
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,417
不是
No.

368
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:51,390
不是 那是洛帝麦道威尔
No, no, no, no, no, no. That's Roddy McDowaII.

369
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,550
安蒂麦道威尔是 "人猿星球"里的那个家伙
Andie MacDowell is the guy from "Planet of the Apes".

370
00:21:56,315 --> 00:22:00,224
噢 对哦 谢谢      不客气
Oh! Yeah, okay. Thank you.         You're welcome.

371
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:15,224
