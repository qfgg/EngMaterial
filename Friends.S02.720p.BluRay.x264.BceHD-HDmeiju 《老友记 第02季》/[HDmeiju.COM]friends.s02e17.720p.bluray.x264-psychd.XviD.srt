艺术      没错是艺术
Art.        Art it is.

6
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:24,897
看看这个 这是咖啡桌吗?
Well, check this out. Is it a coffee table?

7
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:28,184
还是一只美洲豹? 无所谓了
Is it, uh, a panther? There's no need to decide.

8
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,195
好漂亮的枕头
Hey, nice pillow.

It makes me want to pee.

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,113
对 我也是 我想这就是挑战所在
Yeah, me too. I think that's the challenge. Heh.

14
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:53,190
钱德怎么没来呢?
Hey, how come, uh, Chandler didn't come?

15
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:58,737
因为他有事 就是有事
Well, uh, it's because he had a thing with the...with the thing.

16
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,180
哦 我懂了
Right. I got it.

17
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,987
带我们去看看你家的其他部分吧
Why don't you show us the rest of your casa?

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,711
你厕所也装电话?      是的
You have a phone in here?        That's right.

24
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:26,996
我装了个电话
I have a phone.

25
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,123
在这里
In here.

26
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,248
乔伊 答应我一件事      什么?
Joey, promise me something.        Yeah.

27
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,462

亲 抱歉 苹果派卖完了 某人刚拿走了最后一块
Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie. Someone just got the last piece.

33
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,408
天呐 你们不会相信的
Oh my God. Oh, my God. You are not gonna believe this.

34
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,408
我刚刚被发现了
I have just been discovered.

35
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:54,497
等等 四年前我就宣布你是法国领地了
Now wait a minute. I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.

36
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,800
总之 好了 
Anyway.Okay

37
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,238
现在你们要保证不会发狂也别说多棒 直到我说完
Now promise you won't freak out and say how great this is until I'm done.

38
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:04,760
好      好
Okay.        Okay.

39
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:08,098
我刚认识了一个小唱片公司的制作人
Uh, I just met this producer of this teeny record company...

40
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,183
她说我有一副清新 与众不同的嗓音
who said, ahem, that I have a very fresh, off beat sound...

41
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:15,331
她想请我录"臭臭猫"的试听带
and she wants to do a demo of "Smelly Cat".

42
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,774
我刚说过别这样
Okay, I told you not to do that yet. Ha ha.

43
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,355
好
Okay.

44
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,222
她还要拍MTV
And she wants to do a video.

45
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,972
我还没说完呢
I'm not done yet, okay? Ha, ha.

46
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,660
天啊
God. Okay.

47
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:33,661
如果一切顺利 他们甚至可能出一张专辑
If that goes well, they may even want to make an album.

48
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,757
我说完了      太棒了!
I'm done now.        Oh, that's great.

49
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,301
难以置信
That's unbelievable. Oh.

50
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,488
罗斯 如果你关心我 
Oh, God, Ross, if you care about me,

51
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,456
就把派从那人的帽子里拿出来
get the pie out of the man's hood.

52
00:03:45,456 --> 00:03:46,550
拿什么?      他帽子里有块派
Get the what?        There's a pie in the hood.

53
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,391
派在帽子里 快去
Pie in the hood. Go.

54
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:59,020
你在干嘛?      对不起 我的派在你的帽子里
What are you doing?        I'm sorry. My pie was, was in your hood.

55
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,531
我得从那家伙的裤子里拿我的咖啡了
Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants...

56
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:07,661
然后七点前我要回医院去
and I'll be back in the hospital by seven.

57
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:17,003
可恶 罗斯 赶快给我滚出来
Damn it, Ross. Get your butt out of the bathroom.

58
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:20,337
淡定 我在吹头发
Calm down. I'm blow drying.

59
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,673
吹什么头发? 你根本没有头发
Blow drying what? You have no hair.

60
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:28,553
怎么了?      你男朋友在里面待了一个小时
What's going on?        Uh, your boyfriend has been in there for an hour.

61
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,638
真不敢相信 就像我又跟他住在一起了一样
It's like I'm living with him again.

62
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,941
我睡觉时他在这儿 醒来时他在 
He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up,

63
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:34,851
我要洗澡时他还在
he's here when I wanna use the shower.

64
00:04:34,851 --> 00:04:36,647
感觉好像我又回到十六岁了
Uh, I feel like I'm 16 over again.

65
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,066
你不是十六岁 而且现在你们两个都是成年人了
Well, you're not 16. You're both adults now.

66
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,628
快出来 蠢货
Get out, you doofus!

67
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,735
其实 你们俩半斤八两
Or, you know, he's rubber and you're glue.

68
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,664
都是你的了
All yours.

69
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:57,972
希望你把排水孔上的头发清理了
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.

70
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,876
闭嘴!      闭嘴
Shut up.        Shut up.

71
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,500
别这样
Cut it out.

72
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,217
我再也不想要你了
I've never wanted you more.

73
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,022
怎么样? 我该不该打电话给他?
So, what do you say, boys? Should I call him?

74
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,623
大家都是这样说的 "问你拖鞋一个问题"
You know what they say "Ask your slippers a question..."

75
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,918
你疯了!"
you're going crazy.

76
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,417
你好      嘿
Hello?        Hey.

77
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,584
嘿
Hey.

78
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,300
抱歉 我今天没过去
Listen, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.

79
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,809
没关系
Oh, that's okay.

80
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,679
因为你有事嘛
You, uh, you had a thing.

81
00:05:54,312 --> 00:06:00,148
听说你那里很棒      别提了 我开心死了
Yeah, well, I hear the place looks great.        Oh, forget about it. I'm having a ball, ha.

82
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,778
我们的公寓怎么样了? 
How's the apartment doing?

83
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:06,734
哦 棒极了 就是一个普通的空间
Oh. Hey, it's terrific. I mean, it's a regular space...

84
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,523
的聚集地
fest.

85
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,993
那很好
Oh, well, great.

86
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,906
我只是打来打声招呼
Yeah, I just...wanted to call and say hey.

87
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,709
好的
Well, okay, then.

88
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:24,039
那是烤箱计时器的声音吗?      没错 朋友
Was that the oven timer?        That's right, my friend.

89
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,425
是看"海滩游侠"的时候了      海滩游侠!
It's time for Baywatch!        Baywatch!

90
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,719
哦
Oh.

91
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,925
你能相信他们让史黛芬妮得皮肤癌么?
Can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?

92
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:36,055
我还是不敢相信他们升她为小队长
I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.

93
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,388
你那么说是因为你喜欢雅丝敏布莉
You're just saying that because you're in love with Yasmine Bleeth.

94
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,559
怎么可能有人不喜欢雅丝敏布莉?
How could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Bleeth?

95
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,800
嘿 她们在跑了
Hey. Hey, they're running.

96
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,366
看 这正是这个节目的精华所在
See, this is the brilliance of the show.

97
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,613
我说她们应该一直跑下去
I say always keep them running.

98
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,816
一直在跑
All the time running.

99
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,785
跑吧!
Run.

100
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,666
跑吧!
Run.

101
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,920
跑啊 雅丝敏 像风一样的跑
Run. Yasmine. Run like the wind.

102
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,988
但你说想一个人住的
But you wanted to live by yourself.

103
00:07:07,988 --> 00:07:10,294
是啊 我还以为那样会很好
I did. I thought it'd be great.

104
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,843
我以为那样我就有时间思考
I figured I'd have time alone with my thoughts.

105
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:17,680
但结果发现我的思想没有你们想的那么多
But you know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.

106
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,931
乔伊 那怎么不和钱德说你想搬回去?
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?

107
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,397
你们真觉得他会答应么? 昨晚我们聊得很好
You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a good talk last night.

108
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,207
但是当初我搬出去时我伤他很深
But when I moved out, I hurt him bad.

109
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:31,660
我保证 他绝对想要你搬回去
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.

110
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,815
我告诉你 他绝对不会搬回来
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.

111
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:39,035
但我们从没像昨晚那样聊的那么开心过
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. Heh.

112
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,665
那就好像
I mean it was

113
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,622
就像我们刚刚搬在一起住时一样
It was like when we first started living together.

114
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,997
我知道你现在不想听这个
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now.

115
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:52,044
但我们看到他在新家的样子 他真的很开心
but we've seen him in his new place. All right, and he's happy.

116
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,838
他都装修好了
He's, he's decorated.

117
00:07:55,266 --> 00:08:00,112
钱德 他已经往前走了 你也要这样      但是
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, okay? You have to, too.        But

118
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:03,612
你只是要接受你们现在只是朋友的事实 好么?
No, you're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now. Okay?

119
00:08:03,612 --> 00:08:05,397
你们不再是
You're not...

120
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,425
室友了
roommates anymore.

121
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,363
好了 菲比 准备好了吗?
Okay, Phoebe. Ready to try one?

122
00:08:11,363 --> 00:08:12,862
好的
Okay. Ahem.

123
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,744
臭臭猫 臭臭猫
Smelly cat, smelly cat

124
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,496
他们都喂你吃什么?
What are they feeding you?

125
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,451
臭臭猫 臭臭猫 真的很臭的臭臭猫
Smelly, smelly, smelly. Really bad smelling smelly cat.

126
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,915
哇 天啊
Oh, whoa! Oh, my God!

127
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,874
那是谁啊?
I mean, like, who was that?

128
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,613
她们是你的伴唱团 就在你后面 亲爱的
They're your backup singers. Behind you, hon.

129
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,968
我以为她们只是来参观的
Oh, I thought they were just watching me.

130
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:44,638
就像水族馆一样      好了
Like at an aquarium, you know?        All right.

131
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,688
从头开始      好的
From the top.        Okay. Ahem.

132
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,104
臭臭猫 臭臭猫
Smelly cat, smelly cat

133
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,024
他们都喂你吃什么?
What are they feeding you?

134
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,691
臭臭 臭臭
Smelly, smelly, smelly

135
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,656
非常臭的臭臭猫
Really bad smelling smelly cat

136
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,316
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

137
00:09:01,316 --> 00:09:03,327
对不起 我没有感觉到
Okay, sorry. I'm just not getting...

138
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:09,292
大家都懂 这只猫到底有多臭
that everyone, urn, gets how smelly this cat actually is.

139
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,987
或许我们可以聊一下这个 
I think maybe if we could talk about this...

140
00:09:11,987 --> 00:09:15,675
因为我需要感觉到你们真的在乎这只猫
because I need to feel that you really care about the cat.

141
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:21,683
亲爱的 我们可以谈 但这儿一分钟要花一百刀
Honey, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about $100 a minute to be in here.

142
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:26,438
好吧 那猫是很臭 不过你们还是爱他 开始吧
Oh, okay. So, urn, the cat stinks, but you love it. Let's go.

143
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,141
不 他不可能是迅猛龙
No, there is no way he was a velociraptor.

144
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,561
不 看他高耸的头盖骨
No, look at the cranial ridge, okay?

145
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,550
要是狄诺是迅猛龙
If Dino was a velociraptor,

146
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,613
他一口就把摩登原始人一家吃掉了
he'd have eaten the Flintstones.

147
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,237
没错
Yeah. Yeah.

148
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,072
噢 你在睡午觉?
Oh, were you taking a nap?

149

Okay, thanks.

Call Joanna. Hi.        Did she leave a number?

155
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,338
你看见我写下来了么?
Did you see me write one down?

156
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,887
我没有她电话号码 笨蛋
I don't have her number. Butt munch.

157
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,487
那她会再打回来的 别这么幼稚
Well, she'll call back. Don't be such a baby.

158
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:05,803
我不幼稚 你才幼稚
I'm not a baby. You're the baby.

159
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,642
听着 你别烦我好么?      你别惹我好么
Look, you wanna get off my back?        You wanna get out of my face?

160
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,149
等一下 东尼 等一下
Wait, hold on, Tony. Hold on.

161
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,355

Give me that.        Okay.

166
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,237
亲爱的 听着 趁我还没忘
Hi sweetie, listen, before I forget,

167
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:31,953
我的避孕器是不是留在你那儿了?
did I leave my diaphragm at your place?

168
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,252
嗨 妈
Hi Mom.

169
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,228
嗨      嗨
Hey.        Yeah. ha ha.

170
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,239
皇宫生活怎么样?
So, uh, how's the palace?

171
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,986
真有趣你居然会提到 因为我刚在想
It's funny you should mention that because I was thinking...

172
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,999
这些盒子是怎么回事?
What's with the boxes?

173
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:10,416
噢 事实上 我有个消息要告诉你
Oh, uh, actually, I, uh, have some news.

174
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,175
乔伊会回来把他的麋鹿帽子拿走
Hey Chandler, is that Joey guy gonna pick up his moose hat

175
00:11:13,175 --> 00:11:14,421
还是要我把它扔了?
or should I toss it out?

176
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,487
你为何不亲自问他呢? 
Why don't you ask him yourself?

177
00:11:17,487 --> 00:11:19,342
乔伊 这位是我的新室友 艾迪
Joey, this is my new roommate, Eddie.

178
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,190
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

179
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,712
我也是      你好么
Like wise.        How you doing?

180
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:28,139
我带走了 我就是为了这个来的
Uh, I'll take that. It's, uh, what I came for, heh.

181
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,555
这倒是个新闻 你们俩怎么认识的?
So this is new. Where'd you two meet?

182
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:35,442
在超市 在民族食品区
At the, uh, supermarket in the, uh, ethnicfood section.

183
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:39,858
我帮他选西班牙辣香肠      哇奥
I helped him pick out a chorizo. Yeah. Hahaha.      Wow.

184
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,347
后来我们聊了一下 
Oh you know, we got to talking. And, uh,

185
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:44,550
他说要找地方住 我刚好有空房间
he said he needed a place, and I had a spare room.

186
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,786
哦 那是一个空房间了?
Oh, now it's a spare room?

187
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,125
是啊 既然没有人在用
Well, yeah. In that it's not being used...

188
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,377
我又让它空着
and I have it to spare.

189
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,583
对的
Right.

190
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,418
好了 我拿到我来拿的东西了
Well, I, uh, got what I came for.

191
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,675
再见了
I'll, uh, I'll see you guys.

192
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,130
嘿 乔伊
Hey, Joe.

193
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,848
你什么时候开始在头发上抹慕丝的?
When'd you start using moose in your hair?

194
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,511
这家伙很有趣吧?
Is this guy great, or what?

195
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,804
对啊
Yeah.

196
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,769
很有趣
Yeah, he is.

197
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,690
我不敢相信他找到新室友了 这人是谁?
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?

198
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,236
艾迪什么的 他们刚认识
Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.

199
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,863
这关系不会持久的 
It'll never last.

200
00:12:28,863 --> 00:12:31,156
他不过是低潮时填补空档的室友
He's just a rebound roommate.

201
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,087
嗨      嗨
Hey.        Hey.

It's "Smelly Cat", the video.        Oh, God.

204
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:45,963
我还没看 所以要是你们不喜欢的话
Now, okay, I haven't seen it yet, so if you don't like it.

205
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,631
那又怎样? 你们也没人录过MTV
Well, so what? None of you ever made a video.

206
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,019
好的
Okay.

207
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,146
"臭臭猫" 菲比布非
"Smelly Cat" Phoebe Buffay

208
00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:00,818
快滚出去 猫 你臭死了
Get out of here, cat! You stink!

209
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,954

臭臭猫 臭臭猫
Smelly cat, smelly cat

211
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:17,543
他们都喂你吃什么?
What are they feeding you?

212
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,377
臭臭猫 臭臭猫
Smelly cat, smelly cat

213
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:25,294
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

214
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:32,850
臭臭 臭臭 真的很臭 臭臭猫 这不是你的错
Smelly, smelly, smelly. Really bad smelling smelly cat. It's not your fault.

215
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,845
臭臭猫 臭臭猫
Smelly cat, smelly cat

216
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,185
天啊      我知道
Oh, my God!        I know.

217
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,350
我的声音真美
I sound amazing!

218
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:48,653
他们不带你去看兽医 显然你不是他们的最爱
They won't take you to the vet. You're obviously not their favorite pet.

219
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,410
臭臭猫 臭臭猫
Smelly cat, smelly cat

220
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,493
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

221
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,532
哦不
Oh, no

222
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:02,004
我以前从没听过自己的唱歌 除了在我自己脑袋里
I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh.

223
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,962
真酷 我现在可以听到你们听到的声音了
This is so cool. Now I can hear what you hear.

224
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,879
相当不同 对吧?
Pretty, uh, different, huh?

225
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,841
哦对不起 但我真是太有才了
Oh, I am sorry, but I'm incredibly talented.

226
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,394
臭臭猫 臭臭猫
Smelly cat, smelly cat

227
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,851
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

228
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,572
乔伊 怎么了?
Hey, Joey. What's going on, man?

229
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,078

231
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,701
我来拿我的信
I just, uh, came by to pick up my mail.

232
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,417
信在哪里?      在那边桌上
Where's the mail?        Oh it's, uh, over there on the table.

233
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,211
你们不再放在这边桌子上了吗?
You don't keep it on this table anymore?

234
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,047
不 艾迪习惯把信放那边
No, Eddie likes it over there.

235
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,850
好吧 给你 艾迪式煎蛋

太棒了
Oh, oh. That's great.

238
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,231
怎么了?
What?

239
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:11,657
我还以为你喜欢我做的面包挖个洞 中间放蛋呢
No, I just thought you liked your eggs, with the bread with the hole in the middle. a Ia me.

240
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,863
我是喜欢 但艾迪的做法是这样 还挺好吃的
I do, but, uh, Eddie makes them this way. They're pretty darn good.

241
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,280
好了 大家
Well, you guys...

242
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,582
我走了
I'm out of here.

243
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,085
再见了      再见
See you, pals.        See you.

244
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,212
你们两个相处得怎么样?      再开心不过了
So how are you two getting along?        Oh, I couldn't be happier.

245
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,218
很好
Great, huh?

246
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,926
我为你感到高兴
I'm happy for you.

247
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,760
好了 我受够了
All right, that's it!

248
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:43,898
他就这样住进来 这位强尼新蛋蛋先生
He just comes in here, Mr Johnny New Eggs.

249
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:49,695
换了放信的地方 还有那"再见了 大家"
with his moving the mail and his "See you, pals."

250
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:52,907
果汁也没了
And now there's no juice!

251
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:58,367
没留果汁给想喝果汁的人 我想喝果汁 我需要果汁
There's no juice for the people who need the juice. I want the juice. I need the juice!

252
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,704
那边还有一盒
There's another carton right over there.

253
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,995
这不再是果汁的问题了 好么?
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, all right, man?

254
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:09,799
好吧 那是为了什么?      蛋
All right. So, what's it about?        Eggs.

255
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,881
谁的蛋你比较喜欢 他的还是我的?
Whose eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?

256
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,592
两个人的蛋我都喜欢      拜托
Well, I like both eggs equally.        Oh, come on!

257
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,675
没有人会喜欢两种蛋一样多的 
Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally.

258
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:20,468
你更喜欢哪一种? 我要知道答案
You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.

259
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,308
有区别么? 你的蛋现在又不在这里了 不是么
What's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they?

260
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,683
你带走了你的蛋 然后离开了!
You took your eggs, and you left!

261
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,675
你真想希望我再也找不到新蛋了么?
Did you really expect me to never find new eggs?

262
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,869
我晚上想看今夜娱乐
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.

263
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:38,653
不要 我们要看赛伦盖提的掠食者
Tough. We're watching Predators of the Serengeti.

264
00:16:38,988 --> 00:16:40,425
你们两个别争了好么?
Would you guys stop?

265
00:16:40,425 --> 00:16:42,122
这是我的电视!      什么?
It's my TV!        What?

266
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,254
住手      咬我啊
Quit it.        Bite me!

267
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:44,950
天啊
Oh, my God.

268
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,550
摩妮卡一直在转台
Well, Monica keeps changing the channel.

269
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,627
真棒 你怎么不跟妈妈告状去啊
Aw, that's great. Why don't you tell Mommy on me?

270
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:54,044
现在我变成过家家里的妈妈了
Now I'm Mommy in this little play?

271
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:57,425
听着 我拒绝被卷入你们
Look, I refuse to get sucked into

272
00:16:57,425 --> 00:16:59,637
这一类诡异的盖勒家庭纠纷里
this weird little Geller dimension thing, okay?

273
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,973
所以我要去好好泡个泡泡浴
So I'm gonna go take a nice long hot bubble bath...

274
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,059
因为你们两个孩子吵得我快疯了
because you kids are driving me crazy

275
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,351
我们该怎么办?
What do we do about this?

276
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,566
我想我们可以把今夜娱乐录下来
I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.

277
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,855
我不是说电视节目
Not that!

278
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,864
这个! 我们!
This! Us!

279
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,492
天啊 罗斯 你真的是
Oh, my God, Ross, it's, you're just...

280
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,279
自从你来这里以后 我快被你逼疯了...      哦哦
Since you've been here, you're driving...        Ow, ow.

281
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,620
摩妮卡 你又开始高八度了
Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, all right?

282
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,335
我真是不能忍受你在这儿
I just can't stand you being here...

283
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,495
总是在这儿
all the time!

284
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,457
为什么? 你为什么受不了我在这儿? 
Why? Why can't you stand me being here?

285
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:34,384
我们只是在闹着玩而已
We're just having fun.

286
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,136
玩? 你觉得这好玩么?
Fun? You think this is fun?

287
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:38,463
是的
Yeah.

288
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:42,315
拜托 我还以为我们在闹着玩 就像小时候那样
Come on, I mean I thought you know, I thought we were fooling around, like when, uh, when we were kids.

289
00:17:42,315 --> 00:17:44,139
罗斯 小时候我恨你
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.

290
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:49,652
小时候你恨我?      是的 我恨你
You hated me when we were kids?        Yes. I hated you.

291
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,425
我爱你就像"你是我哥 我只能这样"
I mean, I loved you in a "you're my brother so I have to" way.

292
00:17:52,425 --> 00:17:54,396
但基本上我是恨你的
 But basically, I hated your guts.

293
00:17:56,075 --> 00:18:00,444
你干嘛要恨我?      因为你对我很刻薄
Why did you hate me?        Because you were mean to me...

294
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,863
你嘲弄我 你总是得逞
and you teased me and you always, you always got your way.

295
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,241
你不觉得那好玩?
And that wasn't fun for you?

296
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,248
啊哈
Uhhuh.

297
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,460
我不敢相信你恨我
I can't believe you hated me.

298
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,881
但现在我爱你啊
But now I love you.

299
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,882
而且不是因为我必须这样     真的吗?
And not just because I have to.        Really?

300
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,425
是的
Yeah.

301
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,186
你只是必须停止再惹我了
You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.

302
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:34,143
这我办得到
I can do that.

303
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,730
那我就不用杀掉你了
Then I won't have to kill you.

304
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,800
那你想看今夜娱乐么?
So you wanna watch, uh, Entertainment Tonight?

305
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,925
是的 谢了
Yeah, thanks.

306
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,623
今晚 美国运动杂志要
Tonight, America's premier sports magazine moves to primetime...

307
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:51,290
你知道么?      嗯?
You know what?        What?

308
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,925
要是你真的想看那个
If you really wanna watch that

309
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,597
赛伦盖提草原什么的 我们可以看
Serengeti thing, we can.

310
00:18:54,597 --> 00:18:56,487
哦 好的
Oh, okay.

311
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,681
嗨      嗨
Hey.        Hey.

312
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,264
听着 你们一定不会相信
Listen, you are not going to believe this...

313
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,851
原来MTV里唱歌的人不是我
but, ahem, that is not me singing on the video.

314
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,562
不会吧
No.

315
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,146
没错
Yes.

316
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,982
你怎么发现的?
Well, how did you find out?

317
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:21,490
唱片公司把合同寄给我 要我签名同意
Well, okay, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign saying that it's okay

318
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:25,245
让别人代唱 那是我第一个线索
for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.

319
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,408
那你要怎么办呢?
So, what are you gonna do?

320
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,496
我不能和这样做的人合作      当然
I can't work with people who would do this.        Sure.

321
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,161
这可怜的女人
I mean, this poor woman.

322
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,336
哪个女人?
What woman?

323
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,497
代唱的女人
The voice woman.

324
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,884
她的嗓音那么好 但她却没有MTV
I mean she has a great voice, but she doesn't have a video.

325
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,378
菲比 那你怎么办? 
Okay, Pheebs, but what about you?

326
00:19:43,378 --> 00:19:45,966
我有MTV 你们得注意听我说话
I have a video. You have to pay attention.

327
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,738
这个代唱的女人 她很有才华
No, this voice woman, she's so talented.

328
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:57,285
但据制作人说 她长的不够好看之类的
But according to the producer people, they said like she doesn't have the right look or something. You know?

329
00:19:57,285 --> 00:20:00,271
她就像被人丢弃在水池里的小动物
She's like one of those animals at the pound...

330
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,999
只因为他们不够漂亮就没有人要
who nobody wants because they're not pretty enough.

331
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:07,286
或是一些老狗 因为太臭又
Or, you know, like some old dog who's kind of like stinky and, oh

332
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,196
天啊 她就是臭臭猫!
my God! She's smelly cat!

333
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,269
噢 这首歌真有深度
Oh, oh, that song has so many levels.

334
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,710
嘿 艾迪
Hey, Eddie.

335
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,920
要玩桌上足球吗?
You, uh, wanna play some foosball?

336
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,507
不要 谢了 我对运动不太有兴趣
No. thanks. man. I'm not, uh, not really into sports.

337
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,852
好的 没关系
Yeah, okay. All right.

338
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,600
没关系 看海滩游侠的时候到了
Doesn't matter. Time for Baywatch.

339
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,800
什么?
Oh what?

340
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,363
你喜欢那个秀?
You like that show?

341
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,862
你不喜欢那个秀?
You don't like that show?

342
00:20:42,862 --> 00:20:45,300
什么? 不
Ha, ha, what? No.

343
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,702
不过是一群帅哥美女在海滩上跑来跑去
I mean, it's just pretty people running around on the beach.

344
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,539
这就是整个节目的精华所在啊
Well, that's the brilliance of it.

345
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,209
帅哥美女
The pretty people.

346
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,124
跑来跑去
And the running.

347
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,394
我要回房间看会书了
I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.

348
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:05,550
好吧
Oh, oh. Okay, man.

349
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,940
臭臭猫 臭臭猫
Smelly cat, smelly cat

350
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,487
他们都喂你吃什么?
What are they feeding you?

351
00:22:06,487 --> 00:22:07,315
大家一起唱!
Everybody!

352
00:22:07,315 --> 00:22:09,992
臭臭猫 臭臭猫
Smelly cat, smelly cat

353
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,448
不是你的错
It's not your fault.

354
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,800
摩妮卡!      他们不带你去兽医院
Monica.        They won't take you to the vet.

355
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,579
钱德!
Chandler.

356
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,504
你显然不是他们的最爱
You're obviously not their favorite pet.

357
00:22:22,504 --> 00:22:23,550
乔伊!
Joey.

358
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,894
你或许不是玫瑰花床
You may not be a bed of roses.

359
00:22:25,894 --> 00:22:30,088
瑞秋!      你不是有鼻子的人的朋友
Rachel        And you're no friend to those with noses.

360
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:35,050
罗斯 这首歌只有这几句 对不起 回到合唱!
Ross, those are the only lines we have. Sorry. Okay. Back to the chorus.

361
00:22:35,800 --> 00:23:35,472
