是这样的 我在试着过滤电话
No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing.

00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,394
我认为 如果我老是接电话 
You know,  I figure if I'm always answering the phone, 

9
00:00:31,395 --> 00:00:33,526
人们会觉得我没有生活
people will think I don't have a life.

我只是想起 以前我们在一起的美好时光
but I was just thinking about us and how great it was.

16
00:00:47,574 --> 00:00:50,039
我知道那已是三年前的事了

但我希望我们能够重修旧好
But I was kind of hoping we could hook up again.

18
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:55,878
你知道吗 我几乎没勇气打这个电话
You know, I barely had the nerve to make this call.

19
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:58,300
所以你知道我做了什么吗      什么

装个电话终于物有所值了
Having a phone has finally paid off.

40
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,109
就算你模仿鲍勃很像
Even though you do do a good Bob impression.

41
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,320
我想 她明天见到你的时候
I'm thinking when she sees you tomorrow,

42
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,999
大概还是会发现 嘿 你不是鲍勃
she's probably gonna realize, hey, you're not Bob.

43
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,281
我所希望的是 当鲍勃没出现时
I am hoping that when Bob doesn't show up,

44
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,328
她会向邻桌的陌生人张开的双臂间  寻求慰藉
she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.

45
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,289

饥渴又孤单

I've done this.

49
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,352

他生日 每人交62块给我
everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.

55
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:30,287
有没有可能 你取个整数就好
Is there any chance that you're rounding up from

56
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,832
像是20块
you know, like from, like 20?

57
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,794
拜托 我们要买礼物 看演唱会和买蛋糕
Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert and the cake.

58
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,716
我们需要蛋糕吗
Do we need a cake?

59
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,241
听着 我知道金额有点高
Look guys, I know it's a little steep.

60
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:45,241
没错 嗖
Yeah! Whoosh!

61

不过 是罗斯的生日

去做一件事
Do a thing.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.

67
00:04:01,597 --> 00:04:02,998
你不会真要这么做吧
You're not really gonna go through with this, are you?

68
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,526
我想我也许就会
You know I think I might just.

69
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,698
那么 你们今晚的晚餐要怎么办
So, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?

70
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,960
我想 我必须开始 为罗斯的生日存钱
Well, I guess I gotta start saving up for Ross's birthday.

71
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,834
所以我想 我待在家里 喝西北风就好了
So I guess, I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.

72
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,466
你们能相信 要花那么多钱吗
Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?

73
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,924
你们有没有过这种感觉
Do you guys ever get the feeling that,

74
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,994
钱德他们几个 不了解
Chandler and those guys just don't get that,

75
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:29,933
我们赚的钱不如他们多
we don't make as much money as they do?

76
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,305
对 没错      真的
Yes.Yeah         Really?

77
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,472
他们老是说 咱们去这里 咱们去那里
It's like they're always saying, "Let's go here, let's go there."

78
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,732
像是我们负担得起 去这里去那里一样   
Like we can afford to go here and there.

Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice.

I know.        You know? 

81
00:04:42,422 --> 00:04:45,316
老天 像是我们没什么说话的余地 
God! It's not like we can say anything about it, 

82
00:04:45,317 --> 00:04:47,705
因为 像这是为了生日 
because, like, this is a birthday thing, you know? 

83
00:04:47,706 --> 00:04:48,735
而且是为了罗斯
And it's for Ross.

84
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,411
为了罗斯      为了罗斯

85
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,286
我的天啊

86
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,624
嗨      怎么了
Hi.         What?

87
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,623
是这样的 我在工作
Okay. I'm at work

88
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:01,006
只是平凡的一天 你们知道的 切切炒炒
just an ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop saute saute saute.

89
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,843
突然 经理里昂叫我到他办公室
All of a sudden, Leon, the manager calls me into his office.

90
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,938
原来他们开除了午餐主厨 
Turns out they fired the head lunch chef. 

91
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,176
猜猜谁得到了那份工作
And guess who got the job?

92
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,175
如果不是你 这故事还真悲惨
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.

93
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,720
幸好是我      噢
Fortunately, it is me.         Oh!

94
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,355
而且他们升我为采购主管 多谢大家
And they made me head of purchasing. Thank you very much.

95
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,182
真棒
That's so cool.

96
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,626
我刚刚在楼下碰到钱德和罗斯 
Anyway, I just ran into Chandler and Ross downstairs. 

97
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:22,731
我想我们应该出去庆祝一下
I think we should go out and celebrate.

98
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,897
找个不错的地方
You know, someplace nice.

99
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,862
不错的地方      对
Someplace nice.         Yeah.

100
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,831
你们认为 我的肾能卖多少钱
How much you think I can get for my kidney?

101
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,373
我告诉你 你不能这么做
I'm telling you, you can't do this.

102
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:47,511
拜托 我用普通方法绝对追不到那种女生
Oh, come on, I can't never get a girl like that with conventional methods.

103
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,799
那不是重点
That doesn't matter.

104
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,339
她本来是打电话给鲍勃的
She wanted to call Bob.

105
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,884
我们知道 鲍勃才应该跟她在一起
Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with.

106
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:57,016
你也许在破坏 两个人追求快乐的机会
You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.

107
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,722
我们不认识鲍勃
We don't know Bob.

108
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:03,143
好吗 我们认识我 我们喜欢我 拜托让我快乐
Okay? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.

过去那里 告诉那女人真相
Go over there and tell that woman the truth.

110
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,653

00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,720
放你鸽子的那个人是烂人
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.

118
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,768
你怎么      我不知道
How did you?        I don't know.

119

我只是有这种奇怪的感应 
I just had this weird sense. You know? 

120
00:06:40,885 --> 00:06:43,183
不过这就是我 我古怪而敏感
But that's me. I'm weird and sensitive.

121

没关系 我先等等      对不起
That's fine.I'll just wait.         Aw, sorry.

135
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,030
对不起
Oh, sorry, sorry.

136
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:40,748
敬摩妮卡
Monica.

137
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,162
大家准备点菜了吗
Are we ready to order?

138
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,001
我们还没看菜单
Oh. You know what, we haven't even looked yet.

139
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,919
那你们看过之后再叫我
Well, when you do, just let me know.

140
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,836
我就在我的座位边上引颈期盼
I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.

141
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,925
哇 看看这些价格
Wow, look at these prices.

142
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,761
是啊 真不得了
Yeah, these are pretty "cha-ching."

143
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,766
对啊 这些是什么 名牌鸡吗
I know. What are these, famous chickens?

144
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,735
抱歉 我迟到了 摩妮卡 恭喜      谢了
Sorry.I'm late. Congratulations, Mon.         Thanks.

145
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,391
我不为迟到感到抱歉 
I'm not sorry. I'm late. 

146
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:13,073
我跟洁德一起的下午 相当不可思议
How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?

147
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:17,657
根据她在我的答录机上给你留的言 的确不可思议
Well, pretty incredible, according to the message she left you on my machine.

148
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,363
嘿 钱德 为什么这个女人
Hey, Chandler, why is this woman

149
00:08:20,363 --> 00:08:22,579
会在我的答录机上给你留言
leaving a message for you on my machine?

150
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,993
我必须告诉她 我的号码是你的号码
See, I had to tell her that my number was your number.

151
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,287
因为我不能告诉她 我的号码是我的号码
Because I couldn't tell her my number was my number.

152
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,127
因为她以为 我的号码是鲍勃的号码
Because she thinks my number is Bob's number.

153
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,920
再告诉我一次 罗普先生打来时 我该怎么做
Hey, tell me again. What do I do when Mr. Roper calls?

154
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,718
我能斗胆问一下吗
Do I dare ask?

155
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,909
好 我先来一份生牛肉 
Yes, I'll start with the carpaccio. 

156
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,347
再来一份烤明虾
And then I'll have the grilled prawns.

157
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,130
听起来不错 我也一样      
That sounds great, same for me.

158
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:44,933
这位男士呢
And for the gentleman?

159
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,939
我要泰式鸡肉披萨
Yeah,I'll have the Thai chicken pizza.

160
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,193
但是 假如我不要坚果 韭葱等材料
But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff,

161
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,228
会便宜一点吗
is it cheaper?

162
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,731
你以为会 是不是
You'd think, wouldn't you?

163
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,071
小姐      好的
Miss?         Okay.

164
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,659
我要配餐沙拉
I will have the side salad.

165
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,073
它要配什么餐呢
And what would that be on the side of?

166
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,040
我不知道
I don't know.

167
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,245
不如就把它放在我的水旁边好了
Why don't you just put it right here next to my water?

168
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,047
那么你呢
And for you?

169
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:16,837
我要一碗黄瓜汤
I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup.

170
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,551
以及
and,

171
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,845
保重
take care.

172
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,894
我要一份卡津鲶鱼      还要别的吗
I will have the Cajun catfish.         Anything else?

173
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,893
要 来一段《情歌销魂》怎样
Yes, how about a verse of "Killing Me Softly"?

174
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,605
你会朝我的鱼打喷嚏 是不是
You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?

175
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,993
加上小费 除以6
Plus tip, divided by six,

176
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,208
好 每个人28块      好的
Okay, everyone owes 28 bucks.        Okay!

177
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,248
每个人吗
Everyone?

178
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,256
你说得对 真抱歉
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.

179
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,461
谢谢
Thank you.

180
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,134
今晚是摩妮卡的大日子 她不该付钱
It's Monica's big night. She shouldn't pay.

181
00:09:57,135 --> 00:09:58,595
谢谢
Aw, thank you.

182
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,471

184
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,893
不 才不要 抱歉 不可能
No. No way. Sorry, not gonna happen.

185
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,979
等等 毕业舞会情景重现
Whoa. Whoa. Prom night flashback.

186
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,981
抱歉 摩妮卡 你升职 我真的很高兴
Sorry, Monica. I'm really happy you got promoted.

187
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,405
但是冷黄瓜糊要三十几块
But cold cucumber mush for 30something bucks?

188
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,610
不
No.

189
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,531
瑞秋只吃了一小份沙拉
Rachel just had that little salad.

190
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,080
乔伊吃了一小块披萨
And Joey with his, like, teeny pizza.

191
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,207
好了 菲比
Okay, Pheebs.

192
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,502
不如我们各付各的 好吗
How about we'll each just pay for what we had, okay?

193
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,126
没什么大不了      对你是这样
It's no big deal.         Not for you.

194
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,174
好了 怎么回事
All right, what's going on?

195
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,548
好吧 听着 我现在真的不想提这个
Okay, look you guys, I really don't wanna get into this right now.

196
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,658
这只会让大家都不舒服 
I think it'll just make everybody uncomfortable.         

197
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:46,889
好 没关系 好
Oh, fine. All right, fine.

198
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,221
干嘛      你们可以告诉我们
What? Whoa, whoa.         You can tell us.

199
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,273
对 拜托 是我们 好吗 我们能接受
Yeah hello? It's us. All right? We'll be fine.

200
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,899
是啊
Yeah!

201
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,272
好吧
Okay.

202
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:03,318
我们三个觉得
We three feel like that,

203
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,909
有时候你们不了解
sometimes you guys don't get that,

204
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,961
我们没你们那么有钱
we don't have as much money as you.

205
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,171
好      我听到了
Okay         I hear you.

206
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,924
我们可以讨论一下这件事
We can talk about that.

207
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,218
那么
Well, then

208
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,141
就来吧
let's.

209
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:38,195
我猜 我只是从没想到 钱会构成问题
Well, I guess I just never think of money as an issue.

210
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,443
因为你有钱      这一点说得好
That's because you have it.         That's a good point.

211
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:46,654
那么 为什么你们以前从没提过这件事
So, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?

212
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,519
因为总是有特别的事情
Because it's always something, you know? 

213
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,039
像是摩妮卡的新职位
Like with Monica's new job,

214
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,077
或是罗斯生日要盛大庆祝
or the whole Ross birthday hoopla.

215
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,210
什么 等等 嘿
What? Whoa, hey.

216
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:59,920
我可不希望我的生日 造成任何的不愉快
I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative.

217
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,001
到时候会有盛大的庆祝吗
There's gonna be a hoopla?

218
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,621
基本上 有一件事 
Basically there's the thing, 

219
00:12:06,622 --> 00:12:09,093
然后还有那件事之后的事
and then the stuff after the thing and it's...

220
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,812
如果可以让大家好过些 我们可以忘了那件事
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing.

221
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,060
只送礼物就好
And we'll just do the gift.

222
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,892
礼物 那件事不是礼物
Gift? The thing's not the gift?

223
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,900
不 那件事就是 我们要去看"混混与自大狂"演唱会
No, the thing was we were gonna go see "Hootie and the Blowfish".

224
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,290
混混与 我的天 
Hootie and the...Oh my...

225
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,863
我听广播就好了
I can catch them on the radio.

226
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:30,034
不 我现在觉得内疚了 你想去听演唱会的
No. Now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.

227
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,662
不 听着 这是我生日
No, look, hey, it's my birthday.

228
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,040
最重要的是我们大家能在一起
And the important thing is that we all be together.

229
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,416
我们所有人      在一起
All of us.         Together.

230
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,205
不是在演唱会场
Not at the concert.

231
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,217
好吧 谢谢      好吧      
Okay. Thank you.         Yeah.

232
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,628
谢谢      好吧
Thanks!        Yeah!

233
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,933
那个伊波拉病毒 真要命吧
So, the Ebola virus, that's gotta suck, huh?

234
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,560
天呀 摩妮卡 袋子里有什么
Gee Monica. What's in the bag?

235
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,317
我不知道 钱德 咱们来看看
I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.

236
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,444
像是短剧表演
Oh, it's like a skit.

237
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,865
原来是六人晚餐 五块牛排
Why, it's dinner for six. Five steaks,

238
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,413
和给菲比的一条茄子
and an eggplant for Phoebe.

239
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,500
我们餐厅换了肉类供应商 
We switched meat suppliers at work. 

240
00:13:16,501 --> 00:13:18,412
新供应商给了我这些牛排 算是谢礼
And the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thankyou.

241
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,840
等等 还有 钱德 那信封里有什么
But wait, there's more. Hey Chandler, what is in that envelope?

242
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,086
对了 刚在走廊练习时 好像没这么呆
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky out in the hall.

243
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,345
快点
Come on.

244
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,012
原来是 "混混与自大狂"的六张门票
Why, it's six tickets to "Hootie and the Blowfish".

245
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,638
自大狂
The Blowfish.

246
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:42,277
我们付钱的 所以别担心 由我们请客
It's on us, all right? So don't worry. This is our treat.

247
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,029
那么 谢谢
So, thank you.

248
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,867
你们能更冷淡一点吗
Could you be less enthused?

249
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,491
听着 这是很好的表示 真的
Look, it's a nice gesture. It is.

250
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,489
可是感觉像是
But it just feels like...

251
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,994
像
Like?

252
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,955
施舍      施舍
Charity.         Charity?

253
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,545
我们只是想表达一番好意
We're just trying to do a nice thing here.

254
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,500
没错 罗斯 你得了解 
Yeah, Ross, you have to understand, 

255
00:14:03,501 --> 00:14:05,842
你的好意 令我们觉得 我们是这么渺小
your nice thing makes us feel about this big.

256
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,007
其实是 令我们觉得这么渺小
Actually, it makes us feel that big.

257
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,352
什么 我搞不明白
What? I don't understand. 

258
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:15,062
我们好像怎么做 你们都觉得不对
I mean, it's like we can't win with you guys.

259
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,146
没错 如果你们觉得渺小 也许那不是我们的错
Yeah, I mean, if you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault.

260
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,230
也许那只是你们的感受
Maybe that's just how you feel.

261
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,395
噢
Oh!

262
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:26,178
现在 你在断定我们的感受      
Now you're telling us how we feel.        

263
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:28,069
各位 看见了吧 我们真不该提起这件事的
You guys, see? Okey! We never should have talked about this.

264
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,990
好吧 我不去演唱会了
All right, I'm gonna pass on the concert.

265
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,528
因为我现在实在是没那个心情去"混”
Because I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.

266
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,366
我也一样      我也是
Me neither.         Me too.

267
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,831
各位 我们都已经买好票了
Guys, we bought the tickets.

268
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:44,581
刚好你们有空座位 可以放你们的皇冠什么的
Oh well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.

269
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,384
你说话时 为什么看着我
Why did you look at me when you said that?

270
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,348
这下我猜 我们都不能去了
So I guess now we can't go.

271
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,727
什么 拜托 你们想做什么就去做 
What? Come on, you do what you want. 

272
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:58,894
我们非得做什么都在一起吗
Do we always have to do everything together?

273
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,890
知道吗 你说得对
You know what? You're right.

274
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,016
好      好
Fine.         Fine.

275
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,734
好      好
Fine.         Fine.

276
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,404
好      好的
Fine.         All right.

277
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,069
我们要去了
We're gonna go.

278
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,863
还有六小时才开始 我们到时候再去
It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.

279
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,542
钱德      有
Chandler?         Yeah.

280
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,334
天啊
Oh, jeez.

281
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,295
你准备好没      好了 好了
Are you ready?         Yes. Yes.

282
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:36,765
让我拿上西装外套 跟你说我今天跟人上床了
Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.

283
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,053
什么 你今天跟人上床了
What? You had sex today?

284
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,605
从别人嘴里说出来 听起来更酷
Wow! It sounds even cooler when somebody else says it.

285
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,559
我简直是棒呆了
I was awesome, okay? 

286
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,275
她拼命咬着嘴唇 才不会尖叫出来
She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.

287
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,650
哇喔
Wow!

288
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:54,238
我知道我有阵子没做了 但我把那当成好的迹象
Now, I know it's been a while, but I took that as a good sign.

289
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,078
还在过滤电话
Still doing the screening thing?

290
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,205
我今天跟人上床了
I had sex today.

291
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,542
我再也不用去接那个电话了
I never have to answer that phone again.

292
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,916
哔声要来了 你知道该怎么做
Here comes the beep. You know what to do.

293
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,964
嘿 鲍勃 是我洁德 听着
He Bob.It's Jade. Listen.

294
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,386
我只想告诉你 你那天放我鸽子 
I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt, 

295
00:16:14,387 --> 00:16:15,596
我非常难过
when you didn't show up the other day.

296
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,676
后来 我认识了一个男的
And just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.

297
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,973
我是鲍勃
Bob here.

298
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,934
喔 嗨
Oh, hi.

299
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,391
你认识了别人吗
So, you met someone, huh?

300
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,067
是的 我认识了别人
Yes. Yes, I did.

301
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,813
事实上 我两小时前跟他上床了
In fact, I had sex with him two hours ago.

302
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,194
那么 他表现怎样
So, how was he?

303
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,965
鲍勃 他根本比不上你
Oh Bob, he was nothing compared to you.

304
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,217
我必须咬着嘴唇 才不会叫出你的名字
I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.

305
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,426
那令我很欣慰
Well, that makes me feel so good.

306
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,888
过程很笨拙又颠簸
It was just so awkward and bumpy.

307
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,644
颠簸
Bumpy?

308
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,783
也许他有某种很酷的新风格 
Maybe he had some kind of new cool style, 

309
00:17:10,784 --> 00:17:12,152
只是你不熟悉
that you're not familiar with.

310
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,571
也许你只要习惯就好
And, maybe you have to get used to it.

311
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,189
根本没多少时间可以让我习惯 
Well, there really wasn't much time to get used to it.

312
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,238
你懂我意思吧
You know what I mean?

313
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,089
你知道吗 我实在没心情听这个
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.

314
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,589
是 我懂 这是我生日 我们应该全部在一起
Yeah I know. It's my birthday. We all should be here.

315
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,795
那么走吧
So let's go.

316
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,687
也许我们该留下来听一首歌
Well, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.

317
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,774
对 假如我们现在离开 对他们很没礼貌
Yeah. I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.

318
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,925
说不定 他们现在正玩得很开心呢
You know, the guys are probably having a great time.

319
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,361
拜托 两位 再来一次
Come on, you guys. One more time.

320
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,693
好吧
Okay.

321
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,620
一      不是
One.         No.

322
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,214
非常精彩      
That was amazing.        

323
00:18:13,215 --> 00:18:14,758
太棒了 非常棒
Excellent.That was excellent.

324
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:15,677
我不敢相信 他们错过这个
I can't believe the guys missed this.

325
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,589
什么人 喔 对了
What guys? Oh, yeah.

326
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,930
打扰一下 你是摩妮卡盖勒吗
Excuse me. You're Monica Geller, aren't you?

327
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,759
我认识你吗      你以前是我的保姆
Do I know you?         You used to be my babysitter.

328
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,929
我的天 小史提夫费雪
Oh, my God. Little Stevie Fisher?

329
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,639
你近来好吗
How have you been?

330
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,561
很好 我现在是个律师
Good, good. I'm a lawyer now.

331
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:34,064
你不可能是律师 你才八岁
You can't be a lawyer.You're 8.

332
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,481
很高兴见到你 我得回后台了
Well, listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.

333
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,050
等等 后台      
Wait, backstage? 

334
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,570
对 我的事务所代表这乐团
Oh, yeah. My firm represents the band.

335
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,284
罗斯      钱德
Ross.         Chandler.

336
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,057
你们想去认识一下他们吗      
Look, you guys wanna meet the group?         

337
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:46,785
当然 我们想
Yeah, we do.

338
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:47,994
来吧
Come on.

339
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,494
你以前也跟我老爸乱搞过吗
So, look, are you one of the ones that fooled around with my dad?

340
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,959
你们好      生日快乐
Hey, you guys.        Happy birthday.

341
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,878
谢谢 谢谢
Oh, thank you. Thanks.

342
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,221
所以
So, 

343
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,100
你们昨晚过得怎样
How was your night last night?

344
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,853
蛮逊的 你们呢
Oh well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?

345
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,768
我们的也很逊
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked too.

346
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,937
但是我碰到了史提夫费雪 
Oh, but I did run into Stevie Fisher. 

347
00:19:13,938 --> 00:19:14,694
你记得他吗
Do you remember him?

348
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,777
当然 我以前当过他的保姆
Oh, yeah. I used to babysit him.

349
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,521
他爸还好吗
Hey, how's his dad?

350
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:21,991
很好
Good.

351
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,612
除此之外 整个晚上实在没什么好提的
Aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.

352
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,698
对 我们很想你们
Yeah, we really missed you guys.

353
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:32,706
听着 我们想说 整件事实在是太傻了
Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is so stupid.

354
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:38,007
我们必须真的真的 不让钱这种事情影响到
We just have to really really really not let stuff like this, money get like...

355
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,462
那是吻痕吗
Is that a hickey?

356
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,425
不 我只是
Oh, no, I just...

357
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,381
我跌倒了
I fell down.

358
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,476
倒在别人嘴唇上
On someone's lips?

359
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,434
你的吻痕是从哪来的
Where'd you get the hickey?

360
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,016
大概是派对      什么派对
You know, a party or...        What party?

361
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:59,821
其实不太算派对 只是一群人聚在一起
Well, it wasn't a party, so much as a gathering of people.

362
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,490
有食物和音乐以及
With food and music and...

363
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,325
以及乐团
and the band.

364
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,905
你们跟"混混与自大狂" 一起"混"
You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?

365
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:13,034
没错 显然史提夫跟"混混"很熟
Yes. Apparently, Stevie and "Hootie" are like this.

366
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,578
那吻痕是谁给你的
Who gave you that hickey?

367
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,956
应该是一个"自大狂"的杰作
That would be the work of a "Blowfish".

368
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,087
我不敢相信 我不敢相信
I can't believe it. I can't believe this.

369
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,456
我们只是呆坐在家 
We're just like sitting at home, 

370
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:28,845
试着猜乔伊比几根手指
just trying to guess Joey's fingers,

371
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,351
你们则在外面 寻欢作乐
and you guys are out, like, partying and having fun.

372
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,436
以及 "嘿 自大狂 来吸我的脖子"
And you know, all, "Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck."

373
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,654
听着 别怪我们 你们原本也可以去的
Hey, look, don't blame us. You guys could've been there, you know?

374
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,984
干嘛 参与你的 "穷朋友施舍计划"
Oh what? As part of your "Poor Friends Outreach" program?

375
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,032
太好了 公司打来的
Oh, great. It's work.

376
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,896
我不知道该说什么 
Look,  I don't know what to say. 

377
00:20:50,897 --> 00:20:52,911
很遗憾我们赚得比你们多
I'm sorry that we make more than you.

378
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,741
但我们不打算觉得愧疚
But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. 

379
00:20:54,742 --> 00:20:56,248
我们是辛苦工作得到的
We work really hard for it.

380
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,120
那我们没辛苦工作吗
And we don't work hard?

381
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,960
我是摩妮卡 刚有人呼我
Yeah. hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.

382
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:04,169
我只是说 有时我们想做一些比较花钱的事
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.

383
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,462
你觉得我们成了你的绊脚石      对
Oh, and you feel like we hold you back.         Yes.

384
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:08,638
噢      不对
Oh!        No.

385
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,554
里昂 等一下 大家安静
Leon, Leon, wait. Shh! Guys.

386
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,601
等等 我不了解
Wait. I don't understand.

387
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,149
那些牛排只是供应商的礼物
Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor.

388
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,935
那不是回扣
That was not a kickback.

389
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,772
拜托 我会补回去 我们就此忘掉这件事
I mean, come on, I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing.

390
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:28,993
什么企业政策
What corporate policy?

391
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:36,034
不 是
No...Yeah.

392
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,751
好的
Okay.

393
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,462
我刚刚被开除了
I just got fired.

394
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,967
这是你的帐单 4.12元
Here's your check. That'll be four twelve.

395
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,435
我来付
Let me get that.

396
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,439
你有五块吗
You got 5 bucks?
