1
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:10,541
我会去拿蜡烛跟我妈的蕾丝桌巾
So I'll get candles and my mom's lace table cloth.

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,388
因为我想让瑞秋过一个特别的生日 
Since it's Rachel's birthday and we want it to be special...

3
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,595
我想我会做水煮鲑鱼      噢                 
I thought I'd poach a salmon        Oh

4
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,093
怎么了?
What?

5
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,675
问题是为什么每次办派对你都要做水煮食物?
Question, why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?

6
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,144
你要掌管食物委员会吗?
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?

7
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:26,504
问题二 为什么我们办派对一定要有委员会?
Question two, why do we always have parties with committees?

8
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,733
我们为什么就不能点些披萨...
Yeah, yeah. Why can't we just get some pizzas...

9
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,940
买几罐啤酒来狂欢?      对啊?
...and gets some beers and have fun?        Yeah.

10
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:35,441
我赞成派对真正好玩的地方是你打内心就喜欢它
Yeah, I agree.You know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside

11
00:00:35,441 --> 00:00:37,175
但我不确定我们现在是不是
and I'm just not sure we are.

12
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,659
好吧 你们不希望它很特别
All right. You guys don't want it to be special

13
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,494
好吧 你们想办什么派对随便你们
Fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.

14
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,300
乔伊 它们不是真的      啊?啊?
Joey,they're not real.        Huh? Huh.

15
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,839
我在里面塞了很多东西 好么? 它们是假的
I start miles beneath the surface of these things, okay? They're fake.

16
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,545
看到没? 咔咔
See? Honk honk.

17
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:57,504
那像是给小丑看的色情片
Wow, it's like porno for clowns.

18

22
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,488
我问过瑞秋的姐妹了 她们都来不了
I talked to Rachels sisters. Neither of them can come.

23
00:01:50,488 --> 00:01:54,190
好吧 我还得要邀请戴伦 艾玛和莎朗古柏
Ok, so I still have to invite Dylan and Emma and Shannon Cooper.

24
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,925
喔 喔 喔 别邀请莎朗古柏 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh, no Shannon Cooper.

25
00:01:56,925 --> 00:01:58,175
为什么?
Why not her?

26
00:01:58,175 --> 00:02:01,152
因为她会偷东西
Because she, uh... She steals stuff.

27
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:08,622
或许她没偷东西 乔伊只是跟她上过床 没回她电话
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey slept with her and never called her back.

28
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,166
乔伊 这太坑爹了吧
Joey, that is horrible.

29
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:17,008
我喜欢她 好吗? 或许我太喜欢她了 我也不清楚
Hey, I liked her,All right? Maybe may be too much. I don't know.

30
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,135
我想我只是被吓到了
I guess I just got scared.

31
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,339
天啊      抱歉 我不知道
oh        I'm sorry. I didn't know.

32
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,300
我以为没有人会相信 好吧
I didn't think anyone would buy that. Okay.

33
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:31,231
甜心 情况如何?      那是地狱般的毕业典礼
Hi, honey. How did it go?        Ugh. It was the graduation from hell.

34
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,300
我表弟可是靠足球奖学金才上那个"地狱大学"的
You know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.

35
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,900
我是说那应该是个欢乐的场面
You know I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion.

36
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:41,283
我妹妹从大学毕业了 以前都没人想到她能毕业
My sister's graduating from college. Nobody thought she would.

37
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:45,300
应验了一句谚语 "会咬人的狗不会叫"
It's a true testament to what a girl from Long Island would do for a Celica.

38
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,074
发生了什么事?      是我爸妈啦
So, what happened?        My parents happened.

39
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,369
他们需要做的就是坐在同一个体育场骄傲地微笑
All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly...

40
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,584
不再提离婚的事 但是他们却没能做到...
and not talk about the divorce. But no...

41
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,626
他们在毕业生致词时大吵一架
They got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address.

42
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:03,456
杜图主教不得不停下来嘘他们
Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them.

43
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,550
但是你知道吗?你们知道好消息是什么吗?
Ugh. But you know what? You know what the good news is?

44
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,050
接下来我得端八小时的咖啡
I get to serve coffee for the next eight hours.

45
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,557
好吧 我想我们不能邀请她爸妈了
Okay, so I guess we don't invite her parents.

46
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,317
只邀请她妈妈怎么样?      为什么?
Well,how about just her mom?        Why her mom?

47
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,104
因为我已经邀请她了
Because I already invited her

48
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,273
你邀邀请史黛西・萝丝了吗?
did you ask Stacy Roth?

49
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,691
额...不能邀请她
Uh,can't invite her

50
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,487
她也会偷东西
She also steals.

51
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,755
这是生日蜡烛 生日蛋糕在哪里?
Okay, here are the candles. Where's the birthday cake?

52
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:41,362
没有生日蛋糕 我们要吃生日果馅饼
Okay,we're not having birthday cake. We're having birthday flan.

53
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,133
什么?
Excuse me?

54
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:48,012
那是传统墨西哥馅饼甜点      太棒了
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.        Whoa,that's nice.

55
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,726
生日快乐 瑞秋 吃点馅饼
Happy birthday, Rachel. Here's some go.

56

天啊 是瑞秋的爸爸
Oh, my God.It's Rachel's dad.

58
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,283
你来这里做什么?      
What are you doing here?

59
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,196
什么?做父亲的不能在女儿过生日时来看她?
What?the father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?

60
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,204
不 你当然可以啦
No. no. the father can.

61
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:14,334
我是她的室友 她现在不在这里
But, urn, since I am the roommate, I can tell you that she's not here.

62
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,712
我会告诉她的 好吗? 再见
And I'll pass along the message. Okay? So bye-bye.

63
00:04:17,712 --> 00:04:20,420
你们在办派对呀
You're having a party.

64
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,004
不 不是派对
No, no, not a party.

65
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:25,763
只是一些认识瑞秋的人给她准备的惊喜聚会
Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows.

66
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:30,425
他们是菲比 钱德跟乔伊      反正我也记不住
Uh, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.        I'll never remember all of that.

67
00:04:30,425 --> 00:04:32,477
那个惊喜是什么?
So, uh, what's the deal?

68
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:36,390
瑞秋一回家就会有人跳出来大叫? 是这样的吗?
Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff? Is that it?

69
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,440
这不是你第一次参加惊喜派对吧?
This isn't your first surprise party, is it, sir?

70
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,860
你好 摩妮卡
Hi, Monica.

71
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,446
是中国餐馆的人 她忘了拿菜单
The Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.

72
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,866
其实只是一个中国人而已
So basically, just a Chinese guy.

73
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,331
葛林医生 请跟我来
Hey, Dr. Green. come with me.

74
00:04:57,331 --> 00:05:00,376
我们得把你的外套放在瑞秋床上
We'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.

75
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,839
好吧 听起来似乎是需要两个人才能做
All right. That sounds like a two-person job.

76
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,382
天啊 那是怎么一回事?
Well, my goodness. What was that?

77
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,987
桑德拉 我很抱歉 我以为你是瑞秋

78
00:05:12,987 --> 00:05:14,999
我们还没准备好瑞秋的派对
And we just weren't ready for you yet.

79
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:18,607
你以为我是瑞秋?      是啊 因为你看起来很年轻
You thought I was Rachel?        Yes, because, uh, you look so young.

80
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:21,675
因为你们都是白种女人
And because you're both, you know, white women.

81
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:28,530
孩子们 我想你们了 我该把外套放到卧室去吗?
Oh, I missed you kids.Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?

82
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,073

83
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,538

Oh, it all looks so nice. So festive all the balloons.

87
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,836
我来这里的路上发生了一件非常有趣的事
Oh,the funniest thing happened to me on the way here.

88
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,505
我开着车...      真好笑 哈哈哈
I was driving...        That's great. Ha-ha-ha.

89
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:57,930
我等不及要听完其他部分 但我得去上厕所
I can't wait to hear the rest, but I have to go to the bathroom.

90
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,099
那就跟我一起去吧      什么?
So,Hey, come with me.        what?

Oh, my God,my God,my God.        Okay, think. Think.

95
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,748
杰克跟克丽丝会怎么做?
What would Jack and Chrissy do?

96
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:22,204
你的外套已经安全的放在床上了...

98
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,299
乔伊跟钱德 你们该带葛林医生去你们家
So, Joey and Chandler, I think it's time that you take Dr. Green over to your place.

99
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,430

Uh, yes, absolutely.

100
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,636
为什么?
Urn, why, again?

101
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,999
因为派对要在那里举行 笨蛋
Because that's where the party is,you goon.

102
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,270
这里只是准备区
See, this is just the staging area.

103
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,274
对 这里是准备区      这里什么也没有
Right,it's the staging area.        There wasn't anything else

104
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,728
明显不是这个公寓
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.

105
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:55,828
好吧 你们去一号派对

爸爸

131
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,253
他们都来了? 他们都来了?
Both of them are here? Both of them? Both of them are here?

132
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,222
我们可以再数一次  
Well, we could count again.

133
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,888
我不敢相信会发生这种事  
I can't believe this is happening

134
00:08:35,888 --> 00:08:37,550
你知道吗? 这太荒谬了
You know what? This is ridiculous.

135
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,141
这是你的生日 这是你的派对
Okay, this is your birthday, this is your party.

136
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,894
我们得让他们知道实情
I say we just put them all together

137
00:08:41,894 --> 00:08:43,599
如果他们不接受 谁在乎呢?
If they can't deal with it, who cares?

138
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,389
我在乎      那才是最重要的
I do.        That's who.

139
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,142
你没事吧?
Look, are you gonna be okay?

140
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,317
我真的没有选择 我得往好的方面去想
Well I have to be.I don't really have a choice.I mean, I can look at the bright side.

141
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,283
我有两个生日派对和两个生日蛋糕
I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.

142
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:00,571
事实上有一个是生日果馅饼
Well, actually just one birthday flan.

143
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,243
什么?      它是传统墨西哥馅饼甜点
What?        It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.

144
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:09,550
去问摩妮卡 她负责食物 我不能...
Look, talk to Monica.She's on the food committee. I can't...

145
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,548
乔伊 有个女孩走向我 她说"我要你 丹尼斯"
Joe Joe, hey, some girl just walked up to me and said"I want you,Dennis"

146
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,263
然后把她的舌头伸进我的喉咙里
and stuck her tongue down my throat.

147
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,723
我爱这个派对      太棒了!
I love this party.        great!

148
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,105
排球机智问答      排球?
Quick volleyball question.        Volleyball?

149
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,186
我们在你房里搭了一个球场
Yeah, we set up a court in your room.

150
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,191
你不喜欢那盏灰色的灯吧?
Uh,you didn't like that gray lamp, did you?

151
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,379
有个女人将舌头伸进我的喉咙里
Joey, a woman just stuck her tongue down my throat.

152
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:37,320
我根本没在听你说话
I'm not even listening to you.

153
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:41,278
丹尼斯      她在叫我
Dennis.        Okay,that's me.

154
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:45,870
甜心 你能去陪爸爸吗? 我得跟我妈妈聊一会
Listen, ahem, honey, can you keep Dad occupied? I'm gonna go talk to Mom for a while.

155
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,581
好吧 我该说些什么?
Okay, do you have any ideas for any openers?

156
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:52,713
千万别提 "我正在跟你女儿上床"
Uh,let's just stay clear of "I'm the guy that's doing your daughter"

157
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,591
你应该就会没事     
and you should be okay.

158
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,927
大家每人拿一张纸出来
Okay, people,I want you to take a piece of paper

159
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:03,138
来吧 写下你们最丢脸的事
you go. And write down your most embarrassing memory.

160
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:08,100
请大家不用麦克笔时一定要将笔帽盖上
And I do ask that when you're not using the markers...you put the caps back on them...

161
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,645
因为它们会干掉
because they will dry out.

162
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,267
你好 葛林医生
Hi Dr. Green.

还好玩吧?
vascular surgery game?

165
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:25,999
那不是游戏 罗斯 今天有个女人死在手术台上了
It's not a game, Ross.A woman died on my table today.

166
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,162
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,440
看 这就是我工作上的好处
See, that's the good thing about my job.

168
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,340
我工作台上的恐龙早就死了
All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.

169
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,462
大伙们 我不想嗦了...
Listen, you guys, urn, I don't mean to be a pain about this...

170
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,848
但我发现有些人只是随意盖上
but, urn, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on.

171
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,929
你们得用力压笔帽...
You want to push the caps...

172
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,930
直到听见"咔"的一声
until you hear them click.

173
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,691
阿甘 你要去哪里?
Gunther. Where are you going?

174
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,569
我想或许...
I, uh, was sort of thinking about maybe...

175
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,947
不 你不能走 这很好玩
No,No, you can't go. No, this is fun.

176
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,191
我们才刚刚开始 拿去 这是你的马克笔
Come on, come on, we're just getting started.Here's your marker

177
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,781
听着 你想走的话快点走
Listen, if you want to go, just go.

178

不 她还会吼我的
No. She'll yell at me again.

179
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:17,465
好吧 我能把你弄出去      什么?
All right,ahem, I can get you out.        What?

180
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,715
嘘~
Shh.

181
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,469
一分钟后我会分散她的注意力
In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion.

182
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,831
你得趁乱走出去 千万别回头
When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.

183
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,344
我想喝一杯      我去帮你拿酒
I think I need a drink.        Oh, I'll get it for you.

184
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,987
你要喝什么?      威士忌
What do you want?        Scotch.

185
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:36,550
我会很快拿着加冰威士忌回来的
All right, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your Scotch on the rocks in a glass.

186
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,692
纯的      加冰的      不 不 不
Neat.        Cool.        No, no, no.

187
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,778
我是说我要纯的不加冰块的
Neat, as in no rocks.

188
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,485
我知道了
Heh. I know.

189
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,329
罗斯 你跑到哪里去了?      你好
Oh, hello, Ross. Now, where have you been?        Hi

190
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:56,246
我在厕所里
Uh, I have been in the bathroom.

191
00:11:56,246 --> 00:11:59,211
我得将鲑鱼慕斯吐出来
Ahem. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.

192
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,464
纯威士忌

193
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,425

196
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,103

197
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,445
喂 喂
Hey,Hey.

198

烟放外套里了 我去拿
I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.

别去      "别去"什么意思?
No.        No? What do you mean "no"?

201
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,582
不行 因为那是准备区
No. urn, see, because that's the staging area.

202
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,925
你去那里去会毁了你对派对的幻想的
You go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party.

203
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,612
对 拿着你的威士忌回去...
Yeah, I think, you take your Scotch back in there...

我去帮你拿烟
and I will get your cigarettes for you, sir.

205
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,138
也帮我拿眼镜来      没问题
And get my glasses too.        All righty-roo.

206
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,273
我第一次那么说竟然是在这种情况下
What a great moment to say that for the first time.

207
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:04,985
好吧 第一个人最丢脸回忆是

208
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,616
"摩妮卡 你的派对烂透了"
"Monica,your party sucks."

209
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,157
太有趣了
All right. Very funny.

210
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:14,113
天哪 有人忘了用杯垫吗?
Oh, no. Ooh. Did someone forget to use a coaster?

211

217
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,357
嗯哼
Mm-hm.

218
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:45,405
我的眼睛有些问题所以我需要...
I have a condition apparently...that I require...

219

00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,200
不知道      那种镜框很普遍
no        Well, those are very popular frames.

00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,663
尼尔赛达卡也戴这种镜框
Neil Sedaka wears them.

223

224
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,300
瑞秋      嗯? 
Rachel?        Yeah?

225
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,215
你没告诉我你男朋友会抽烟
You didn't tell me your boyfriend smokes.

226
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,384
对 他烟瘾非常重
Yeah, like a chimney.

227

只能你们三个 再多她一定会起疑
No, only the three of you. Any more than that and she'll get suspicious.

241
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:20,408
好吧 我去拿外套      没时间了
All right. Let me just get my coat.        There isn't time.

You know, my party is fun.I mean, maybe it's a little quieter less obvious sort of fun.

257
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,014
如果大家愿意给它一个机会 它非常...
But, you know, if people would just give it a chance, it's...

258
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:32,773
你要我去看心理医生?      甜心 你明显有问题
You want me to see a therapist?        Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem.

259
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,999
你选的男朋友跟你爸是一个模子印出来的
You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.

260
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,999
妈妈 你知道么? 好吧 我会去预约
Okay, Mom, you know what? Fine. I'll make an appointment.

261
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,488
但我得走了 我还有事要做
Okay? But you know what? Right now, I gotta go. I gotta go do a thing.

262
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:48,664
你知道你妈花一千二买盆栽的事吗?
Did you know your mother spent $1200 on bonsai trees?

263
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,925
我觉得自己被绑得喘不过气
I felt like Gulliver around that place.

264
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:57,889
爸爸 爸爸 我真的很想听你说 但我还有事要做
Daddy, Daddy I really want to hear more about this,i really do, but I just have to do,uh,some stuff.

265
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,176
我非常努力的经营婚姻
You work and you work and you work at a marriage...

266
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,720
但他只在乎他的笨船
but all he cares about is his stupid boat.

267
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,810
我非常努力地将船弄好
You work and you work and you work on a boat.

268
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,896
他老是嘲笑我的陶艺课
He always ridiculed my pottery classes.

269
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,062
帮它打光上漆
And you sand it and you varnish it.

270
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,300
我用尽所有办法 他还是用马克杯喝东西
But when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.

271
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,194
有一晚是她的瑜如课 跟"麦迪逊之桥"
One night of her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...

272
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,284
威士忌 香烟...      盆栽 吉娃娃...
Scotch, cigarettes...        Bonsais, the Chihuahua...

273
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,665
我只做了三星期的心理治疗 但...
I've only been in therapy three weeks now but...

274
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:28,043
她要一半的船做什么?
What's the hell does she want with half a boat?

275
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:35,460
好吧 你当上衣 我当皮肤
Okay, okay, okay, you can be shirts and I'll be skins.

276
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,345
我可以当皮肤
I'll be skins.

277
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,551
嘿
Hey.

278
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,175
你还好吧 老虎?
How you holding up there, tiger?

279
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:51,692
抱歉 我爸妈离婚时 很多人叫我老虎
Oh. Sorry. When my parents were getting divorced, I got a lot of "tigers."

280
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:56,565
也有人叫我冠军 老大跟小子
Ahem. I got a lot of "champs" "chiefs" "sports"

281
00:17:56,565 --> 00:17:58,488
有一个人叫我州长
Ahem. I even got a "governor"

282
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,909
这就是我的生活 对吧? 这就是我未来的人生
This is it,isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like.

283
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:09,127
我妈在那里 我爸在那里 感恩节 圣诞节
My mom there, my dad there.Thanksgiving, Christmas.

284
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:13,711
她拿到房子 他住公寓 我妹妹会用藤制品装饰它
She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker.

285
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,675
钱德 你是怎么撑过来的?
Chandler, how did you get through this?

286
00:18:17,675 --> 00:18:24,263
我做了精心设计的心理治疗 治疗我的否认心态
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program...of denial...

287
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,681
跟尿床问题
and wetting the bed.

288
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,895
我只是...感觉真的好怪
You know, I just...It's so weird.

289
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:36,733
我在那里听他们责备彼此
I mean, I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other.

290
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,740
脑袋里只想到独立纪念日
All I kept thinking about was the Fourth of July.

291
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:46,238
因为那让你想起我们的开国元老如何责备彼此?
Because it reminded you of the way...our forefathers used to bitch at each other?

292
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,142
他们吵架的原因就是
It's just this thing.

293
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:52,419
每年我们会坐我爸的船出海看烟火
Every year we would go out on my dads boat and watch the fireworks.

294
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,049
妈非常讨厌那么做 因为海风会将她的头发吹乱
Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big.

295
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,507
我妹妹吉儿会趴在船边吐
My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side...

296
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,362
爸很生气因为没有人帮他
and my dad would be upset because nobody was helping.

297
00:19:03,362 --> 00:19:06,768
我们真的去帮他时 他会骂我们做错了
And then when we did help, he would scream at us for doing it wrong.

298
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:14,480
但开始施放烟火后大家会闭嘴
But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up.

299
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,020
因为真的很冷
You know, and it'd get really cold.

300
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:20,907
我们会一起窝在毯子里
And we'd all just sort of smoosh under this one blanket.

301
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,737
没有人想过要多带一条毯子
It never occurred to anybody to bring another one.

302
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,622
现在...
And now it's...

303
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,543
我知道
Yeah I know.

304
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,859
谢谢你们的光临 希望你们玩得开心
Thanks for coming. I hope you had fun.

305
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:03,278
好吧 我得回去了 我把我的十个动词放在桌上了
All right, Monica, dear I'm gonna hit the road. Now, I've left my 10 verbs on the table.

306
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,951
一定要把完成的诗寄给我
Yes, and you be sure and send me that finished poem.

307
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,987
我会的 很高兴你来了      好吧 亲爱的
Okay, will do. So glad you came.        All right, dear.

308
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,113
我看到瑞秋在走廊上      我去看看
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.        Okay, let me go check.

309
00:20:11,113 --> 00:20:12,374
好的
Oh, all right.

310
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,961
你妈要跟你道别      噢 好
Your mom wants to say goodbye.        Oh, okay.

311
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,248
生日快乐 甜心
Happy birthday, sweetie.

312
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,087
好
Okay.

313
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,919
乔伊 好好开车
Joey Uh, you drive safe.

314
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,634
好      罗斯 你在做什么?
Okay.        What are you doing?

315
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:30,475
我准备要去滑水
I'm getting ready for the water skiing.

316
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:34,309
好吧 再抱一次 快点
Okay, big hug. One more. Come on.

317
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,266
你好吗?
How are you?

318
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,800
你要去哪里?      拿我的外套
Dr. Green. Where are you going?        To get my coat.

319
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,360
别 别 别 我们去帮你拿
No, no, no. We'll get that for you.

320
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:46,776
好吧 我可以自己去拿外套
All right, all right. I can get my own coat.

321
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,744
抱歉 我们吃果馅饼兴奋过头了
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.

322
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,174
不 你不该在这里
Oh, no. No, you're not supposed to be here.

323
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:06,612
这里是准备区 这是不对的 你应该离开
This is the staging area. It's all wrong. You should leave.

324
00:21:06,612 --> 00:21:09,144
你得离开这里
Ha, ha. You know, just get out.

325
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,983
或许你想来杯薄荷甜酒
Or perhaps you'd like acremede menthe.

326
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,112
我得回我的别墅去 谢谢
I have to be heading toward my chateau. Thank you.

327
00:21:24,112 --> 00:21:26,945
我想我们要回走廊了
All right, well then I guess we're going back into the hallway again.

328
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,327
谢谢你赶过来 葛林太太

329
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,545

00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,420
保重
You take care.

331
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,720
你们这些孩子
Oh, you kids.

332
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,099
好了
Well

333
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:57,253
这是多年来我参加过最棒的派对
This is the best party I've been to in years.

334
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,807
谢谢
Thank you.

335
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,315
大伙们 果馅饼时间到了
Okay, everybody, it's time for flan.

336
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:11,452
准备大尝好吃的果冻
Yep. Get ready for the gelatinous fun.

337
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,781
看起来很像严重感染时涂的药膏
Kind of looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.

338
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,200
够了
Okay, thats enough.

339

Heads up.

342
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:34,054
那些愿望几乎都无法成真
Wow. Those things almost never come true.

343
00:22:35,006 --> 00:22:55,206
