1
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,328
老兄 这好奇怪
Man, this is weird.

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,206
你有没有发现脆脆船长的眉毛 长在他的帽子上
Ever realize Cap'n Crunch's eyebrows are on his hat?

3
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,540
这叫奇怪?
That's what's weird?

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,711
乔伊 那家伙当了40年的早餐片船长
Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,756
咦!
Waaa-aaah!

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,098
干嘛
What?

7
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,885
汤匙 你舔完就放回去了
The spoon! You licked and, and you put.

8
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,269
舔完你就放回去了
You licked and you put.

9
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,362
对 怎么了
Yeah, so?

10
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,000
你不觉得这很恶心吗
Well, don't you see how gross that is?

11
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,529
就像是你用我的牙刷一样
I mean that's like you using my toothbrush.

12
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,739
你还用我的牙刷?
You used my toothbrush?

13
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:40,241
那是因为人家用红的那支去通排水孔了嘛
Well, that was only because I used the red one to unclog the drain.

14
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,987
红的那支是老子的
Mine is the red one!

15
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:48,583
我的老天爷 一发不可收拾啊
Oh, God! Can open, worms everywhere!

16
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,920
嘿 为什么牙刷不能共用
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush

17
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,566
肥皂就可以?
but we can use the same soap?

18
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:58,134
因为肥皂是肥皂 会自我清洁
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.

19
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:00,716
行 那下次你冲凉的时候
Alright, well next time you take a shower

20
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:04,846
想想我最后洗哪儿 你又最先洗哪儿
think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.

21

什么情况
What's the occasion?

28
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:03,867
知道在我那部剧里演昏迷不醒的那个人吗
Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma?

29
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,040
他做东
He's having a brunch.

30
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,751
好了 就等你了
Okay, I'm ready when you are.

31
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:10,556
搞定
Okey-doke.

32
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,500
真不敢相信你们真要去刺青
I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.

33
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,363
等会儿 你们要去刺青?
Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?

34
00:02:16,363 --> 00:02:19,386
对 但你不能告诉罗斯 因为我想给他个惊喜
Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.

35
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,427
喔噢 好奔放 你们准备刺什么
Wow, this is wild! What are you gonna get?

36
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,970
我要刺一朵百合
Um, I'm getting a lily.

37
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,512
纪念我妈 因为她叫莉莉
For my mom, 'cause her name's Lily.

38
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,000
算你命好 要是她叫大污点看你怎么办
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?

39
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:35,746
那你们要刺在哪里
So where you getting it?

40
00:02:35,932 --> 00:02:36,732
肩膀上吧
I think on my shoulder.

41
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:37,896
什么
What?

42
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,198
你肩上有什么
What's on your shoulder?

43
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:41,691
呃 重担
Um, a chip.

44
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,781
是刺青 我要去刺青啦
A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo

45
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,783
刺青? 为什么要去刺青
A tattoo? Why, why would you wanna do that?

46
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,164
嗨      嗨
Hi.        Hi.

47
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,541
你不觉得很酷吗
Well hey, you don't, you don't think they're kind of cool?

48
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,664
不 抱歉 我不觉得
No, sorry I don't.

49
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,172
怎么会有人花钱去搞个一辈子的伤痕
Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life?

50
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,511
菲比 要是刺得不好怎么办
What if it doesn't come out right Phoebes?

51
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:04,806
那成什么了 我是说 就像你永远顶着个烂发型
Then it's like, I don't know, having a bad haircut all the time.

52
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,768
你们干嘛都盯着我
Why is everyone staring at me?

53
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,731
罗斯 过来在老爸的生日卡上签名
Ross, come sign this birthday card for Dad.

54
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:12,488
理查随时会到
Rich is gonna be here any minute.

55
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:14,441
哎哟 理查也要去派对啊
Oooh, Richard's going to the party too, huh?

56
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:16,359
他是我爸妈最要好的朋友 必须去
Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.

57
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,855
那今天打算告诉你爸妈你们俩的事吗
So, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?

58
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:24,201
是啊 为了我爸生日 我决定让他中风
Yeah, for my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.

59
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,050
不 我觉得你应该告诉他们
No, I think you should tell them.

60
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,925
不 我还不知道他爱我有多深
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me.

61
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:30,991
在搞清楚前 我什么也不说
Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.

62
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,585
很难说 我想他们不会介意的
I don't know, I don't think Mom and Dad would mind.

63
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,789
记得你9岁 理查30岁时 老爸常说...
Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say...

64
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,839
"天啊 真希望他们在一起"
"God, I hope they get together."

65
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,255
准备好了?
Alright, shall we?

66
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,924
等等
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

67
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,801
那什么
You know what?

68
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:52,141
罗斯 我们换下 你站中间
Ross, let's, let's switch places. You get in the middle.

69
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,488
不行不行 这一看就像是我们在隐瞒什么
No um, you know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.

70
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:56,300
妹子
Monica, Monica

71
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,645
就算你骑着他进去他们也不会相信的
You could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it.

72
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,402
我们来了
We're here!

73
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:05,144
嗨 孩子们      是孩子们
Oh hi, kids!        Uh, the children!

74
00:04:05,194 --> 00:04:06,360
噢 宝贝儿
Hi,darling!

75
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,400
老爸 生日快乐      噢 谢谢
Happy birthday, Dad.        Oh thank you.

76
00:04:09,446 --> 00:04:09,946
嗨 老妈
Hi ma.

77
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:10,910
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

78
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,625
柏克医生载你们来 你们谢过他了吗
So, you kids thanked Dr.Burke for the ride?

79
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,792
妈 我想摩妮卡替我们两个谢过了
Uh, actually Mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.

80
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,542
你们坐火车来的吗
So, you kids take the train in?

81
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,253
不 理查柏克载他们来的
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.

82
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,758
说到他啊...
Um, speaking of whom...

83
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,884
我听说他在城里泡了个二十来岁的幼齿
I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.

84
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,128
手抖了 天啊 抱歉
Finger cramp! Oh, God, sorry.

85
00:04:37,128 --> 00:04:38,358
妈 放着我来
Here, let me get that, Mom.

86
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,446
原来理查好这口啊
Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section?

87
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,782
还要讲那个吗
Are we still on that?

88
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:49,494
想想也知道她的智商肯定跟餐巾纸一样高
You just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.

89
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,621
说不定都不算漂亮
She's probably not even pretty.

90
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,542
只是够年轻 所以一切都还没下垂
Just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.

91
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,089
这地方超赞吧
Can you believe this place?

92
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,049
对啊 这公寓超赞
I know, this is a great apartment.

93
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,174
我刚去过浴室 两边墙上都有镜子
Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you.

94
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,768
尿尿的时候就像是有一排人一起尿
So when you're in there, it's like you're peeing with the Rockettes.

95
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,600
我的幻想成真了
Well, there's my fantasy come true.

96
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,264
真的
No, seriously.

97
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,482
嘿
Hey.

98
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,845
嘿 老兄 我们正在说你的公寓超棒的
Hey, we were just saying, great apartment man.

99
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:24,117
谢了 你要吗
Thanks. You want it?

100
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:24,817
什么
Uh?

101
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,531
我要搬去更大的公寓
Yeah, I'm moving to a bigger place.

102
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,491
你真的应该入手
You should definitely take this one.

103
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,440
你觉得我会住这么好吗
Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?

104
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,581
有何不可 你讨厌公园景观和挑高天花板吗
Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings?

105
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,826
来 我带你看看厨房
Come on, I'll show you the kitchen.

106
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,038
不用了伙计们 我今早在电视上...
Oh that'sall right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning...

107
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,376
看过厨房了
on TV.

108
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,963
还是闭嘴好了
Stop talking. Okay!

109
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,716
拜托 快说嘛      就是呀 她真的只有20?
Come on, tell us!        Yeah, is she really 20?

110
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,797
我什么也不会说的
I am not telling you guys anything.

111
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,487
说嘛 理查 今天是我生日诶 让我过一下干瘾嘛
Come on Rich, it's my birthday. Let me live vicariously!

112
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,720
爸 你真的不会想那样做的
Dad, you really don't want to do that.

113
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,602
跟基友分享下你的中年危机嘛
Ahh, what's a little midlife crisis between friends?

114
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,316
杰克 放我一马吧
Jack, would you let it go?

115
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,983
我了解你在做什么 50岁的时候我买了辆保时捷
Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50, I got the Porsche.

116
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,484
你呢 也有了自己的小 "加速器"
You, you got your own little speedster.

117
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:10,352
各位 说真的 不是你们听到那样的
Guys, seriously, it is not like that.

118
00:06:10,552 --> 00:06:11,152
这样
Tell you what.

119
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:15,352
找个周末 我车子借你 你的小...
Maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I could...

120
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:17,991
爸 求你别说
Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence!

121
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,039
干嘛啦 我开玩笑的嘛
What? I'm kidding!

122
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,125
我才不会让他碰我的保时捷呢
You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.

123
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,089
瑞秋
Okay, Rach.

124
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:36,050
选哪朵百合 这朵还是那朵
Which lily? This lily or that lily?

125
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,390
我觉得...      我喜欢这朵
Well I...        I like this lily.

126
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,060
绽放得更灿烂 就像我妈
It's more open, you know, and that's like my Mom.

127
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,775
她有比较豁达 奉献的精神
She had a more open, giving spirit.

128
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,270
莱亨鸡!
Oh, Foghorn Leghorn!

129
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,240
金发妞儿 你到二号房
Alright, blond girl, you're in room two.

130
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,943
没那么金的妞儿 你跟我来
Not-so-blond girl, you're with me.

131
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,863
走吧
Here we go!

132
00:06:54,963 --> 00:06:55,744
嗯哼
Uh-huh.

133
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,747
怎么不走
You're not going?

134
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,994
嗯
Uh-huh.

135
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,597
怎么了 是因为罗斯的话吗
What? Is it, is this because of what Ross said?

136
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,207
不是
No.

137
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,309
好吧 或许是的
Well, yeah, maybe.

138
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:06,586
真不敢相信
I don't believe this.

139
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,677
你们之间的关系难道就是罗斯占据着主导地位?
Is this how this relationship's gonna works? Ross equals boss?

140
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,055
拜托 又不是1922年了
I mean, come on, what is this, 1922?

141
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,011
1922年怎么了
What's 1922?

142
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,050
只是很久以前嘛
Just, you know, a long time ago.

143
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,815
那个年代的女人基本都得听男人的
When men used to tell women what to do a lot.

144
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,690
然后有了投票权 这是好事 不过听起来很可怕
And then there was suffrage, which was a good thing but it sounds horrible.

145
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,050
你到底要不要刺
Do you want this tattoo?

146
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,777
要啊 只是罗斯...
Yes I do, it's just that Ross is...

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,222
停停停 什么都要男朋友替你做主吗
OK, hey, hey. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?

148
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:40,869
不是
No.

149
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,112
那好 谁替你做主
Okay, who is the boss of you?

150
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,290
你?
You?

151
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,878
不 你该自己做主
No. You are the boss of you!

152
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,362
你现在就屁颠儿屁颠儿地进去
Now you march your heinie in there

153
00:07:50,362 --> 00:07:52,519
把那颗心刺到屁股上
and get that heart tattooed on your hip!

154
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,046
去!
Go!

155
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,394
没事儿吧
How you doing?

156
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,221
我成幼齿了!
I'm a twinkie!

157
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,558
是吗 我可是个英雄
Really? I'm a hero.

158
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,983
这太纠结了
This is so hard.

159
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,278
我又何尝不是呢
Yeah, I know. I hate it too.

160
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,239
要不 我们公开吧
Look, maybe we should just tell them.

161
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,113
要不先跟你爸妈说吧
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.

162
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,415
我父母早就不在了
My parents are dead.

163
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,747
天啊 你命太好了
God, you are so lucky!

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,498
我是说... 你懂我的意思      我懂
I mean, well, you know what I mean.        I know, I know.

165
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,421
撑住 好吗
Just hang in there, okay?

166
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,000
我先出去 好吗
Okay, I'll go out first, all right?

167
00:08:35,254 --> 00:08:36,254
好
Alright, alright.

168
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,800
茱蒂! 上厕所啊! 好肠胃啊!
Judy! Going to the bathroom! Good for you!

169
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:51,403
谢谢你给我动力 理查
Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.

170
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,615
亲爱的
Honey.

171
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,613
看到我那哈蒙基勒博签名的球棒了吗
Honey, have you seen my Harmon Killebrew bat?

172
00:08:59,613 --> 00:09:00,878
鲍勃不相信我有
Bob doesn't believe I have one.

173
00:09:00,878 --> 00:09:02,332
没看到
I have no idea.

174
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,925
你知道理查在城里泡了个幼齿吗
Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?

175
00:09:06,316 --> 00:09:08,144
我知道 他像是来第二春了
I know, he's like a new man.

176
00:09:08,144 --> 00:09:10,380
就像是 "魔茧" 里的情景
It's like a scene from Cocoon.

177
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,509
我怎么也想不到 理查会跟一个小笨妹在一起
I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.

178
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,999
显然他告诉强尼夏皮洛说 那个女孩不错
Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl.

179
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:21,433
他还告诉强尼 他觉得自己爱上她了
In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her

180
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,135
是不是啊      跟你说 我没见他这么快乐过
Really?        I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.

181
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,807
那么 杰克...
So, Jack...

182
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,550
你有没有想过 找个年轻小妞儿来替代我
you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?

183
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,268
当然没有
Of course not.

184
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,025
有了你就等于有了两个二五佳人啊
With you, it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.

185
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,235
杰克 不要嘛
Oh, Jack, stop!

186
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,286
来嘛
Come on!

187
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,411
今天哥生日啊
It's my birthday!

188
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,832
能不说了吗
Can we drop this?

189
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,298
我对那家伙的公寓没兴趣
I am not interested in the guy's apartment.

190
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,711
拜托 我看到你欣赏他装饰的样子了
Oh, please, I saw the way you were checking out his moldings.

191
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:58,924
你想要
You want it.

192
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,753
我干嘛要另外一间公寓 啊?
Why would I want another apartment, huh?

193
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:03,679
我已经有我爱的公寓了
I've already got an apartment that I love.

194
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,136
是嘛 你偶尔这样 说说又不会死
It wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.

195
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:14,300
好 你想听实话? 我的确在考虑
All right, you want the truth? I'm thinking about it.

196
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,487
什么      抱歉
What?        I'm sorry.

197
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,608
我都28了 还没一个人生活过
I'm 28, I've never lived alone

198
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,112
而现在我终于赚到足够的钱
and I'm finally at a place where I got enough money

199
00:10:22,112 --> 00:10:24,733
可以让我不再需要室友了
that I don't need a roommate anymore.

200
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,995
切 哥也不需要室友啊
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't need a roommate either, okay?

201
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,748
哥一个人住这儿也负担得起
I can afford to live here by myself.

202
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,623
搞得好像哥每个礼拜都要请人来舔一遍餐具一样
You know I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.

203
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,967
你干嘛那么火大
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh?

204
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,465
我们又没说要永远住一起
It's not like we agreed to live together forever.

205
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,338
我们又不是动画片里的毕特和恩尼
We're not Bert and Ernie.

206
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,557
听着
Look, you know what.

207
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,556
如果你觉得是这样
If this is the way you feel

208
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,645
那也许你该搬过去
then maybe you should take it.

209
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,732
我是这么觉得      那也许你该搬过去!
Well that's how I feel.        Then maybe you should take it!

210
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:53,979
那好啊!
Well then maybe I will!

211
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,485
好啊!      好!
Fine with me!        Great!

212
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,397
这样你就能跟你真正的朋友好好过了
Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends

213
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,277
破汤匙!
the spoons!

214
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,409
谁还要饮料
Whose drink can I freshen?

215
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,946
该切蛋糕了
Almost time for cake!

216
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,382
妹子
Mon?

217
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,300
妹子 没事儿吧
Mon, are you okay?

218
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,612
还记得我发现的那盘爸妈主演的录像带吗
You remember that video I found of mom and dad?

219
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,113
记得 怎么了
Yeah?

220
00:11:24,113 --> 00:11:26,000
我刚看了遍真人秀
Well, I just caught the live show.

221
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,397
嗨 怎么样      怎么了
Hey there.        What?

222
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:45,034
没什么 我刚听到你的好话
Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.

223
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:47,111
真的?
Humm, really?

224
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,031
理查 理查
Richard, Rich.

225
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:54,222
你儿子现在没女朋友吧      就我所知 没有
Your son isn't seeing anyone, is he?        Uh, not that I know of.

226
00:11:54,222 --> 00:11:58,175
我在想 要不让他跟莫妮卡联系联系
Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?

227
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,923
这... 是个主意
That... that's an idea.

228
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,737
其实 我已经有男朋友了
Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.

229
00:12:06,737 --> 00:12:07,716
喔?      喔?
Oh?        Oh?

230
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,596
啊呕...
Oh...

231
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,604
这孩子什么事都不说
She never tells us anything.

232
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,800
罗斯 你知道摩妮卡有男朋友了吗
Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?

233
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,815
妈 我身边有好多人
Mom, there are so many people in my life.

234
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,550
有些人在恋爱 也有些还是单身
Some are seeing people and some of them aren't.

235
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,032
那是水晶的吗
Is that crystal?

236
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,578
那个神秘男子是谁
So, who's the mystery man?

237
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,816
呃 他是个医生
Well, uh, he's a doctor.

238
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,675
不是博士?
A real doctor?

239
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:36,706
是 他是研究肉的
No, a doctor of meat.

240
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,414
他当然是个医生
Of course he's a real doctor.

241
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,291
他很英俊
And he's handsome.

242
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,613
人很好 我知道你会喜欢他的
And he's sweet, and I know you'd like him.

243
00:12:45,613 --> 00:12:47,179
那不错...
Well that's wonderful, that...

244
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
我
I...

245
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,267
妈 没事的
Mom, it's okay.

246
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,472
没错 茱蒂
It is, Judy.

247
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,190
杰克!
Jack!

248
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,775
你能过来下吗
Could you come in here for a moment?

249
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,272
现在!
Now!

250
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,775
找到了      爸 交给我
Found it!        I'll take that, Dad.

251
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:16,613
你女儿跟理查看来是一对
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.

252
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:19,871
不可能 他不是在城里有个幼齿嘛
That's impossible. He's got a twinkie in the city.

253
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,613
爸 我就是那个幼齿
Dad, I'm the twinkie.

254
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,394
你就是那个幼齿?      她不是幼齿!
You're the twinkie?        She's not a twinkle!

255
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,999
好吧 听着 这是我至今谈过最棒的恋爱...
Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in...

256
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:31,348
拜托 这叫谈恋爱?
Oh please! A relationship?

257
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,012
对 就是谈恋爱!
Yes, a relationship!

258
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,470
你们听好了 我为这个男人痴狂
For your information, I am crazy about this man.

259
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,805
真的?
Really?

260
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,522
真的
Yes.

261
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,185
老子过生日居然要站在这儿听你们放屁?
Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?

262
00:13:43,131 --> 00:13:45,531
爸 这对我是件好事
Dad, dad this is a good thing for me, you know

263
00:13:45,581 --> 00:13:47,827
而且你自己也说 你没见过理查这么快乐过
and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.

264
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,862
我什么时候说的
When did I say that?

265
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,621
楼上浴室里 就在你对老妈毛手毛脚前!
Upstairs in the bathroom, right before you felt up Mom!

266
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,990
祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to you

267
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,748
祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to you

268
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:04,340
祝杰克生日快乐
Happy birthday, dear Jack

269
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:09,341
祝你生日快乐

278
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,704
不知道去哪里了
I don't know how, where it went.

279
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,455
你没刺?      没
You didn't get it?        No.

280
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,175
你干嘛不刺
Why didn't you get it?

281
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,757
抱歉 真的很抱歉
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

282
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,548
菲比 你怎么可以这么对我 这全是你的主意
Phoebe, how could you do this to me? This was your idea!

283
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:53,348
我知道 我本来要刺的 可是他进来时拿着针
I know, I know, and I was gonna get it, but he came in with this needle

284
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,221
你知道他们是用针刺的吗
and uh, di-did you know they do this with needles?

285
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,488
真的? 我可从来没听过啊
Really? You don't say.

286
00:14:59,488 --> 00:15:02,269
因为我的是喵星人舔上去的!
Because mine was licked on by kittens!

287
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,443
嘿      嘿

那我们是抱一下还是...
So do we need to hug here or...

292
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:18,531
不用了吧      对
No, we're all right.        Yeah.

293
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,667
我有东西给你

294
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,290

Great!        Lick away, my man.

296
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:33,972
这在我的新家会很管用 先应付应付
These will go great in my new place, you know, till I get real ones.

297
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,802
什么
What?

298
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,677
我不能老是用这东西
I can't use these forever.

299
00:15:37,877 --> 00:15:40,641
我是说 这不环保
I mean, let's face it, they're no friend of the environment.

300
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,182
不不不 我是说 你说什么新家?
No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?

301
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,358
我要搬出去 我们谈论过的
I'm moving out, like we talked about.

302
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,565
我不知道你是认真的
Well I didn't think that was serious.

303
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,358
我以为我们只是在吵架
You know, I thought that was just a fight.

304
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,280
对啊 我们确实吵架了
Well, it was a fight...

305
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,191
有根有据的 记得吗
based on serious stuff, remember?

306
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,156
有关我从来没一个人生活过
About how I never lived alone or anything?

307
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,376
我想这样对我有好处 能帮助我成长...
I think it would be good for me, you know, help me to grow or...

308
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,960
之类的
whatever.

309
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,883
那好吧
Well, there you go.

310
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,879
嘿 这事你能接受吗
Hey, are you cool with this?

311

我不想让你觉得进退维谷
I mean, I don't wanna leave you high and dry.

312
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,841
嘿 我本来也没有好到哪儿去
Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter.

314
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,272
改成游戏室之类的
bedroom into a game room or something, you know.

315
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,771
把桌上足球放到里面
Put the foosball table in there.

316
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,730
等等 那桌子为什么归你
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?

317
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,526
我付了一半的钱
I did pay for half of it.

318
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,300
对 但另外一半是我付的
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.

319
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,237
行 那我们来一局 谁赢归谁
Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.

320

好 说定了
All right, you're on.

321
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,543
哥抽个两分钟出来虐虐你也无妨
I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.

322
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,252
哥射进的球 会比你妹被射的次数还多
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.

323
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,012
嘿! 嘿! 嘿! 嘿!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

324
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,393
哪个妹妹
Which sister?

325
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,145
你后悔我告诉他们吗
So are you sorry that I told them?

326
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:13,446
不会 反正我跟你爸好久没去跑步了
No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running.

327
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,500

Is Ross here?        No he went out for pizza.

330

好 抓紧时间
Okay, really quick, okay.

331

好 那这是什么
Okay, well then, what is this?

336
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,470
我们在看什么
What are we looking at?

337
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,181
那颗蓝色的雀斑?
That blue freckle?

338
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,097
拜托 这是我的刺青
Okay, that's my tattoo.

339
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,888
那不是刺青 那什么也不是
That is not a tattoo. That is a nothing.

340
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,738
我好不容易把她弄回去刺
I finally got her in the chair,

341
00:17:48,738 --> 00:17:50,675
结果人家的针还没碰到她
he barely touched her with the needle

342
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:52,853
她就尖叫着跳起来 逃了回来
she jumped up screamed and that was it.

343
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,729
好了
Okay, hi!

你们听好了 这正是我想要的刺青
For your information, this is exactly what I wanted.

345
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:05,315
这是个从很远的地方看到的地球
This is a tattoo of the Earth as seen from a great, great distance.

346
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,751
我妈从天堂看我就是这样的
It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.

347
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,612
简直胡说八道
Oh, what a load of crap!

348
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,522
那就是一个点
That is a dot!

349
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,237
你妈正在天堂大叫说 
Your mother's in heaven going,

350
00:18:18,237 --> 00:18:21,215
"老娘的百合呢 你个胆小鬼!"
"Where the hell's my lily, you wuss!"

351
00:18:22,815 --> 00:18:27,050
菲比 那不叫刺青! 这才叫刺青!
Okay, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo! This is a tattoo!

352
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,604
你去刺青了?
You got a tattoo?

353
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:34,984

只是很小一个 菲比把全世界都刺上了
But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world!

355

359
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,210
我没想过可以这样 但是...
I wouldn't have thought it would be, but...

360
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,173
哇

真的 那么
Yeah, so uh

363
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,738
会酸痛吗 还可以做运动吗

364
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,221
可以吧
I guess.

365
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,144
嘿 给我们留点披萨
Hey, save us some pizza.

不在这里的时候我们才会去
Except when we are here.

376
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,322
我知道你只是搬到上城区 但我还是会很想念你的
I know you're just moving uptown, but I'm really gonna miss you.

377
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,441

我们以前用它把水球弹到屋顶上
We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof.

384
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,442
记得吗
Remember that?

385
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,100
那些初中生连马路对过都弹不到
Those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
