Eight hundred and twelve bucks.

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,548
我不知道老鸨怎么跟你说的 
I don't know what Big Leon told you. 

6
00:00:18,549 --> 00:00:21,973
跟我过夜 要一千大洋才够
But it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night.

7
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,813
这是在干嘛啊      我现在开始赚钱了 
What is this for?         Well, I'm making money now.

8
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:28,072
这是还你拍大头照的钱 电费
And this is paying you back for headshots, electric bills,

9
00:00:28,073 --> 00:00:30,655
以及无数披萨的钱等等 
and so many slices of pizza I can't even count.

10
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,777
我爱你 老兄      那谢啦 老兄

这下子我有钱买个小马了
Now I can get my pony.

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,909
我还有个小礼物要送给你 感谢你永远支持我
Hey. This is a little extra something for, you know, always being there for me.

13
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,082
哇 我不晓得该说什么才好
Wow, I don't know what to say.

14
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:53,004
哇 我不晓得该说什么才好
Wow, I don't know what to say.

15
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,215
你觉得怎样      我不知道
What do you say?         I don't know.

16
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,089
这是一条手链
It's a bracelet.

17
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,392
可不是吗 还刻了字 快看看
Isn't it? It's engraved too. Check it out.

18
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,269
送给我的好哥们儿
"To my best bud"

19
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,477
谢了 好哥们儿
Thanks, best bud.

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,487
戴上吧     现在吗
Put it on.         Oh. Now?

21
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,675
不 这么美的东西 应该留到特殊的场合再戴 
No, no. I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion.

22
00:01:19,675 --> 00:01:22,988
不 美就美在这儿 它配什么都好看 
Oh, no no, that's the beauty part. It goes with everything.

23
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,112
戴上这个 你就可以风风光光地出门
You put this on, you're good to go.

24
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,255
哦 哇
Oh, man!

25
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,543
这手链真是太配你了
You are so wearing that bracelet!

26
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,049
可不是嘛
I so am!

27
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:41,674
知道这种东东 会为你的性生活带来什么好处吗
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?

28
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,638
刚开始时可能会让我慢半拍
It'll probably slow it down at first.

29
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:47,187
等我习惯这种重量之后 我就会重振雄风了
But once I'm used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.

Well, this all looks good.         Great.

35
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:41,859
如果我想找人问问你过去的工作表现呢
And if I wanna call for a reference on your last job.

36
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,800
就在这下面 看 经理是钱德宾
Oh, that's there on the bottom. See, the manager, Chandler Bing?

37
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:46,386
好的 
All right. 

38
00:02:46,387 --> 00:02:49,575
我们就来看看 你本人有没有那么好 
Let's see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. 

39
00:02:49,576 --> 00:02:50,801
给我做个沙拉
Make me a salad.

40
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:54,705
沙拉吗 我可以做难度更高的东西
A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.

41
00:02:54,706 --> 00:02:56,987
不 沙拉就可以了
No, just the salad will be fine.

42
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,085
没问题
You got it.

43
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,260
好 我要你一边做一边告诉我你在做什么
Now I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it.

44
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:09,015
好的 我在撕莴苣
All right. Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.

45
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:10,437
莴苣很脏吗      
Uhhuh. Is it dirty? 

46
00:03:10,438 --> 00:03:11,729
不 放心好了 我会清洗的
Oh, no, no, don't worry. I'm gonna wash it.

47
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,816
不要 我喜欢脏脏的
Don't. I like it dirty.

48
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,486
悉听尊便了
That's your call.

49
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,736
你接下来要做什么呢
So, uh, what are you going to do next?

50
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,447
我想 我接下来要切蕃茄了 
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.

51
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,991
蕃茄坚硬吗
Are they firm?

52
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,156
还可以
They're alright.

53
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,288
你确定没有变坏吗
You sure they haven't gone bad?

54
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,208
你确定没有非常非常坏吗
You sure they're not very very bad?

55
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,588
没坏 都还可以啦
No, really, they're okay.

56
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,965
你会很温柔的切开吗
You gonna slice them up real nice?

57
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,988
其实 我想切成细丝
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.

58
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,263
我不干了
I'm out of here!

59
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,152
喂
Hello?

60
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,443
瑞秋现在不在 要我留口信吗
No, Rachel's not here right now, can I take a message?

61
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,862
是哪个凯西
All right. And how do we spell Casey?

62
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:07,800
是"凯西出击" 还是 "凯希阳光合唱团"
Is it like "at the bat" or "and The Sunshine Band'?

63
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,700
好 再见
Okay, byebye.

64
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,919
嘿 这个凯西是谁啊
Hey, who's this Casey?

65
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,800
她看电影认识的人 
Some guy she met at the movies.

66
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,500
真的 他找她干嘛
Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?

67
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,923
我猜 他想跟她跳点小舞
I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance.

68
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,670
嘿咻一下
You know, make a little love.

69
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,929
差不多今晚就把她解决掉
Well, pretty much get down tonight.

70
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,602
我不晓得 我不
I don't know. I don't...

71
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,236
我不懂 两个月前 我跟瑞秋只差这么一点点了
I don't get it! I mean, two wo months ago, Rachel and I werel like this close.

72
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:44,022
现在我却在帮一个她看电影时遇到的家伙留话
Right now, what? I'm taking messages from guys she, she meets at the movies?

73
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,777
应该这个凯西帮我留言 或是
I mean this, this Casey should be taking down my messages, you know? Or or...

74
00:04:47,998 --> 00:04:50,346
瑞秋应该和我在一起
Rachel and I should be together.

75
00:04:50,347 --> 00:04:54,867
然后我们就需要留言服务
And we should get some kind of message service.

76
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,289
耐心点吧 会有那么一天的
Hang in there. It's gonna happen.

77
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,962
这你怎么知道
Okay, now how do you know that?

78
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,957
因为她是你的龙虾
Because she's your lobster.

79
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,995
哦 她有些想法想要表达
Oh, she's going somewhere.

80
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:12,218
龙虾一旦相爱 就会白头偕老 这是常识
C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life.

81
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,155
你可以亲眼目睹 年老的龙虾夫妇在水缸里漫步
You know what? You can actually see old lobster couples walking around their tank, 

82
00:05:17,156 --> 00:05:20,526
钳子牵着钳子 就像这样
you know, holding claws, like...

83
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,197
觉得好一点了吗
Hey, you feeling better?

84
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:29,781
我想洗到第五次 就可以把面试的记忆冲掉了
Yeah. I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.

85
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,825
那你还有其他的可能吗
So do you have any other possibilities?

86
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,748
当然有 我有可能付不起房租
Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.

87
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,675
摩妮卡 你有需要的话 我可以借你钱
Monica, if you want, I can lend you money.

88
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:41,175
不要 万一我无法立刻还你钱
No no no. If I couldn't pay you back right away

89
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,790
那每次看到你 我就会内疚紧张
then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.

90
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:47,090
那好吧 那你为什么不直接找老爸老妈借
Oh, okay, well, then why don't you borrow it from Mom and Dad?

91
00:05:47,204 --> 00:05:50,222
反正在他们面前 你已经非常内疚紧张了
You feel guilty and tense around them already.

92
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,883
还不如趁机会跟他们刮点钱
You might as well make some money off of them.

93
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,268
说的有道理      喔
The man's got a point.         Ohh.

94
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,642
那闪闪发亮的是什么东东
What is that sparkly thing?

95
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,732
这玩意儿是
That thing it's a...

96
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,562
对 是有点俗气
Yeah, it's a little flashy.

97
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,730
不会 不会
No, no.

98
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:09,167
不会 不会
No, no. 

99
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:12,550
对道上的兄弟来说不算太俗
It's not flashy, not for a goodfella.

100
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,889
老兄 这玩意儿真显眼 
Man, man that is sharp. 

101
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,996
你一定花了不少银子吧
It must have cost you quite a few debloons.

102
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,223
嗨      嗨 
Hi.         Hi.

103
00:06:25,224 --> 00:06:26,833
亲爱的      这是什么
Hi, darling.        So what's this?

104
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,627
你的一些旧东西
Some of your old stuff.

105
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:32,093
亲爱的 我们要给你一个惊喜
Well, sweetie, we have a surprise for you. 

106
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,551
我们把你的房间 变成健身房了
We're turning your room into a gym.

107
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,390
哇 真是没想到
Wow, that is a surprise!

108
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,056
容我问一下 干嘛不用罗斯的房间
Just one little question. Why not Ross room?

109
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,732
我们讨论过了
Gosh, we talked about that.

110
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:47,567
可是他有太多科学类的奖杯 奖状 奖章之类的
but your brother had so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges.

111
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,732
我们不想去惊动它们 
Well, we didn't want to disturb them.

112
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,320
老天也不准 
God forbid!

113
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,068
哦    嗨
Ohh.         Hi.

114
00:06:56,084 --> 00:07:01,612
嗨 瑞秋 我们很遗憾听到 你的父母分手了
Hi, Rachel. Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear.

115
00:07:01,612 --> 00:07:03,551
他们只是分居而已 
Oh, well, you know, they're just separated. 

116
00:07:03,552 --> 00:07:05,334
谁知道呢 看看吧
So, you know, never know, we'll see.

117
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,300
老实说 我们一点也不惊讶
I can't say any of us were surprised.

118
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:13,012
从我们认识他们开始 他们就一直很不快乐
Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them.

119
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,883
特别是在夏威夷那件事之后 
Especially after that incident in Hawaii.

120
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,362
什么事情
What incident?

121
00:07:20,362 --> 00:07:23,189
不对 不对 我一定是记错人了
No, no, no, I must be thinking of someone else.

122
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,016
搞不好是我自己
Maybe me! 

123
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,002
你不是有衣服要叠吗
Don't you have some folding to do? 

124
00:07:27,003 --> 00:07:29,192
去叠吧 亲爱的 忙你的去吧
Go fold, dear. Fold. You fold.

125
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,869
要续杯吗      我不要了 谢谢
Do you want a refill?         No. I'm all right, thanks.

126
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,499
好吧 等我一下下 我要学得逼真一点
Okay. You gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. 

127
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:50,112
兄弟 十一点钟方向 无敌辣妹一直在看你
Dude, eleven o'clock, totally hot babe checking you out.

128
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,702
感觉很不错
That was really good. 

129
00:07:53,703 --> 00:07:56,591
我想我可以去变性了
I think I'm ready for my penis now.

130
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:08,102
我知道你在想什么 温蒂汉堡创办人 大卫汤玛斯 
I know what you're thinking. Dave Thomas, founder of Wendys.

131
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,362
我是盖儿      钱德
I'm Gail.         Chandler.

132
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:17,112
我真得走了 很高兴见到你
I... I really have to be somewhere, but it was nice meeting you.

133
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,029
什么
What?

134
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,036
这可真是妙不可言 他大可以送我一台录影机
Oh, this is excellent! You know he coulda gotten me a VCR.

135
00:08:28,037 --> 00:08:29,600
可以给我一套高尔夫球杆
He coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs.

136
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:32,175
可他却偏偏给我弄了个 吓走女人的东西
But no! He has to get me the "woman repeller"!

137
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,171
破烂堆里最恶心的玩意儿
The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!

138
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,925
也没差到那个程度啦      
It's not that bad.          

139
00:08:37,926 --> 00:08:38,925
是啊 你说得倒轻巧
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say.

140
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:42,237
你又不用戴着 连T先生都不要的东西到处走
You don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.

141
00:08:42,237 --> 00:08:43,613
钱德 钱德
Chandler. Chandler.

142
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:47,144
我同情那些戴着我的珠宝的傻瓜 我真的同情
"I pity the fool that puts on my jewelry! I do! I do!

143
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,863
我同情那些戴着 嗨
I pity that fool... Ay.

144
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,314
嘿 老兄 我们刚刚在玩模仿秀
Hey, man! We were just doing some impressions over here.

145
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,425
你来学 马塞尔马尔索(法国哑剧艺术家)
Do your Marcel Marceau.

146
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,696
其实演得不错
That's actually good.

147
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,955
你看看那家伙
Would you look at that guy? 

148
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,544
他们聊多久了
I mean how long has he been talking to her?

149
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:16,883
滚开 臭家伙 她是服务生又不是艺妓
It's like, back off, buddy! She's a waitress, not a geisha.

150
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,217
我觉得她很愉快
I think she's okay.

151
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,136
你看看 她都推开他了 他还死不走
Look at that! See how she's pushing him away and he won't budge?

152
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,228
我得采取行动才行
Alright, I'm gonna do something..

153
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:32,562
我们可以在山上租间木屋 滑进滑出的 很棒
We'll get a condo right on the mountain. Ski in, ski out,it's great.

154
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,571
打扰一下 你是瑞秋吗
Excuse me? Are you Rachel?

155
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,065
什么
What?

156
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,367
我是罗斯盖勒
Ross Geller.

157
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,914
老天 你在广告上说你很美 不过 哇
God, in your ad you said you were pretty, but wow

158
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,416
你在干嘛
What are you, what are you doing?

159
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,419
哦 我的天 今天不行吗
Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day?

160
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:51,727
真是难以置信
I don't believe it! 

161
00:09:51,728 --> 00:09:55,171
这件事如果成了的话 将来跟孙子们就有得吹了
well, hey, I guess if it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids!

162
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,668
你会有机会的      是吗
You sure will.        Yeah?

163
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,925
我得走了
I've gotta go.

164
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,680
保重     好
Take care.        Okay.

165
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,512
再见了 很高兴认识你
See you later. Nice meeting you.

166
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,928
不客气
You're welcome.

167
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,107
什么      我是在救你
What?         I was saving you.

168
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,986
好让我结束跟一个大帅哥愉快地交谈吗
Saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man?

169
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,064
从我刚才坐的位置看来     罗斯 听我说
From where I was...        Okay, Ross listen to me.

170
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,946
我不是要你救的人
I am not yours to save.

171
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,028
但是你是      什么
But you are.         What?

172
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,327
你是我的龙虾
Uh, well, you're my lobster.

173
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,488
你又在装玩相亲游戏吗
OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?

174
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,376
不 你是我的龙虾
No, no, you're my lobster.

175
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,132
龙虾呢
See Lobsters,

176
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:43,598
在水槽里 他们变老了以后
in the tank, when they're old

177
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,762
会那个 他们会牵着钳子散步
they get with the... They walk around holding the claws.

178
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,973
在水槽里
In the tank! You know, with...

179
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,984
牵着钳子而且
with the holding and

180
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,154
菲比 帮我解释一下龙虾的事 好不好
Pheebs, you wanna help me with the lobster thing?

181
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,155
再做一次握的动作
Do the claws again.

182
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,327
瑞秋 别管龙虾了 可以吗
Rach, okay, forget the lobsters, okay?

183
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,362
我们来谈谈 谈谈我们如何
Let's talk. What about us?

184
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,829
罗斯 没有所谓的"我们" 行吗
Ross, there is no "us", okay?

185
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,498
可是      不 你听我说
No, but...        No! Listen to me!

186
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,004
我爱上你 我深受打击
I fell for you and I get clobbered.

187
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:18,042
后来你爱上我 我还是深受打击
You then fall for me and I again get somehow clobbered.

188
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,924
我不想再受伤了 你知道吗
I'm tired of being clobbered, you know?

189
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,713
这根本不值得
It's just not worth it.

190
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,259
但是      没有"但是"了 罗斯
Well. but...        No "but" Ross.

191
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:31,221
我们是不可能的 好吗 接受吧
We are never gonna happen, okay? Accept that.

192
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,815
除非什么呢
Except...Except that what?

193
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,857
不 不
No. No.

194
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,820
接受这个事实吧
Accept that.

195
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,203
哦
Oh.

196
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:56,918
嘿 老兄 哇 是我的好哥儿 你好吗
Hey, man! Look, it's my best bud. How you doing?

197
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,634
你模仿马塞尔马尔索 越来越像了
Wow. You're getting good at that Marcel Marceau thing.

198
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:07,090
我们去打球如何 就你和我 怎么样
Hey, what do you say we play some ball? You and me, huh? What do you say?

199
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,559
是我不好
Okay, that's my bad.

200
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,311
如果你不喜欢那条手链 你大可直说
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.

201
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,300
尽管我不喜欢 我还是戴着  
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it 

202
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,650
这不就表示 我非常重视我们之间的友谊吗
say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?

203
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,816
可是你羞辱那条手链 你还取笑我
What about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?

204
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,990
所以说 我是个王八蛋
Well that's the part where I'm a wank.

205
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,076
我希望你不要只注意那件事
I was hoping you wouldn't focus on that.

206
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:35,254
别这样啦 我已经向你道过一百次歉了
Come on, man! I said I was sorry a hundred times.

207
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,792
我保证我再也不会拿下我的
I promise, I will never take it off my...

208
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,872
手腕
wrist.

209
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,112
如果你想待在里面发脾气
But if you want to stay in there and be mad

210
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:48,340
那就待吧
you know, you just, you stay in there.

211
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,221
你知道吗
You know what the...

212
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,886
我就在这里 跪着
I am here, on my knees,

213
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,765
拿着这两个椅垫
holding up these couch cushions

214
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:00,300
表达我的遗憾和悔恨
as a symbol of my sorrow and regret.

215
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:04,110
就像"圣经"里的故事一样
Much like they did in biblical times.

216
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,407
可能你还心怀怨恨
Though you may haveth anger now.

217
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,166
格拉芙的屁股长得真不错
You know that Steffi Graf has quite a tushy.

218
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,623
我只是说说 你自己看
I'm just saying! It's right there!

219
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,113
嘿 大家好      嗨 亲爱的
Hey, guys.        Hi, darling.

220
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,738
我的孙子呢 你没把他带来
Where's my grandson? You didn't bring him?

221
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:27,541
他今天在卡萝跟苏珊那里      
No. He's at Carol andSusan'stoday. 

222
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:30,175
我公司也有一个女人是同性恋
A woman in my office is a lesbian.

223
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,802
我只是说说
I'm just saying!

224
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:38,602
杰克 快看 你看了就会笑的那个油漆广告开始了
Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up.

225
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,105
你去哪里了      情感地狱
Where have you been?         Emotional hell.

226
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,862
他们借给你钱了吗      
So, did they lend you the money yet? 

227
00:13:47,862 --> 00:13:49,776
还没 那是因为我还没开口
No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.

228
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,319
拜托 摩妮卡 快点
Come on, Monica, do it.

229
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,032
嘿 你们
Hey, you guys.

230
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,369
摩妮卡有事要说
Monica has some news.

231
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:01,626
很抱歉我没有早点告诉你们 可是
So listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before, but

232
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:05,626
我已经没上班了 我不得不离开
I'm no longer at my job. I had to leave it.

233
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:09,095
为什么      被他们逼的
Why?         Because they made me.

234
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,988
你被炒鱿鱼了 
You were fired? 

235
00:14:12,988 --> 00:14:14,612
这下子你该怎么办呢
What are you gonna do?

236
00:14:14,612 --> 00:14:18,726
茱蒂 别紧张 她可是我们的小小"魔女卡"
Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about..

237
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,231
我们把她教得很精
We taught her well.

238
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,550
你一成的薪水都会      
Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?

239
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,362
存银行
In the bank.

240
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:27,550
这就对了 所以她在吃她的老本
There you go. So she dips into her savings.

241
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,024
存钱本来就是应急的 她不会有事的
That's what it's there for. Shes gonna be fine.

242
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:34,453
如果那些钱还不够用的话 你知道该去哪里要吧
And if you need a little extra, you know where to find it.

243
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,036
能变多一点吗
Anything larger back there?

244
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,955
真是难以置信
I can't believe it!

245
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,300
你能不再碎碎念了吗
Would you stop already?

246
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,956
就别再抱怨谷仓里的苦差事 跳到草堆里玩玩吧
Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.

247
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,713
没错 我是该跳到稻草堆里玩玩
Oh, youre right. I should play in the hay.

248
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,925
别忘了 我刚刚拿四百块
For about the fact that I just dropped four hundred dollars 

249
00:14:49,925 --> 00:14:52,221
换来一个我一开始就很讨厌的手链
to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with.

250
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,132
逗我开心啊 
Bring on the hay!

251
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:55,929
嘿
Hey!

252
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,813
我有一个能让你很开心的东西
I've got something that's gonna make you happy.

253
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,646
你猜阿甘找到什么东西了
Guess what Gunther found?

254
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,050
嘿 这下子你有两个了
Hey, now you have two!

255
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,189
哦 现在你有两个了哦
Oh, now you have two.

256
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,425
这下子我怎么办呢
What am I gonna do?

257
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,404
嘿
Hey.

258
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,365
嘿
Hey.

259
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,410
你怎么会有两个
How come you have two?

260

No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you.

264
00:15:33,737 --> 00:15:36,182
而且我也明白 它不只是个首饰
And I also know this is about more than just jewelry.

265
00:15:36,183 --> 00:15:40,113
这代表了你和我 代表我们是好哥们儿
It's about you and me and the fact that we're "best buds".

266
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:45,099
哇 这是友谊吗 我想是的
Wow. Is this friendship? I think so!

267
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,396
你看看 我们是手链兄弟
Check it out! We're bracelet buddies!

268
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,781
以后他们就会这样叫我们
That's what they'll call us!

269
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,994
好了 给你 你什么时候还我都可以
Okay, here you go. You can pay me back whenever you like.

270
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,077
你竟然有恐龙图案的支票
You have dinosaur checks?

271
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:04,137
对 你拿到钱的同时 还可以学些东西
Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something.

272
00:16:04,138 --> 00:16:05,419
有什么不好吗
What's wrong with that?

273
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,830
没有 没有
Nothing. Nothing.

274
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,707
嘿 你是只小器龙
Hey, you're a cheapasaurus!

275
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:15,213
开玩笑的啦 谢了 感激不尽
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Thank you. I'm very grateful.

276
00:16:15,214 --> 00:16:17,219
嘿 摩妮卡 这是什么
Hey, Mon, what is this?

277
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,175
噢
Oh!

278
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,645
我中学时的泳衣
That's my bathing suit from high school. 

279
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:24,063
我当年比较肿
I was a little bigger then.

280
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:28,936
我还以为 这是康涅狄格州的遮雨布
Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rains.

281
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,437
摩妮卡 这带子里录的是什么
Hey, what's on this videotape?

282
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,402
我不晓得 放进去看看
Hey, you got me, put it in.

照这边 杰克 好
Over here, Jack. Okay.

285
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,038
瑞秋就要进门了
I see, Rachel's coming up the path.

286
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:52,755
她是不是很美 杰克你能拍到吗
Doesn't she look pretty? Jack? Can you get this?

287
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,216
我的天
Oh my God!

288
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,385
你的鼻子怎么了
What is with your nose?

289
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:04,805
医生不得不给我做缩鼻术 因为我鼻中隔偏曲
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.

290
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,283
好吧 我错了 
Okay, I was wrong. 

291
00:17:06,284 --> 00:17:09,560
这才是康涅狄格州的遮雨布
That's what they use to cover Connecticut.

292
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:10,884
知道这是什么吗 
You know what this is?

293
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:12,987
这是我们准备要去毕业舞会的录像
This is us getting ready for the prom.

294
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,139
我们不要看这个      
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this        

295
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,736
要 要看
Oh yeah we do.

296
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,362

297
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,410
来拍摩妮卡
Get a shot of Monica.

298
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:22,872

Wait. How do you zoom out?

300
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,995
在这儿呢
There she is!

301
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,754
有个女孩把摩妮卡吞掉了
Some girl ate Monica!

302
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,430
闭嘴 人上镜会显得胖十磅
Shut up! The camera adds ten pounds.

303
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,262
那到底有多少镜头对着你
So how many cameras are actually on you?

304
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,395
哦 你看起来好棒
Oh, you look so great!

305

你也是 真漂亮
So do you! You look beautiful!

306
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,184
糟了     干嘛
Oops.       What?

307
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,738
我的蛋黄酱沾到你身上了
Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.

308
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:57,190
没关系 只是肩膀 没沾到衣服
Oh, that's okay, it's just the shoulder, it's not my dress.

309
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,277
大家笑一笑
Everybody smile!

310
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,622

Oh!        Dad, turn it off!

311
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,493

It's off.         

312
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:07,089
哪有 红灯还亮着
Dad, it is not! What's with the red light?

313
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,502
那就表示关了 对吧 罗斯
It's the off light. Right, Ross?

314
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,547
很帅嘛 
Looking good, Mr. Cotter.

我的扣子松了吗 这些东东一直往下掉
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down.

319
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,828
我看看 我不晓得
Let me see. I don't know. 

320

你打算如何
So, what are you gonna do...

321
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,669
男生们到了

322
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,041

323
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,301
玩你的音乐
Work on your music?

324
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,308
我的天 是洛伊贾柏立克
Oh my God! Look, there's Roy Gublik!

325
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,722
洛伊看"星球大战"看了317遍 
You know, Roy saw "Star Wars" 317 times.

326
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,185
还上过报纸
His name was in the paper.

327
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:17,028
奇普呢 他怎么还没到
Where's Chip? Why isn't he here yet?

328
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,985
他会来的 放心吧
He'll be here, okay? Take a chill pill.

329
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,575
好了
There.

330
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,538
我刚才是跟瑞秋说 洛伊碰了我的胸部
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.

331
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,613
没有男伴 我去不成毕业舞会了
I can't go to my own prom without a date. 

332
00:19:35,614 --> 00:19:37,419
去不了了 来不及了
I can't! It's too late!

333
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,593
你不去的话 我也不想去
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.

334
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,337
我要宰了奇普
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass!

335
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,175
我有个好主意
I have a wonderful idea.

336
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,137
你应该带瑞秋去参加毕业舞会
You should take Rachel to the prom.

337
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,183
我很怀疑
Doubtful.         

338
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,308
杰克 摄影机给我 你来跟你儿子说

All right, go on.         This thing's heavy.

340
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,907
你妈妈说的对 带她去 你可以穿我的礼服
Your mother's right. Take her. You can wear my tux.

341
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,658
她不会想跟我去的
Dad, she won't want to go with me.

342
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,741
她当然愿意 你是大学生了
Of course she would! You're a college man!

343
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,201
我不晓得      哦 好了啦
I don't know.         Well, come on.

344
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,245
你就不想试试看
Don't you wanna find out?

345
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,333
真不敢相信 我去不成自己的毕业舞会
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom!

346
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,043
这太残酷了
This is so harsh!

347
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:25,713
好 帮我拿键盘      好孩子 好孩子
Okay. Hold my board.         Attaboy! Attaboy!

348
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,474

Okay, you guys, ya know, I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.

349
00:20:28,474 --> 00:20:29,568

No, no, no.

350
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,931

The button! The button!

365
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,153
