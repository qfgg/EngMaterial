不开放 我们知道 
Closed set. We know. 

3
00:00:04,886 --> 00:00:06,750
但是我们是猴子的朋友
But we're friends with the monkey, hmm?

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,249
早安
Good morning.

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,300
嘿 老兄 看我带谁来了

我搞不懂
I don't get it.

9
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,050
他昨天看到我时好像还很开心
He seemed so happy to see me yesterday.

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,003
别放在心上 他压力很大
Don't take it personal. He's under a lot of pressure.

11
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:29,738
你也知道 拍电影的
Y'know, starring in a movie and all.

12
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,942
马塞尔现在算多大牌
Now just how big of a star is Marcel?

13
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,233
用人来比吗 我想他应该是
In human terms? I'd say...

14
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,737
西碧儿雪柏      哇
Cybill Shepherd.        Whoa.

15
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,292
你们是有份演出 还是有妄想症
So you guys in the movie or you just really paranoid?

16
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,668
嘿 塞尔
Hey, Sal? 

17
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,363
杰瑞想知道 猴子有没有准备好 拍地铁那场戏
Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set.

18
00:00:50,363 --> 00:00:51,550
不好意思
Excuse me?

19
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,176
杰瑞是导演吗 他是哪一位
Jerry is the director? Which one's he?

20
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:57,133
坐在导演椅上的那个      知道了
The one in the director's chair?        Gotcha.

21
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,238
菲比 陪我一起走
Pheebs, walk with me.

22
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:00,300
好 
Okay. 

23
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:02,806
为什么要我跟你一起走
How come I'm walking with you?

24
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,082
我们过来这里  是因为可以逃离 
Well we're just going over here so that we can get away from 

25
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,309
可怕的嗜肉病毒
the horrible flesh eating virus!

26
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,943
看在老天的份上 听我说
For the love of God, woman, listen to me!

27
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,775
他在看吗 他在看吗
Is he looking? Is he looking?

We've got a problem.         Tell me.

33
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:13,123
我没办法帮克莉丝化妆 
I can't do Chris's make up. 

34
00:02:13,124 --> 00:02:15,507
她不承认自己有胡子
She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche.

35
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,635
很严重吗      
Is it bad?         

36
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,259
像是眉毛长在嘴上
It looks like one of her eyebrow fell down.

37
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,599
除非谁能说服她把胡子漂白
Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it,

38
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,433
不然尚格云顿就得跟盖伯卡普兰亲热了
Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.

39
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,511
我去跟她说
I'll talk to her.

40
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,925
我讨厌演员
I hate actors.

41
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,163
你的迷彩装真不错 
Nice camouflage, man. 

42
00:02:32,164 --> 00:02:34,182
我差点就没看到你
For a minute there, I almost didn't see you.

43
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,319
不好意思
Excuse me. 

44
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,620
你是叫钱德吗      是的
Is your name Chandler?        Yes, yes it is.

45
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,905
你是钱德宾
Chandler Bing.

46
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,701
你是认识我 还是真的就这么厉害
Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?

47
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,084
我是苏西摩斯
I'm Susie Moss.

48
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,711
四年级 戴眼镜的
Fourth grade? Glasses?

49
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,794
我以前随身带一盒动物饼干 像拿着一个皮包一样
I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse?

50
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,708
苏西摩斯
Susie Moss!

51
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,923
是你啊 哇
Right! Yeah! Wow!

52
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,134
你看起来
You look...

53
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,799
真是女大十八变
Great job growing up.

54
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,897
还好你没戴着那个缀满小镜子的牛仔帽
It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.

55
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:13,436
四年级结束以后 我才意识到自己不是拉皮条的
Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.

56
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,067
还记得班级话剧表演吗
Remember the class play?

57
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:20,487
你掀了我的裙子 让全礼堂的人都看到我的内裤
You pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants?

58
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:26,487
对 那时候我用幽默来保护自己
Yes. Back then, I used humor as a defense mechanism.

59
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:29,372
谢天谢地 我现在不会了
Thank God! I don't do that anymore.

60
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,461
我的天啊      怎么啦 怎么啦
Oh my God!         What? What?

61
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,873
是尚格云顿耶
It's Jean Claude Van Damme.

62
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,884
我不知道他也在这部电影里面 他很帅
I didn't know he was in this movie. He is so hot!

63
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,551
有吗
You think?

64
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:46,090
布鲁塞尔的肌肉男 尚格云顿
The Muscles from Brussels? Wham Bam Van Damme?

65
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,804
你看过"时空特警"吗
Did you see "Time cop"?

66
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,468
没有 他演得好吗
No. Was he any good in it?

67
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,353
瑞秋 他完全转换了时空耶
Rachel, he like totally changed time!

68
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,146
哇喔
Wow!

69
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,354
你去跟他搭讪啊      少来
So why don't you go talk to him?         Oh. Yeah.

70
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,686
你过去告诉他 他很帅 
What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute. 

71
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:00,646
能糟到哪儿去
What's the worst that could happen?

72
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,109
他会听到的
He could hear me.

73
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,569
噢 拜托
Oh, please!

74
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,029
我去帮你说      
Okay, I'm doing it for you.        

75
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,827
瑞秋 不要 你敢 不行 不行
Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't.

76
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,488
跟他说我会煮菜
Tell him I cook!

77
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,122
不好意思
Excuse me.

78
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,376
嗨      嗨
Hi.         Hi.

79
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,712
听起来可能有点怪
This is gonna sound kind of goofy. 

80
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:21,421
但是 那边我的朋友
But, urn, my friend over there

81
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,381
她很会煮菜

82
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,054
她觉得你很帅
She thinks you're cute.

83
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,089
你不觉得我帅吗
You don't think I'm cute?

84
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,802
我不知道
I don't know.

85
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,470
你觉得你帅吗
Do you think you're cute?

86
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,567
话题有点扯远了 
Okay, we're kinda getting off the track here. 

87
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,484
我是来告诉你
I was supposed to come here and tell you

88
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,145
我朋友觉得你很帅
my friend thinks you're cute.

89
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,814
我要怎么回她呢
So, what should I tell her?

90
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:48,698
你可以跟她说 我觉得她朋友很美
You can tell her I think her friend is cute.

91
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,009
化妆师      他们在叫我 我得走了
Make up!         Oh, that's me. I gotta go.

92
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,110
哦 
Oh! 

93
00:05:01,111 --> 00:05:02,461
好吧
Okay.

94
00:05:02,462 --> 00:05:08,237
我还得摸你的手臂几次 你才会约我出去呢
So listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date?

95
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,550
再来一次看看
Well, let's try one more.

96
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,804
这就对了 8点在厄尼餐厅好吗
There you go. Say Ernie's, eight o'clock?

97
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,392
到时候见了
I'll be there.

98
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,183
如果一切顺利的话 说不定这次
And who knows, if things go well, maybe this time.

99
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,444
我会看到你的内裤
I'll get to see your underwear.

100
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,660
竟然没人听到我们的谈话
No one was around to hear that?

101
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,497
他说什么了
So, what'd he say?

102
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,831
真是个混蛋
What a jerk!

103
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,162
我一直在谈你
I kept talking about you.

104
00:05:41,163 --> 00:05:43,675
可是他一直想约我出去
And he kept asking me out.

105
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,303
自然 我拒绝他了
I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.

106
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,347
那么
Well,

107
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,598
还是多谢
thanks, anyway.

108
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,475
他只是一直约我
He just kept asking

109
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,228
一直问 一直问
and asking, asking, asking...

110
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,488
瑞秋 如果你想跟他约会 那就去啊
Rachel, if you, if you wanna go out with him, you can.

111
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,737
虽然我觉得他是个混蛋 但是如果你想去的话
Sound like a big jerk to me if that's what you want to do...

112
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:06,487
尚格 她答应了 今晚见
Jean Claude, she said yes! I'll see you tonight!

113
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,692
谢谢你
Thank you.

114
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,289
然后尚格带我去酒吧
And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads.

115
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,670
在那里跟德鲁巴里摩尔聊了一会儿
And that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.

116
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,127
哇 她很惹火哦
Oh, man. She's so smoking!

117
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,133
她有很炫的
She's got the greatest set of... 

118
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,223
周围没男的喔
No guys around, huh?

119
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,539
有人想喝点什么吗      
Anybody need anything?         

120
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,476
我要杯浓缩咖啡
Oh, I'll have an espresso.

121
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,227
我自己来好了
Oh, actually I'll get it.

122
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,686
如果要你拿 说不定会被你喝掉
If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.

123
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,603
她这样说太不公平了      对啊
That is so unfair.         I know.

124
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:50,820
你怎么可能在抢了云顿之后 还把她的咖啡喝掉
Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme?

125
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,487
乔伊 今晚我不能跟你打壁球了
Hey Joey, I have to cancel racketball for tonight.

126
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,800
刚刚是马塞尔的训练师 
That was Marcel's trainer.

127
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,369
他可以让马塞尔跟我待几个小时
He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.

128
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,374
你为了一只猴子放我鸽子
You're blowing me off for a monkey?

129
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,331
我们可以改到星期六再打啊
Hey, we can reschedule for Saturday.

130
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:06,214
对 除非你又勾搭上一群鸽子
Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.

131
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,048
嘿
Hey.

132
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,675
拿根叉子刺我吧
Stick a fork in me

133
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,428
我熟了
I am done!

134
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:13,926
拿叉子刺什么
Stick a fork what?

135
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,136
就像你做牛排的时候
Like when you're cooking a steak.

136
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,097
我不吃肉
Oh, okay, I don't eat meat.

137
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,896
那你怎么知道蔬菜熟了没
Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?

138
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,184
你吃了就会知道啊
Well you know, you just, you eat them and you can tell.

139
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,675
那就吃我吧 我熟了
Okay, then eat me, I'm done!

140
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,238
我碰到了完美的女人      什么
I've met the perfect woman.         What?

141
00:07:33,238 --> 00:07:35,653
我们在沙发上 卿卿我我
Okay, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around.

142
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,998
突然 她对我说  
And then suddenly she turns to me and says, 

143
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,863
"你想在电梯里做吗"
"Did you ever want to do it in an elevator?"

144
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,080
你说了什么
What did you say?

145
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,550
我相信 我的原话是 哼呀咿
I believe my exact words were "Flaign,en - sten"

146
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:48,988
我不知道要说什么 
I mean I didn't know what to say. 

147
00:07:48,988 --> 00:07:50,925
你怎么知道你想不想
How do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?

148
00:07:50,925 --> 00:07:52,300
你就是知道
Oh, you just know.

149
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,613
我们得走了 30分钟内要到餐厅
Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in thirty minutes.

150
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:04,101
不 不 不 不 不 
Oh no no no no no no no no no no.

151
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:08,484
我计划做的事 最多不会超过两三分钟
You see, what I had planned shouldn't take more than two, three minutes tops.

152
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:13,363
两百秒的激情 我们得走了
Two hundred seconds of passion! We gotta go.

153
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,404
不过
But...

154
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,115
我有个主意
Here's an idea.

155
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:22,207
你穿过女人的内裤吗
Have you ever worn women's underwear?

156
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,792
其实穿过
Well, yes, actually.

157
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:28,751
可是我穿的是爱德娜阿姨的
But they were my Aunt Edna's.

158
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,962
而且一共有三个人一起穿
And there were three of us in there.

159
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,887
如果你今晚吃饭时
Well I was thinking it would be kinda sexy,

160
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,390
穿我的内裤 一定会很性感
if you wore mine tonight at dinner.

161
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,351
你要我穿你的内裤
You want me to wear your panties?

162
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,940
可以吗
Could you?

163
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,897
如果我穿你的内裤
Well, if I was wearing your underwear,

164
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,234
那你要穿什么
then what would you be wearing?

165
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,492
你太棒了
You're swell!

166
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,743
你看 我做了马塞尔最爱的香蕉蛋糕
Check it out. I made Marcel's favorite dish, banana cake...

167
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,916
噢      还加了虫虫
Ooh.         with mealworm.

168
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,293
蜡烛
Candle. 

169
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,222
你想今晚会发生什么事呢
What do you think is gonna happen here tonight?

170
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,182
喂 
Hello.

171
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,642
你好 你准备要过来了吗
Oh, hi, are you on your way over...

172
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,108
哦
Oh!

173
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:36,425
没关系 我理解 猴子工作很忙
No, no. I understand. A monkey's gotta work.

174
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,278
没关系
It's no big deal.

175
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:43,288
我也没特别准备什么
lt's not like I had anything special planned, you know.

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,084
好 好 再见
Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay, bye.

177
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,678
瑞秋 你先说吧
Okay. Rachel, why don't you start talking first?

178
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,237
好吧 我觉得 她这样是完全没道理的
All right. I feel that this is totally unjustified.

179
00:10:01,237 --> 00:10:04,267
她说我可以的 我又没做什么
She gave me the green light, I did nothing...

180
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,271
你以为 我在电视荧幕上看不到你吗
Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?

181
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,812
摩妮卡 你有什么想说的
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...

182
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,651
你没权利跟他出去
You know, you had no right to go out with him!

183
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,943
这太荒谬了      你出卖我
That's the most ridiculous.         You sold me out!

184
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,952
我没有      你就是有
I did not sell you out!         You absolutely.

185
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,114
你能让我说完吗
Would you let me talk!

186
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,363
你刚刚弹我的头
Did you just flick me?

187
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,251
因为你不让我说完
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus...

188
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,592
很痛耶
Ow, that hurt!

189
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,256
不要弹了
Quit flicking!

190
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,429
你才不要弹了      你先弹我的
Ow! Stop flicking!        You flicked me first!

191
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,720
不要这样
Okay, no, no.

192
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,978
不要这样
Let's not do this!

193
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,642
想点快乐的事情 别打了
Come on. Happy thoughts. No! No!

194
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,560
快乐的事情 快乐的事情
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!

195
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,175
够了 老娘要出手了
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass!

196
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:20,425
好 你们都别闹了 我就放手
All right. Now, I will let go if you both stop.

197
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:22,855
你要怎样 要我不再见他吗 你就这样想的 对不对
Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?         

198
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:23,426
嗯哈
Uhhuh.

199
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,196
你要我打电话给他 
You want me to just call him up,

200
00:11:25,197 --> 00:11:26,974
跟他说他应该跟你约会
and tell him that you're seeing him instead?

201
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,431
你是要这样吗      对
Is that what you want?        Okay.

202
00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:34,690
你就是要这样      没错
Oh, that's what you want!        Yes!

203
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,319
好      好
Fine!         Fine!

204
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,154
很好
There we go.

205
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,488
如果我们在监狱 你们可以当我的小喽
You know what? If we were in prison, you guys would be like my bitches.

206
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,828
谢谢你们让我加入
Thanks for letting me tag along tonight, you guys.

207
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,338
别客气啦
Forget about it.

208
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:02,127
你怎么样      勉强撑着
How you doing there, squirmy?         I'm hanging in.

209
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,613
有点跑出来了
And a little out.

210
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,185
你是导演的助理啊
So assistant to the director?

211
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:14,399
这个工作真棒 你的责任一定很大
That's a really exciting job. I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities.

212
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,936
我不负责选角
I have nothing to do with casting.

213
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,017
你们想吃什么
So, what are you guys gonna eat?

214
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,440
为什么我满脑子只想着把冰块含在嘴里
How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth.

215
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:27,202
然后舔遍你全身呢
and licking you all over?

216
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:33,241
因为我上的是男子中学 现在上帝要补偿我了
Because I went to an all boys high school, and God is making up for it?

217
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,459
我现在就想要你
I want you right here

218
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,291
在这里
right now.

219
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,547
此时此刻
Right now, right here?

220
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,337
你不觉得 这里算是公共场合吗
Don't you think we're in kind of a public place?

221
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,016
这里真有虾呢
They do have the shrimp.

222
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,675
到洗手间等我 
Meet me in the bathroom.

223
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,072
我现在要去洗手间
I'm going to the bathroom now.

224
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,036
来吧
Come on.

225
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,753
好了 先生
All right, mister.

226
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,130
让我看看你的内裤吧
Let's see those panties.

227
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,959
好啊
Alrighty.

228
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,431
你知道怎样会更性感吗
But you know what would be even sexier?

229
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,182
怎样
What?

230
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,265
如果你没把上衣塞进去的话
If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.

231
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:42,569
好 现在呢 我要看你只穿内裤的样子
All right. Now, I would like to see you wearing nothing but them.

232
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,066
把衣服脱掉
Take your clothes off.

233
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,486
我要提醒你
But, uh, I hope you realize this means

234
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,322
这样会错过服务生介绍特餐的时间
we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.

235
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,009
来 快点      
Come on, hurry! 

236
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,957
你是要我做得最快 还是要我做得最好
Hey, do you want this done quick or done right?

237
00:13:56,127 --> 00:14:00,120
好了 转过身去 我要看你的背后
All right, turn around. I wanna see you from behind.

238
00:14:00,121 --> 00:14:04,966
有人一直跟着健身录影带做运动喔
Oh oh. Somebody's been doing his Buns of Steel video.

239
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:08,594
你要我夹紧什么东西吗
So you want me to, uh, clench anything or...

240
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,431
苏西
Susie?

241
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,634
苏西
Susie?

242
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,550
这是你四年级的报应
This is for the fourth grade.

243
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,392
你什么意思呀     我什么意思
Huh? What do you mean?         What do I mean?

244
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,650
什么"什么意思"
What do you mean what do I mean?

245
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:27,300
我的意思是内裤 先生 我就是这个意思
I mean underpants, mister! That's what I mean!

246
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,027
什么 什么意思
What? What do you mean?

247
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,528
我的裙子
My skirt!

248
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,445
你掀了 小孩都笑了
You lifted. Kids laughing!

249
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,050
我一直到十八岁都是内裤苏西
I was Susie Underpants till I was eighteen!

250
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,058
那是四年级的事情 
That was in fourth grade! 

251
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:41,627
你怎么会气到现在
How could you still be upset about that?

252
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,004
那么
Well...

253
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,800
你二十年后打电话给我
Why don't you call me in 20 years and

254
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,258
告诉我 你还气不气今天的事吧
and tell me if you're still upset about this.

255
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,717
你要知道 你的内裤我不会还你了喔
Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back!

256
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,361
我真是不敢相信
I can't believe this.

257
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,899
两个星期前 我还在看"绝命杀阵"
Just two weeks ago, I was watching "Sudden Death".

258
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:14,657
现在我却在跟尚格云顿约会
And now I'm on a date with Jean Claude Van Damme.

259
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,367
你能打扁那个家伙吗
Can you beat up that guy?

260
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,951
当然
Yeah.

261
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,538
你可以打倒那个人吗      当然
Can you beat up that guy?         Sure.

262
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,202
实在是太棒了
Oh, this is so wild.

263
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:28,501
我得承认 我有点吃惊你会答应跟我出来
Y'know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.

264
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,634
通常我是不会答应的
Normally, I would not do it.

265
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:31,885
是吗
Yeah?

266
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,219
那为什么会为我破例
What made you make the exception for me?

267
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,863
因为瑞秋跟我说
Because Rachel told me,

268
00:15:36,863 --> 00:15:40,433
你非常想跟我和德鲁巴里摩尔来个三人行
you were dying to have a threesome with me and, uh, Drew Barrymore.

269
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,848
对了 德鲁有些原则
By the way, Drew has some ground rules and...

270
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,773

你怎么会没穿内裤
How can you not be wearing any underwear?

326
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,996
因为看到一个男的穿了粉红丁字裤 让我火热难耐
Oh.I'm getting heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.

That's okay. I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff.

340
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:38,363
你知道的 他已经有了新的生活
You know, he's moved on.

341
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,236
本来就应该这样的 对吧
That's the way it goes, right?

342
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,064

钱德 我能借你的丁字裤吗
Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your Gstring?

348
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,091
你等着说这句话等多久了      
How long you been waiting to say that?
