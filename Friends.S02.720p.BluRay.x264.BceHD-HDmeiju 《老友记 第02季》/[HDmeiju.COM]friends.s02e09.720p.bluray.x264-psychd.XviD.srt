丑裸男在装饰圣诞树
Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree.

3
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:13,005
天啊 你们该来看看 他的圣诞球有多大
Oh my God! You should see the size of his Christmas balls!

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,472
嘿      嘿
Hey.        Hey.

5
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,719
你们今年给了管理员多少钱的红包
How much did you guys tip the super this year?

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,961
我们打算给50 
Yeah, we were gonna give fifty. 

7
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:22,887
但是如果你们给的比这多的话 我们也不想太难堪
But if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,526
事实上 今年我们只送了他一些自制的曲奇
Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.

9
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,603
那就给25
And twenty-five it is.

10
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,651
你们送他曲奇
You gave him cookies?

11
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,729
钱太没人情味了      对
Money is so impersonal.        Yeah.

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,690
曲奇能表示关心他们
Cookies says someone really cares.

13
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,743
好吧 我们破产了 但曲奇的确表达那层意思
All right, we're broke, but cookies do say that.

14
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:40,995
我了解
I can see that.

15
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,290
有盘布朗尼曾经给我念过打油诗
A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.

16
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:50,047
菲比 我问你 那些布朗尼是不是很搞笑
Pheebs, let me ask you something. Were these "funny" brownies?

17
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,500
也一般吧
Not especially.

18
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,173
不过 我觉得里面有大麻
But, you know, I think they had pot in them.

19
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:01,426
两位 你们还送过谁曲奇作红包
So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?

20
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,935
邮差 管理员
The mailman, the super...

21
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,181
还有那个送报纸的
Oh and the newspaper delivery guy.

22
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,521
天啊
Oh my God!

23
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,105
怎么了
What?

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,066
我想 你们不会喜欢这个的
I don't think you're gonna like this.

25
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,356
天啊
Oh gosh!

26
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,823
这是压烂在体育版里的碎曲奇
Oh, these are cookies smashed in the Sports section.

27
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,953
看 他还玩了我的字谜游戏
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.

28
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,412
而且还错漏百出
Yeah, but not very well, 

29
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:25,908
除了横14的"盖西文音乐剧"
Unless 14 across "Gershwin musical"

30
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:30,250
是"去死吧 去死吧 去死吧"
actually is "Bite me, bite me. bite me."

我不敢相信圣诞节已经到了 
I can't believe it's Christmas already, you know?

35
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:26,139
才刚吃过感恩节火鸡 转眼间
I mean, one day you're eating turkey, the next thing you know

36
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,305
神在跳舞 鹅在下蛋 (一首圣诞颂歌的歌词)
your lords are a-leaping and your geese are a-laying. 

37
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:34,943
所以每年的这个时候 鹅都很轻松
Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.

38
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,112
大家好      嘿

滚下楼 不论一个或两个
Walks downstairs alone or in pairs,

45
00:02:55,258 --> 00:03:01,128
大家都知道 它是一个大弹簧
Everyone knows it's just a big spring.

46
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,926
你还在生我的气 就因为
You're still mad because of the whole...

47
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,516
那张 不想跟我在一起的理由 可恶的清单
Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?

48
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:10,061
从现在起 我们称那为 “不幸的插曲” 怎么样？ 
How about for now we just call it "the unfortunate incident"?

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,734
阿甘 你住的地方有楼梯吗
Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?

Hey, guys.        Hey.

52
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,113
袋子里是什么东西
What's in the bag?

53
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,494
只是一些礼物
Just some presents.

54
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,701
来吧 让我们看看你买了什么
Come on, show us what you bought.

55
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,828
少装啦
You know you want to.

56
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,709
好吧
Okay.

And I got this blouse for Mom.

61
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,225

看看这些逼真的假勋章
Look at these authentic fake medals!

63
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,669

这是我爸的照片

71
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,550
菲比 那是相框里附送的照片
Pheebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.

72
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,962
不 才不是呢 他是我爸 我证明给你们看
No, it isn't. This is my dad. Alright, I'll show you.

73
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,389
菲比 我以为你爸在坐牢
Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.

74
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,182
那是我的继父
No, that's my stepdad.

75
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,727
我生父在我出生前就抛弃了我们
My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.

76
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,892
你怎么从未上过奥普拉的节目
How have you never been on Oprah?

77
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,809
看吧 就是他

我妈去世前给了我这张照片 是同一个人

79
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,360
亲爱的 这是一张相框模特儿
Honey, this is a picture of the frame guy

80
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,245
跟一只牧羊犬 在浅蓝色的布景前面拍的照
posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.

81
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,659
那不是蓝色布景 那是
It's not a blue screen. It's just...

82
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,662
或许那天的天气很好
Maybe it was just really clear that day.

83
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,091
好吧 我得找我外婆谈一谈
Okay, I have to talk to my grandmother.

84
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,298
等一下 亲爱的      菲比
Wait a minute, honey!        Pheebs.

艾瑟林文斯
Esther Livingston.

89
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,990
死了
Gone!

90
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,702
嘿 小菲
Hi Pooh.

91
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,158
外婆 你在做什么
Hi Gram. What're you doing?

92
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,870
更新电话簿
Oh! Just updating the phone book.

93
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,328
外婆
Gram?

94
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,747
我能再看一下我爸的照片吗
Can I see the pictures of my dad again?

95
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,753
哦
Oh!

96
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,007
没问题 当然可以
Oh sure, sure.

97
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,632
怎么了
How come?

98
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,468
我只是想看看他
Just, you know, to see him.

99
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,640
没问题 在这儿
Oh, sure. Here.

100
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,051
好
All right.

101
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,221
这是你爸站在草地上
This is the one of your father in a meadow.

102
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,809
教一个小男孩放风筝
And, helping a little boy fly a kite.

103
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,437
这是他参加毕业典礼
And here he is at a graduation.

104
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,107
另一场毕业典礼
Another graduation.

105
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,703
另一场毕业典礼
Another graduation.

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,740
他真的是我父亲吗
Okay. Is this really my father?

107
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,751
他真的是你父亲
Is it really your...

108
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,545
当然是的
Well, of course it is.

109
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,708
我闻到烟味了 因为有人要火烧屁股了
I smell smoke. Maybe that's because someone's pants are on fire!

110
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,839
我
Well I...

111
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,881
我们祖孙这么多年
Y'know, in all the years we've been grandmother and granddaughter

112
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,594
你从来没对我说过谎
you have never lied to me.

113
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,263
好吧 他不是你爸 只是相框附送的照片
All right, that's not your father. That's just a picture of a guy in a frame.

114
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,649
天啊
Oh God!

115
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,647
那是你妈的点子
It was your mother's idea.

116
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,282
她不要你知道你生父是谁
Y'know, she didn't want you to know your real father.

117
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,365
因为他离开时 她真的很伤心
Because it hurt her so much when he left.

118
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,567
我本来也不想跟着她骗你 
I didn't wanna go along with it.

119
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,120
但她死了 我很难跟她争论
But then she died and it was harder to argue with her.

120
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:01,084
不是不可能 但是更难了
Not impossible, but harder.

121
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,879
好吧 那他不是著名的树医生
All right. So was he not a famous tree surgeon?

122
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:13,638
而且我猜 他也不住在 没有电话的缅甸茅屋里头
And then I guess, okay, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?

123
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,517
据我所知 他在州北部的某个地方当药剂师
Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.

124
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,310
那一点道理都没有
Okay. That makes no sense.

125
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,644
为什么村民要崇拜一个药剂师
Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?

126
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,268
亲爱的
Honey...

127
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,149
喔 对      对
Oh. Yeah.        Yeah.

128
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,821
总之 我只知道那么多
Anyway, that's all I know.

129
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,452
那个
That

130
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,952
还有这个
and this.

131
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,036
这是
This

132
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,917
真正的他
is the real him.

133
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,208
噢
Oh!

134
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,047
我记得我爸 穿着一身红色的衣服
Y'know, I remember my father all dressed up in the red suit,

135
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,391
黑色大靴子 还有漆皮皮带
the big black boots and the patent leather belt,

136
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,229
在楼下鬼鬼祟祟
sneaking around downstairs. 

137
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,637
他不想我们看到他
He didn't want anybody to see him.

138
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,088
但是他又喝醉了 
But he'd be drunk.

139
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:06,520
走路摇摇晃晃 撞上东西 把大家都吵醒了
So he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.

140
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,858
听起来 不像是个快乐的圣诞节
Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.

141
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,238
谁说是圣诞节来着
Who said anything about Christmas?

142
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,209
嗨      
Hi!     

143
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,865
嘿 谁有菲比的消息
Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?

144
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,412
没有 完全没消息
No, nothing.

145
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,992
希望她没事
I hope she's okay.

146
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,158
我能了解她的感受
Yeah. I know exactly what she's going through.

147
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,709
你怎么会完全了解她的感受
How do you know exactly what she's going through?

148
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,454
她跟我们说了
She told us.

149
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,591
你买了什么 摩妮卡
So what do you got there, Monica?

150
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,052
派对要用的东西
Just stuff for the party.

151
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,622
你们还在这里干嘛 
Yeah, what're you guys doing here? 

152
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:37,131
你们不是应该去血拼的吗
Aren't you guys supposed to be shopping?

153
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,969
你们还没有买礼物吗
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet?

154
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,847
明天就是平安夜 你们打算怎么办
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve! What are you gonna do?

155
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,014
不是只有粘土动画里的人才会这么说话吗
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?

156
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,999
对了 摩妮卡 我想邮差不喜欢你的曲奇
Oh, by the way, Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies.

157
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,895
这是你妈寄来的装饰品
Here are the ornaments your mom sent. 

158
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,240
好吧
Well.

159
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,217
或许邮差喜欢曲奇 
Maybe the mailman liked the cookies. 

160
00:08:58,218 --> 00:09:00,571
只是我们给的不够
We just didn't give him enough.

161
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,782
摩妮卡 鸽子都比你聪明
Monica, pigeons learn faster than you.

162
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,086
嘿 瑞秋
Hey, Rach.

163
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,219
我想我知道 怎么做能让你开心一点
You know what? I think I know what will make you feel better.

164
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:19,218
你也列一张关于我的清单 怎么样
How about you make a list about me?

165
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,399
什么 算了 罗斯 不要 
Wha... forget it, Ross, no.

166
00:09:21,401 --> 00:09:22,971
我才不要站在这里列清单
I am not gonna stand here and make a list of ...

167
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,144
好吧 你爱抱怨
Okay, youre whiny.

168
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,268
你偏执 没有安全感
You are obsessive. You are insecure.

169
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,183
非常没胆
You're gutless. 

170
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,696
你无法把握机会
You know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know?

171
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,655
你喜欢我一整年 却没采取任何行动
You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it.

172
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,067
还有 你的发胶抹太多了
And... Oh you wear too much of that gel in your hair.

173
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,407
看吧 你
See, there. You...

174
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,327
你照我的话去做了
All right, you did what I said.

175
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,584
没错 你知道吗 你说的对 我真的感觉好多了
Yeah, and you know what? You're right. I do feel better.

176
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,838
谢谢你 罗斯
Thank you, Ross.

177
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:03,429
对 在奥巴尼 能告诉我法兰克布非的电话吗
Yeah, in Albany. Could I have the number of Frank Buffay?

178
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,554
好的 伊夕卡呢
Okay, in Ithaca?

179
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,890
好吧 沙拉托加呢
All right, Saratoga?

180
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,397
奥尼昂坦呢
Oneonta?

181
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:17,360
你知道吗 你不该自称是查号台
You know what? You shouldn't call yourself information!

182
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,493
嘿
Hey.

183
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:27,533
外婆 如果那是你的真名
Hello, Grandma. If that is in fact your real name.

184
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,915
别这样 小菲 别再生我的气了
Come on. Now, Pooh, don't still be mad at me.

185
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,374
怎么样      没结果
How's it going?         Oh, not so good.

186
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,924
州北部很大 他很渺小 你自己想吧
Upstate's pretty big. He's pretty small. You do the math.

187
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,598
我想 没有他 你能过得更好
Well, I think you're better off without him.

188
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,551
亲爱的 我知道他是你爸
Oh honey, I know he's your daddy.

189
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,934
但对我来说 他仍是那个不负责的混蛋
But to me, he's still the irresponsible creep

190
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,189
搞大你妈的肚子 偷走她的小魔怪玩具
who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.

191
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:59,356
我了解 我只想知道他是谁
I know. I just wanted to know who he was, you know?

192
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,110
对 我知道
Yeah. I know.

193
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,199
好吧
Okay.

194
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,000
其实我没有完全说实话
I wasn't completely honest with you 

195
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:12,160
我跟你说我不知道他在哪里
when I told you that I didn't know exactly where he lived.

196
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,120
什么意思
What do you mean?

197
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,379
他住在米德尔敦月桂路74号
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown.

198
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,259
看到乳制品女王 就代表你走过了
If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far.

199
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,305
你可以开我的出租车去
You can take my cab.

200
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,849
哇
Wow!

201
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,010
谢谢
Thank you.

202
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,823
不能让其他人开那辆出租车      
Now, remember nobody else drives that cab.        

203
00:11:32,824 --> 00:11:37,235
我知道 我要去见我爸了
Got it. Oh! I'm gonna see my dad!

204
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,236
谢谢
Thank you!  

205
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,367
好吧 祝我好运吧 外公
Okay. Oh! Wish me luck, Grandpa.

206
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:53,834
嘿
Hey.

207
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,515
菲比把出租车开过来了吗
Phoebe here with the cab yet?

208
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,252
对 她开了辆隐形出租车
Yeah, she brought the invisible cab.

209
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,757
上车吧
Hop in!

210
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,169
她最好快一点 商店七点就关门了 
She'd better get here soon. The outlet stores close at 7.

211
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:06,215
别担心 开车到菲比爸家要两小时
Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll  be two hours to Phoebe's dad's house.

212
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,508
他们会见面 聊天 分享人生故事
They'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories.

213
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,347
我们仍然有的是时间
We'll still have plenty of time.

214
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,725
她来了      嘿
Hey, here she comes!         Hey.

215
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,061

嘿      嘿
Hey.        Hey.

218
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,443
你们能相信吗
Can you believe this?

219
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,781
两小时后 我就有爸爸了
In like two hours I'm gonna have a dad.

220
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,245
没错 重大事件哦
Yeah, big stuff.

221
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,871

Okay, let's go.         Okay.

222
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,333
拿去 这个给你      好的
Here, you have to hold this.         Okay.

223
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,500
煞车左边 油门右边
Brake, left. Gas, right?

224
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,738
那是我的小抄
Yeah, that's my cheat sheet.

225
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,425
我的安全带在哪里      
Where's my seat belt?         

226
00:12:46,426 --> 00:12:47,515
那边没有安全带
Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one.

227
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,179
被救护人员剪开了
The paramedics had to cut through it.

228
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,181
嘿      嘿
Hey.         Hey.

229
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,989
来吧 快告诉我 拜托
Come on, just tell me. Please, please.

230
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,198
这是第16次 不 我不觉得你偏执
For the 16th time, no, I do not think you're obsessive.

231
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,690
天啊 这里真的好热      
Oh gosh. It's hot in here! 

232
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,577
瑞秋 关掉暖气
Rach, get the heat.

233
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,493
罗斯 请你关掉暖气      没问题
Ross, turn the heat down, please?         Sure.

234
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,832
它们之间有明显的差别 偏执和
By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive...

235
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,167
罗斯 暖气
Ross, the heat!

236
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:24,459
好吧 暖气 暖气 暖气 还说我偏执
Fine. Okay. Heat heat heat. And I'm the obsessive one?

237
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,426
好的
Okay.

238
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,337
这边是开
This way is on.

239
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,466
所以这边是
So this is...

240
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,094
关
off.

241
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,356
你把散热器弄坏了
Did you just break the radiator?

242
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:41,480
不 我只是转一下开关 然后
No, no, I was turning the knob and...

243
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,444
就变成这样了
Here it is.

244
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,861
把它装回去
Well, put it back!

245
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:48,950
它
It...

246
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,718
装不回去      
It won't go back.         

247
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,157
我打电话给管理员
I'll call the super.

248
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,788
来吧 让我试试看
Here, let me try.

249
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:58,167
没错 我忘了你有熔化金属的超能力
Oh oh, that's right. I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.

250
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,119
好笑的远亲
Hey, it's Funny's cousin,

251
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,413
不好笑
Not Funny!

对 有人弄坏了我们的暖气开关

这里真的很热
And it's really hot in here.

256
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,850
对 热到可以烤曲奇了
Yes, it's hot enough to bake cookies.

257
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,980
你能在六点前帮我们换新的吗
Well, do you think we could have a new one by six?

258
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,353
什么 不 星期二 我们不能等到星期二
What? No, no. Tuesday? We can't wait until Tuesday.

259
00:14:23,354 --> 00:14:24,940
今晚我们要举行派对

Okay, tip the man.

261
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,522
不 如果他不喜欢我们的曲奇 太可惜了
No. If he doesn't like our cookies, too bad.

262
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,487
我才不要被勒索
I won't be blackmailed.

263
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,947
就算情况变糟 变得有点热
Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm,

264
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,828
我们可以办主题派对
We'll call it a theme party.

265
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,828
派对主题 "请进 热锅上的蚂蚁"
Hey, here's a theme, "Come on in, live like bacon!"

266

Seventy four.

268
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:49,544
原来这个的功用是那样啊
Oh. so, that's what this is for!

269
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,676
就是这里 我要见到我爸了
This is it. I'm gonna meet my dad.

270
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,011

This is like the biggest thing ever, huh?

271
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,264
对      当然
Yeah.         Sure is.

272
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,313
好吧 我要进去了
Okay, here I go. I'm going in.

273
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,395
好的
All right!

274
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,851
祝你好运 菲比

275
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,607

276
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,776

277
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,146

Here I go.

278
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,237
我要去了

279
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,378
嗨
Hi.

280
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,962
欢迎光临我们的热带圣诞节派对
Welcome to our tropical Christmas party.

281
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:31,720
可以将外套 毛衣 裤子 跟衬衫 放到卧室里
You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.

282
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,599
很难看得出来 因为我在流汗
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating.

283
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,848
但我完全是按照 发胶瓶身说明使用的
But I use exactly what the gel bottle says.

284
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,045
一颗豆子大小的份量而已 
An amount about the size of a pea. 

285
00:15:45,046 --> 00:15:46,772
那怎么会太多呢
How can that be too much?

286
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,113
冰块
Ice?

287
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,902
冰块 谁要冰块 拿张纸巾
Ice? Ice squares anyone? Take a napkin.

288
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,159
好吧
All right.

289
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,238
摩妮卡 摩妮卡
Monica? Monica!

290
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,416
摩妮卡 你的客人快变成肉干了
Monica, your guests are turning into jerky. Okay？

291
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,748
是吗 我觉得蛮舒服的
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable.

292
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,002
嘿 嘿 嘿 排队 老兄 我是下一个

294
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,550

You said there was a party.

295
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,051
没错
Oh, yeah！

296
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,558
欢迎光临我们的三温暖
Well, hey, welcome to our sauna.

297
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,846
很热吗 我从来不觉得热
Is it hot? My body always stays cool.

298
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,481
或许是因为我的皮很厚
Probably because I have so much skin.

299
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,192
嘿 芝士
Hey, cheese!

300
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,613

Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica, give him cash.

Rachel, give him your earrings. Something, now, anything!

302
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,701

No. I will not cave.

303
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:38,952
我支持摩妮卡
Yeah, I'm with Mon.

304
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,411
好吧 好吧 你说我不懂得把握机会
Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day?

305
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:46,001
好吧 尽管他是你们的管理员 我也要把握机会
Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing.

306
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,622
崔格先生
Mr. Treeger?

307
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,963

Here is fifty bucks. Merry Christmas!

308
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,385
哇
Oh wow!

309
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,841
我没给你准备礼物

No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright?

312
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,269
对了 你认为你可不可以 现在把暖气给修好
Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?

313
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,726
不行 我跟女孩们说过
No can do. Like I told the girl.

314
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,735
星期二才能拿到开关零件
I can't get a knob until Tuesday.

315
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,147
罗斯      什么
Ross?        Yeah?

316
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,065
看样子 他在打棒球
Looks like he's playing baseball.

317
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,075
你是说 他在玩硬的吗
You mean hardball?

318
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,495
都一样
Whatever.

319
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,501
你要怎么办
What you gonna do?

320
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,663
失陪 我要去把握机会
Excuse me. I'm seizing.

321
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,870
崔格先生

Happy Hanukkah.

324
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,336
这能帮助你快点拿到开关零件吗
Will, will this help with the knob getting?

325
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,762
不行
No.

326
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,890
商店星期二才会开门
The place is not open till Tuesday.

327
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,633
我说的还不够清楚吗
Am I not saying it right?

328
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,100
这么说 你真的喜欢我的曲奇
So, wait, you really did like my cookies?

329
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:51,194
当然 非常有感情 证明你们真的关心我
Oh yeah, they were so personal. It really showed you cared.

330
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:00,401
你太会把握机会了 发胶男孩
Nice seizing, gel boy.

331
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,745
这是槲寄生吗
So, is this mistletoe?

332
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:12,880
不 那是 那是罗勒
No, no, that, that is basil.

333
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,212
如果那是槲寄生 我就要亲你了
If it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss you.

334
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,178
不 那是罗勒
Yeah, no, it's still basil.

335
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,485
好吧
Okay.

336
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,858
你跑到哪里了      信箱
How far did you get?         Mailbox.

337
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,070
好吧 我们有进步了
All right, we're getting closer.

338
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,659
菲比 到底怎么了
What's going on?

339
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,285
其实是所有的事情混在一起
No, it's just like, you know, it's a whole mess of stuff, you know. 

340
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:55,248
比如说 昨天我爸是著名的缅甸树医生
Because like yesterday, you know, my dad was this famous Burma tree surgeon guy.

341
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,714
现在他是药剂师
And, you know, now he's a pharmacist guy and... 

342
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:03,047
或许他是很酷的药剂师
Well, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.

343
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:07,636
没错 或许他是 我去敲门
Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door.

344
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,055
他会拥抱我 我就有爸爸了
And he'll hug me, and I'll have a dad.

345
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,204
我会去他的药房 
Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy. 

346
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:14,893
大家都会对我好
And everyone will be nice to me.

347
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,063
因为我是法兰克的女儿
Because, you know, I'm Frank's daughter.

348
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,609
那为什么你不去敲门呢
So why not go knock?

349
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:28,497
因为如果他不是个好爸爸呢
Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy?

350
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,126
我是说 如果他还是那个 
I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag 

351
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:33,753
抛弃我妈跟我们的混蛋呢
who ran out on my mom and us?

352
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,506
对      嗯
Yeah.        Hmm.

353
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,046
你们知道吗
You know what?

354
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,672
这星期我已经失去了一个假爸爸
I've already lost a fake dad this week and...

355
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,759
我不想再失去一个真爸爸
I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.

356
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,564
菲比 没关系的 今天你跨出了一大步
Pheebs, that's okay. You took a big step today.

357
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,313
是吗      对
Yeah?        Yeah.

358
00:19:56,487 --> 00:20:00,025
有一天  当你准备好时 就会越过那片篱笆了
And someday, when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.

359
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:03,074
没错 那个时候 他会有幸得到你这样的女儿
Yeah! And when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.

360
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,826
你们
You guys...

361
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,324
抱歉 你们来不及去买东西了
I'm sorry about your shopping.

362
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,960
没关系 会有办法的
Oh, that's okay. We'll figure something out.

363
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,381
我知道你不打算进去
Listen Phoebs, I know you're not going in there.

364
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:23,085
但是你觉得 我能不能去借用一下 他家的洗手间
But do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom?

365
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,513
没关系 算了
That's fine, never mind.

366
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,221
酷 下雪了
Cool. Snow!

367
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,928
就像一张空白画布
Kinda like a blank canvas.

368
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:44,524
天啊 这里好热啊
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap, is it hot in here!

369
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,032
真的好热 介意我把暖气关小点吗
Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?

370
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:52,619
对呀 我们该早点想到那一点的
Hey, we could have used that kind of thinking earlier!

371
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,954
菲比 怎么样
So, Pheebs, how did it go?

372
00:20:54,956 --> 00:20:56,919
我没办法进去
Oh! I couldn't go in.

373
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,250
亲爱的 我很遗憾      你还好吧
Honey, I'm sorry.         Are you okay?

374
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,254
没事 因为我知道他在那里
Yeah, yeah, no it's okay. Because, I mean, I know he's there.

375
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,339
目前那就已经足够了
So that's enough for now.

376
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,334
嘿 已经过了午夜 
Hey, guys, it's after midnight! 

377
00:21:06,335 --> 00:21:07,718
祝大家圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas, everyone!

378
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,551
对 圣诞快乐
Oh right! Merry Christmas!

379
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,303
嘿 摩妮卡 开关坏了
Hey, Monica, the knob was broken.

380
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:18,145
我就从下面把暖气整个关掉 希望别出什么问题
So I just turned it off from underneath. I hope that's alright.

381
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,696
瑞秋 这是给你的

I don't even have a car.

384
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:41,789
没错 有了这个新汽车芳香剂 你会以为自己真有车
No, but with this newcar smell, you'll think you do.

385
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,294
好吧 菲比 轮到你了

388
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,184
