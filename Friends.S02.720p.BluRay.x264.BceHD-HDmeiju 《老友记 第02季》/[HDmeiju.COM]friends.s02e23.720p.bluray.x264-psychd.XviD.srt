1
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:05,836
好吧 钱德 摩妮卡 只剩一个香蕉坚果松饼了
Okay, Chandler, Mon, there's only one banana-nut muffin left.

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,416
我先说要的
I ordered mine first.

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,456
是啊 但是我比较快
Yeah, but I'm so much faster.

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,334
给我
Give it to me.

5
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:13,673
不要
No.

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:14,927
给我
Give it to me.

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,931
好吧 你可以拿去
Okay, you can have it.

8
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,188
好吧 享受你的咖啡吧
There you go. Enjoy your coffee.

9
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,361
我来这儿时就已经在桌上了
That was there when I got here.

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,868
嘿 你们绝对猜不到 谁要来纽约
Hey, you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.

11
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,738
快点 菲比 在他咽下去之前快告诉我们
Quick Phoebe tell us before he swallows.

12
00:00:39,738 --> 00:00:42,448
好 是雷恩 和我约过会 在海军服役的那个
OK Ryan, that guy I went out with who's in the Navy.

13
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,862
你和在海军服役的人约会?
You went out with a guy in the Navy?

14
00:00:45,862 --> 00:00:48,837
是啊 我在华盛顿广场公园弹吉他时遇到他
Yeah. I met him while playing guitar in the park.

15
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:52,545
雷恩给我太妃糖 因为他没有零钱
Ryan threw in saltwater taffy because he didn't have change.

16
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,051
嘿 所以你就写了《太妃糖人》?
Hey, is that when you wrote 'SaltwaterTaffyMan'?

17
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,587
不是
No. Heh.

18
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:01,517
不是 他是我的潜艇人 他每两年就会出水一次
No.he's my submarine guy. He resurfaces, like, every couple years...

19
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,474
然后我们就会一起度过最棒的三天
and we have the most amazing three days together

20
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,800
只不过这一次 他会来两个星期
Only this time,he's coming for two weeks.

21
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,187
整整两个星期 也就是耶
Two whole weeks, which meansyay."

22
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,425
等等 这家伙一潜到水底下 就是两年?
So wait, this guy goes down for like, two years at a time?

23
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,925
这就是舔我的松饼的代价
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.

24
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:25,703
嗨
Hi.

25
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,701
哦 糟糕 发生了什么事?
Oh, no. What happened?

26
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,370
我刚才和卡萝通话 小班得了水痘
I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chickenpox.

27
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:31,789
哦 不是真的吧
Oh, no.You're kidding.

28
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:35,209
是啊 所以如果你还没有得过 你很可能会得
Yeah, so if you haven't had it, chances are you're gonna get it.

29
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,048
好吧 我已经得过了      是啊 我得过了
 Well,I've had it.        Yeah I've had it.

30
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,211
得过了      得过了
 Had it.        Had it.

31
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:42,095
我从来没有得过 我觉得好孤单 哦 你看
I've never had it. I feel so left out. Oh look.

36
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,319
亲爱的 你又铺好床了
Honey, you made the bed again.

37
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,987
我告诉你 你不必这么做 这又不是营地
I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.

38
00:02:42,987 --> 00:02:47,122
所以我猜昨晚偷内裤 是完全不必要的了
Oh. Then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for.

39
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,925
好吧 我要去冲个澡
Okay, I am going to take a shower.

40
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:53,675
今天我会唱吉姆克罗齐的《李洛伊布朗》
And today I will be singing Jim Croces"LeroyBrown."

41
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,219
摩妮卡?
Monica?

42
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,931
嘿 摩妮卡 我有一个问题
Hey, Mon, I have a question.

43
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,503
李洛伊是整个镇最坏的人
Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town...

44
00:03:11,503 --> 00:03:13,628
还是整个镇最胖的人?
...or the fattest man in the whole damn town?

45
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:18,400
最坏的 否则这首歌 就会是《肥肥李洛伊布朗》
The baddest. Otherwise, the song would be'Fat,Fat LeroyBrown.'

46
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,981
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

47
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,077
我只是在等待着你 亲爱的
I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.

48
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,737
你在重铺床?
Are you remaking the bed?

49
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,501
对不起 对不起 你知道吗? 你弄的根本没问题
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what? The way you did it. It was just fine.

50
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,129
那你重铺是因为...?
Then you're redoing it because...?

51
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,047
如果我告诉你 你会认为我疯了
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.

52
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,301
反正已经无可避免
You're pretty much running that risk either way.

53
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,922
好吧 你看...
Okay. You see...

54
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:49,222
棉被的标签不该是在左上角
the duvet tag shouldn't be at the top left corner...

55
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,478
应该是在右下角
it should be at the bottom right corner.

56
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,425
嗯 这不是太疯狂啊
Uh-huh. Well,that's not so crazy.

57
00:03:53,425 --> 00:03:55,143
我只是用简单的方法解释给你听
I'm just easing you in.

58
00:03:55,143 --> 00:03:56,607
好的
Ha. All right.

59
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,311
好 你有看到这些小花朵吗?
All right, you see these little flower blossoms?

60
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,775
它们应该朝上 不是朝下
They should be facing up, not down...

61
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,442
因为...床头应该是太阳出来的地方
because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be.

62
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,441
你不爱我了 对吧?
You don't love me anymore, do you?

63
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,545
其实 如果可能的话 我更爱你
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.

64
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,751
真的吗?
Really?

65
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,300
好吧 那么 来吧
Wow. Well, then, come on.

66
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,884
我想让你看如何 把卫生纸折成三角形
I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.

67
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,227
乔伊 如果你需要工作...
Joey, if you need something to hold you over

68
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,139
我这里就可以给你一份工作 当入门处理员
I can get you a job right here as an entry-level processor.

69
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,308
那样的工作不用经验吗?
Don't you need experience for a job like that?

70
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,896
并不是很难学
It's not that hard to learn.

71
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,550
当人发现你不知道你在做什么时...
And as for people realizing you don't know what you're doing,

72
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,858
嘿 你是演员耶
hey, you're an actor.

73
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:47,050
就演得像个处理员 人们就会认为你是一位处理员
Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.

74
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,203
嘿 钱德 这是今天上午的预测
Hey, Chandler. Here's this morning's projections.

75
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,364
嘿 史考特亚历山大 谢谢 这是乔伊崔比亚尼
Hey, thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbiani.

76
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,622
嘿      嘿
Hey        Hey.

77
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,410
乔伊是一位处理员
Joey is a, uh, fellow processor.

78
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:57,870
不是开玩笑吧?
No kidding?

79
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,456
哦 是的
Oh, yeah.

80
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,815
我处理人们要处理的东西 我是他们要找的人
I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.

81
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,223
你在哪儿工作?      好吧 我现在待业中
Where do you work?        Uh. well, right now I'm in between things.

82
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,935
你知道是怎么回事 有一天 你在处理 第二天...
You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day...

83
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,938
你没有那么多... 可处理了
...you're not so much processing anymore.

84
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,645
我正跟乔伊讲佛莱许曼小组的职缺的事呢
I was telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.

85
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,401
佛莱许曼小组
Fleischman's group.

86
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,062
不管你做什么 不要碰他的三明治
Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches.

87
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,035
你们处理员都是笨蛋吗?
Are all you processors dorks?

88
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,831
这口红你涂起来很美
Ugh. This lipstick looks just great on you.

89
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,546
你看起来很美 亲爱的 真的
You look fabulous, honey. You really do.

90
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,206
是啊 你确定吗?真的吗?
Yeah, are you sure? Really?

91
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,554
看 你看起来很漂亮 拜托 把灯光调暗
See, you look beautiful. For God sakes, dim the lights.

92
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,300
我好吓人啊
I'm hideous.

93
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,014
不会有问题的
It's gonna be okay.

94
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,894
雷恩在水底下很久
Ryan's been underwater

95
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,478
你的屁股上没有长牡蛎他就已经很开心了
he's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnacles on your butt.

96
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,617
进来
Come in.

97
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,994
嘿 宝贝 我回来了
Hey, baby, I'm back.

98
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,375
嘿 雷恩 你好吗?
Hey, Ryan. What's up?

99
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,003
这是怎么回事?
What's going on?

100
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:27,588
不...你必须保持距离 我长了痘痘
No, no. You have to stay back. I have the pox.

101
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,259
水痘还是天花?
Chicken or small?

102
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:36,264
是水痘 真是讽刺 因为我是素食主义者
Chicken, which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.

103
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,300
为什么你不躺在家里休息? 
 Why aren't you at home in bed?

104
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,737
因为我祖母从未得过水痘
My grandmother's never had chicken pox.

105
00:06:41,737 --> 00:06:43,942
拜托 拜托 告诉我你得过
Please, please, tell me you have...

106
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,945
因为...哦 我的天 我忘了你有多么可爱
...because oh, my God, I forgot how cute you are.

107
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,363
对不起 我从来没有得过      噢 噢
 I'm sorry, I never had them.        Oh. oh!

108
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,566
如果我有一个愿望 我会组装一台 时间机器
If I had one wish,it'd be to build a time machine,

109
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:55,628
回到我七岁时
go back to when I was 7

110
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:57,121
当吉米豪瑟得水痘时...
when Jimmy Hauser had chicken pox...

111
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,250
我会抓住那小子 用他抹遍我的脸
I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.

112
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,878
是啊 或者 你知道 你可以希望我现在没有得水痘
Yeah, or, you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.

113
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,667
求你了 我可以看看你的脸吗?
Can I please see your face?

114
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,709
不要 你不会想看到长满痘痘的脸的
No. You don't wanna see a face covered with pox.

115
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,754
就算你的脸上全是鲑鱼 我也不会在意
Your face could be covered with lox, I wouldn't care.

116
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,737
而且你讨厌鱼 噢
And you hate fish. Oh.

117
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,058
真贴心 好吧
So sweet. All right.

118
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,891
好吧 你可以看
Okay, all right. You can see.

119
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,148
这就是我
This, ahem, is me.

120
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,692
对不起
Sorry.

121
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,356
我很可怕
I am scary.

122
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,774
对不起 是闪电...
Sorry, the lightning

123
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,160
闪电是不幸的巧合
Lightning was an unfortunate coincidence.

124
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,203
你看起来很可爱
You look lovely. Lovely.

125
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,581
我讨厌这样
I hate this.

126
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,334
我告诉你 我为我们计划了 最棒的两周
I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us.

127
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,918
在我脑海里 我们比现在这样亲近多了
And almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.

128
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,488
菲比 我花了将近八个月时间
Phoebe, l've spent the last eight months

129
00:07:50,488 --> 00:07:52,427
与男人们在钢管中生活
in a steel tube with men...

130
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,639
一直都在想像这个时刻
thinking about this moment.

131
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,426
我不会让一堆...
I am not gonna let a bunch...

132
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,378
会发痒的斑点挡在我们之间
of itchy spots stand between us.

133
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,773
好吧 这是我得过最浪漫的病了
Okay. This is the most romantic disease I've ever had.

134
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,576
嘿      嘿 第一天过得如何?
Hey.        Hey.How's the first day going?

135
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,206
相当不错 就像你说的那样
Pretty good.It's like you said.

136
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,414
大部分只是把号码从一列填到另一列
It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.

137
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,668
对啊 就是这样
Well, there you go.

138
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,296
嘿 大家都好友善
Hey, and everybody's so nice.

139
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,894
我刚才在和一位红头发叫珍妮的女士畅谈
I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.

140
00:08:31,894 --> 00:08:34,587
珍妮? 东岸开发部门的主管 珍妮?
Jeannie? The head of East Coast Operations, Jeannie?

141
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:38,222

是啊 世界真小 对吧?
Yeah. Small world, huh?

143
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,018
世界真怪
Weird world.

144
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,647
你的孩子?      我想我的角色应该有孩子
 Your kids?        l figure my character has kids.

145
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:55,111

You know, there isn't a part of that sentence that I don't need explained.

146
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,285
嗯 知道吗 当你在演戏时 你需要思考这样的东西
Well, see, when you're acting, you need to think about stuff like that.

147
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,868

149
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,962
爱什莉重复布莉塔妮所做的一切
Ashley copies everything Brittany does.

150
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:18,971
嗯 无形的孩子 有时是会这样
Oh. Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.

151

你知道是什么能使痒痒更糟糕吗?
You know what makes the itching even worse?

157
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,286
你不停谈论它吗?
That you don't stop talking about it?

158

183
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,523
不要动      为什么?
Don't move.        Why?

184
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,026
不要动      你在...?
Don't move.        What are you...?

185
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,325
停下 现在就停下
Aah! Stop that. Stop that right now.

186
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,656
你知道吗 菲比 我想过你可能会这样
You know, I might've expected this of you, Phoebe.

187
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,237
但是 雷恩 你是一个军人耶
But, Ryan, you're a military man.

188
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,586
你和米尔顿一定要到我们船上来玩

Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up.

194
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,762
再见 珍妮      再见 约瑟夫
Bye-bye, Jeannie.        Bye-bye, Joseph.

195
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,135
好假的一个人
What a phony.

196
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,300
好了 我相信当她走下
Well,I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson

197
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,999
空无一物的码头时她就知道教训了
when she steps off the dock onto nothing.

198
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,728
嘿 道格拉斯先生      老板
 Hey, Mr. Douglas.        Sir.

199
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,522
听着 宾 我收到了你的备忘录
Uh, listen, Bing, I got your memo.

200
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,407
我们要到下周五才看得到报告?
So we're not gonna see the report until next Friday?

201
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:46,240
我这组的人想与家人共度周末的节日
Well, the people in my group want to spend the holiday with family.

202
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,247
我也是有家的人 但我还是会在这儿的
I have a family. I'm gonna be here.

203
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,050
是啊 宾 那是怎么一回事呢?
Yeah, Bing. What's that about?

204
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,206
是要让我的人休息一下 知道吗 振奋一下士气
It's about cutting my people a little slack, you know, for morale.

205
00:12:00,206 --> 00:12:02,757
如果你想看粗略的数字 我星期三前就可以给你
If you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.

206
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,263
粗略数字?
Rough numbers?

207
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,362
这家公司可不是用粗略数字建立的
This company was not built on rough numbers.

208
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:10,218
对吧 道格拉斯先生?
Right, Mr. Douglas?

209
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,684
周二之前把正确的数字放在我的办公桌上
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.

210
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,065
就照你说的办 老板
If you say so, sir.

211
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,818
约瑟夫很棒 是不是?
Joseph's good,isn't he?

212
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,530
好吧 我要杀了你
Well,I'm going to kill you.

213
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,199
嘿 嘿 我只是觉得约瑟夫是喜欢搅和事情的那种人
Hey, hey, I just figured Joseph's the kind of guy who likes to mix it up.

214
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:31,536
你知道 进入状况 搅乱一池春水
You know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.

215
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,083
为什么呢?
Why?

216
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:39,460
听着 我很抱歉 但是 约瑟夫就是这样的人
Look,I'm sorry, but that's what Joseph does.

217
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,750
好吗?如果你想耍什么小聪明
Okay? If you try to pull something...

218
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,842
他会揭发你的
hell call you on it.

219
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,387
他会说 你想耍什么小聪明?
"What are you trying to pull?'he'll say.

220
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,057
噢 胶带
Ooh. Duct tape.

221
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,517
我是不是也应该带点东西来?
Was I supposed to bring something too?

222
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,800
这是给外面那对抓痒双胞胎的
This is for the scratchy twins out there.

223
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,860
我用胶带把烤箱手套黏在他们手上了
I taped oven mitts to their hands.

224
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,483
你还真严厉
You're strict.

225
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,694
是啊 这是为他们好
Yeah. well,it's for their own good.

226
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,613
你知道吗
You know, I like

227
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:10,612
我喜欢你很有效率地把胶带头这样折一下
the way you have efficiently folded this tab under.

228
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,300
要急用胶带时
See, in a tape emergency,

229
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,999
就可以省去好几秒宝贵的时间
you could shave valuable seconds off your time.

230
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,412
没错 
Exactly.

231
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,878
天啊 我很喜欢我现在在你身边可以完全的神经质
God I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now.

232
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,588
跟我说实话
 Tell me the truth.

233
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,300
你不觉得你更喜欢
Dont you like it better that

234
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,925
办公桌上的一切都是垂直摆放的吗?
everything on your desk is perpendicular?

235
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:31,307
如果不是正确的角度 那就是错误的角度
If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.

236
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,559
非常好      谢谢
Very good.        Thank you.

237
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,221
你知道吗? 明天我要调整你的钟
You know what? Tomorrow, I'm gonna do your clocks.

238
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,022
你要怎么调整我的钟?
You're gonna do what to my clocks?

239
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,725
我要设成我的时间
I'm gonna set them to my time.

240
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,563
好吧 我困惑了
Well.I'm confused.

241
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,857
我以为我们的时间都一样呢
I thought we shared time.

242
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:52,033
没有 没有 你看 我把卧室里的钟调快了六分钟
No. no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast.

243
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,195
你想知道为什么吗?
You wanna know why?

244
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:57,834
因为卧室和厨房的时区有点不同?
Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen?

245
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,612
你知道吗?算了 我不要告诉你 
You know what? Forget it.

246
00:13:59,612 --> 00:14:00,791
不 来吧 来吧 告诉我
No, come on, come on, tell me.

247
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,705
不 你不明白      不 说吧
No, you dont understand.        No, come on.

248
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,045
你没有任何这些很可爱的小怪癖
No, you don't have any of these cute obsessive things.

249
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,084
不对 才不是呢 不是这样的
No.that's not true. That is not true.

250
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,252
哦 是吗?      是啊
Oh, yeah?        Yeah.

251
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,092
好 给我讲一个你的怪癖
All right, well, tell me one of yours.

252
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,847
好吧
Okay.

253
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:21,024
我有个怪癖就是 我总是把我的运动袜...
One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks...

254
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,901
和套装袜分开
from my dress socks.

255
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,148
是啊      如果它们混在一起呢?
Yeah.        What if they get mixed up?

256
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,658
天啊 我会...
Boy, I would just, uh...

257
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,489
我会抓狂的
I would freak out.

258
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,371
你才不会
You would not.

259
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,955
我不敢相信 我讨厌这样 你太正常了
I cant believe this. I hate this. You're too normal.

260
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,336
我不敢相信我的男友没有任何怪癖
I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing.

261
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:45,044
我的男朋友没有任何怪癖
My boyfrienddoesn't have a thing.

262
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,460
看 如果有人偷听到 我的名声就完了
See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well there.

263
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,613
道格拉斯先生正在找你
Mr. Douglas is looking for you.

264
00:14:59,613 --> 00:15:02,520
为什么道格拉斯先生要找我?
Why? Why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?

265
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,778
因为他强烈地怀疑 你的贷款项目搞砸了
Because he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.

266
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,231
为什么呢?为什么他要怀疑?
Why? Why does he suspect that?

267
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,784
因为一开始 他以为是约瑟夫...
Because at first, he thought it was Joseph...

268
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:17,863
不过在问过约瑟夫之后 发现其实是你
but after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you.

269
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,873
无论如何 我只是觉得你应该知道      好了 够了
Anyway, I just thought you should know.        All right.That's it.

270
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,503
听着 乔伊...
Look, Joey...

271
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,507
对不起 我知道这是你一生最重要的角色
I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for you...

272
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,009
而且如果我可以开除约瑟夫的话,我会的
and if I could just fire Joseph, I would.

273
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,965
可惜的是那是不可能的
But unfortunately that's not possible.

274
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,472
所以我要把你们俩都炒了
So I'm gonna have to let both of you go.

275
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,929
你说什么呢? 大家都喜欢约瑟夫
What are you talking about? Everybody loves Joseph.

276
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,140
我不喜欢 我恨约瑟夫
I don't. I hate Joseph.

277
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,640
好吧 我认为他是一个拍马屁的烂人
Okay, I think he's a brown-nosing suck-up.

278
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,021
哦 是吗?
Oh, yeah?

279
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,026
你不能开除约瑟夫 你知道为什么吗?
Well, you can't fire Joseph. You know why?

280
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,403
他不在你的部门
He's not in your department.

281
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:58,325
好吧... 所以我不能解雇约瑟夫...
All right, okay.All right,so I can't fire Joseph...

282
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,114
不过我可以和他老婆上床
but, uh, I can sleep with his wife.

283
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,670
不 凯伦      是啊 凯伦
Not Karen.        Yeah, Karen.

284
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,004
我在考虑和她搞婚外情 哦 你知道吗?
I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what?

285
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,964
我刚跟她搞完
I just did.

286
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,464
你对我干了什么好事?
What the hell are you doing to me, man?

287
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,973
哦 不是我干的
Oh,it's not me.

288
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,475
是我的角色
It's my character

289
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,970
钱迪
Chandie.

290
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,353
是啊 这个流氓处理员 专门引诱同事的妻子...
Yeah, the rogue processor who seduces his coworkers' wives for sport...

291
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,438
然后第二天还在饮水机旁当笑话讲
and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler.

292
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:32,105
事实上 她的内裤就在我的抽屉里
In fact I have her panties right there in my drawer.

293
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,695
真的?      不 疯子 她是虚构的!
Really?        No, freak show, she's fictional!

294
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,906
好啦!放轻松
Come on! Take it easy.

295
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,244
如果对你意义如此重大 我...我会去找别的工作
If it means that much to you, I'll, uh-I'll go find something else.

296
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,579
谢谢
Thank you.

297
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,922
只是...我会想念约瑟夫
It's just that I'm gonna miss Joseph.

298
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,047
我喜欢他 他的妻子
I liked him. His wife.

299
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,802
她很火辣
She was hot.

300
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,009
请把这些摘下来 我发誓 我不会抓的
Please take these off. I swear I won't scratch.

301
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,520
不行 对不起 亲爱的 摩妮卡的命令
No, sorry, hon.Monica's orders.

302
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,482

Well that wasn't easy.

303
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,065
好了 晚餐好了
Okay,dinner's on.

304
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,947
有一个桃子派在烤箱里保温
And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven.

305
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:19,201
所以盘子会很烫 不过对你们来说应该不是问题
So the plate's gonna be hot. but that shouldn't be a problem for you.

306
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,655

Bye.        Oh, look, look.

308
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,784
一场低预算的木偶戏
A low-budget puppet show.

309
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,050
真可惜 你看不到我比的中指
It's such a shame you can't see what finger I'm holding up.

310
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,987

Monica.        What's up?

323
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,136
我想到了一个怪癖
I thought of a thing.

324
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,817
是吗?      是啊
 Yeah?        Yeah.

I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.

326
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,493
不 亲爱的 你必须睡在床的那一侧...
No, honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed...

327
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,451
是因为我必须睡在床的这一侧
because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.

328
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,042
还是我让你那样认为的
Or so I would have you believe.

329
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:39,217
不是 有什么大不了的 每个人都有睡某一侧的习惯
No. Big deal. So you have a side of the bed. Everybody has a side of the bed.

330
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:42,629
嘿 别这样 你还没有听我的理由呢
Hey, come on. You haven't heard my reason yet.

All right, go on.        Okay.

332
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,305
我必须睡在西边
I have to sleep on the west side...

333
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,516
因为我是在加州长大的
?because I grew up in California...

334
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,522
否则...
and otherwise...

335
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,981
海洋就会在错的一边了
the ocean would be on the wrong side.

336
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:05,781
哦 我的天 你是一个怪胎      是啊
Oh, my God.You're a freak.        Yeah.

怎么样啊?
How about that?

338
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,248
雷恩 你要潜到哪里去?      我真的不能说
 So, Ryan, where are you shipping off to?        I really can't say.

339
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,664
你们艇上有核武器吗?
So do you have any nuclear weapons onboard?

340
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,582
我不能说
I can't say.

341
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,593
那么 你可以透过潜望镜那种玩意儿看东西吗?
Well, do you get to look through one of those periscope thingies?

342
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,719
对不起 我不能说
I'm sorry, but I can't say.

343
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,848
哇 学习到潜艇的知识真不错
Wow it's neat learning about submarines.

344
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,476
我得走了 不然该错过班机了
I better get out of here. I'm gonna miss my flight.

345
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,852

Bye, Ryan.        Pleasure. Take care.

347
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:44,487
那么你认为我们可以借一套那种制服吗?
So do you, uh, think we could get you one of those uniform things?

348
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,239
你喜欢 对吧?
You like that, do you?

349

哦 是的      让我打几通电话
Oh, yeah.       I'll make some calls.

351
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,117
你能相信我们是这样度过这两星期的吗?
Can you believe that's how we spent our two weeks?

352
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,161
我们一件我计划的浪漫的事都没做
We didn't do the romantic things I'd planned...

353
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:02,003
像是在中央公园野餐 在中央咖啡厅喝咖啡
...like having a picnic in Central Park and, you know, a coffee at Central Perk.

354
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,714

360
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,417

Well, then, uh...

363
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,522

we better make this night count.

364
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,779
哦 等一下 我忘了关卡布其诺咖啡机
Oh, wait, I forgot to turn off the cappuccino machine.

365
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,330

Oh, you know what? I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.

368
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,804
好吧 我何不在楼上等你就好了
All right, why don't I just meet you upstairs?

369
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,178
亲爱的
Honey.
