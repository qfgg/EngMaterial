00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:09,874
嘿 艾迪
Hey, Eddie. Aah!

2
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:15,613
你在这里做什么?      没事 看你睡觉
What are you doing here?        Nothing roomie, just watching you sleep.

3
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:17,343
为什么?
Why?

4
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,363
那让我觉得很平静
It makes me feel, urn, peaceful.

5
00:00:20,363 --> 00:00:21,863
请继续
Ha. ha. Ahem. Please.

6
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,516
我现在没法睡了
I can't sleep now!

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,550
你要我唱歌给你听吗?
Oh, you want me to sing?

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,520
不 听着
No. Look.

9
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:31,027
够了 我要你立刻离开这间公寓
That's it. It's over. I want you out. I want you out of the apartment now!

10
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,280
你在胡说什么?
Oh, what, what, what are you talking about?

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,815
人魔汉尼拔
Hannibal Lecter?

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,238
他比你更适合当室友
Better roommate than you.

13
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:38,753
不
No.

14
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:42,865
我觉得你不公平 某天晚上你看到我被吓到了
See now, I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me, you get scared.

15
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,001
那你没看到我的那些晚上呢?
I mean what about the other nights when you don't see me, huh?

16
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,961
昨晚你起床喝水
What about last night you went and got some water...

17
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,582
我好心躲在门后 那又怎么说?
and I was nice enough to hide behind the door. What's that about, huh?

18
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,169
我不知道
I didn't realize that.

19
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,470
马上滚出去!
Get out now!

20
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,223
好吧 你真的要我滚吗?
Okay. You really want me out?

21
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,474
对 请滚
Yes, please.

22
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,307
我要听你说你要我滚
Then I want to hear you say. I want to hear you say "you want me out".

23
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,766
我要你滚
I want you out.

24
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,647
不不不 我要听你亲口说
No no no. I want to hear it from your lips.

25
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,559
那之前你从哪儿听到的?
Where'd you hear it before?

26
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,820
好吧 你知道么? 就当我已经滚了
Oh, right, all right. You know what pal? Consider me gone.

27
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,316
明天你下班回来会发现我不在了
You know what? I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.

28
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,861
谢谢      我听到了
Thank you.        I heard that.

谢谢      嗨
Thanks.        Hey.

34
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,628
嗨      嗨
Hey.        Hey.

35
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,383
看看你
Well, look at you!

36
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,630
终于把时光机修好了?
Finally got that time machine working, huh?

37
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,487
真的 你们喜欢么?
Seriously, you like it?

38
00:02:22,487 --> 00:02:23,440
有个家伙在卖衣服
This guy was selling them

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,929
在第八大道 然后我就想
on 8th Avenue, and I thought

40
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:28,054
你知道我没有什么吗?      镜子?
You know what I don't have?        A mirror?

41
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,974
好吧 尽管笑吧 我觉得很潇洒
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.

42
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,519
哇 对于一个
Wow! For a guy

43
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:36,895
刚失业的人来说 你的心情真不错
who's recently lost his job, you're in a awfully good mood.

44
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:40,487
我会没事的 我又不是从头开始
Hey I'll be all right. I mean it's not like I'm starting from square one.

45
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:44,115
我是"我们的日子"里的德瑞克雷莫瑞医生
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray on Days of our Lives.

46
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,300
那肯定可以算是一种储备吧
Huh? I mean that's got to have some kind of cachet.

47
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,121
储备? 潇洒?
Cachet? Jaunty?

48
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,207
钱德送我每日一词卫生纸
Chandler gave me word-of-the-day toilet paper

49
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,122
我去买杯咖啡
I'm gonna get some coffee.

50
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,690
嗨      嗨
Hey        Hey.

51
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,678
哦 怎么样? 你看那本书了么?
Oh! So so so, did you read the book?

52
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,089
天啊 太不可思议了
Oh, my God. It was incredible!

53
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,050
对吧 是不是完全说中你的心声了?
Didn't it, like, totally speak to you?

54
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,013
这是什么样的书?
Whoa, whoa, what book is this?

55
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:12,477
瑞秋 你一定要看这本书 书名是"掌握自己的风"
Uh! You have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Wind Keeper

56
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:14,979
是写女人需要拥有更多权力
It's about how women need to become more empowered.

57
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,644
对 但是有风
Yeah and oh! But there's wind.

58
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,073
风让我们成为女神
And the wind can make us goddesses.

59
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,237
你知道谁把我们的风抢走了吗? 
Do you know who takes our wind?

60
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,862
男人 他们就这样拿走了
 Men. They just take it.

61
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,832
男人抢走风了?
Men just take our wind?

62
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,748
一直都是 因为他们是闪电使者
Uh-huh. All the time. Because they are the lightning bearers.

63
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,751
哇噢
Wow.

64
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,785
听起来很酷 有点像霍比特人
That sounds kind of cool, kind of like The Hobbit.

65
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,488
一点都不像霍比特人
It is nothing like The Hobbit.

66
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,972
它像是看穿了我曾经有过的每一段关系
It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had.

67
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,474
理查除外
Except for Richard.

68
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,999
是的 理查绝对不会偷走你的风
Oh, yes. No. Richard would never steal your wind.

69
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:51,223
没错      没错
No.        No.

70
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,810
因为他很可口      没错
Because he's yummy.        Yes.

71
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,144
但其他男人就会
But all the other ones.

72
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,185
嗯 对了 有一段写他们总是
Oh yes. Oh, and the part about how they're always

73
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,270
吸走我们储存的内在力量
drinking from our pool of inner power

74
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,739
但上帝禁止我们使用内在力量
But God forbid we should take a sip.

75
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,108
谁要吃长条糕?
Anybody want a cruller?

76
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:07,699
这是闪电使者的典型做法
Ok, this is a typical lightning bearer thing.

77
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,737
那像是 额
Right there. It's like, urn...

78
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,050
"嗨 谁要吃我的老二形蛋糕"?
"Hello. Who wants one of my phallic shaped man cakes?"

79
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,800
别担心 事情已经发生了
Don't worry about it already! Things happen.

80
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:29,300
所以你不气我被炒鱿鱼?
So you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?

81
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,719
乔伊 看着我
Joey, look at me.

82
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,728
看着我
Look at me!

83
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,896
我的牙齿沾到口红了吗?
Do I have lipstick on my teeth?

84
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:41,982
没有
No.

85
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,613
我们能继续谈我的问题吗?
Uh, can we get back to me?

86
00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:47,735
听着亲 在这一行到处有人被炒鱿鱼
Look, honey. People get fired left and right in this business.

87
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,925
我已经帮你争取到"另一个世界"的试镜
I already got you an audition for Another World.

88
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,497
太棒了
All right!

89
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,242
二号出租车司机?
"Cab Driver Number two?"

90
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,119
不客气
You're welcome.

91
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,297
但我演过德瑞克雷莫端医生
But, but I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

92
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:05,006
我怎么能从神经外科医生变成开出租的?
How can I go from being a neurosurgeon to driving a cab?

93
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,676
世事无常 随遇而安吧
Things change. Roll with them.

94
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,182
但这个角色只有两句台词
But this is a two line part!

95
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,552
这就像是在开倒车
It's like taking a step backwards.

96
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,637
我不要做这个
I'm not gonna do this.

97
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,523
乔伊
Joey.

98
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,651
我要跟你说我跟阿尔明查
I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minza

99
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,188
和他的狗狗金字塔说一样的话
and his pyramid of dogs.

100
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,863
有工作就做 别在地上拉粑粑
Take any job you can get, and don't make on the floor.

101
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,404
对不起
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,247
再见
I'll see you.

103
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,875
天啊
Uh, God!

104
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,462
天啊 我是说它真的
Oh, God! I mean it's just so...

105
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,921
对吧?
Isn't it?

106
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,258
这像是在看我自己的一生
Uh. This is like reading about my own life!

107
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:49,255
这本书应该叫"掌握自己的风 瑞秋"
I mean this book could have been called Be Your Own Wind Keeper Rachel!

108
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,139
我觉得虽然不会卖一百万本
I don't think it would have sold a million copies

109
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,513
但那会是送你的很不错的礼物
but it would've made a nice gift for you.

110
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,220
大家好      嘿
Hey, you guys.        Hey.

111
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,139
亲爱的 我们该走了
Uh, sweetie, we've gotta go.

112
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,397
不
No!

113
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,735
不?
No? Heh.

114
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:08,774
不 为什么我们总是得照你的时间表来做事?
No! Why do we always have to do everything according to your timetable?

115
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:12,240
事实上 是按照电影院的时间表
Actually, it's the movie theater that has the timetable.

116
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,155
这样你才不会错过开头
It's so you don't miss the beginning.

117
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:22,190
不 这跟电影院无关 这是关于你偷走了我的风
No. See, this isn't about the movie theater. This is about you stealing my wind.

118
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,006
加油 姑娘
You go, girl!

119
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,136
我说得不好 对吧?
I can't pull that off, can I?

120
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,925
对不起 你的风?
Excuse me, your, your, your wind?

121
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,593
对 我的风
Yes, my wind.

122
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:40,300
你不让我吹又怎么能期待长大(变大)?
How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?

123
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,901
你知道我...
You know I don't have...

124
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,701
不会反对那个
have a problem with that.

125
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,210
好吧
Okay.

126
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:08,425
现在我只是需要独处一下
I just, I just really need to be with myself right now.

127
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,589
对不起
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:15,237
嗯嗯嗯?      哦对 我不必道歉
Mm, mm. mm.        Uh, you're right. I don't have to apologize.

129
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,675
抱歉 该死
Sorry. Damn it!

130
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,483
那是什么?      我不知道
What is it?        I, I don't know.

131
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,524
里面都是一些关于风和树
It's got all this stuff about wind and trees...

132
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,800
还有圣池
and there's some kind of sacred pool in it.

133
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,741
我不是很看得懂 但她似乎非常生气
I mean I don't really get it. But she's, she's pretty upset about it.

134
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,745
看 这就是为什么我不和看书的女人约会
See? This is why I don't date women who read.

135
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,538
额哦
Uh-oh.

136
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,040
什么? 那是什么?
What? What's that?

137
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,368
我的信用卡帐单
It's my VISA bill.

138
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,871
两封里的第一封
Envelope one of two.

139
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,751
一定不会是好事      打开 打开
That can't be good.        Open it, open it.

140
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:54,842
天啊
Oh, my God!

141
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,641
看看这个 我怎么会花这么多钱?
Look at this! How did I spend so much money?

142
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,600
乔伊 那是最低应缴额度 总额在那边
Uh, Joey, that's just the minimum amount due. That's your total due.

143
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:09,186
在原野瓷器花了3500?
Whoa, whoa. 3500 dollars at "Porcelain Safari"?

144
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,778
我的动物们
My animals.

145
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:16,026
店员说它们很适合我 他说话带口音 我被迷惑了
Hey the guy said they suited me. He spoke with an accent. I was all confused.

146
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,661
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do!

147
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,827
我想你可以从在"另一个世界"开出租车开始
Well I guess you can start by driving a cab on Another World.

148
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,791
什么?      那个试镜?
What?        That audition?

149
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,751
那是只有两句台词的角色
That's a two line part!

150
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:30,086
乔伊 你欠"我爱树脂"1100块
Joey, you owe $1100 at "I Love Lucite".

151
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,626
那又怎么样?      接受吧
So what?        So suck it up, man.

152
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,385
那是工作 可以赚钱
It's a job. It's money.

153
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:38,424
我不需要你变得爱批评 高傲又爱卖弄学问
Hey! I don't need you getting all judgmental and condescending and pedantic.

154
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,014
卫生纸?      嗯
Toilet paper?        Yeah.

155
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,894
我不是那样的人 我只是比较现实
Look I'm not being any of those things. Okay? I'm being realistic.

156
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,980
别说了 你是我的朋友才对      我是你的朋友
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend!        I am your friend.

157
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,113
那你该跟我说些像"乔伊 你会没事的"
Then tell me things like, "Joey, you'll be fine."

158
00:08:53,113 --> 00:08:55,987
"坚持住" "你一定会出头的 我知道"
"Hang in there" and, and  "Something big's gonna come along. I know it!"

159
00:08:55,987 --> 00:08:57,158
但我不知道
But I don't know it.

160
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,363
我只知道你欠"缤纷世界"2300块
What I do know is that you owe $2300 at "Isn't It Chromantic"

161
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,282
罗斯 我知道我欠了多少钱
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.

162
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:08,295
那就理智点 你花了十年才得到那份工作
Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job.

163
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,332
下份工作又得等多久呢?      现在我不想听这些
Who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another?        Look I don't want to hear this right now

164
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,589
我只是说...
I'm just saying...

165
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,918
别"只是说"!
Well, don't "just say"!

166
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,846
或许我该走了
Oh. You know, maybe, maybe I should just go.

167
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,300
好吧
Okay.

168
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:23,389
好的 再见
Ok, I'll see you later

169
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,309
考虑一下 好么?
Just think about it, okay?

170
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,397
我不需要考虑
I don't need to think about it!

171
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,858
我是德瑞克雷莫瑞医生
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

172
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,898
那是重要角色
That was huge!

173
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,610
我的大好机会一定会出现 等着瞧吧
Big things are gonna happen! You'll see!

174
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:36,905
罗斯
Ross!

175
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,942
你还在吗?
You still there?

176
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,917
嘿 朋友      哦 天啊
Hey, pal.        Oh, God!

177
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,834
艾迪 你还在这做什么?
Eddie, what are you still doing here?

178
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,970
就是给一些水果蔬菜脱水
Uh, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables.

179
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,677
天啊 这真的太棒了
Man alive, this thing's fantastic!

180
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,759
艾迪  你是不是忘了什么?
Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?

181
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,099
哦对 我给我们买了新的金鱼
Oh, yeah. That's right. Look, I got us a new goldfish.

182
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,226
他比上一只金鱼有活力多了
He's a lot feistier than the last one.

183
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,517
或许因为上一只金鱼是培珀莉饼干做的
Maybe because the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm.

184
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,739
艾迪 现在是不是还有其他什么事你忘了做?
Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?

185
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,400
不 除非它跟脱水有关
Wll, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man

186
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,411
因为现在我是脱水疯子
because right now, I'm a dehydrating maniac!

187
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,488
你必须得帮帮我 
Look you have to help me out here.

188
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:29,705
我以为我们说好了 我以为我回来时
I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time I got

189
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,994
你知道这是什么吗?
You know what that is?

190
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,496
你前室友的肾脏?
Your last roommate's kidney?

191
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,666
这是蕃茄
That's a tomato. Ha, ha.

192
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:40,011
这个一定要拿出来展示
This one definitely goes in the display.

193
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,769
阿甘 我要外带一杯柠檬汁
Hey, Gunther, let me get a, uh, lemonade to go.

194
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,353
柠檬汁?
Lemonade?

195
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,064
你没事吧?
You okay, man?

196
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,566
只是事业遇到点问题
Ahh, it's career stuff

197
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,486
我不知道你听说没 他们杀死了我的角色
I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.

198
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,402
那太可惜了 他们怎么做的?
Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?

199
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,866
我从电梯里掉下去了
I fell down an elevator shaft.

200
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:07,868
那真的很逊
Oh. That sucks.

201
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,741
我在雪崩时被埋了
I was buried in an avalanche.

202
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,372
什么?
What?

203
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,129
我演过"我的孩子们"里的布莱斯
I used to be Brice on All My Children.

204
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,732
为什么大家都要看我睡觉?
Why must everybody watch me sleep?

205
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,614
不准再看我睡觉了 不准!
There'll be no more watching me sleep! No more!

206
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,861
再看!      我...
watching!        I...

207
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,709
来看看 我有一些好东西要脱水 葡萄 杏桃
Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate. I got some grapes, got some apricots

208
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,417
我觉得看这些水球会变成什么样子很酷
I thought it'd be cool to see what happens with these water balloons.

209
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,674
滚出去 出去出去出去...!
Get out. Get out, get out, get out...!

210
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,919

What?        You! Move out!

211
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:07,265
带着你的水果 愚蠢的小水果 滚出去!
Take your fruit! Your stupid small fruit and get out!

212
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,426
你要我搬走?
You want me to move out? Uh...

213
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,139
嗯哼
Uh-huh.

214
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,692
额 我
Heh. I, uh-Ooh!

215
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:23,206
我得说 你不觉得那有点突然 你不觉得么?
Ha, ha. I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kind of out of the blue, I mean don't you think?

216
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,199
这一点都不突然
This is not out of the blue!

217
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,816
这完全不突然!
This is smack dab in the middle of the blue!

218
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,412
哇哦!
Whoa!

219
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,080
淡定 别激动 兄弟
Relax! Take it easy, buddy!

220
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,075
你不必告诉我第二次 你想我走? 好吧
You don't have to tell me twice. You want me to go? Alright, alright

221
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,712
我会回来拿我的东西
guess I'll be back for my stuff.

222
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:46,753
如果你以为我会让你跟我的鱼独处 你就疯了
But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!

223
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,597
需要我帮忙吗?
You want some help?

224
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,679
我不需要帮忙 朋友
No help required, chico!

225
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,737
一路到机场? 那超过三十里远了
All the way to the airport, huh? You know, that's over 30 miles.

226
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:06,240
那得花你不少钱
That's gonna cost you about "so" bucks.

227
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,652
对不起 应该是五十块
Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.

228
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,823
什么?      五十块
What?        Five-O dollars.

229
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,425
哦 你知道是怎么回事么? 
Oh. You know what it is?

230
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:17,706
传真过来的剧本字有点模糊
It's smudgy because they're fax pages.

231
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,876
我在"我们的日子"演德瑞克雷莫瑞医生时
When I was on Days of our Lives as Dr. Drake Ramoray...

232
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,769
他们会打印整个剧本寄给我
they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.

233
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:27,427
那真的太棒了
Ha, ha. That's great.

234
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:32,613
如果你要加戏 比如出租车发生车祸
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or something

235
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:34,050
我可以治疗乘客
I could attend to the victims

236
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,517
因为我有演医生的背景
because I have a background in medical acting.

237
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,269
好吧 听着 谢谢你来试镜
Okay, listen, thanks for coming in.

238
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:43,653
不不 别谢我来试镜 至少让我演完先
No no. Uh, don't thank me for coming in. Uh, at least let me finish.

239
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,394
我们可以走高速
Uh, we could take the expressway

240
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:53,656
但这时你最好超预算
but, uh, this time of day you're better off taking the "budge".

241
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,536
应该是要过桥才对吧?
You were going for the word bridge there, weren't you?

242
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,288
祝我今天愉快
I'll have a good day.

243

"Have you ever allowed a lightning bearer to take your wind?"

245
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,267
我要回答"没有"
I would have to say no.

246
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,518
那我要说"胡扯"
And I would have to say, "Pah, ha"

247
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,645
什么?
What?

248
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,559
你不记得布偶男了吗?
Do you not remember the puppet guy?

249
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:28,732
你根本就是让他在你的内在力量池里洗脚
Yeah, you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.

250
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,984
还有他的布偶
And his puppet too!

251
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,370
好吧 至少我没有让男人
Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy

252
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,316

00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,862
瑞秋 你知道瓶口完全是指向我
Oh come on Rachel, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.

264
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,778
那是因为你占了一半的圈子
Only because you took up half the circle!

265
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,618
看看你们两个 真是可悲
Listen to you two. It's so sad.

266
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,713
看起来我得一个人参加女神会议了
Looks like I'll be going to the goddess meetings alone.

267
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,713
你休想 当她们发现你和杰森赫利上床
Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley

268
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,629
就在他和摩妮卡分手一个小时后
an hour after he broke up with Monica.

269
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,090
一小时?
One hour?

270
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,181
你真会挑拨离间! 哦!
You are such a leaf blower! Oh!

271
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,851
哦!
Ugh!

272
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,142
哦!
Ugh!

273
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:58,533
小心3D的"最后的晚餐" 犹大有点松了
Oh, hey, uh, be careful with that 3D Last Supper. Judas is a little loose.

274
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,790
天啊 发生了什么事?
Oh, my God! What's going on?

275
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:09,249
他们要把我的东西都收回去 我想你说得对
They're taking all my stuff back. I guess you were right.

276
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,590
不 我错了 所以我来找你
No, look I wasn't right. That's what I came here to tell you.

277
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:17,265
那天我满脑子只想着自己的事
I was totally hung up on my own stuff the other day.

278
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:21,178
不 听着 我是那种需要安全感的人 知道么
No listen. I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, you know?

279
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:25,773
知道下一笔收入在哪里 但你不需要那样
To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from. But you, you don't need that.

280
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,729
那真的让我很佩服
And that's amazing to me.

281
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,236
我永远都没办法跟你一样 乔伊
I could never do what you do, Joey.

282
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,906
谢谢 罗斯      你得为更好的机会坚持住
Thanks Ross.        Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger

283
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,192
我无法告诉你我多么尊重
I can't tell you how much respect I have

284
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,074
你不去参加那个愚蠢的出租车司机试镜
for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.

285
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,163
我去了      太棒了 结果如何?
I went.        Great! How did it go?

286
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,699
我没拿到角色      你是好样的!
I didn't get it.        Good for you!

287
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,118
什么?      你在实现梦想
What?        You're living the dream!

288
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,794
啊?      
Huh?

289
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,829
好吧
All right, then!

290
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,923
哦 别拿走我的鹦鹉      什么?
Oh, not my parrot.        What?

291
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,923
我看不下去了
I can't watch this.

292
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,630
等一下 等等
Hey, hold on, hold on.

293
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:01,889
多少钱 那只鸟要多少钱?
How much for the, uh...? How much to save the bird?

294
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,936
1200      美金?
Twelve hundred.        Dollars?

295
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,897
你花1200块买只塑料的鸟?
You spent $1200 on a plastic bird?

296
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,064
那是一时冲动买的 它就在收银台附近
Uh, it was an impulse buy. Near the register.

297
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,979
走吧 把鸟拿走吧
Go aheah. Go ahead with the bird.

298
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:16,483
有没有200左右的东西?
It's ok. Do you have anything for around $200?

299
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,364
那只狗
The dog.

300
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,704
那个?      对
Huh?        Yeah.

301
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:24,786
我买了
I'll take it.

302
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,705
这是我送你的礼物
My gift to you, man.

303
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,379
谢谢你 罗斯
Thanks, Ross!

304
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,673
但我真的喜欢那只鸟
I really liked that bird, though.

305
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,967
不过狗也可以      对吧?
But the dog! Oh!        Yeah. Right?

306
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,803
这是你们的蛋糕
Here are your cakes.

307
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,313
我们没有点蛋糕
We didn't order cake.

308
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,607
对 我知道 我请客
No, I know. Ahem. They're from me.

309
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,148
姑娘们 这不是件好事
Look you guys, this is not good.

310
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,855
男人偷走我们的风已经够麻烦了
I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind

311
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,157
我们不该彼此对立
without taking it from each other

312
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,196
你说的对      你知道吗?
You're right.        You know?

313
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,658
我爱你们这些女神
I love you goddesses.

314
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,244
我爱你们
I love you.

315
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,166
我不想再抢你的风了
I don't ever want to suck your wind again.

316
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,300
谢谢 那我们没事了吧?      我们和好了
Thank you. So are we good?        Oh. We're good.

317
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,709
我们没事了吧?      是的
We're good?        Yes.

318
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:16,467
好吧 我得把蛋糕收回去 他们会扣我的薪水
Okay. Let me take these cakes back. Because they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.

319
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,676
叮咚 那个疯子走了
Ding dong, the psycho's gone!

320
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,933
这次你确定吗?      是的
Are you sure this time?        Yes.

321
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,018
是的 我确实看到他离开了
Yes, I actually saw him leave.

322
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,362
那家伙站在窗户那 拿着一颗人头
I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head.

323
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,440
他在拿着一个人头!
He's standing in the window holding a human head!

324
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,985
看看 兄弟
Check it out, man!

325
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,326
我在梅西百货后面的巷子里从假人身上拔下来的
I tore it off a mannequin in the alley behind Macy's. Ha, ha.

326
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,861
梅西百货后面没有巷子
There is no alley behind Macy's.

327
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,531
我在少女部偷来的 有区别么
So I got it in the junior miss department. Big diff

328
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,800
无论如何 
Anyway check it out man.

329
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,455
这样我们下次办鸡尾酒会就有得聊了 兄弟
It's gonna make a hell of a conversation piece at our next cocktail party, huh pal?

330
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,541
我们下一次办鸡尾酒会?
Our next cocktail party?

331
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:56,958
对 我们可以把薯片放进去 让它变成薯片姑娘
Yeah, you know, we'll put chips in it. We'll make it a chip chick.

332
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,380
艾迪 你记得昨天吗?
Eddie, do you remember yesterday?

333
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,674
对 我依稀还记得
Uh, yes, I think I vaguely recall it.

334
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:12,891
你记得昨天你跟我说话吗?
Ahem. Do you remember talking to me yesterday?

335
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,771
对
Uh, yes.

336
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,652
发生了什么事?
So, what happened?

337
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,862
我们开车到拉斯维加斯
We took a road trip to Las Vegas man!

338
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,948
天啊
Oh sweet Moses

339
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,156
拉斯维加斯旅行 那你们有赢钱么?
So on this road trip, uh, did you win any money?

340
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,577
我输光了 但21点先生 他手气可好了
Nah, I crapped out. But Mr 21 over here! He cleans up!

341
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,816
三百块 他还买了双新鞋送我 体贴吧
$300! Check it out. He buys me these new shoes. Sweet. huh?

342
00:19:35,816 --> 00:19:36,737
太棒了
Nice.

343
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,045
楼上见 大家再见

有人开始喜欢他了吗?
Is anyone else starting to really like him?

345
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,362
有什么能帮你么?
May I help you?

346
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,327
为什么我的钥匙不能用? 我的东西为什么在楼下?
Why doesn't my key work, and what's my stuff doing downstairs?

347
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,409
对不起
I'm sorry. Aah.

348
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,290
我们认识吗?
Have we met?

349
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,790
我是艾迪 变态 你的室友
It's Eddie, you freak! Your roommate.

350
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,380
对不起
I'm sorry, I, uh...

351
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,379
我已经有室友了
I already have a roommate.

352
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:27,723
你好
Hello.

353
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,940
他住在这里很多年了 我不知道你到底在说什么
Urn, he's lived here for years. I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man.

354
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,975
不不 他是 额
No, no. He's, uh...

355
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:42,238
不 他搬出去了 我搬进来
No, he, he moved out and I moved in.

356
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,992
我想我们会记得那种事
Well, I think we'd remember something like that.

357
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,910
我知道我会记得
I know I would. Ha, ha.

358
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,365
有点道理 额
That's, uh, a good point. Urn...

359
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,040
好吧
Okay, wow. Huh.

360
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,494
我想我走错公寓了
I guess I got the wrong apartment.

361
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,501
听着 我...
Look, I'm

362
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,007

I am terribly sorry.        Hey, no problem.

363
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,379
再见
See you.

364
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:13,219
再见 脱水水果变态狂
Goodbye, you fruit drying psychopath.

365
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,300
要我帮你把东西拿出来吗? 
You want me to help you unpack stuff?

366
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,940
不用了 我自己可以
Nah, I'm okay. Oh, and, uh...

367
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,482
你知道 我搬回来不是因为我走投无路
Just so you know, I'm not moving back in because I have to.

368
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,405
我的确走投无路 可是...
I mean, I do have to, but...

369
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,776
只是因为那个地方不是...
It's just that that place wasn't really...

370
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,778
这是...
I mean this is...

371
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,702
欢迎回家 兄弟
Welcome home, man.

372
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,634
玩一下足球台?      当然
A little foos?        Absolutely!

373
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,051
足球怎么了?
What happened to the foosball?

374
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,178
那是哈蜜瓜
It's a cantaloupe.

375
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,232
每次罗斯过来我们都得把这个搬出来么?
Hey look, are we gonna bring this out every time Ross comes over?

376
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,643
他付了很多钱买下它的
He paid a lot of money for it.

377
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,030
我要换个方向拿      好的
I'm gonna hold him a different way.        All right.

378
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,952
我不理解 如果你那么讨厌它 开始为什么要买它?
I don't understand. If you hated it so much, why'd you buy it in the first place?

379
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,044
我有一个瓷器动物园在那里
Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing going over there.

380
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:23,113
但现在少了其他的动物 看起来怪怪的
But now without the other ones, it just looks tacky.

381
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:27,214
它会用马桶还是会到处留下瓷器粑粑?
Is he house trained or will he leave little bathroom tiles all over place?

382
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,215
别动
Stay.

383
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,051
别动
Uh, stay!

384
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,425
好乖的假狗狗
Good fake dog.

385
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:55,456
