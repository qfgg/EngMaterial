Which is what you should be doing instead of playing dress-up.

121
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,100
是  是  老信长官

All right, hold on!

146
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,070
该去偷点早餐了
Time to steal some breakfast.

147
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,780
你好  狗狗  回头见
Hey, there, sonny boy. See you around.

148
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,720
你好啊
Hello!

149
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,400
啧  简直唾手可得
Pfft, this is too easy.

150
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,690
你好
Hello.

151
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,160
-你胆子真大  -女士
- How dare you! - Ma'am!

152
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,450
你妈的脸都给你丢光了
Your mother would be ashamed of you!

153
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,210
女士
Ma'am!

154
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,380
要不是这么饿我肯定会感到愧疚
I'd feel bad if I wasn't so hungry.

155
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,700
我猜猜  被装在盒子里遗弃在路边
Let me guess, left in a box by the side of the road?

156
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,780
这一套我都听烦了  走开
You know what? I've heard it before, so beat it.

157
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,940
-你们要自己去找午餐  -我饿了
- You gotta earn your lunch. - I hungry.

158
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,660
你的声音不可能这么萌
There is no way your voice is that cute.

159
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,870
-别装了  好好说  -求你了
- What's your real voice? - Please?

160
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,150
你本来就这声音
That's your voice?

161
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,240
好吧  算了  行
All right, you know what? Fine.

162
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,550
我不吃这一套  但我尊重你们的努力
Look, I'm not buying the hustle, but I respect the effort.

163
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,300
记住我这话  大概六个月后
But take it from me, in about six months,

164
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,330
等你们变声了  这招就不管用了
that voice is gonna drop and the bit's dead.

165
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,710
得来全不费功夫啊
That was too easy.

166
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,500
{\an8}药店

167
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,030
不  我最喜欢的捕狗人
Oh, no. My favorite dog catcher.

168
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,990
这镇上又不是只有我一条狗
There are other dogs in this town, you know.

169
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,390
看这边
Hey! Over here!

170
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,530
佩吉和牛头在这边  想跟你谈谈
It's Peg and Bull. Wanna talk to ya.

171
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,600
{\an8}流浪狗收容所

172
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,820
老天  只要我装作没看见  也许就...
Oh, man! Maybe if I just act like I don't see them...

173
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,830
别装作没看见我们似的
Don't act like you don't see us.

174
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,530
救命  我们被抓了
Help! We got caught!

175
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,470
{\an7}警告
没有许可证的狗
要被立即抓进收容所
市政府指示

176
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,260
日安  先生  我只是来贴告示  无需紧张
Good day, sir. Just posting bills. No need for alarm.

177
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,760
我已把这附近的危险动物清理干净了
I already cleared this block of dangerous animals.

178
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,270
但我还在找一条狡猾的流浪狗
But I'm still looking for a cunning street dog.

179
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:53,290
-我能把这个贴在你窗户上吗  -不行
- May I hang this on your window? - No, you cannot.

180
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,920
-帮我一下又不花钱  -不行
- There's no charge for helping me. - No.

181
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,860
它有魔鬼般的眼睛  鲨鱼般的牙齿
He has demon eyes and teeth like a shark.

182
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,700
你说的还是狗吗
You still talking about a dog?

183
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,200
说吧  怎么回事
All right, what happened?

184
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,950
-我们打劫了肉铺  -又去了
- We robbed the butcher shop. - Again?

185
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,910
牛头吃了三公斤牛肉
Bull ate seven pounds of beef,

186
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,790
四块羊排  还有一整条烘肉卷
four lamb chops, and a whole meatloaf.

187
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,880
-我吐得天翻地覆  -没错
- I threw up everywhere. - Yeah.

188
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,750
我生命中最辉煌的一天
Best day of my life!

189
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,760
老天  跟你说过多少次了  肉铺只能单干
God, I keep telling ya the butcher's shop's a one-man-job.

190
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,380
如果你们不学会分头行动  总是会被抓到
You're always gonna get caught if you don't learn to split up!

191
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,840
你疯了吗
Are you mad?

192
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,890
我们宁愿被关在一起  也不愿独自在街头流浪
We'd rather be locked up together, than out on the streets alone.

193
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,710
独自  你说的是自由吧
Alone? Uh, I think you mean free?

194
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,390
瞧  你俩关在一起
See, while you're locked up together,

195
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,440
我自由自在  无牵无挂
I'm free to be myself, and I'm free to be by myself.

196
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,980
-是是是  知道了  -你天天挂在嘴上
- Yeah, yeah, we know. - Ya say it all the time.

197
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,740
既然你这么自由自在  那就把我们放出来吧
Since you feel so free, feel free to bust us outta here.

198
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,740
不不不  你们不明白
Oh, no, no, no. You guys don't understand.

199
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,960
我不能再惹这家伙了
I can't mess with this guy again.

200
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,660
但你喜欢把他耍得团团转
But ya love makin' him look like a fool.

201
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,680
抱歉  我帮不了你们了
I'm sorry, guys, you're on your own.

202
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,370
你可以的  把门砸了  砸门
You can do it. Just bust. Bust. Bust.

203
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,790
砸门  砸门  砸门
Bust. Bust. Bust. Bust.

204
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,010
好吧  我帮  别叫了
Okay! I'll do it. Stop yelling.

205
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,330
棒耶  他要帮我们了
Yeah! He's gonna do it.

206
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,700
-他要帮我们了  佩吉  -别叫  嘘  他过来了
- Yeah! He'll do it, Peg. - No... Shh! He's coming over.

207
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,660
我有点难受
I don't feel so good.

208
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,750
-他在做什么  -别问我  我什么也看不见
- What's he doin'? - Don't ask me. I can't see anything.

209
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,920
是什么
What is that?

210
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,890
瞧瞧看  送上门来了
Well, well, well, just the dog I was looking for.

211
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,240
你怎么了  病了
What are you, sick?

212
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,120
不  他病了  吐出来
Oh, no, he's sick. Just throw up.

213
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,080
再吃下去你就好了
You'll feel much better once you eat it.

214
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,140
我抓到你了
I got you.

215
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,860
他们绝对想不到我会抓到你
They never thought I'd get ya.

216
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,700
又耍我
Not again!

217
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,840
够了  我要放弃这种犯罪生活
That's it. I'm giving up the life of crime.

218
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,930
我们也可以回屠夫那里去
Or we can go back to the butcher.

219
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,220
说起来我又饿了
I could eat. Yeah.

220

Are you two, uh, twins?

223
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,630
我是她丈夫  伙计

是啊
Yeah.

232
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,360
不是该带我去散步了吗

看看我买的这双靴子多美

00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,570
我不知道你要来
I didn't know you were coming.

236
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:56,160
到时候将会有尖叫  嚎哭  呕吐

-谢谢  -不客气

244
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,890
-真可爱  -你喜欢吗

245
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,420
天啊  她肯定穿不下

251
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,440
-你不该这么客气的  -我知道

是的  是原版的锡釉彩陶
Yes, it's an original Majolica.

It's gonna do wonders for this room

254

- This is priceless! - Down, down!

258
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,630
不行  坏狗狗
No! Bad dog!

259
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,050
这狗该教训了
That dog needs to be trained.

260
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,340
它平时很乖的
She's, uh, normally really good.

261
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,590
你说的是猫吧
I think you're thinking of cats.

262
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,700
不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

263
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,020

We're stopping? Ugh. Some getaway driver you are.

264
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,190
好吧  我在这下车了
All right, I'll hop out here.

265
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,660
势利山庄啊
Snob hill.

266
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,830
天  那家伙对我还真执着
Oh, my gosh! This guy's obsessed with me.

267
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,880
好吧  我得低调一阵子
All right, I gotta lay low for a while.

268
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,510
坏狗狗
"Bad dog"?

269
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,100
我做错什么了
What did I do wrong?

270
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,610
老信
Hey, Trusty!

271

发生了一些很奇怪的事
Something strange is going on,

274
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,370
我真的需要跟朋友倾诉一下
and I really need to talk to a friend.

275
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,340
那些人都挤在屋子里
All these people are in the house,

276
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,640
有很多玩具  但都不是给我的
there's a bunch of toys, none of them are for me.

277
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,220
他们从今早到现在还没有给我梳毛
I haven't even been brushed since this morning.

278
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,670
我都快打结了
I'm getting tangly.

279
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,350
而且我的午后零食居然是凉的  凉的
And my afternoon snack was cold. Cold!

280
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,460
天  听起来真糟
Oh, boy. Sounds rough.

281
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,100
我都不记得达令上次给我揉肚子
And, I can't even remember the last time

282
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,820
是什么时候的事了
that Darling gave me a belly rub.

283
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,940
说到肚子  达令的肚子变得真的很大
Speaking of bellies, Darling's tummy is getting really big.

284
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,470
肯定是吃太多零食胀气了  我们都经历过
I'm pretty sure it's gas, too many treats. We've all been there.

285
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,270
而吉姆  我说不好  他看起来很正常
And Jim Dear, I don't know, he seems normal but...

286
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:45,560
可你知道吗  我总在他身上闻到恐惧的气味
You know what? I smell fear on him all the time.

287
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,540
所以我猜他并不那么正常
So, I guess that's not that normal.

288
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,860
-我不知道  -是啊  听起来真糟
- I don't know. - Yeah, that sounds bad.

289
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,990
你的声音
You sound...

290
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,920
你...你不是老信
Hey, you're... You're not Trusty.

291
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,380
-对  可你...  -我刚说的你都听到了
- Correct. But, you... - Did you just hear everything that I said?

292
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,040
-是的  -你的项圈呢
- Yes. - Where is your collar?

293
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,900
-说来话长  -老信呢
- Yeah, long story. - Where is Trusty?

294
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,150
老信  他肯定在哪里
Trusty, I'm sure, is somewhere.

295
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,610
-你在这里做什么  -老信
- What are you doing in there? - Trusty?

296
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,740
-快走开  -老信
- Get out of here! - Trusty?

297
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,740
我家主人就在里面  我要叫他们来
Hey, my people are inside, I'm goona warn them.

298
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,970
什么  不  别这样
What? No, no. Hey.

299
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,810
别叫人类过来  好吗
Let's not warn the people, okay?

300
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,520
我也想离开  可现在不行
Now, I would get out of here but I can't,

301
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,870
我不是来惹麻烦的
and I'm not here to make trouble,

302
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,660
我才是遇到麻烦的那个  你可以帮我
I'm the one in trouble and you could help me out here.

303
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,660
-我要叫了  -不  拜托  我可以解释
- I'm gonna bark. - No, please just... I can explain.

304
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,530
-稍等片刻  我过来  -来这里
- Just gimme a second. I'm comin' over. - Here?

305
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,030
你以为你在干什么
What do you think you're doing?

306
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,760
-我要叫了  -不  拜托别叫
- Hey! I'm gonna bark. - No. Please, do not do that!

307
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,510
-我要叫了  -千万别
- I'm gonna bark. - Absolutely do not do that.

308
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,160
别  嘘  别叫了
Stop. Hey, hey! Shh! Stop it!

309
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,540
别指挥我该怎么做
Don't tell me what to do.

310
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:45,840
怎么回事
What?

311
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,760
等等  别叫了
Wait... Hang on!

312
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,230
好吧  你知道吗
All right. You know what?

313
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,110
我听到你刚才说的那些了  你没有反应过度
I heard what you said back there and you're not overreacting.

314
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,150
拜托  求你了
Come on. Please, please!

315
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,360
听着  如果你安静点
Look, if you keep it down,

316
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,270
我就告诉你关于那个宝宝的真相
I will tell you the truth about that baby!

317
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,360
那个什么
That... What?

318
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,280
糟糕
Oh, man!

319
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,660
没事吧  淑女
Everything all right, Lady?

320
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,960
是你的狗在叫吗
That your dog barking?

321
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,040
-什么  -是你的狗在叫吗
- What? - That your dog barking?

322
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,420
是的  它是我的狗
Yeah. She's mine.

323
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,050
还看到什么了吗
Seen anything else?

324
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,550
我在找这附近一个很危险的动物
I'm looking for a dangerous animal around here.

325
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,430
是有熊吗
Like a bear?

326
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,390
更糟  一条流浪狗
Worse, a stray dog.

327
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,470
灰色的公狗  有半米多长
Grey male, about two-foot four.

328
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,480
-浑身生疮  肮脏不堪  非常危险  -拜托  不要
- Mangy, dirty, dangerous. - Please, don't.

329
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,270
你是在朝流浪狗叫吗  淑女
You barking at a stray, Lady?

330
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,030
求你了
I'm begging you.

331
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,530
好吧
Fine.

332
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,450
看起来没什么事
Everything seems to be fine.

333
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:55,200
你确定吗  它浑身生疮  肮脏不堪
You sure now? He's mangy, and dirty...

334
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,140
-非常危险  -非常危险
- And dangerous? - Dangerous.

335
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,290
好吧
Yes, right.

336
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,760
说起来  我们这里最近
Actually, you know, we've been having

337
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,790
一直有点闹老鼠
a bit of a rat problem, recently.

338
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,800
老鼠
A rodent?

339
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,890
它会跑进院子里
He's been getting into the yard,

340
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,420
破坏我们的食物之类的
and spoiling our food, things like that.

341
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,590
领居们也遇到了
The neighbors too.

342
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,360
我不碰害兽  它们身上有病菌
I don't associate myself with vermin. They carry disease.

343
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,810
也对  好吧
Ah, right. Well...

344
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,350
那...谢谢了
Then, um... Then thank you.

345
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:19,730
谢你
For...

346
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,770
不管这算什么
Whatever this was.

347
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,570
尽职尽责
Commitment.

348
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,400
好吧
Okay.

349
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,110
天
Oh, my!

350
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,350
谢了  不能说是愉快的经历  再见
Thanks. Well, can't say it's been fun. Bye!

351
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,720
别急  你刚才说的是什么意思  关于宝宝
Not so fast. What did you mean back there, about the baby?

352
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,300
现在你想让我帮忙了
So now you want my help?

353
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,720
你想让我继续叫吗
Do you want me to bark again?

354
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,640
好吧  我该怎么说呢
Oh, fine. How can I put this?

355
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,060
你是你主人世界的中心  对吧
You're the center of your people's universe, right?

356
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,410
-可以这么说  -他们让你用浴盆  给你抹香波
- You could say that. - They shampoo you in the bathtub,

357
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,660
-让你睡在他们的床上  -你是说我们的床吗
- let you sleep in the bed? - You mean, our bed?

358
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,250
给你在这里建了个这么大的厕所
Build you this 40/40 bathroom right here?

359
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,450
恶心  我会在散步时解决
Gross. I have walks for that.

360
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,860
-好吧  那一切现在基本都结束了  -什么
- Well, that's basically all over now. - What?

361
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,320
你就要被取代了
You're about to be replaced.

362
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,620
-被取代  我  -对
- Replaced? Me? - Yeah.

363
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,760
我不这么认为  你可以走了
I don't think so. You can leave.

364
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,920
淑女  你还好吗
Lady! Are you okay?

365
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,340
-离她远点  杂种狗  -那是啥玩意
- Stay back, mongrel! - What is that?

366
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,630
我马上过去  我要报警了
I'll be right over. I'm callin' the cops!

367
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,680
你现在可以走了
I think you can be on your way now.

368
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,680
谢谢你的帮忙
Thanks for your help.

369
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,430
是你请我帮忙的
Whoa! You asked for my help.

370
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:41,310
听着  这话你可能不想听  但我了解人类
Now look, you may not wanna hear this, but I know people, okay?

371
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,490
人类并不忠诚
And people are not loyal,

372
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,450
你越快开始照顾你自己
and the sooner you start looking out for yourself,

373
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,110
我是说只想着你自己  就越好
and I mean, only yourself, the better.

374
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,460
这话也太消极了  而且并不是真的
Wow, that is incredibly depressing and also not true.

375
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,210
谢谢你什么也没帮上  再见
So, thanks for nothing. Bye.

376
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,120
淑女  你和你的朋友最好小心点
Lady, you and your friend better be careful.

377
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,240
我嗅到了闯入者的气息
I smell an intruder afoot.

378
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,120
就是他  老信
That's him, Trusty!

379
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,970
警察的工作就交给我吧
Leave the police work to me.

380
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:07,000
好怕怕  老信警官来了  救命啊  来得正好
Oh, no! It's Officer Trusty, help. Just in the nick of time.

381
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,810
-别得寸进尺  -围巾可别掉了  杀手
- Hey! Don't push it! - Keep your scarf on, killer.

382
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:13,090
好了两位  谢谢支援  不过他已经要走了
Okay, you two, thank you for the back-up but he was just leaving.

383
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,470
是吧  流浪狗
Weren't you, street dog?

384
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,470
流浪狗  我懂了
Street dog? Oh, I got it.

385
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,650
我会走的  但只是因为我想走就能走
I'll go, but only because I'm free to leave

386
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,020
而你们都被困在栅栏后面
while all of you are stuck behind your fences.

387
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,480
记住了  宝宝出生
Just remember, when the baby moves in,

388
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,940
狗狗就扔
the dog moves out.

389
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,860
对了  这个我偷走了
I'm stealing this by the way.

390
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,620
那是我让你偷走的
Hey, I let you steal that!

391
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,090
被宝宝取代  无稽之谈
Replaced by a baby? Makes no sense.

392
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,310
-不可能  -无稽
- No way. - None.

393
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,020
毕竟  宝宝能给他们拿拖鞋吗
I mean, can a baby fetch slippers?

394
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,310
-深表怀疑  -别傻了
- Doubtful. - Don't be daft.

395
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,480
会给他们捡报纸吗
Or pick up the paper.

396
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,900
-不可能  -可笑
- Not a chance. - Ridiculous.

397
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,570
宝宝能让吉姆和达令
Can a baby provide Jim and Darling

398
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,800
感到生命完整  找到人生意义吗
with the sense of wholeness and a reason to live?

399
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,640
-这个嘛  -呃
- Well... - Uh...

400
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,480
我就是这个意思
My point exactly.

401
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,350
医生  我只想说太感谢你了
Doc, actually just wanted to say, thank you so much.

402
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,460
我简直不敢相信  你看到她了吗
I just can't believe it. Did you see her?

403
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,890
我不敢相信她那么完美
I just can't believe how perfect she is.

404
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,760
你见过比她还漂亮的女婴吗
I mean, have you ever seen a more beautiful baby girl?

405
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:39,820
没有  我干接生这行已经38年了
No. In my 38 years of delivering babies,

406
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,600
你家宝宝是最漂亮的宝宝
your baby is the most beautiful baby.

407
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,310
-真的吗  -晚安
- Really? - Good night!

408
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,390
-我送你出去  -不了  谢谢
- I'll walk you out. - No, thank you.

409
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,730
达令  你听到了吗
Darling, did you hear that?

410
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,730
我还是不敢相信

- Get her! - My birds! Sorry!

547
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,090
这里卖鸟吗
Do you sell birds?

548
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,550
好了各位  开始了
All right, everybody, here we go!

549
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,390
当心
Watch out there!

550
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,440
看路
Watch out!

551
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,870
疯了  真是疯了
This is crazy. This is crazy.

552
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:54,330
当然了  死胡同
Of course. A dead end.

553
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,340
这小巷是我的
I own this alley.

554
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,590
至少你不住这里
At least you don't live here.

555
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,380
我也住这里
I also live here.

556
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,970
非常抱歉
I am so sorry.

557
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,030
再一看  这里很漂亮
Looking at it again, it's a beautiful space.

558
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,140
离我的东西远点  小偷
Back away from my stuff, thief.

559
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,950
小偷  我从来没有偷过东西  谢谢
Thief? I have never stolen a thing in my life, thank you.

560
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:18,620
我也不准备从偷这垃圾开始
And I'm not gonna start with this garbage.

561
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,330
那是我的食物
That's my food.

562
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,580
食物  好吧
Food? Okay...

563
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,410
你想愚弄我吗
You trying to make a fool out of me?

564
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,280
那可不容易做到
'Cause that's not easy to do.

565
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,970
好吧  我这就走了
Okay. You know what, I'm just gonna go.

566
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,380
我发现我不该来这里
I realize I've been an imposition.

567
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,580
不  你哪也别想去
No, you're not going anywhere.

568
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,000
-住手  -什么
- Stop! - What?

569
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,710
快停下
Just stop.

570
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,170
好极了  流浪汉来了
Great. It's the tramp.

571
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,720
不要轻举妄动
Don't make any sudden moves.

572
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,520
你面对的是个杀手
You're dealing with a killer here.

573
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,140
是呵  哈巴狗  杀手
Yeah, lap dog. A killer.

574
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,640
冷静  我不是说你
Stay calm. I'm not talking about you.

575
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,140
-我在说她  -什么
- I'm talking about her. - What?

576
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,030
-什么  -谁
- What? - Who?

577
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,060
-别被她软趴趴的耳朵骗了  -什么
- Don't let those floppy ears fool you, man. - What?

578
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,360
拜托  难道你不好奇她为什么戴着口套吗
Come on. Aren't you wondering why she's wearing a muzzle?

579
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,670
为什么这么一条讨厌的小狗会来你家
Why such a tiny, annoying, little dog would come into your home?

580
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:08,160
-讨厌  -是啊  我确实好奇
- Annoying? - Yeah. You know, I was wondering about that.

581
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:09,780
这是条狂犬
This dog is rabid.

582
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,410
她是兔子吗[音似]She's a rabbit?

583
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:16,800
-你知道狂犬是什么意思吧  -知道
- You know what rabid means, right? - Yeah?

584
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,540
就是狂犬病  知道吗
Like, rabies, you know?

585
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:23,300
行为危险  有传染性  可怕
Like, when you act dangerous and contagious and scary.

586
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,880
好像要杀生
Like, you're gonna kill someone.

587
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,930
我有狂犬病
I have rabies!

588
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,190
-我行为危险  -我的老天
- I am acting dangerous! - Oh, my goodness!

589
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,490
-冷静  冷静  -还有传染性
- Easy, easy. - And contagious!

590
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,950
有时候表现得没这么夸张
And sometimes, it's even a little more subtle than that.

591
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:40,860
-狂犬病  狂犬病  -有时候就这么夸张
- Rabies! Rabies! Rabies! - And sometimes, it's not.

592
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,750
她病得不轻  是不是
She's got it bad, doesn't she?

593
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,690
当心  她朝你的存货去了
Look out! She's headed for your stash!

594
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,960
-我有吗  -是的
- I am? - Yes, you are.

595
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,280
没错  我要去  我要到处传播狂犬病
Right! Yes, I am! I'm getting rabies everywhere!

596
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,970
连香肠都不放过吗
Even the sausages?

597
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,420
对
Oh, yeah!

598
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,970
-什么  -对  尤其是香肠
- What? - Yes, especially on the sausages.

599
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,510
-现在香肠也染上狂犬病了  -我们怎么办
- These are rabies sausages now. - What do we do?

600
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,560
快跑  自救
Quick, run! Save yourself!

601
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,600
我的香肠怎么办
What about my sausages?

602
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,170
快走  别管它了
Just go! Just leave it!

603
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,140
-她来了  -等等  停  她追上我了
- Here she comes! - Wait, stop! I think she's got me!

604
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,630
抱歉  你自救吧
Sorry, you're on your own.

605
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,220
真过瘾
I feel alive.

606
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,310
狂犬病
Rabies!

607
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:17,610
等等  我好想记得你管我叫流浪狗
Wait, I seem to remember you calling me a street dog,

608
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,150
但你现在也在街头
but here you are out on the streets.

609
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:24,820
奇怪  我猜猜  宝宝出生  狗狗就扔
Strange. Let me guess, baby moves in, dog moves out?

610
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,530
不  根本不是那样
No, not at all!

611
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,900
这事...不是你想的那样
This here... this is not what it looks like.

612
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,620
对了  救你一命这事  不用客气
You're welcome for saving your life, by the way.

613
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,630
作为交换  我给了你一顿免费午餐
And in exchange, I got you a free meal.

614
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,040
所以我们扯平了
So, I think we're even.

615
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,590
这是我听过最疯狂的"谢谢"
That's the craziest "thank you" I've ever gotten.

616
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,750
也许你确实有狂犬病
Maybe you do have rabies.

617
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:42,140
行  真好笑  既然我帮你吃到了那垃圾
Great. Hilarious. Okay, well, seeing as I'm the reason

618
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:45,710
你能帮我摘掉脸上这东西吗
that you got that garbage, how about you help me get this thing off my face.

619
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:49,010
好吧  我尽力而为
Fine. I'll see what I can do.

620
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,110
我有一个能帮上忙的朋友
I think I got a friend who can help.

621
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,720
他挺冷硬的  有点像你
Now, he's a little stiff. Kinda reminds me of you.

622
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,770
我已经开始后悔了
I'm already regretting this.

623
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,650
这就是你朋友
This is your friend?

624
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:06,480
拜托你别犯傻  这才是我朋友
Please. Don't be ridiculous. This is my friend.

625
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,280
-当然是这位了  -来
- Of course it is. - Come on.

626
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,240
你只要把钢圈挂到它牙上就行
You just need to hook that wire onto his teeth.

627
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,210
你准备让它咬下来吗
Is your plan for him to bite it off?

628
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,920
你能照办吗
Would you just do it?

629
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,410
像这样
Like this?

630
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,720
好像没什么用
This doesn't feel like progress.

631
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,640
你到底要不要我帮你
Do you want me to help you or not?

632
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,010
你往后挪一点  固定住这东西
Just lean back so this thing doesn't move...

633
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:23,600
你动作快点
I guess. Just make it quick.

634
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,170
然后我把这玩意咬松  这是什么
while I work this thing loose. What is this?

635
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,640
是我耳朵  拜托
That's my ear, please.

636
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,670
什么  你能别乱动吗
What? Could you stop moving so much?

637
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,310
你踩到我爪子了
You stepped on my paw.

638
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,300
抱歉  我不是故意的
Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to.

639
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,300
这一点也不尴尬
This is not awkward at all.

640
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,110
我数三声  我们一起
On my count, we're both gonna need to pull

641
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,640
使最大的力气往后拽  准备好了吗
as hard as we can. You ready?

642
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,970
-好了  -一
- Yeah. - One...

643
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,280
-二  -我来数
- Two. - My count.

644
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,190
-好  -二  三
- Okay. - Two... Three.

645
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,540
告诉你能行的
Told you it would work.

646
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,790
对  谢谢你帮我忙
Yep. Well, thanks for your help.

647
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,280
谢谢你  我是说
Thank you. I mean, yeah,

648
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,330
-不客气  -也谢谢你
- you're welcome. - Yeah... thank you, too.

649
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,590
祝你在家玩得开心  宝贝
Have fun at home, baby.

650
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,820
我是说  和宝宝玩得开心
I mean, with the baby.

651
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,610
什么
What?

652
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,920
没啥  当我没说
No, uh... never mind.

653
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,480
该告别了
Well, this is goodbye, I think.

654
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,160
-对  -再见
- Yep. - Bye.

655
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,250
再见
Bye.

656
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:27,410
你...你好像迷路了
You, um... you look lost.

657
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:26,960
{\an8}舒尔茨帽店

我完全能够
I think I am capable of

659
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:31,070
自己找到回家的路  非常感谢
finding my own way home, thank you very much.

660
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,820
行
Oh, okay.

661
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:37,530
我大概不用告诉你走错了路
I guess I won't bother telling you that's the, uh, wrong way.

662
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,940
你要回家的话  那路就走错了
I mean, if you're going home, that would be the wrong way.

663
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,860
我知道  我只是想看看那边的情况
No, I know. I just wanted to see what was over there.

664
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,990
-现在我才要回家  -行
- Now, I'm going home. - Okay.

665
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,040
那边的路也不对
That's also the completely wrong way.

666
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,490
好吧  我迷路了
Okay, yes, I am lost.

667
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,850
你是准备站在那笑话我
So, you just gonna stand there

669
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,050
还是要帮我忙
and mock me or are you gonna help me out?

670
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,950
只能二选一吗  因为理想情况下...
Is that an either or question? Because ideally...

671
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:59,260
你指个方向  我自己走  行吗
Just point. I'll be on my way, okay?

672
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,450
是那边  听好了  这里不是后院
It's that way. Now, listen, this isn't a backyard.

673
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,890
这里有这里的规矩  第一  眼观六路
There are rules. Lesson one. Always look both ways.

674
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,270
-跟上  -第二
- Catch up! - Lesson two.

675
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,590
车很重  撞上来很疼
Cars are heavy and they hurt!

676
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,040
你一条近路也不知道吗
Don't you know any shortcuts?

677
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,620
我们走的是观景路线
We're taking the scenic route.

678
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,350
希望最终能走回家
I would like to get home eventually.

679
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,930
你为什么想回家
Why do you even want to go home?

680
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:26,830
我告诉你了
I told you.

681
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:29,170
这事情只是个误会
This is just one big misunderstanding.

682
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,970
吉姆和达令现在肯定担心坏了
Jim Dear and Darling must be worried sick about me by now.

683
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,040
当然
Yeah, no, sure.

684
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,690
你那表情什么意思
What is that look?

685
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:36,810
我不想说难听话
Look, I hate to break it to you,

686
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:39,060
就是我没怎么看见"寻狗启事"的广告
I'm just not seeing a lot of "Lost dog" posters up...

687
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,010
你可能认为你很了解人类
You may think that you know people,

688
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:43,100
但是你不了解我的主人  好吗
but you don't know my people, okay?

689
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,630
他们绝对不会让我流落街头
They would never let me wind up on the streets.

690
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:46,990
不会故意这样
Not on purpose.

691
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,030
好吧  有道理
Okay, fair enough.

692
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:52,300
但你现在正在街上游荡  你没戴项圈
But you're walking around on the street. You have no collar.

693
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,470
没人牵引  你闻起来有点臭
You are off leash. You smell a tweensy bit like trash.

694
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:58,860
-真没礼貌  -也就是说  对那个捕狗人而言
- Rude. - Which means, to that dog catcher...

695
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,670
我在找一只流浪狗
I'm looking for a street dog.

696
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:03,440
外表非常邋遢  行动莫测
Really scruffy face. Unpredictable.

697
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,870
你就是流浪狗
You're a street dog,

698
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,260
所以我们才要走观景路线
so that's why we're sticking to the scenic route.

699
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,290
来  你说不定能找点乐子呢
Come on. You might even have fun.

700
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,430
{\an8}流浪狗收容所

701
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,560
垂耳吗
Floppy ears?

702
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,370
-就是它  -我知道那狗
- That's the one. - Yeah, I know that dog.

703
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,190
-那是条恶狗  -对
- That dog's a menace. - Yes.

704
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,630
就睡在我的火车场
Sleeps in my train yard.

705
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,330
-带路  -来
- Show me. - Come on.

706
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,440
快点  我们得过河
Come on! We gotta get across the river.

707
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,520
坐那个
On that?

708
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,520
你没坐过船吗
Have you never been on a boat before?

709
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,140
我都没见过船  我们要怎么上船
I've never seen a boat before. How are we supposed to get on?

710
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,490
来  跟着我
Come on, follow me!

711
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:50,390
从这里  稍微一跳就行
Here. Just a quick little jump.

712
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,850
没门
No way.

713
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:54,330
拜托  很容易的  我跳给你看
Oh, come on, it's easy. I'll show you.

714
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:00,640
非常安全  当心水渍
Yeah, it's totally safe. Just watch out the wet spot, right?

715
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,220
有人在这里洒了点东西
There's someone spilled something.

716
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,130
是啊  我不跳
Yeah. I'm not gonna do that.

717
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:06,570
拜托  你会游泳  对吧
Come on! You know how to swim, right?

718
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,840
欢迎上船
Welcome aboard.

719
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:15,190
-你好  -你好  请出示船票
- How do you do? - Hello, ticket please?

720
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,490
-谢谢  -旅途愉快
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

721
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:21,490
下午好  请出示船票  你真可爱  对吗
Oh, good afternoon, ticket please. Well, aren't you just lovely?

722
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:24,110
耳朵尤其漂亮
And such gorgeous ears.

723
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:34,760
全体上船
All aboard!

724
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:54,190
-再见  -再见  一路顺风
- Goodbye! - Bye now! Have a nice trip!

725
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,090
干得不错  也许我低估你了
Not bad. Maybe I was wrong about you.

726
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:04,910
对  下次你冒不必要的生命危险前
Yeah, maybe next time you should ask me if I have any ideas

727
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:07,260
也许可以问问我的主意
before you risk your life unnecessarily.

728
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:10,620
你是说你不希望我死吗
Was this your way of saying that you don't want me to die?

729
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,820
我没那么说
I didn't say that.

730
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:15,050
-所以你希望我去死  -我也没那么说
- So now you want me to die? - And I didn't say that either.

731
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,460
-我才不信呢  小鬼  -我叫淑女
- Not buyin' it, kid. - It's Lady.

732
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:19,170
很高兴认识你  淑女
Nice to meet ya, Lady.

733
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,010
我也很高兴认识你...
Nice to meet you, too...

734
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:23,870
我都没问过你的名字  你叫什么
I never asked you your name. What's your name?

735
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:24,970
我有好多名字
I get called a lot of things.

736
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:29,850
包括伙计  狗狗  点点  布奇  滚
You know, I get Buddy or Pooch or Spot or Butch or Scram

737
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:31,450
或者  别翻垃圾
or Hey, get out of the trash.

738
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,270
要名字干嘛呢  我想做谁就做谁
Who needs a name, you know? I'm free to be whoever I wanna be.

739
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:38,430
自由自在  无牵无挂
Free to be myself and free to be by myself.

740
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:41,320
以天为庐  以地为塌  纵横四海  四海为家
Sky's my roof. Walk wherever I wanna walk.

741
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:44,080
走自己想走的步伐
I walk however I wanna walk.

742
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,660
你真疯狂
You're crazy.

743
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,630
这才哪到哪
You don't know the half of it.

744
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,210
-你想听点好听的吗  -好啊
- Hey, you wanna hear something great? - Sure!

745
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,360
他们真棒
They're amazing.

746
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:24,690
是吧  歌手更出色  听好了
Oh, yeah? Well, the singer's even better. Listen to this.

747
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:30,470
-顺便一说  自学的  -不
- Self-taught, by the way. - No.

748
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:32,160
我承认我技法可能不太娴熟
I admit I'm not the best technical singer.

749
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,930
但有时候音乐不在于音阶和音调
But sometimes it's not really about pitch or tone.

750
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:36,380
-而在于  -音量
- Sometimes it's just about... - Volume?

751
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,170
音量  音量显然很重要
Volume. Volume helps. Obviously.

752
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,960
-当然  -因为要让人家听到嘛
- Sure. - 'Cause you want people to hear you.

753
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,700
音量你没问题
Well, you have that part down.

754
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:45,930
-你也就音量没问题  -什么  大胆
- That's about all you have down. - What? How dare you?

755
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:47,520
你很努力了
It's an A for effort, I think...

756
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,440
你看  当一条流浪狗也没什么不好
See? Being a street dog isn't so bad at all.

757
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,420
能看到另一种风景
And it comes with a view.

758
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,700
好了  你可以停下了
Okay, you can stop now.

759
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,640
这世界这么大  有很多事可做
See, there's plenty to do out here in this big, old world.

760
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,850
的确如此
Yeah. I'll bet there is.

761
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:14,530
那公园真美
That park is pretty.

762
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,230
那公园埋了很多骨头
There's a lot of bones buried in that park.

763
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:18,910
死狗吗
Dogs died?

764
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:21,270
不  我们原来在那里藏吃剩的骨头
No, that's just where we used to bury all our bones.

765
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,280
你左边是这城里最早的消防栓
And on your left is the oldest fire hydrant in the city.

766
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,000
-也算是个地标了  -为什么
- Kind of a landmark around here. - Why is that?

767
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,580
不是吧  那是个消防栓啊
Seriously? It's a fire hydrant.

768
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:33,310
-对哦  真恶心  -狗  消防栓
- Oh, right. Gross. - Dogs, fire hydrant.

769
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,290
桥这边
And just beyond this bridge

770
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,920
我曾经在这里和一只臭鼬起过冲突
here is where I had a run-in with a skunk.

771
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,500
你闻到了吗
Do you smell that?

772
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,070
不  那是好多年前了  我当时还是条小狗
No, no, no. This was years ago. I was, like, a puppy. It was...

773
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,260
不不不
No, no, no, no.

774
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:46,740
这是什么
What is all this?

775
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,730
这里吗  这是城里我最喜欢的地方
This? This is, like, my favorite part of town.

776
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:50,840
是美食街
It's Restaurant Row.

777
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:57,290
{\an8}面馆

778
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:52,460
美食街
Restaurant Row?

779
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,280
对  这里有法国剩饭
Yeah, they got French scraps,

780
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,490
中国剩饭  肉和土豆剩饭
Chinese scraps, meat and potato scraps.

781
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:58,500
-什么都有  -他们就直接给你吗
- They got it all. - And they just give it to you?

782
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,280
不是谁都给的  但是我例外
No, not just anyone. But to me, yes.

783
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,940
行  我们试试
Okay. Well, let's give it a try.

784
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:06,590
不是要送你回家吗
Don't we have to get you home?

785
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:12,100
对  回家
Yeah. Home.

786
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:13,820
你还好吗
You okay?

787
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:15,920
我...
I, uh...

788
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,780
怎么了
What's wrong?

789
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:23,050
我不知道我还有没有家
I'm not so sure I still have a home to get back to.

790
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,470
我想...肯定没事的
Hey, I'm... I'm sure it'll be okay.

791
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:30,980
不  你是对的
No, you were right.

792
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,420
宝宝出生  狗狗就扔
Baby moves in and the dog moves out.

793
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,510
事情和你预料的一样
It happened just the way that you said it would.

794
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:43,200
你大概觉得我就想听你这句话  但是
I know you probably think that's what I wanted to hear, but it...

795
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:45,230
不是的
It wasn't.

796
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,090
这样吧
You know what?

797
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:50,560
我们去找点吃的
Let's get something to eat.

798
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,610
我知道一个好地方
And I think I know just the place.

799
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,630
{\an8}托尼餐馆

800
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:59,320
托尼餐馆  镇里我最喜欢的地方
Tony's. My favorite place in town.

801
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,580
闻起来真香  我们直接走进去吗
It smells amazing. Do we just walk right in?

802
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,620
其实我有自己的私人入口  跟我来
Actually I kinda use my own private entrance. Follow me.

803
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,900
等等我
Wait up.

804
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,730
我太饿了  能吃下一只鞋
I am so hungry I could eat a shoe.

805
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,130
我吃过  一般般吧
Done it before. Overrated.

806
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,910
你躲着别出来  晚餐我请
Okay, you stay hidden. Dinner's on me.

807
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:20,920
布奇  抱歉朋友  来得不是时候
Hey, Butch. I'm sorry, my friend. Bad timing.

808
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,040
今晚人满为患
It's a full house in there, you know?

809
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:27,690
这是哪位
Who is this?

810
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,490
你好  亲爱的  晚上好
Hola, mi amor. Buenas noches.

811
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:35,490
好吧  我去想想办法  好吗
Okay, let me see what I can do for you, okay?

812
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:38,370
乔  客人等着用餐呢
Joe? We got tables waiting.

813
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:40,640
好的  抱歉老板
Yes. Sorry, boss.

814
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:44,310
-我们都要忙死了  -我知道  你以为我不知道吗
- We're dying in there. - I know, I know! You think I don't know?

815
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,970
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

816
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,660
你怎么不早说呢
Why didn't you say so?

817
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,560
你根本配不上它  布奇
She's way too good for you, Butch.

818
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,140
它是个可卡犬姑娘  是吗
She's a Cockerel Spanish girl, huh?

819
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,140
-乔  -我在
- Joe? - Yes?

820
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,150
-乔  听着  -早想到了
- Joe, listen, I... - Uh, way ahead of you.

821
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:11,010
骨头  你什么毛病
Bones! What's the matter with you?

822
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:14,640
今晚  布奇要享受最棒的晚餐
Tonight, Butch gets the best in the house.

823
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,370
我喜欢  最棒的晚餐
I love it, best in the house.

824
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:18,380
-来吧  我们能做到  -稍等一下
- Come on, we can do this. Go on. - One moment, please.

825
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:19,590
怎么回事
What's happening?

826
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:20,620
你问我吗
You're asking me?

827
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,980
-快点  -好
- Come on! - Okay.

828
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,200
快点  快点
Hurry up, hurry up.

829
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:25,890
我该做什么...
What do I do... What do I...

830
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:28,160
去拿蜡烛  面包棒
Get a candle. Bread sticks.

831
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,210
拿来了
I got it.

832
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,560
好了
All right.

833
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,490
-你能把蜡烛点上吗  -好的
- Can you light the candle? - Yes.

834
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:34,060
点蜡烛
Light the candle.

835
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,480
我正要点  我只有两只手
I'm going. I only have two hands.

836
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:42,000
店里最好的位置  你们可以落座了
The best table in the house. And now, your table is ready.

837
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:49,360
相信我
Take it from me,

838
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:52,340
最好点托尼的特色菜
you'll want Tony's speciale.

839
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:55,380
乔  布奇说他想要两份特色意大利面
Joe, Butch says he wants two spaghetti special.

840
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:58,470
多加肉丸
And heavy on the meatballs.

841
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,700
托尼  你是不是傻  狗不会说话
Are you silly, Tony? Dogs don't talk. Yeah?

842
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:04,910
但它跟我说话了
Well, he's talkin' to me.

843
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:07,560
-两份特色意大利面马上就来  -快点
- Two specials coming right up. - Hurry.

844
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,310
很抱歉  我马上去
I'm so sorry. Yeah I'm going.

845
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:12,980
街头生活是吗
Street life, huh?

846
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:15,610
是啊  除非有桌子  桌布
Yeah. You know, I won't even eat unless

847
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:19,150
蜡烛  菜单  否则我拒绝进餐
I have a table, and a table cloth, and a candle, and a menu.

848
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,430
我瞎说的  这都是因为有你
No. This is because you're here.

849
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:21,720
快来  快来
Come on. Come on.

850
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:31,860
给我们的狗狗  布奇  和它的新女朋友
For our boy, Butch, and his nice new lady friend.

851
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:33,850
-是的  -走吧  走吧
- Yes. - Come on. Come on.

852
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:35,100
-好的  -走吧
- Okay. - Come on.

853
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,570
祝你们好胃口
Buon appetito.

854
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,170
他们说特色菜卖完了
They told me they were out of the special.

855
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,430
天呐  我还以为他们俩要坐下来和我们一起吃呢
God, I thought those two were gonna sit down and join us.

856
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,070
别担心  他们不会打扰我们了
Don't worry. They won't bother us...

857
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,820
他们回来了
And they're back.

世界  这是淑女
World, Lady.

890
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:45,130
我觉得你们俩会相处得很愉快
I think you two are gonna get along just great.

891
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:47,730
我睡在那边的火车场里
I sleep over there in the train yard

892
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:52,620
有时候我会来这里看风景
so, you know, sometimes I come up here just for the view.

893
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,960
白天肯定看得更清楚  不过
'Course you see more in the daylight but, you know,

894
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:01,850
野外的黑夜和星空有独特的魅力
there's something about the night, outside, under the stars.

895
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,860
我在院子里看过
I've seen them from the yard before,

896
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:08,010
但这...完全不同
but this is... This is something else.

897
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,480
你来试试
Now you try.

898
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,390
我不知道我会不会
I don't know if I can.

899
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:18,090
你当然会
Of course you can.

900
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:20,480
我以前从没嚎叫过
I've never howled before.

901
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,780
什么
What?

902
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:22,780
什么
What?

903
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:25,250
好吗  你只要挖掘内心
Okay, look, you just gotta reach down deep,

904
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:27,950
找到你内心深处的狼
and you gotta find that inner wolf inside you.

905
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:28,790
来吧
Go ahead.

906
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:31,310
让我准备一下  可能得用力挖掘
Okay, give me a minute. It might be buried deep.

907
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:39,310
太...太棒了
That was... That was great.

908
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,060
太棒了  你是真的想嚎叫
That was great. Was that a real attempt,

909
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,380
还是只是在热身
or were you just kinda warming up?

910
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,430
别这样  我以前从没试过
Hey! Come on, I've never done this before.

911
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:48,180
不像狂犬病那样自然而然就会了
Not coming to me as naturally as rabies did.

912
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,450
再让我试一次
Let me try again.

913
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:57,080
就是这样  感觉好吗
There you go! Did that feel good?

914
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,080
-感觉挺好的  -是啊
- That felt pretty good. - Yeah.

915
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:01,180
我觉得我们只需要改善你的...
I think we just need to work on your...

916
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,450
我的音量  你是想说这个吗
My volume? Is that what you were gonna say?

917
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:05,260
没错
Exactly.

918
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:09,400
我从没在这么高的地方看过这个镇子
I've never seen the town from this high up.

919
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,350
不知我能不能看到我的...
I wonder if I can see my...

920
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,400
我的房子
My house.

921
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:22,480
也没那么糟
It's not so bad.

922
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:26,380
瞧瞧你  你在这里  对着月亮嚎叫
Look at you now. You're up here, you're howling at the moon!

923
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:31,050
昨天  你所有的经历都是在栅栏后面
Yesterday, the only experiences you had were from behind a fence.

924
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:34,340
我知道  我知道
Yeah, I know! I know.

925
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:38,310
但是栅栏后面有很多东西
But there was a lot behind that fence.

926
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:40,560
知道吗
You know?

927
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:44,080
我的生活充满了爱和意义
My life was full of love and meaning.

928
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,180
我们是特别的存在
I was a part of something special.

929
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:50,080
我们是一家人
We were a family.

930
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,370
不管我们怎么嚎叫
It doesn't matter how much howling I do,

931
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:55,350
离开他们我都感到很难过
I feel bad about leaving them.

932
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,140
你不必担心离开他们
You don't have to worry about leaving them.

933
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:04,890
他们已经离开你了  我知道这有多伤心
They already left you. I mean, look, I know how much it hurts...

934
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:07,210
怎么可能  你怎么知道
No, how? How would you know?

935
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,450
我就是知道
I just do.

936
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:17,900
你确实知道
You do know.

937
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:24,440
你曾经有过家  是吗
You did have a home, didn't you?

938
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:25,780
是的
Yeah.

939
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,680
我有过
I did.

940
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:32,520
我有过家
I had a home.

941
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,980
我有过家人
I had a family.

942
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:43,970
我拥有过一切
Oh, I had it all.

943
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:48,740
他们爱我
They loved me.

944
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,650
我爱他们
And I loved them.

945
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,850
然后有一天  一切都变了
And then one day it all changed.

946
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:20,200
我在原地等了一天
I waited in that spot all day...

947
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,120
一夜
And all night.

948
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:26,100
我很遗憾
I'm so sorry.

949
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:29,830
我
I...

950
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:31,900
我不知道
I didn't know.

951
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:34,180
算了吧
Forget it.

952
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:37,140
每条狗都得长教训  对吧
Every dog's gotta learn someday, right?

953
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:41,240
人类就是不懂忠诚
People just don't do loyalty.

954
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,690
不像我们这些狗
Not like us dogs.

955
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:49,020
而且如果我还和他们在一起  就不会遇见你了
And if I were still with 'em, I wouldn't have met you.

956
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,190
我们也不会共度这么美好的一天
And we wouldn't have had this amazing day.

957
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:54,670
一夜
And night.

958
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,040
每一天都可以是一场冒险
Every day could be an adventure.

959
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,270
你和我  没人牵引没有栅栏
You and me, no leashes or fences...

960
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:02,570
不对任何人忠诚
No loyalty to anyone.

961
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,930
它一定就在这里
He's gotta be around here somewhere.

962
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:10,700
我找到你了
I found you!

963
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:11,800
-他找到我了  -什么
- He found me! - What?

964
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,400
我们得逃跑了  快跑
Run! We gotta run. Right now!

965
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,200
回来
Hey, get back here!

966
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,830
这次你逃不掉了  这次不行
You're not getting away this time! Not this time!

967
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:26,570
快  从这里走
Come on! Through here!

968
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,600
我们得分头跑  快点  去那边
We need to split up. Quick. Go that way.

969
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,700
什么  不  这太疯狂了  我们得待在一起
What? No, that's crazy. We have to stay together!

970
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:38,020
反正他在追我  我们最好单独行动
He's after me anyway. We're better off alone.

971
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:40,740
相信我  你错了
Trust me! You are wrong about this.

972
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:43,640
快跑
Run!

973
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:09,200
-你看到什么了吗  -还没有
- You see anything? - Not yet.

974
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:12,820
我们分头行动  把它赶出来  准备好
Let's split up. We're gonna flush him out. Be ready.

975
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,360
我会的
I will be.

976
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,420
过来  狗狗
Here, boy.

977
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:26,220
现在只剩你一个了  流浪狗
You're all alone now, street dog.

978
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,800
快出来吧
Come on out.

979
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,210
你不累吗
Aren't you tired?

980
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,400
赶紧的  我要关门了
Wrap it up. I'm closing shop.

981
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,140
-马上就好  -我们出去吧
- I'm almost done. - Let's get out.

982
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,010
-走吧  -我们走
- Come on. - Let's go.

983
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:45,440
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait.

984
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:46,910
把门关上
Shut the door!

985
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,710
你给我站住
Don't run away from me.

986
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:54,200
站住
Stop!

987
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:56,460
它往你那边跑了
He's heading your way.

988
00:59:58,150 --> 00:59:59,240
我没看见它
I don't see him.

989
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,060
过来  狗狗
Here, boy.

990
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:15,900
快出来吧
Come on out.

991
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:19,990
见鬼
Dang it.

992
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,240
就现在
Now!

993
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,700
我堵住它了
I got him.

994
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,700
别让它溜了
Don't let him get by.

995
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,040
绝不可能
Not a chance.

996
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,750
就这样  慢慢来
That's it, nice and easy.

997
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:41,380
淑女
Lady!

998
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:44,470
你干什么
Hey, hey, hey! What're you doing?

999
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:46,510
淑女  我们走
Lady, let's go!

1000
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:47,640
抓住它
Get her!

1001
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,890
快跑
Run for it!

1002
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,480
太不可思议了  我们成功了
That was incredible! We made it!

1003
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:01,360
淑女
Lady?

1004
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:05,700
别哼唧了
Quit your whining.

1005
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:06,780
淑女
Lady!

1006
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,370
淑女  我这就...
Lady, I'm gonna...

1007
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:15,670
我...
I...

1008
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:29,890
我很抱歉  淑女
I'm so sorry, Lady.

1009
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:35,940
{\an8}流浪狗收容所

1010
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,460
小鬼  你迷路了吗
You lost, kid?

1011
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:05,130
她看起来很害怕
She looks scared.

1012
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:36,500
别让他们吓到你  亲爱的
Don't let 'em scare you, honey.

1013
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,040
在这里我们都是朋友
We're all friends in here.

1014
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,540
阿科  你就这么对待客人吗
Arko, is that how you treat our guest?

1015
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:46,170
你知道不能这样
You know better than that.

1016
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:50,680
第一次来吗  亲爱的  这里可不常见家养狗
First time, love? Don't get many family dogs in here.

1017
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:54,310
而且闻起来她好像洗过澡
Smells like she's had a bath, too.

1018
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:57,140
我都不记得我上次洗澡是什么时候了
I can't remember the last time I had a bath.

1019
01:02:57,310 --> 01:02:59,270
这里是收容所  对吧
This is the pound, isn't it?

1020
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:01,770
亲爱的  你不习惯来这种地方吧
Not used to digs like these, are ya, honey?

1021
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:04,020
一月洗的  我想起来了
January! Just remembered.

1022
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:08,320
别担心  这里有两种类型的狗
Don't worry. Here they've got two types of dogs.

1023
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,530
可收养的  也就是你
Adoptable, which is you,

1024
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:12,660
以及我们这些
and the rest of us.

1025
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:15,330
为什么你们不可收养
Why aren't you adoptable?

1026
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:18,080
宝贝  我们是流浪狗
Baby, we're street dogs.

1027
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,120
我们没人要
We're strays.

1028
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:21,040
我们中有些是罪犯
Some of us are criminals.

1029
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,500
那是传闻
Allegedly.

1030
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,550
{\an8}流浪狗收容所

1031
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,760
你们听啊  船回来了
You guys, listen. The boat's back.

1032
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,970
你怎么流落到这里的
How did you end up here anyway?

1033
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:36,010
我和一个朋友遇上麻烦  然后分开了
Well, a friend and I ran into trouble and got split up.

1034
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:38,140
等等  你刚才说朋友
Hang on. Did you say friend?

1035
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:40,940
是"真正的"朋友  还是"所谓的"朋友
Like a "friend" friend? Or a "friend"?

1036
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:45,400
我回去帮他  但是我...
Well, I went back to help him, but I... I...

1037
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:47,530
看来他不能帮我
I guess he couldn't help me.

1038
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:49,990
不能  还是不愿
Couldn't or wouldn't?

1039
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:53,490
你这个朋友有名字吗
Does this friend have a name?

1040
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:55,950
他说他有很多名字
He said he had a lot of names.

1041
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:59,790
老天  让我猜猜  布奇  点点
Oh, boy! Let me guess. Butch? Spot?

1042
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:02,040
或者  别翻垃圾
Or, Hey, get out the trash?

1043
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:04,670
你们一定要分开吗
Did you have to split up?

1044
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:07,670
还是他说你最好单独行动
Or did he just say you're better off alone?

1045
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,630
等等  你怎么知道
Wait. How did you know that?

1046
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:12,470
因为我们认识他
'Cause the guy we know...

1047
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:14,140
他是个独行侠
He's a lone wolf!

1048
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:16,140
他只演独角戏

来吧  该走了
Come on. It's time to go.

是疯子

01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,280
没有你我们就不是一家人了
We're not a family without you.

1092
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:08,290
家
Home.

1093
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,330
看看你
Look at you.

1094
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:17,250
真不敢相信你独自在镇上到处跑
I can't believe you've been running around town all alone.

1095
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,710
太可怕了
That's just awful.

1096
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:19,920
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

1097
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,010
我尽力收拾干净了
I tried my best to tidy up.

1098
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,640
你找到它了
You found her!

1099
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,720
谢天谢地它没事
Thank goodness she's safe and sound.

1100
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:30,320
真希望你没有那样跑掉  淑女  你把大家都吓坏了
Wish you hadn't run off like that, Lady. You upset everyone.

1101
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:32,140
没关系  淑女
That's okay, Lady.

1102
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:35,810
莎拉姑姑的意思是她很抱歉
What Aunt Sarah meant to say was she's sorry.

1103
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:37,650
而且她要走了
And she was just leaving.

1104
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:40,990
你知道吗
Well, you know what?

1105
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:41,900
我正好有个
Just so happens that I do have

1106
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,490
非常重要的约会
a very important engagement to attend to.

1107
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:51,370
要是我的话  我会仔细考虑
You know, if I were you, I would think long and hard

1108
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:54,670
要不要让那条狗靠近可爱的宝宝
about letting that dog get close to that sweet baby.

1109
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:57,290
-下次我们可以...  -不会有下次了
- I mean, next time we can... - Oh, there won't be a next time.

1110
01:08:57,290 --> 01:08:58,460
你说什么
Excuse me?

1111
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:01,130
你好大的胆子
How dare you!

1112
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:04,680
好吧
Well...

1113
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,970
莎拉姑姑说的
Aunt Sarah does have a point

1114
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:10,640
让你靠近宝宝的话是有道理的
about letting you get close to the baby.

1115
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,230
没事的  淑女  来吧
It's all right, Lady. Come on.

1116
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:17,400
来吧  淑女  来吧
Come on, Lady. Come on.

1117
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:21,780
淑女  这是露露
Lady, this is Lulu.

1118
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:24,030
她现在也是家庭的一员了
She's part of the family now, too.

1119
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:29,660
来吧
Go on.

1120
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,080
真好
There you go.

1121
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,180
你在玩吗
Are you playing?

1122
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:14,500
一切都恢复正常是不是很棒
Isn't it nice to have everything back to normal?

1123
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:17,000
穿着裙子的狗还好意思说
Says the dog in a dress.

1124
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,750
老天在上  注意你的口水
Oh, for goodness sake, watch your drool!

1125
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:20,790
我今天已经洗一次过澡了
I've already had a bath today.

1126
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:22,750
我真的很想你们
I really missed you guys.

1127
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:25,170
那吉姆和达令...
And things with Jim Dear and Darling are, uh...

1128
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,720
我不是他们世界的中心了
Well, I'm not the center of their world anymore,

1129
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,760
不过我们的世界变大了
but our world is just bigger.

1130
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:34,850
仅此而已  我们有了露露
That's all. We have Lulu now.

1131
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,560
听起来真操心
Sounds exhausting.

1132
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,850
你不再流落街头我们就很高兴了
We're just glad you're off the street.

1133
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:41,400
远离那条肮脏的流浪狗
Away from that dirty street dog.

1134
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,940
是啊  我想你们没看错他
Yeah, guess you all were right about him.

1135
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,440
不过也不全是坏事
Although it wasn't all bad.

1136
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:48,740
流浪狗  他们和我们一样
You know, street dogs, they're just like us.

1137
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:51,450
他们只是不够幸运  没有家
They just aren't lucky enough to have homes.

1138
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:52,240
仅此而已
That's all.

1139
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:56,660
所以你能回家真是太好了  不是吗
Then it's a darn good thing you made it back to yours, innit?

1140
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:57,460
是啊
Yeah.

1141
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:00,620
我无法想象街头生活
I cannot imagine life on the street!

1142
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:02,750
争夺残羹剩饭填饱肚子
Scrappin' about for your next meal,

1143
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:05,420
没有栅栏给你安全感
no fences to make you feel safe.

1144
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:09,300
那是我能想象到的最奇怪的生活
It is the oddest, most bizarre life I can imagine.

1145
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:12,430
乔克  杰奎琳
Jock! Jacqueline!

1146
01:11:12,510 --> 01:11:15,470
宫廷小丑准备好了吗
Who's ready to entertain the court?

1147
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:18,680
叫我了  祝我好运吧[摔断腿]That's my cue. Hope I break a leg.

1148
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:20,190
那就太遗憾了
Yeah, wouldn't that be a shame.

1149
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:24,070
先生  别得寸进尺  别看我身材小  但我力量大
Don't push it, Mister. I may be small, but I am mighty.

1150
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,820
欢迎你回家  淑女
Good to have you home, Lady.

1151
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:17,120
瞧瞧这是谁
Look what the cat dragged in.

1152
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:21,160
不好说  这家伙看起来太忧郁了  不像流浪汉
I don't know. This guy, he looks too blue to be the Tramp.

1153
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:24,580
你们好  为什么你们戴着项圈
Hey, guys. Why are you wearing collars?

1154
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:26,590
原来我们是可收养的
Turns out we're adoptable.

1155
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:30,010
你们俩在这儿呢  希望你们饿了
There's my two. I hope you're hungry.

1156
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:31,720
来吧
Here you go.

1157
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,930
晚餐前的一点零食
Just a little snack before dinner.

1158
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:34,800
什么
What?

1159
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,720
别吃太饱  别走开
Save some room. Stay.

1160
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:40,810
你相信吗
You believe that?

1161
01:12:40,930 --> 01:12:43,690
屠夫直接把骨头给他了
The butcher just gives it to him.

1162
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:47,150
等等  等一下  你们俩被领养了
Wait, wait. Hang on. You two, adopted?

1163
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:49,320
从来没想过你们会成为家养狗
Never really took you two for family dogs.

1164
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:52,440
在某种程度上  我们一直都是家养狗
In a way, we've always been family dogs.

1165
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:53,860
至少是彼此的家人
At least to each other.

1166
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:56,740
这个世界是怎么了  大家都和人类生活在一起
What is the world coming to? Everybody's living with people!

1167
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:59,660
别激动  你这么生气干什么
Easy. What're you so upset about?

1168
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:01,160
这和我们在收容所遇到的
This wouldn't have anything to do with

1169
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:03,370
那个姑娘没关系吧
that girl we met in the pound, would it?

1170
01:13:03,370 --> 01:13:06,250
什么  谁  淑女  你见过她吗
What? Who? Lady? But, did you meet her?

1171
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:08,630
不  我没有在想她
No. I'm not thinking about her.

1172
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:10,710
我好得很  真的特别好
I'm doing good. I'm doing really good!

1173
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:13,670
你确定吗  你看起来可是一团糟
Are you sure? 'Cause you seem like you're doing terrible.

1174
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:17,260
不  牛头  你搞错了  他好得很
No, Bull, you got it all wrong. He's doin' great.

1175
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:20,560
他的梦想成真了  而且他说的都是对的
He got what he always wanted, and was right about everything.

1176
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,470
我们看的是同一条狗吗
Are we looking at the same dog?

1177
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,690
是啊  他可以自由自在
Yep. He's free to be himself,

1178
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:27,770
-无牵无挂  -形影单只
- and free to be by himself. - By myself.

1179
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,480
-我是不是搞砸了  -说得没错
- I screwed up, didn't I? - Yep, sure did.

1180
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:33,570
怎么回事  佩吉
What's goin' on, Peg?

1181
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:34,860
无所谓了
Doesn't matter. It's...

1182
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,410
都太迟了
It's too late.

1183
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:38,910
她的家人回来找她了
Her family came back for her.

1184
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:42,620
你是说就像她回去找你一样
You mean like she did... for you?

1185
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:43,620
天啊
Oh, man.

1186
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:46,830
我得弥补这事  我不知道能不能做到
I gotta fix it. I don't know if I can,

1187
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:49,880
但我得试试  我必须试试
but I... I gotta try. I have to.

1188
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,630
-我们明白  -我不明白
- We get it. - I don't!

1189
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:53,670
让她明白你的感受
Just let her know how you feel.

1190
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,640
-好  -佩吉  解释一下刚才发生了什么
- Okay! - Peggy, fill me in. What just happened?

1191
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:01,100
这个我要偷走  好吗
I'm stealing this, okay?

1192
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:03,810
不好  你这个小偷
No, it's not okay! Thief!

1193
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:47,310
世事难料啊  流浪汉来了
What do you know? It's the Tramp.

1194
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:49,940
给你带了点东西
Brought you somethin'.

1195
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:53,610
给你
Here.

1196
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:55,480
专门为你挑的
Picked it out, special.

1197
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,030
这也是你偷的吗
Did you steal that one, too?

1198
01:14:59,030 --> 01:14:59,950
不是
No.

1199
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:01,240
这是礼物
It was a gift.

1200
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,870
我借来的礼物
A borrowed gift that, um...

1201
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:06,200
好吧  是我偷的
Okay, yep, I stole it.

1202
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:09,080
听着
Look, um...

1203
01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:11,710
在火车场的时候
Back at the train yard...

1204
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:14,460
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry for, um...

1205
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,010
我不应该离开你的
I never should've left your side.

1206
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:19,510
你自己也说了
You said it yourself.

1207
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,090
没有人是忠诚的  你为什么要忠诚呢
Nobody else is loyal, so why should you be?

1208
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:24,220
我就应该相信你的
I should've just believed you.

1209
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:27,100
不  你不应该相信我
No. You shouldn't have believed me.

1210
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:32,730
无论我说过什么关于自由自在的话
Whatever I said about that, about, you know, being free and...

1211
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,070
都不是真的
That was not true.

1212
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:40,030
因为没有你的自由自在  就是...
Because being free without you there, now it's just...

1213
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:43,450
就是形影单只
That's just... being alone.

1214
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:49,290
你知道我是条流浪狗
Look, um, you know I'm a street dog.

1215
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:51,500
我对谁都没有多大价值
And I don't have much value to anyone...

1216
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,000
千万别这么说
Don't you say that.

1217
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,710
对我来说你是有价值的
You have value to me.

1218
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,090
我想你了
I missed you.

1219
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:02,180
我也想你
Missed you, too.

1220
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:07,640
有时候我晚上出来只是为了对着月亮嚎叫
Sometimes I come outside at night just to howl at the moon.

1221
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:11,060
这个没必要停止
Well, that... That doesn't have to end.

1222
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,560
我们可以一起嚎叫  一起自由奔跑
We could howl again. We can run free.

1223
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:15,940
一起去更多的冒险
Have more adventures.

1224
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:18,280
现在还为时不晚
It's... It's not too late for that.

1225
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,190
是吧
Is it?

1226
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:25,200
抱歉  但为时已晚
Sorry... but it is.

1227
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:28,700
我属于这里  和吉姆
I belong here... with Jim Dear,

1228
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:31,370
达令还有露露在一起  我们是一家人
and Darling, and Lulu. We're a family.

1229
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:33,710
他们离不开我
They depend on me.

1230
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,500
我对他们忠诚
And I'm loyal to them.

1231
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,090
是啊  你是
Yeah, you're...

1232
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:41,630
你是对的
You're right.

1233
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:44,590
这是你应得的  淑女
You deserve it, Lady.

1234
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:47,560
这也是你应得的
You deserve it, too.

1235
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,430
你应该得到爱
You deserve love.

1236
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:54,060
很遗憾不是和我
I'm just sorry that it can't be with me.

1237
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:04,280
淑女  进屋来
Lady! Come inside.

1238
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,040
我这就走
I'll go.

1239
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:15,330
你应该和家人在一起
You belong with your family.

1240
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:30,760
淑女  别在外面淋雨了
Lady! Come in out of the rain.

1241
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:36,730
谁啊
It's...

1242
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:08,800
露露
Lulu!

1243
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,150
我要找的那条流浪狗曾经和你家的狗一起混
The stray I'm after was running around the streets with your dog.

1244
01:18:18,150 --> 01:18:19,310
-淑女  -淑女
- Lady! - Lady!

1245
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:22,190
我知道它要来这里  你家的狗也知道
I know he's coming here. And she knows it, too!

1246
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:23,360
-淑女  -没事的  这样吧
- Lady! - It's all right. You know what?

1247
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,860
-别这样  -我让它去冷静一下  过来
- No. Please. - I'm gonna let her calm down. Come on.

1248
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:27,860
很显然这就是它叫个不停的原因
That's obviously why she's barking.

1249
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:31,120
好了好了  没事的
There, there. It's all right.

1250
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,030
不  实际上我认为
No, actually I think she's still

1251
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,790
它对收容的经历心有余悸
upset about her experience at the pound.

1252
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:38,540
很明显它在那里一点教训也没长
Well, clearly she learned nothing from her time there.

1253
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:40,000
一会就好  淑女
Just for a minute, Lady.

1254
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,420
力气真大
So strong. She...

1255
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:55,430
淑女
Lady?

1256
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:01,650
这么晚了  还好我们听到敲门声了
It's so late. It's a good thing we heard the door.

1257
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:03,860
-我们正准备睡觉呢  -是啊
- We were about to get into bed. - Oh, yeah.

1258
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:06,900
没错  夫人  事关安全不能等到早上
It sure is, ma'am. Safety can't wait till morning.

1259
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:22,580
淑女
Lady?

1260
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,380
淑女  是我
Lady? It's me!

1261
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:28,300
谢天谢地  你回来了
Thank goodness! You came back!

1262
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:29,760
你没事吧  出什么事了
Are you okay? What's wrong?

1263
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:33,010
露露的房间里有只老鼠  但我出不去
There's a rat in Lulu's room. But I can't get out of here.

1264
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:34,890
-我来处理  -真的吗
I'll take care of it. You will?

1265
01:19:34,890 --> 01:19:38,020
好  不过小心  捕狗人在屋里
Okay. But be careful. The dog catcher's in there.

1266
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,810
别担心  交给我
Don't worry. I got this.

1267
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:42,230
快点
Hurry!

1268
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:49,240
我已经追踪这条流浪狗好几个小时了
I've been tracking this street dog for hours.

1269
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:51,610
就算它现在还没到  很快也会来
If he isn't here already, he will be.

1270
01:19:51,610 --> 01:19:54,870
这就是你之前在找的那条流浪狗吗
This is the same stray that you were looking for before?

1271
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:55,870
正是那条
The very one.

1272
01:19:56,910 --> 01:19:58,410
你还没抓到它吗
And you still haven't caught him?

1273
01:19:59,870 --> 01:20:01,460
那边是你家后院吗
Is that the back of your property?

1274
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:03,910
什么  那请进吧
What... What... Please, come right in.

1275
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,960
等一下
What's... Hold on.

1276
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:08,580
什么  抱歉
What? I'm sorry.

1277
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:10,840
你确定它朝我家来了吗
And you're sure he's headed this way?

1278
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:13,630
确定  为了你们的安全  我最好在这里等它
Yes. And for your safety, I better wait for him.

1279
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:15,340
你最好泡点咖啡
And you'd better make some coffee.

1280
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:17,300
吉姆  你听到了
Jim, you heard the man.

1281
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:18,630
马上就来  达令
Right away, Darling.

1282
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:20,850
只有咖啡没有蛋糕可不行
Coffee without cake is the devil's work.

1283
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,310
楼上发生什么了
What is going on up there?

1284
01:21:11,650 --> 01:21:13,480
我跟你说  我差点
I'm telling you, I had him...

1285
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:16,030
就把它抓起来了
inches from custody.

1286
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,950
别忘了  这条狗浑身生疮
And keep in mind, this dog is mangy,

1287
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:23,910
肮脏不堪  非常危险
dirty, dangerous.

1288
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:04,320
滚开
Get off me!

1289
01:22:50,410 --> 01:22:52,460
不  离宝宝远点
No! Stay away from the baby!

1290
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:55,420
不
No!

1291
01:22:56,670 --> 01:22:57,670
在审判中...
In the trial...

1292
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:10,850
你没事
You're okay.

1293
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:17,190
等等  那是露露吗
Wait, is that Lulu?

1294
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:24,570
天啊
Oh, God.

1295
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,290
露露
Lulu?

1296
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:41,000
滚开  离她远点
Get away! Get away from her!

1297
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:43,880
别过来  退后  退后
All right, stay back! Get back! Back up!

1298
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,260
-露  -它在这儿
- Lu! - He's here!

1299
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:46,590
-露露  -去抱孩子
- Lulu! - Get the baby!

1300
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,680
-她没事吧  -我不知道
- Is she all right? - I don't know!

1301
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:50,100
别动  别动
Stay! Stay!

1302
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:53,680
没事了  它在这儿  狗在这儿
We're okay. He's here! The dog's here!

1303
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:00,770
你们逃过一劫
You got very lucky there.

1304
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:02,400
这家伙真是个祸害
This one's a real menace.

1305
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,940
小心  你确定抓牢了吗
Careful. Are you sure you've got him?

1306
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:07,610
别担心  它跑不掉了
Don't worry. He's not going anywhere.

1307
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:09,130
{\an8}流浪狗收容所

1308
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,990
真奇怪  我以前从没见过这条狗
This is so strange. I've never seen this dog before in my life.

1309
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:15,830
我不知道它是怎么进去的
I'm not sure how he could've got inside.

1310
01:24:15,830 --> 01:24:17,370
狗是很危险的
Dogs can be dangerous.

1311
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,250
这种事正是我们这行想要防范的
This is exactly the kinda thing we try to prevent in my profession.

1312
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:22,090
当然
Of course.

1313
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:30,510
不过我得说
You know, I must say, I...

1314
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:32,890
一开始我没把你当回事
I didn't take you seriously at first.

1315
01:24:33,390 --> 01:24:34,600
经常有人这么说
I get that a lot.

1316
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:37,770
不过现在你安全了
But you're safe now.

1317
01:24:37,770 --> 01:24:39,100
它不在街上游荡了
He's off the streets,

1318
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:41,270
而如何处理袭击人类的狗
and we've got strict rules on what happens

1319
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:43,110
我们有严格的规定
to dogs that attack humans.

1320
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,900
非常感谢你抽出时间
Well, thank you very much for your time.

1321
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:50,660
-晚安  -晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

1322
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:01,830
你听到那边的骚动了吗
Did you hear all that ruckus?

1323
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:05,380
你真的觉得他要伤害小宝宝吗
Do you really think he went after the wee baby?

1324
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:07,550
我从没信任过他
I never trusted him,

1325
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,090
但我也从没想过他会那么做
but I never thought he'd do that.

1326
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:18,640
淑女  我很抱歉
Lady, I'm so sorry.

1327
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:21,690
你只是想警告我们小心那条狗
You were just trying to warn us about that dog...

1328
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:23,610
淑女  淑女
Lady! Lady!

1329
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:27,940
淑女
Lady?

1330
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:31,280
淑女
Lady!

1331
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:33,780
淑女
Lady!

1332
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:36,740
怎么了
What?

1333
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:40,460
达令
Darling!

1334
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:41,710
吉姆  过来
Jim, come here!

1335
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:43,330
怎么了
What?

1336
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,880
天啊  是什么
Oh, God. What is it?

1337
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,340
是只老鼠
It's a... It's a rat.

1338
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:56,310
不  我...
Oh, no. I've...

1339
01:26:01,730 --> 01:26:02,850
他去哪了
Where'd he go?

1340
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:04,850
捕狗人带他去监狱了
Dog catcher took him to the pokey.

1341
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:06,650
-我得拦下他们  -怎么回事
- I've gotta stop them! - What happened?

1342
01:26:06,650 --> 01:26:08,360
是老鼠
It was the rat!

1343
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:11,320
老信  也许我们看错他了
Trusty! Maybe we misjudged him.

1344
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,900
淑女没看错  我们得帮她
Lady didn't. We gotta help her.

1345
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:16,160
穿着苏格兰裙我跑不起来
I can't run in my kilt!

1346
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:17,740
你得试试
You're gonna have to try.

1347
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:22,160
不
Oh, no!

1348
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,500
它要干什么
What is she doing?

1349
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:24,790
-淑女  -淑女
- Lady! - Lady!

1350
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:26,340
-淑女  -淑女
- Lady! - Lady!

1351
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:29,340
-淑女  -我们去追它
- Lady! - Let's go get her!

1352
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:31,120
我们去追它  快点
Let's go get her. Come on.

1353
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,010
快点
Come on!

1354
01:26:32,010 --> 01:26:33,510
我们得拦下那辆马车
We've gotta stop that wagon.

1355
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:35,340
我不是跑得快的品种好吗
I'm not built for speed, you know?

1356
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:37,310
你能做到的  小狗
You can do it, little doggie.

1357
01:26:37,390 --> 01:26:38,470
我的小短腿
My wee legs!

1358
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,640
所有人都认为我疯了
Everyone thought I was crazy.

1359
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:45,440
现在我可不像疯子了吧
But I don't look so crazy now, do I?

1360
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,740
快点  继续跑
Come on! Keep going!

1361
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:55,400
老天啊  我在裸奔
In the name of the wee man! I'm naked.

1362
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:57,240
不  是跑得更快了
Nah, you're just faster.

1363

它是怎么了
What has gotten into her?

1364
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:07,460
它为什么要追那条流浪狗
Why would she be chasing that stray?

1365
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:09,340
吉姆  露露没事

鲷鱼  见鬼
Snapper! Darn it!

1380
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:02,640
抱歉  淑女  我错了
Sorry, Lady, I'm wrong.

1381
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:07,890
事实是  靠得住老了  靠不住了
Truth is, Ol' Reliable is old and not that reliable.

1382
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:10,230
老信  你给我听好了

把注意力集中在我身上
I want you to focus on me.

I have not listened to you witter on about "Ol' Reliable"

1385
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,410
喋喋不休地念叨"靠得住"
for half of my short life

1386
01:28:19,410 --> 01:28:21,740
可不是让你在紧要关头放弃的
just to see you quit when we need you!

1387
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:22,870
如果我能用这四条小短腿

在街上裸奔

你就能闻到马车里的狗
