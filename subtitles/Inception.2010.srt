1
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,929
快过来
Hey! Come here!

2
00:01:27,064 --> 00:01:28,815
马上就来
I'm on my way.

3
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,401
他已经神志不清了  但还是指名要见你

4
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:42,339
把他带进来

5
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:45,783
他身上只带了这个...

6
00:01:47,956 --> 00:01:49,443
还有这个

7
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,368
你是来杀我的吗
Are you here to kill me?

8
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,544
我知道这是什么
I know what this is.

9
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,715
很久很久以前
I've seen one before.

10
00:02:26,716 --> 00:02:28,786
我在一个男人身上见过
Many, many years ago.

11
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,599
我们在一个梦中相遇
It belonged to a man I met

12
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:35,292
而那个梦我已经记不清了
in a half-remembered dream.

13
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,400
那个男人满脑子都是激进的想法
A man possessed of some radical notions.

14
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,138
最强大的寄生虫是什么
What is the most resilient parasite?

15
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,775
是细菌  是病毒
A bacteria? A virus?

16
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,608
还是肠道蠕虫
An intestinal worm?

17
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,978
柯布先生的意思是...
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say

18
00:02:58,143 --> 00:02:59,346
是一个想法
An idea.

19
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,152
顽强无比  感染性极强
Resilient. Highly contagious.

20
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,580
你头脑中一旦形成一个想法
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain,

21
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,323
那就几乎无法抹去
it's almost impossible to eradicate.

22
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,541
只要这个想法完整而被理解
An idea that is fully formed, fully understood,

23
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:12,028
就会深深根植在那里
that sticks.

24
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,427
在大脑里的某个地方
Right in there somewhere.

25
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,163
而你这样的人就来窃取吗
For someone like you to steal?

26
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,267
对  在梦境中  你的意识会放松警惕  
Yes. In the dream state, your conscious defenses are lowered...

27
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,868
如此一来你的想法便极易遭到窃取
and that makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft.

28
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:22,269
这就叫做盗梦
It's called extraction.

29
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:26,008
斋藤先生  我们能训练你的潜意识进行自我防御
Mr. Saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself...

30
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:28,676
就算最出色的盗梦人也无计可施
from even the most skilled extractor.

31
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,010
你凭什么这么肯定
How can you do that?

32
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:33,014
因为我就是最出色的盗梦人
Because I am the most skilled extractor.

33
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,010
我知道怎样窥探你的想法并找出你的秘密
I know how to search your mind and find your secrets.

34
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,886
我掌握其中的窍门
I know the tricks.

35
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:39,988
我能教会你  让你即使在睡着时
And I can teach them to you, so that even when you're asleep...

36
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:42,490
也绝不会放松警惕
your defense is never down.

37
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,871
听着  如果你要我帮忙  
Look, if you want my help,

38
00:03:44,872 --> 00:03:47,297
就得完全信任我  对我毫无保留
you're gonna have to be completely open with me.

39
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,833
我得比你的妻子  你的咨询师
I need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife...

40
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:53,301
甚至是任何人  都更了解你的想法
better than your therapist, better than anyone.

41
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,405
如果这是梦  梦里有个藏有你秘密的保险箱
If this is a dream, and you have a safe full of secrets...

42
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,906
我必须知道保险箱里有什么
I need to know what's in that safe.

43
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:02,545
为此你必须对我完全坦诚
In order for this all to work, you need to completely let me in.

44
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,798
祝你们今晚愉快  先生们
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen,

45
00:04:07,644 --> 00:04:10,053
我会考虑一下你们的提议
as I consider your proposal.

46
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,554
他知道了
He knows.

47
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,058
上面是怎么回事
What's going on up there?

48
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,916
斋藤知道了  他在耍我们
Saito knows. He's playing with us.

49
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,652
无所谓  我能找到它  相信我
Doesn't matter. I can get it here. Trust me.

50
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,320
情报就在保险箱里
The information is in the safe.

51
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,656
我提到秘密时  他下意识地盯着它看
He looked right at it when I mentioned secrets.

52
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,058
她来干什么
What's she doing here?

53
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,865
回房间去吧  这里交给我来处理
Just head back to the room. All right? I'll take care of this.

54
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,067
好吧  你最好处理好  别忘了我们的工作
Okay, make sure you do. We're here to work.

55
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:45,182
如果我跳下去  还能活下来吗
If I jumped, would I survive?

56
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,951
掉进海里的话也许还有希望
With a clean dive, perhaps.

57
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:51,785
茉儿  你在这干什么
Mal, what are you doing here?

58
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,155
我以为你会想我
I thought you might be missing me.

59
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,589
你知道我想你
You know that I am.

60
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,628
但我不能再相信你了
But I can't trust you anymore.

61
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,729
那又怎样
So what?

62
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:05,500
看着像是亚瑟的品味
Looks like Arthur's taste.

63
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:09,304
其实是这次的目标喜欢战后英国画家的作品
Actually, the subject is partial to postwar British painters.

64
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,707
请坐吧
Please, have a seat.

65
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:21,882
告诉我
Tell me...

66
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,851
孩子们想我吗
do the children miss me?

67
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,990
想到你无法想象
You can't imagine.

68
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,162
你要做什么
What are you doing?

69
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:36,863
出去透透新鲜空气
Just getting some fresh air.

70
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:39,032
坐那别动  茉儿
Stay where you are, Mal.

71
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,582
见鬼
God, damn it.

72
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:58,011
转过身来
Turn around.

73
00:07:58,178 --> 00:07:59,313
道姆  把枪放下
The gun, Dom.

74
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,623
快点
Please.

75
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,105
把信封交出来  柯布先生
Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

76
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,910
是她告诉你的呢  还是你本来就知道
Did she tell you? Or have you known all along?

77
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:33,316
知道你是来偷东西的  还是我们其实在做梦
That you're here to steal from me, or that we are actually asleep?

78
00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:39,821
告诉我你雇主的名字
I want to know the name of your employer.

79
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:45,695
你也知道在梦里威胁他没用吧  茉儿
Ah, there's no use threatening him in a dream, right, Mal?

80
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,329
那得看你怎么威胁了
That depends on what you're threatening.

81
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,399
杀了他只会让他醒过来
Killing him would just wake him up.

82
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,333
而疼痛...
But pain...

83
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:59,172
他的大脑会感受到疼痛
Pain is in the mind.

84
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,177
从周围的布局来看
And judging by the decor,

85
00:09:01,178 --> 00:09:04,080
我们是在你的梦里吧  亚瑟
we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?

86
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:17,094
搞什么  你醒得太早了 
What are you doing? It's too soon.

87
00:09:17,095 --> 00:09:18,594
我知道  但梦境崩溃了
I know. But the dream's collapsing.

88
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,030
我尽量让斋藤多逗留一会
I'm gonna try to keep Saito under a little bit longer.

89
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,397
我们快得手了
We're almost there.

90
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:40,382
他差点就得手了
He was close. Very close.

91
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,263
拦住他
Stop him!

92
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,258
不起作用  把他叫醒
This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.

93
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:47,015
他醒不过来
He won't wake.

94
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:50,215
机密

95
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:52,786
-让他坠落  -什么
- Give him the kick. - What?

96
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,354
把他推下去
Dunk him.

97
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,267
他昏过去了
He's out.

98
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,640
你是有备而来啊
You came prepared, hmm?

99
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,509
连我的保安主管都不知道这座公寓
Not even my head of security knows this apartment.

100
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,647
你怎么会知道
How did you find it?

101
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,600
像你这种地位的男人
It's difficult for a man of your position

102
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:56,019
要保密这样一个爱巢可不容易
to keep a love nest like this secret...

103
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,720
尤其对方还是有夫之妇
particularly where there's a married woman involved.

104
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,855
-不可能  -但事实摆着  我们在这了
- She would never... - Yet here we are.

105
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,025
-进退两难  -他们慢慢逼近了
- With a dilemma. - They're getting closer.

106
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,962
-你们已经达到目的了  -并没有
- You got what you came for. - Well, that's not true.

107
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,798
你把关键部分藏起来了吧
You left out a key piece of information, didn't you?

108
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:13,168
你知道我们的目的  所以有所保留
You held something back because you knew what we were up to.

109
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:16,204
-但你为何还让我们进来  -算是一次试探
- Question is, why'd you let us in at all? - An audition.

110
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,342
-什么试探  -不重要了  你失败了
- An audition for what? - Doesn't matter. You failed.

111
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:23,210
我们窃取了你脑中所有的情报
We extracted every bit of information you had in there.

112
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:25,913
但你的诡计已被拆穿了
But your deception was obvious.

113
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,614
放了我  你们走吧
So leave me and go.

114
00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:11,227
你还不明白吗  斋藤先生
You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.

115
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,631
雇佣我们的公司  他们可不允许失败
That corporation that hired us, they won't accept failure.

116
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,932
不然我们就死定了
We won't last two days.

117
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,068
柯布
Cobb?

118
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:24,373
看来我只能简单粗暴一下了
Looks like I'm gonna have to do this a little more simply.

119
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:26,498
把你知道的告诉我们 
Tell us what you know!

120
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:28,310
快点告诉我们
Tell us what you know, now!

121
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:34,548
我一直讨厌这条地毯
I've always hated this carpet.

122
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:39,088
它褪色和磨损得这么与众不同
It's stained and frayed in such distinctive ways.

123
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:43,925
但好歹是条羊毛毯子
But very definitely made of wool.

124
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:46,459
可现在...
Right now...

125
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,931
我却躺在一条涤纶毯子上
I'm lying on polyester.

126
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:58,641
也就是说  我不是躺在自己公寓的地毯上
Which means I'm not lying on my carpet, in my apartment.

127
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,777
你果然不负盛名  柯布先生
You have lived up to your reputation, Mr. Cobb.

128
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,246
我依然在做梦
I'm still dreaming.

129
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,754
-进展如何  -不太妙
- How'd it go? - Not good.

130
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:23,266
梦中有梦  真是佩服
Dream within a dream, huh? I'm impressed.

131
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,037
但在我梦里  得由我说了算
But in my dream, you play by my rules.

132
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,470
这么说吧  斋藤先生...
Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito...

133
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:32,038
我们不是在你的梦里
We're not in your dream.

134
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,773
而是在我的梦里
We're in mine.

135
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:45,819
蠢货  你怎么会把地毯搞错
Asshole. How do you mess up the carpet?

136
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,289
-那不是我的错  -你可是筑梦师
- It wasn't my fault. - You're the architect.

137
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,591
我怎么知道他会把他揍得贴在地毯上
I didn't know he was gonna rub his cheek on it!

138
00:14:50,755 --> 00:14:51,857
别吵了
That's enough.

139
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,494
还有你  你究竟在搞什么
You. What the hell was all that?

140
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,865
-我控制住了局势  -是么  那失控岂不是更夸张
- I have it under control. - I'd hate to see you out of control.

141
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,803
没时间争论了  我要在京都下车
We don't have time for this. I'm getting off at Kyoto.

142
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,804
怎么  他又不会查看每节车厢
Why? He's not gonna check every compartment.

143
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,605
没错  但我不喜欢坐火车
Yeah, well, I don't like trains.

144
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,542
听好  各自保重吧
Listen. Every man for himself.

145
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:23,916
你好
Yes, hello?

146
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,720
-爸爸  -爸爸
- Hi, Daddy. - Hi, Dad.

147
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:30,859
小鬼们  你们好吗  过得怎样
Hey, guys. Hey. How are you? How you doing, huh?

148
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,260
-很好  -还好吧
- Good. - Okay, I guess.

149
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:37,167
还好吧  这是谁在说话  是你吗  詹姆斯
Okay? Who's just okay? Is that you, James?

150
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,236
是我  爸爸  你什么时候回家
Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?

151
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,554
不行  亲爱的  我不能回家
Well, I can't, sweetheart. I can't.

152
00:16:44,554 --> 00:16:46,875
还得一阵子  记得吗
Not for a while, remember?

153
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,374
为什么
Why?

154
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:54,286
我说过了  我要工作  不能回家
Look, I told you, I'm away because I'm working, right?

155
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,419
外婆说你再也不会回来了
Grandma says you're never coming back.

156
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,986
菲丽帕  是你吗
Phillipa, is that you?

157
00:17:00,952 --> 00:17:03,290
让外婆听电话好吗
Put Grandma on the phone for me, will you?

158
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,159
她在摇头
She's shaking her head.

159
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:09,797
那我们只能但愿她错了
Well, just hope she's wrong about that.

160
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:11,865
爸爸
Daddy?

161
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:13,600
怎么了  詹姆斯
Yeah, James?

162
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:15,435
妈妈和你在一起吗
Is Mommy with you?

163
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,274
詹姆斯  我们谈过了
James, we talked about this.

164
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,911
妈妈已经不在这了
Mommy's not here anymore.

165
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:26,212
那她在哪里
Where?

166
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,584
好了  孩子们  说再见吧
That's enough, kids. Say bye-bye.

167
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,789
听着  我会让外公带些礼物回去  好吗
Listen, I'm gonna send some presents with Grandpa, all right?

168
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,287
你们要听话... 
And you be good, you be...

169
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,702
-直升机就在房顶  -好
- Our ride's on the roof. - Right.

170
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,041
你没事吧  
Hey, are you okay?

171
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,079
我很好  怎么了
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

172
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,681
我们在梦里时  茉儿出现了
Well, down in the dream, Mal showing up.

173
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:02,918
很抱歉她开枪打了你的腿
Look, I'm, uh, sorry about your leg.

174
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:04,085
不会再这样了
Won't happen again.

175
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,700
情况越来越糟了吧
It's getting worse, isn't it?

176
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,856
我们就事论事好吧  亚瑟
One apology's all you're getting, all right, Arthur?

177
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:10,491
-纳什人呢  -他还没来  要等他吗
- Where's Nash? - He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?

178
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,128
我们早该在2小时前就把
We were supposed to deliver Saito's expansion plans...

179
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,061
斋藤的扩建计划交给科博工程公司
to Cobol Engineering two hours ago

180
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,846
现在他们肯定知道我们失败了
By now, they know we failed.

181
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,466
我们得赶快跑路
It's time we disappear.

182
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,502
-你要去哪里  -布宜诺斯艾利斯
- Where you gonna go? - Buenos Aires.

183
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:22,888
在那里避一阵风头 
I can lie low there,

184
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:25,941
等风平浪静了没准还能揽个活  你呢
maybe sniff out a job when things quiet down. You?

185
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,307
回美国
Stateside.

186
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,008
记得代我问候你家人
Send my regards.

187
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,920
他出卖了你们  跑来求我饶他一命
He sold you out. Thought to come to me and bargain for his life.

188
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:42,888
现在我交给你们处理吧
So I offer you the satisfaction.

189
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:49,364
我不做这种事
It's not the way I deal with things.

190
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,512
-你要对他怎么样  -没什么
- What will you do with him? - Nothing.

191
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:07,414
但科博公司就难说了
But I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.

192
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:24,931
-你想要我们做什么  -植梦
- What do you want from us? - Inception.

193
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,936
-可能吗  -当然不可能
- Is it possible? - Of course not.

194
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,305
你要是能从别人脑中窃取想法
If you can steal an idea from someone's mind...

195
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,340
为何不能反过来植入一个念头
why can't you plant one there instead?

196
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,609
好吧  现在我来对你植入一个想法
Okay, here's me planting an idea in your head.

197
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,292
我说  "不要去想大象" 
I say, "Don't think about elephants".

198
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:39,080
你会想到什么
What are you thinking about?

199
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:40,280
大象
Elephants.

200
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,145
没错  但这不是你的想法  
Right. But it's not your idea,

201
00:19:42,146 --> 00:19:43,618
因为你知道是我灌输给你的
because you know I gave it to you.

202
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:46,788
目标的大脑总能追溯想法的来源
The subject's mind can always trace the genesis of the idea.

203
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:50,157
-不可能假造真实的想法来源  -那不一定
- True inspiration's impossible to fake. - That's not true.

204
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,797
-你能做到吗  -你是在给我选择吗
- Can you do it? - Are you offering me a choice?

205
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,632
因为我自己有办法摆平科博的麻烦
Because I can find my own way to square things with Cobol.

206
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,834
那你自己选择吧
Then you do have a choice.

207
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,769
那我选择离开  先生
Then I choose to leave, sir.

208
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,376
告诉机组你的目的地
Tell the crew where you want to go.

209
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:15,715
柯布先生
Hey, Mr. Cobb.

210
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:25,060
如果让你回家  回到美国的孩子身边  意下如何
How would you like to go home,to America, to your children?

211
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:28,830
这你做不到  没人可以
You can't fix that. No one can.

212
00:20:28,993 --> 00:20:32,233
-比植梦还难吗  -柯布  走吧
- Just like inception. - Cobb, come on.

213
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,872
-这个想法有多复杂  -相当简单
- How complex is the idea? - Simple enough.

214
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:41,397
你要植入对方大脑中的想法
No idea is simple when you need to plant it

215
00:20:41,398 --> 00:20:42,577
不可能简单
in somebody else's mind.

216
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:46,481
我的主要竞争对手是个病入膏肓的老人
My main competitor is an old man in poor health.

217
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:50,419
他的儿子马上就要继承他的公司
His son will soon inherit control of the corporation.

218
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:54,890
我要他决定解散他父亲的商业帝国
I need him to decide to break up his father's empire.

219
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,259
-柯布  我们不要插手  -先等一下
- Cobb, we should walk away from this. - Hold on.

220
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:03,598
如果我愿意干  如果我确实做到了
If I were to do this, if I even could do it...

221
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,665
我需要你的保证
I'd need a guarantee.

222
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:09,103
-我怎么确定你能做到  -你别无选择
- How do I know you can deliver? - You don't.

223
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:11,171
只能相信我
But I can.

224
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:16,346
那么你是想心怀幻想
So do you want to take a leap of faith...

225
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:20,616
还是变成一个老人  心中充满悔恨
or become an old man, filled with regret...

226
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,384
孤零零地等死
waiting to die alone?

227
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,103
集结你的团队吧  柯布先生  
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.

228
00:21:29,104 --> 00:21:30,760
这次可要慎重挑选队友了
And choose your people more wisely.

229
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,701
我知道你有多想回家
Look, I know how much you wanna go home.

230
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,238
但这活我们干不了
This can't be done.

231
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,040
不  可以 
Yes, it can.

232
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,676
只要潜入得足够深
Just have to go deep enough.

233
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,410
你没法确定
You don't know that.

234
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,581
我以前做过
I've done it before.

235
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,948
是对谁
Who'd you do it to?

236
00:22:01,185 --> 00:22:03,188
我们为什么去巴黎
Why are we going to Paris?

237
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,493
我们需要一个新的筑梦师
We're gonna need a new architect.

238
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:25,479
你从来不喜欢你的办公室吧
You never did like your office, did you?

239
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:30,317
那个地方小得根本没法思考
No space to think in that broom cupboard.

240
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:34,421
你来这里安全吗
Is it safe for you to be here?

241
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,058
你也知道  法国和美国间的引渡条款
Extradition between France and the United States...

242
00:22:38,222 --> 00:22:40,460
简直就是官僚主义的噩梦
is a bureaucratic nightmare, you know that.

243
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:41,657
说不定就你这个案子
I think they might find a way

244
00:22:41,657 --> 00:22:43,550
他们会想办法破个例
to make it work in your case.

245
00:22:43,714 --> 00:22:46,785
我买了一些东西
Look, I, uh, brought these for you to...

246
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,222
你有机会就带给孩子们吧
give to the kids when you have a chance.

247
00:22:48,384 --> 00:22:50,989
时不时地送点绒毛玩具
It'll take more than the occasional stuffed animal...

248
00:22:51,154 --> 00:22:54,126
这样做爸爸可不行
to convince those children they still have a father.

249
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,018
我只是尽我所能  
I'm just doing what I know.

250
00:22:56,019 --> 00:22:57,129
这些都是你教我的
I'm doing what you taught me.

251
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,829
我从没教你去偷东西
I never taught you to be a thief.

252
00:22:58,996 --> 00:23:01,200
没错  你教我如何引导别人的思想
No, you taught me to navigate people's minds.

253
00:23:01,364 --> 00:23:02,667
但在那件事以后...
But after what happened...

254
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:04,619
几乎就没什么合法的机会
there weren't a whole lot of legitimate ways

255
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,406
能让我发挥这种技能了
for me to use that skill.

256
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,043
道姆  你来这做什么
What are you doing here, Dom?

257
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:17,549
我想我找到回家的方法了
I think I found a way home.

258
00:23:17,714 --> 00:23:21,287
只要为一些权高位重的人干上一票
It's a job for some very, very powerful people.

259
00:23:21,517 --> 00:23:25,926
我相信他们能彻底撤销对我的指控
People who I believe can fix my charges permanently.

260
00:23:26,723 --> 00:23:27,991
但我要你帮忙
But I need your help.

261
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:31,998
你是来带坏我最好的学生吗
You're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best.

262
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:33,614
你知道我开的条件优越  
You know what I'm offering.

263
00:23:33,615 --> 00:23:35,067
你得让他们自己决定
Let them decide for themselves.

264
00:23:35,232 --> 00:23:36,702
-钱吗  -不仅仅是钱
- Money. - Not just money.

265
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:38,202
你也知道
You remember.

266
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:39,916
那会让我们有机会  
It's the chance to

267
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:41,607
建造大教堂和整座城市
build cathedrals, entire cities...

268
00:23:41,772 --> 00:23:43,541
创造那些现实中从未存在过
things that never existed...

269
00:23:43,707 --> 00:23:46,913
也绝不可能存在的事物
things that couldn't exist in the real world.

270
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:49,406
所以你想要我让其他人
So you want me to let someone else

271
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:52,253
跟你一起走进你的幻想
follow you into your fantasy?

272
00:23:52,415 --> 00:23:54,385
他们不必亲自进入梦境
They don't actually come into the dream.

273
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,025
他们只需设计梦境
They just design the levels

274
00:23:56,028 --> 00:23:57,823
再把详情教给梦主就行
and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.

275
00:23:57,988 --> 00:23:59,223
你自己设计好了
Design it yourself.

276
00:24:01,892 --> 00:24:03,394
茉儿会阻止我
Mal won't let me.

277
00:24:09,598 --> 00:24:11,736
回到现实中来吧  道姆
Come back to reality, Dom.

278
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,642
-求你了  -现实
- Please. - Reality.

279
00:24:16,006 --> 00:24:18,543
我的孩子  也就是你的外孙...
Those kids, your grandchildren...

280
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:21,065
正等着他们的父亲回家
they're waiting for their father to come back home.

281
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,816
对他们来说这才是现实
That's their reality.

282
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,882
而只有完成这最后一次任务
And this job, this last job,

283
00:24:24,883 --> 00:24:26,085
我才能实现这个愿望
that's how I get there.

284
00:24:26,615 --> 00:24:30,255
如果不是走投无路  我绝不会来这求你
I would not be standing here if I knew any other way.

285
00:24:33,422 --> 00:24:36,327
我需要个和我一样出色的筑梦师
I need an architect who's as good as I was.

286
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:42,532
比你更出色
I've got somebody better.

287
00:24:42,699 --> 00:24:43,734
艾莲涅
Ariadne?

288
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,874
这位是柯布先生
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.

289
00:24:49,272 --> 00:24:50,374
很高兴见到你
Pleased to meet you.

290
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:51,710
如果你有时间
If you have a few moments,

291
00:24:51,715 --> 00:24:54,003
柯布先生有份工作给你
Mr. Cobb has a job offer.

292
00:24:54,004 --> 00:24:55,215
他想和你聊几句
He'd like to discuss with you.

293
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:56,414
实习吗
A work placement?

294
00:24:56,813 --> 00:24:58,115
也不算
Not exactly.

295
00:24:58,281 --> 00:24:59,616
我要先测试一下你
I have a test for you.

296
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,420
你不先告诉我是什么工作吗
You're not gonna tell me anything first?

297
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:05,223
在这之前  我得确认你能够胜任
Before I describe the job, I have to know you can do it.

298
00:25:05,389 --> 00:25:08,595
-为什么  -严格来说  这并不合法
- Why? - It's not, strictly speaking, legal.

299
00:25:11,695 --> 00:25:14,697
给你两分钟时间  设计一个
You have two minutes to design a maze

300
00:25:14,697 --> 00:25:16,370
花费一分钟才能解开的迷宫
that it takes one minute to solve.

301
00:25:18,301 --> 00:25:19,436
时间到
Stop.

302
00:25:21,872 --> 00:25:23,074
再试一次
Again.

303
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:26,543
时间到
Stop.

304
00:25:29,713 --> 00:25:31,783
这都太简单了
You're gonna have to do better than that.

305
00:25:44,795 --> 00:25:46,063
这才像话
That's more like it.

306
00:26:06,249 --> 00:26:09,154
都说我们只开发了大脑真正潜力的一小部分
They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential.

307
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,022
但这只是在我们醒着的时候
Now, that's when we're awake.

308
00:26:11,188 --> 00:26:14,160
当睡着时  我们的大脑几乎无所不能
When we're asleep, our mind can do almost anything.

309
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:15,359
比如呢
Such as?

310
00:26:15,524 --> 00:26:17,788
想象一下  你设计一座建筑物时
Imagine you're designing a building.

311
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:19,531
你有意识地设计出每个部分
You consciously create each aspect.

312
00:26:19,695 --> 00:26:22,515
但有时却感觉像是建筑在自行构建
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost creating itself,

313
00:26:22,522 --> 00:26:23,536
明白我的意思吗
if you know what I mean.

314
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:25,669
对  我只需要去发现而已
Yeah, like I'm discovering it.

315
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:28,106
纯粹的灵感  是吧
Genuine inspiration, right?

316
00:26:28,271 --> 00:26:31,610
而在梦里  大脑会连续地保持这样
Now, in a dream, our mind continuously does this.

317
00:26:31,775 --> 00:26:36,416
创造和感知  这两个过程同步发生
We create and perceive our world simultaneously.

318
00:26:36,579 --> 00:26:38,039
而我们的大脑是如此神奇  
And our mind does this so well

319
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,986
以至于我们自己根本没意识到
that we don't even know it's happening.

320
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,889
这么一来我们就能直接进入这个过程
That allows us to get right in the middle of that process.

321
00:26:43,053 --> 00:26:45,424
-怎么做  -由我们来创造
- How? - By taking over the creating part.

322
00:26:45,588 --> 00:26:47,224
这就是你的工作
Now, this is where I need you.

323
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,761
你创造一个梦境
You create the world of the dream.

324
00:26:49,926 --> 00:26:52,655
我们把目标带入这个梦境
We bring the subject into that dream,

325
00:26:52,665 --> 00:26:55,303
这个梦境里则会充满他们的潜意识
and they fill it with their subconscious.

326
00:26:55,465 --> 00:26:58,684
一个梦境的细节要有多逼真
How could I ever acquire enough detail

327
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:00,141
才能让对方相信自己身处现实
to make them think that it's reality?

328
00:27:00,303 --> 00:27:03,776
我们做梦时总是感觉很真实吧
Well, dreams, they feel real while we're in them, right?

329
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,793
只有等我们醒来后
It's only when we wake up

330
00:27:05,794 --> 00:27:07,646
才会意识到不对劲
that we realize something was actually strange.

331
00:27:09,112 --> 00:27:10,514
问你个问题吧
Let me ask you a question.

332
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,086
你从不记得梦的开头吧
You never really remember the beginning of a dream, do you?

333
00:27:14,251 --> 00:27:17,290
总是突然就这么置身其中
You always wind up right in the middle of what's going on.

334
00:27:17,454 --> 00:27:18,489
我想是吧
I guess, yeah.

335
00:27:18,654 --> 00:27:20,224
那我们是怎么来这的
So how did we end up here?

336
00:27:20,623 --> 00:27:22,693
我们刚从...
Well, we just came from the, uh...

337
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:26,332
仔细想想  艾莲涅  你怎么来这的
Think about it, Ariadne. How did you get here?

338
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,833
你现在哪里
Where are you right now?

339
00:27:32,135 --> 00:27:33,303
我们在做梦吗
We're dreaming?

340
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,908
你其实正睡在工作坊中央
You're in the middle of the workshop, sleeping.

341
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:39,044
这是你分享梦境的第一课  冷静
This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.

342
00:28:16,379 --> 00:28:18,516
如果这只是做梦  你为什么要遮挡...
If it's just a dream, then why are you covering...

343
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,887
因为这绝不仅仅只是个梦
Because it's never just a dream, is it?

344
00:28:22,052 --> 00:28:23,435
玻璃刺在脸上的感觉生疼
And a face full of glass hurts like hell.

345
00:28:23,445 --> 00:28:25,358
你做梦时  感觉是真实的
When you're in it, it feels real.

346
00:28:25,522 --> 00:28:27,726
所以军队开发了分享梦境系统
That's why the military developed dream sharing.

347
00:28:27,891 --> 00:28:30,245
士兵能通过这个程序
It was a training program for soldiers to shoot,

348
00:28:30,255 --> 00:28:31,598
身临其境地射击  格斗和搏杀
stab and strangle each other...

349
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,896
而不会受到伤害
and then wake up.

350
00:28:33,196 --> 00:28:34,999
筑梦师的工作是什么
How did architects become involved?

351
00:28:35,165 --> 00:28:37,904
总得有人去设计梦境吧
Well, someone had to design the dreams, right?

352
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:41,372
再给我们五分钟吧
Why don't you give us another five minutes?

353
00:28:41,538 --> 00:28:42,640
五分钟
Five minutes?

354
00:28:44,007 --> 00:28:46,344
怎么会  我们少说也谈了一个小时
What? We were talking for, like, at least an hour.

355
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:48,746
你做梦时  大脑运转速度加快
In a dream, your mind functions more quickly...

356
00:28:48,912 --> 00:28:51,750
所以时间相对变慢
therefore time seems to feel more slow.

357
00:28:51,915 --> 00:28:55,288
现实中的五分钟  相当于梦境里的一小时
Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream.

358
00:28:56,019 --> 00:28:59,091
何不看看你在五分钟内能做些什么
Why don't you see what you can get up to in five minutes?

359
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:07,934
基本布局有了  书店  咖啡店
You've got the basic layout. Bookstore, cafe?

360
00:29:08,098 --> 00:29:09,767
该有的东西差不多都有了
Almost everything else is here too.

361
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:12,871
-这些人是谁  -我潜意识中的映射
- Who are the people? - Projections of my subconscious.

362
00:29:13,036 --> 00:29:14,204
-你的吗  -对
- Yours? - Yes.

363
00:29:14,371 --> 00:29:16,908
记住  你是梦主  你创造了梦境
Remember, you are the dreamer. You build this world.

364
00:29:17,073 --> 00:29:19,744
而我是目标  梦境里充满了我的潜意识
I am the subject. My mind populates it.

365
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:21,811
你还可以和我的潜意识交谈
You can literally talk to my subconscious.

366
00:29:21,978 --> 00:29:24,882
这也是盗取目标秘密的方法之一
That's one of the ways we extract information from the subject.

367
00:29:25,048 --> 00:29:26,316
除此之外呢
How else do you do it?

368
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,416
你可以设计一个安全场所
By creating something secure,

369
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:30,490
比如银行金库  或是监狱
like a bank vault or a jail.

370
00:29:30,654 --> 00:29:34,395
重要信息就会自动存入其中
The mind automatically fills it with information it's trying to protect.

371
00:29:34,557 --> 00:29:35,535
明白了吗
You understand?

372
00:29:35,995 --> 00:29:38,957
-你再潜入梦境去偷吗  -这个嘛...
- Then you break in and steal it? - Well...

373
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:43,026
我本以为梦境该基于视觉
I guess I thought that the dream's space should be all about the visual,

374
00:29:43,034 --> 00:29:45,772
但其实更重要的是去感觉
but it's more about the feel of it.

375
00:29:45,788 --> 00:29:48,059
我想知道  如果我颠覆了
My question is what happens when you

376
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:50,708
物理规律  会有什么后果
start messing with the physics of it all?

377
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:35,666
-很厉害吧  -是啊
- It's something, isn't it? - Yes, it is.

378
00:30:58,971 --> 00:31:00,878
他们为什么都看着我
Why are they all looking at me?

379
00:31:00,885 --> 00:31:04,934
因为我的潜意识觉得这是别人创造的梦境
Because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world.

380
00:31:04,944 --> 00:31:06,261
你改建得越离谱
The more you change things,

381
00:31:06,261 --> 00:31:09,048
映射就会越早如潮水般涌向你
the quicker the projections start to converge on you.

382
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:10,058
这是什么意思 
Converge?

383
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:12,607
他们一旦察觉外来入侵的梦主
They sensed the foreign nature of the dreamer.

384
00:31:12,614 --> 00:31:15,722
就会像白血球抵抗感染那般攻击对方
They attack like white blood cells fighting an infection.

385
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,917
他们会攻击我们吗 
Are they gonna attack us?

386
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,104
不  只攻击你
No, actually, just you.

387
00:31:25,101 --> 00:31:26,773
这样很棒  但我也说了 
This is great. But I'm telling you,

388
00:31:26,774 --> 00:31:28,724
如果你再这么继续下去...
if you keep changing things like this...

389
00:31:32,213 --> 00:31:35,237
受不了  就不能让你的潜意识冷静点么
Gees! Mind telling your subconscious to take it easy?

390
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:38,975
这可是我的潜意识  我自己没法控制
It's my subconscious, remember, I can't control it.

391
00:32:31,686 --> 00:32:33,549
佩服
Very impressive.

392
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:48,491
我认识这座桥  这是现实中的场所吧
I know this bridge. This place is real, isn't it?

393
00:32:48,507 --> 00:32:50,912
对  我每天穿过桥去学校
Yeah, I cross it everyday to get to the college.

394
00:32:50,923 --> 00:32:52,879
绝不能重建你记忆里的场景
Never recreate places from your memory,

395
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,346
必须创造新的东西
always imagine new places.

396
00:32:54,358 --> 00:32:56,442
你总得借用熟悉的东西吧
Well, you gotta draft from stuff you know, right?

397
00:32:56,453 --> 00:32:57,700
只能借用细节...
Only use details, uh...

398
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,817
比如路灯啊电话亭啊  但绝不能复制整块地方
A street lamp, or a phone booth, never entire areas.

399
00:33:00,831 --> 00:33:01,645
为什么 
Why not?

400
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,071
因为借用记忆中的场景塑造梦境
Because building a dream from your memory...

401
00:33:03,085 --> 00:33:06,687
极易让你迷失何为梦境何为现实
is the easiest way to lose your grasp on  what's real and what is a dream.

402
00:33:06,704 --> 00:33:08,687
-你有过这种经历吗  -听着
- Is that what happened to you? - Listen to me,

403
00:33:08,705 --> 00:33:10,958
这和我无关  懂吗
this has nothing to do with me, understand?

404
00:33:10,995 --> 00:33:13,395
所以你要我来帮你筑梦吗
Is that why you need me to build your dreams?

405
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:15,510
放开她  走开
Get off of her. Back off.

406
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,446
-滚开  -别碰我
- Back off! - No!

407
00:33:16,642 --> 00:33:17,835
别碰她
Get off of her!

408
00:33:18,836 --> 00:33:20,100
茉儿
Mal!

409
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:23,332
把我叫醒  快把我叫醒 
Wake me up! Wake me up!

410
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:24,706
茉儿
Mal! Mal!

411
00:33:24,861 --> 00:33:26,839
把我叫醒
Wake me up! Wake me up!

412
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,457
看着我  你没事了  没事了
Hey, hey, hey! Look at me. You're okey? You're okey?

413
00:33:32,487 --> 00:33:35,535
为什么我醒不过来
Why... why wouldn't I wake up?

414
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,309
因为设定的时间还没到
Because there was still some time on the clock,

415
00:33:37,321 --> 00:33:39,553
除非你在梦里死去  不然没法提前醒来
and you can't wake up within a dream unless you die.

416
00:33:39,598 --> 00:33:41,588
-她需要个图腾  -什么
- She'll need a totem. - What?

417
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:43,454
图腾是个小的私人...
A totem is a small personal...

418
00:33:43,457 --> 00:33:46,032
你的潜意识可真厉害啊  柯布
That's some subconscious you've got in you, Cobb.

419
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:47,546
还是个美人呢 
She's a real charmer!

420
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:49,496
看来你见过柯布夫人了
Oh, I see you met Mrs. Cobb.

421
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,568
-那是他妻子吗  -对  话说图腾...
- She's his wife? - Yeah. So... a totem,

422
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:54,631
你需要一个小巧的物件
you need a small object potentially heavy,

423
00:33:54,631 --> 00:33:56,632
能够一直带在身边
something could have on you all the time

424
00:33:56,645 --> 00:33:58,286
-不能让别人知道  -像硬币吗
- that no one else knows. - Like a coin?

425
00:33:58,293 --> 00:34:01,817
不  得更独特才行
No, it must be more unique than that.

426
00:34:01,818 --> 00:34:04,084
这是一个注铅的骰子
This is a loaded die.

427
00:34:04,352 --> 00:34:07,406
不  你不能碰  不然就没意义了
No, I can't let you touch it, that would defeat the purpose.

428
00:34:07,414 --> 00:34:11,972
只有我知道这个特制骰子的重心和重量
Only I know the balance and the weight of this particular loaded die.

429
00:34:11,982 --> 00:34:13,685
只有这样  当你看着自己的图腾
That way, when you look at your totem,

430
00:34:13,716 --> 00:34:18,106
你才能确信自己不在别人的梦里
you know, beyond a doubt, that you're not in someone else's dream.

431
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:21,237
我不知道...
I... I don't know...

432
00:34:21,244 --> 00:34:25,016
你是不想知道还是的确不知道
if you can't see what's going on, or if you just don't want to,

433
00:34:25,024 --> 00:34:28,618
柯布的内心深处隐藏着很严重的问题
but Cobb has some serious problems that he's tried to bury down there.

434
00:34:28,641 --> 00:34:33,555
我可不想对这种人敞开心扉
And I'm not about to just open my mind to someone like that.

435
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:39,795
她会回来的
She'll be back.

436
00:34:39,817 --> 00:34:42,592
我还从没见过有人能学得这么快
I've never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before.

437
00:34:42,607 --> 00:34:45,284
现实已经不能满足她了
Reality is not gonna be enough for her now.

438
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:47,138
当她回来时...
When she comes back...

439
00:34:47,576 --> 00:34:50,351
你就教她设计迷宫
when she comes back, you're gonna help her building mazes.

440
00:34:50,365 --> 00:34:52,678
-那你呢  -我要去找伊姆斯
- Where're you gonna be? - I gotta go visit Eames.

441
00:34:52,689 --> 00:34:54,856
伊姆斯  他在蒙巴萨[肯尼亚港口城市]
Eames? Now he's in Mombasa.

442
00:34:54,857 --> 00:34:56,302
那里可是科博公司的老巢
It's Cobol's backyard.

443
00:34:56,315 --> 00:34:57,720
必须冒这个险 
It's a necessary risk.

444
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,407
神偷多了去了
There's plenty of good thieves.

445
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:03,971
我们不仅需要小偷  我们需要个伪装者
We don't just need a thief. We need a forger.

446
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,469
你再怎么搓也生不出钱来
You can rub them together all you want, they're not gonna breed.

447
00:35:15,484 --> 00:35:17,021
那可不一定
You never know.

448
00:35:17,341 --> 00:35:19,420
去喝一杯吧
I'll get you a drink.

449
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,783
你请客
You're buying.

450
00:35:29,249 --> 00:35:31,618
-你的拼写还是这么差  -滚你的
- Your spelling hasn't improved. - Piss off.

451
00:35:31,767 --> 00:35:34,990
-书写怎么样了  -好使着呢
- How's your handwriting? - Versatile.

452
00:35:35,022 --> 00:35:37,240
-那就好  -多谢
- Good. - Thank you very much.

453
00:35:37,506 --> 00:35:39,424
植梦
Inception.

454
00:35:39,584 --> 00:35:42,448
在你费心告诉我这不可能前...
Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...

455
00:35:42,456 --> 00:35:45,605
这当然可能  只是难得要死
No, it's perfectly possible. It's just bloody difficult.

456
00:35:45,774 --> 00:35:47,011
只是难吗
Just difficult?

457
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:49,640
亚瑟总说这不可能
Arthur keeps telling me it can't be done.

458
00:35:49,654 --> 00:35:52,622
哈  亚瑟  你还和那个扑克脸在一起么
Hmm... Arthur. You're still working with that stick-in-the-mud?

459
00:35:52,636 --> 00:35:54,704
作为前哨来说他很优秀  是吧 
He's good at what he does, right?

460
00:35:54,705 --> 00:35:56,946
是最优秀的  只是缺乏想象力
Oh, the best. He has no imagination.

461
00:35:56,978 --> 00:35:59,367
-你就不同  -听着  如果你要植梦
- Not like you. - Listen, if you wanna perform inception,

462
00:35:59,394 --> 00:36:02,985
-必须要有想象力  -问你个问题
- you need imagination. - Let me ask you something,

463
00:36:02,998 --> 00:36:05,874
-你以前做过吗  -我们试过
- have you done it before? - We tried it.

464
00:36:05,902 --> 00:36:08,565
想法都就位了  但对方没有上钩
We got the idea in place, but it didn't take.

465
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:10,333
你们植入得不够深吗
You didn't plant it deep enough?

466
00:36:10,356 --> 00:36:12,243
这不只是深度问题
It's not just about depth, you know...

467
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,107
植入的想法必须极其简单
you need the simplest version of the idea,

468
00:36:14,107 --> 00:36:16,730
让目标觉得这是自然而生的想法
in order it to grow naturally in the subject's mind.

469
00:36:16,733 --> 00:36:18,204
这可是相当微妙的艺术
That's a very subtle art.

470
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,976
你要植入的想法是什么
So what is this idea that you need to plant?

471
00:36:20,993 --> 00:36:23,444
我们要让一个大公司的继承人
We need the heir of a major corporation

472
00:36:23,445 --> 00:36:25,330
决定瓦解他父亲的企业帝国
to dissolve his father's empire.

473
00:36:25,346 --> 00:36:27,847
这么说吧  关于反垄断的看法
Well, you see right there, you have various political motivations of...

474
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:31,276
有各种各样的政治动机  诸如此类
anti-monopolistic sentiments and so forth, and all of that stuff.

475
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:31,971
但是所有的一切
That's all.

476
00:36:32,001 --> 00:36:35,026
最终还是取决于目标的偏好  明白吗
It's really at the mercy of your subject's prejudice, you see?

477
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:37,783
你只须着眼于最基本的东西
All you have to do is to start with the absolute basic.

478
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:42,199
-是什么  -他和父亲之间的关系
- Which is what? - The relationship with the father.

479
00:36:43,499 --> 00:36:45,672
-你有药剂师了吗  -还没有
- Do you have a chemist? - No, not yet.

480
00:36:45,682 --> 00:36:46,414
那好
Alright.

481
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:50,076
这儿有个人  叫尤瑟夫・皮耶罗
Okey, there's a man here, Yusuf Pierro.

482
00:36:50,103 --> 00:36:52,889
他配制的药剂独一无二
He formulates his own versions of the compounds.

483
00:36:52,898 --> 00:36:54,705
你什么时候带我去见见
When are you taking me there?

484
00:36:54,706 --> 00:36:56,255
你先甩掉跟踪你的人吧
Once you've lost your tail.

485
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:57,567
吧台边的那家伙
Man at the bar.

486
00:36:57,568 --> 00:36:58,962
科博公司开的赏金
Cobol engineering.

487
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:01,566
对我的悬赏要求是死是活
That price on my head, was that "dead or alive?"

488
00:37:01,572 --> 00:37:03,756
不记得了  看他开不开枪吧
I don't remember. Let's see if he starts shooting.

489
00:37:04,066 --> 00:37:07,083
你替我引开他  我们半小时后
Run interference, I'll meet you downstairs in the bar in, say uh...

490
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:07,951
酒吧楼下见吧
say half an hour?

491
00:37:07,963 --> 00:37:10,635
-再回到这里吗  -最危险的地方最安全
- Be back here? - It's the last place they'd expect.

492
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:13,514
好吧
Hum-hmm. Well...

493
00:37:14,952 --> 00:37:17,659
弗雷迪  你是弗雷迪・赛文斯吗
Freddy, Freddy Savens?

494
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,207
天啊  真的是你吗
My God, it's you, isn't it?

495
00:37:20,607 --> 00:37:23,283
看来我认错人了
No, it isn't.

496
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,756
这下你不是在做梦了吧
You're not dreaming now, are you?

497
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,844
那边
There!

498
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:56,914
没事
Okey.

499
00:38:04,105 --> 00:38:06,585
咖啡  要一杯咖啡
Oh, uh... cafe. One... one cafe.

500
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:19,817
一杯咖啡
One cafe.

501
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:21,534
一杯咖啡
One cafe.

502
00:39:17,493 --> 00:39:19,429
要搭车么  柯布先生
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

503
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:22,170
你怎么会在蒙巴萨
What're you doing here in Mombasa?

504
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:24,374
我得保护我的投资对象
I need to protect my investments.

505
00:39:26,863 --> 00:39:29,763
甩个人就这么难吗
Ahh, so this is your idea of losing a tail, uh?

506
00:39:29,793 --> 00:39:31,228
还有一伙人
Different tail.

507
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:41,243
柯布说过你会回来
Cobb said you'd be back.

508
00:39:42,164 --> 00:39:44,277
我也不想  但... 
I tried not to come. But...

509
00:39:44,278 --> 00:39:45,995
你已经无法自拔了
But there's nothing quite like it.

510
00:39:46,007 --> 00:39:50,577
只是...纯粹的创造
It's just... pure creation.

511
00:39:50,695 --> 00:39:53,710
我们来看一些矛盾建筑吧
Shall we take a look at some paradoxical architecture?

512
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:55,393
如果你要建造三层不同的梦境
You're gonna have to master a few tricks,

513
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,569
就得掌握一些窍门
if you're gonna build three complete dream levels.

514
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,281
抱歉
Excuse me.

515
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,902
什么样的窍门
What kind of tricks?

516
00:40:00,943 --> 00:40:04,485
在梦里  你可以把建筑设计成不可能图形
In a dream, you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes.

517
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:06,677
这样你就能造出闭合的循环
That lets you create closed loops,

518
00:40:06,692 --> 00:40:11,013
好比彭罗斯阶梯  无止尽的阶梯
like the Penrose steps, the infinite staircases.

519
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:15,938
看见了吗
See?

520
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:20,818
矛盾建筑
Paradox.

521
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:22,898
这样的闭合循环
So a closed loop like that will help you

522
00:40:22,898 --> 00:40:25,302
有助你分辨梦境的边缘
disguise the boundaries of the dream you create.

523
00:40:25,313 --> 00:40:27,860
梦境的每一层需要多大
But how big do these levels have to be?

524
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:31,210
随你  一个楼面一幢大楼或是一座城市
It could be anything from the floor of a building to an entire city.

525
00:40:31,218 --> 00:40:32,623
但梦境必须非常复杂
But they have to be complicated

526
00:40:32,623 --> 00:40:34,707
能让我们躲避映射的追踪
enough that we can hide from the projections.

527
00:40:34,721 --> 00:40:35,727
比如一个迷宫吗
A maze?

528
00:40:35,728 --> 00:40:37,741
对  迷宫  迷宫越好...
Right, a maze, and the better the maze...

529
00:40:37,749 --> 00:40:40,581
映射就越难找到我们吗
Then the longer we have before the projections catch us?

530
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:44,524
-没错  -我的潜意识就很有礼貌
- Exactly. - My subconscious seems polite enough.

531
00:40:44,551 --> 00:40:46,194
等着瞧  他们会翻脸不认人
You wait, they'll turn ugly.

532
00:40:46,205 --> 00:40:49,138
没人喜欢别人在自己的大脑里乱窜
No one likes to feel someone else messing around in their mind.

533
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,642
柯布不能再筑梦了吧
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?

534
00:40:53,514 --> 00:40:55,573
就算他可以  他也不愿意了
I don't know if he can't, but he won't.

535
00:40:55,584 --> 00:40:58,303
他觉得他不知道梦境的话会更保险
He thinks it's safer if he doesn't know the layouts.

536
00:40:58,325 --> 00:40:59,309
为什么  
Why?

537
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:02,099
他不愿意说  我想是因为茉儿吧
He won't tell me. I think it's Mal.

538
00:41:02,158 --> 00:41:04,624
-他前妻吗  -不  不是
- His ex-wife? - No, not his ex.

539
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:08,372
-他们还在一起吗  -不  她...
- They're still together? - No, she...

540
00:41:08,865 --> 00:41:10,474
她已经死了
she's dead.

541
00:41:12,033 --> 00:41:15,670
你看到的她不过是他脑中的映射
What you just see in there is just his projection of her.

542
00:41:18,503 --> 00:41:23,069
-她在现实中怎么样  -她很迷人
- What was she like in real life? - She was lovely.

543
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,124
-你要找药剂师吗  -对
- You're seeking a chemist? - Yes.

544
00:41:28,176 --> 00:41:31,126
任务需要配制药剂吗
To formulate compounds for a job.

545
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:33,144
还得和我们一起进入梦境  
And to go into the field with us.

546
00:41:33,145 --> 00:41:35,913
不  我从不进入梦境  柯布先生 
No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.

547
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:39,888
你得在梦里根据需要定做药剂
We need you there to tailor compounds specific to our needs.

548
00:41:39,899 --> 00:41:41,958
-有什么要求  -足够深度
- Which are? - Great depth.

549
00:41:41,977 --> 00:41:46,512
梦中梦吗  两层梦境
A dream within a dream? two levels?

550
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:50,531
-三层  -这不可能
- Three. - Not possible.

551
00:41:50,557 --> 00:41:52,836
这种多层梦境太不稳定了
That many dreams within dreams is too unstable.

552
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:57,024
有可能  只需要加镇静剂
It is possible. You just have to add a sedative.

553
00:41:57,037 --> 00:42:00,488
强效镇静剂
A powerful sedative.

554
00:42:01,392 --> 00:42:03,769
-一共几个人  -五个
- How many team members? - Five.

555
00:42:03,846 --> 00:42:05,359
六个
Six.

556
00:42:06,335 --> 00:42:09,185
只有我和你们一起进入梦境
The only way to know you've done the job

557
00:42:09,186 --> 00:42:10,769
才能确定你是否完成了任务
is if I go in with you.

558
00:42:10,782 --> 00:42:12,984
这种工作可不能带观光客 
There's no room for tourists on a job like this,

559
00:42:12,985 --> 00:42:14,012
斋藤先生
Mr. Saito.

560
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,882
那这次得破例了
This time it seems there is.

561
00:42:17,345 --> 00:42:21,441
先试试这个吧  我每天都用
This, I think, is a good place to start. I use it everyday.

562
00:42:21,475 --> 00:42:25,417
-用来做什么  -来  我带你看看
- What for? - Here, I'll show you.

563
00:42:28,615 --> 00:42:33,458
-你得做好心理准备  -你先请
- Perhaps, you will not want to see. - After you.

564
00:42:43,011 --> 00:42:45,886
十个...十二个  全部连在一起  
Ten... twelve, all connected.

565
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,526
天啊
Bloody hell!

566
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:49,140
他们每天来这分享梦境
They come here everyday to share the dream.

567
00:42:50,877 --> 00:42:53,998
看见了吗  非常稳定
You see? Very stable.

568
00:42:59,218 --> 00:43:03,506
-他们每天做梦多久  -三四个小时吧
- How long do they dream for? - Three, four hours, each day.

569
00:43:03,868 --> 00:43:06,245
-梦里是多久  -在这种药效下
- And the dream time? - With this compound?

570
00:43:06,271 --> 00:43:08,848
每人每天四十个小时
About 40 hours, each and every day.

571
00:43:08,862 --> 00:43:10,463
他们为什么这么做
Why do they do it?

572
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:12,211
你来说吧  柯布先生
Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

573
00:43:13,731 --> 00:43:14,840
在你用药一阵子后
After a while,

574
00:43:14,841 --> 00:43:16,444
不用药就没法做梦了
it becomes the only way you can dream.

575
00:43:16,492 --> 00:43:18,830
你还做梦吗  柯布先生  
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

576
00:43:18,831 --> 00:43:20,731
他们每天来这做梦吗
They come here everyday to sleep?

577
00:43:20,763 --> 00:43:25,726
不  他们是为了醒过来
No, they come to be woken up.

578
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:33,488
梦境已成了他们的现实  谁又能说不是呢
The dream has become their reality. Who are you to say otherwise, uh?

579
00:43:36,538 --> 00:43:38,690
让我见识一下吧
Let's see what you can do.

580
00:43:51,424 --> 00:43:55,842
你知道怎么找到我  你知道你该怎么做
You know how to find me. You know what you have to do.

581
00:44:00,855 --> 00:44:02,511
很鲜明吧
Sharp? No?

582
00:44:17,566 --> 00:44:21,882
你没事吧  柯布先生  
Are you all right, Mr. Cobb?

583
00:44:21,883 --> 00:44:24,473
放心  我没事
Yeah, yeah. I'm just fine.

584
00:44:32,786 --> 00:44:34,512
罗伯特・费舍
Robert Fischer,

585
00:44:34,513 --> 00:44:36,886
费舍明日能源集团的继承人
heir to the Fischer-Morrow Energy Conglomerate.

586
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:39,795
你和这位费舍先生有何瓜葛
What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?

587
00:44:39,796 --> 00:44:40,698
这不关你的事
That's not your concern.

588
00:44:40,906 --> 00:44:42,656
斋藤先生  这...
Mr. Saito, this...

589
00:44:42,657 --> 00:44:45,379
这可不是一般的商业间谍活动
this isn't your typical corporate espionage.

590
00:44:45,385 --> 00:44:48,618
你让我植梦  我希望你明白...
You asked me for inception, I do hope you understand that...

591
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:51,650
这其中的严重性
the gravity of that request.

592
00:44:51,669 --> 00:44:54,748
我们会在对方脑中植入一个想法
The seed that we plant in this man's mind will grow into an idea.

593
00:44:54,766 --> 00:44:59,087
这个想法会决定他的行为
This idea would define him. It may come to change...

594
00:44:59,145 --> 00:45:01,521
可能会彻底改变他的人生
it may come to change everything about him.

595
00:45:01,547 --> 00:45:05,782
我们是仅存的能和他们抗衡的能源公司
We're the last company standing between them and total energy dominance.

596
00:45:05,808 --> 00:45:08,073
但我们快撑不住了
We can no longer compete.

597
00:45:08,088 --> 00:45:11,572
很快他们将控制半个世界的能源供给
Soon they'll control the energy supply of half the world.

598
00:45:11,596 --> 00:45:14,901
事实上  他们将成为新兴超级帝国
In effect, they become a new superpower.

599
00:45:15,282 --> 00:45:18,477
全世界都需要罗伯特・费舍
The world needs Robert Fischer

600
00:45:18,478 --> 00:45:19,188
改变主意
to change his mind.

601
00:45:19,193 --> 00:45:20,833
这要看我们的了
That's where we come in.

602
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:23,299
罗伯特・费舍
How is Robert Fischer's

603
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:23,815
和他父亲的关系如何
relationship with his father?

604
00:45:23,852 --> 00:45:27,110
传言他们之间的关系有些复杂
Rumor is their relationship is quite complicated.

605
00:45:27,128 --> 00:45:29,875
但光靠传言可不够  是吧
But we can't work based solely on rumor, can we?

606
00:45:29,887 --> 00:45:31,319
你能让我接近这个男人吗
Can you get me access to this man here,

607
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,229
布朗宁
Browning?

608
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:35,573
老费舍的左膀右臂
Fischer senior's right-hand man,

609
00:45:35,574 --> 00:45:37,286
小费舍的教父
Fischer junior's godfather.

610
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:40,729
应该不难  只要你有合适的推荐信
It should be possible, if you can get the right references.

611
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:45,572
搞推荐信可是我的专长  斋藤先生
References are something of a speciality for me, Mr. Saito.

612
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,362
这里还有未解决的事项
I'm not smelling settlement here.

613
00:45:48,382 --> 00:45:50,063
-去搞定它  -布朗宁先生
- Take them down. - Mr. Browning,

614
00:45:50,094 --> 00:45:53,213
莫里斯・费舍的原则之一
Maurice Fischer's policy is always one of

615
00:45:53,214 --> 00:45:54,427
就是避免一切诉讼
avoiding litigation.

616
00:45:56,713 --> 00:45:59,417
那我们是不是应该把你的想法
Well, shall we voice your concerns

617
00:45:59,418 --> 00:46:01,497
直接告诉莫里斯
with Maurice directly?

618
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,393
没那个必要吧
Not sure if that's necessary.

619
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:05,449
不  我觉得有必要
No, no, no. I think we should.

620
00:46:26,793 --> 00:46:28,616
他怎么样了
How is he?

621
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,991
我也不想因琐事而麻烦他  但...
I don't wanna bother him unnecessarily, but...

622
00:46:32,296 --> 00:46:34,753
罗伯特  我告诉过你
Robert, I've told you to

623
00:46:34,754 --> 00:46:36,454
别让那些该死的...
keep out the damn...

624
00:46:36,822 --> 00:46:37,855
照做就是了
Just do it!

625
00:46:37,856 --> 00:46:40,182
你不适合讲话  费舍先生
No, don't speak, Mr. Fischer.

626
00:46:40,826 --> 00:46:45,788
总是不照我说的做
Never... never do thing what I asked.

627
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:48,218
出去吧
Leave town.

628
00:46:55,292 --> 00:46:58,647
这一定是他宝贵的回忆
Must be a cherished memory of this.

629
00:46:58,658 --> 00:47:03,509
我把相框放在他床边  他甚至都没注意到
I put it beside his bed. He hasn't even noticed it.

630
00:47:03,808 --> 00:47:08,185
罗伯特  我们得谈谈委托书的问题了
Robert, we need to talk about the power of attorney.

631
00:47:08,185 --> 00:47:10,932
我知道现在不合适...
I know this is hard for you...

632
00:47:10,949 --> 00:47:12,774
现在不行  彼得叔叔
Not now, uncle Peter.

633
00:47:12,775 --> 00:47:14,486
但刻不容缓  我们得开始...
But it's imperative that we start to...

634
00:47:17,235 --> 00:47:19,463
秃鹰在盘旋
The vultures are circling.

635
00:47:19,474 --> 00:47:21,621
莫里斯・费舍病得越重
It is the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,

636
00:47:21,621 --> 00:47:23,930
彼得・布朗宁就越强大
The more powerful Peter Browning becomes.

637
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:27,014
我充分观察了布朗宁
I've had ample opportunity to observe Browning,

638
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:31,238
记下了他的模样  行为模式和习惯等等
adopt his physical presence, study his mannerisms, so on and so forth.

639
00:47:31,453 --> 00:47:33,523
所以在梦境的第一层  
So now, in the first layer of the dream,

640
00:47:33,524 --> 00:47:35,298
我可以模仿布朗宁
I can impersonate Browning,

641
00:47:35,399 --> 00:47:38,764
并给费舍的大脑灌输暗示
and suggest the concept to Fischer's conscious mind.

642
00:47:38,824 --> 00:47:40,814
当我们带他进入更深一层
Then, when we take him a level deeper,

643
00:47:40,826 --> 00:47:42,974
他脑中产生的布朗宁的映射
his own projection of Browning should...

644
00:47:42,974 --> 00:47:45,011
会把这些信息反馈给他自己
should feed that right back to him.

645
00:47:45,032 --> 00:47:48,089
-让他觉得这是自己的想法  -没错
- So he gives himself the idea? - Precisely.

646
00:47:48,123 --> 00:47:51,312
只能这么做  必须是自发生成的想法
That's the only way it will stick. It has to seem self-generated.

647
00:47:51,323 --> 00:47:54,261
伊姆斯  不错嘛
Eames, I am impressed.

648
00:47:54,509 --> 00:47:57,968
能得到你的赞赏
Your condescension, as always,

649
00:47:57,969 --> 00:47:59,698
我真是受宠若惊  亚瑟  感激不尽
is much appreciated, Arthur. Thank you.

650
00:48:19,516 --> 00:48:21,865
你一个人进入梦境吗
Were you going under on your own?

651
00:48:21,907 --> 00:48:25,660
不  我就是做些实验
No, no. I was just, uh...  just running some experiments.

652
00:48:25,682 --> 00:48:27,756
没想到这里还有人  所以...
I didn't realize anyone was here. So...

653
00:48:27,763 --> 00:48:30,447
嗯  其实我在弄我的图腾
Yeah, I was just... I was working on my totem, actually.

654
00:48:30,477 --> 00:48:32,292
给我看看
Here, let me take a look.

655
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:35,292
你学得还真快
So you're learning, huh?

656
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:38,872
这种鉴别现实的方法好优雅啊
An elegant solution for keeping track of reality.

657
00:48:39,582 --> 00:48:42,195
-是你的主意吗  -不  其实...
- Was it your idea? - No, it was, uh...

658
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:44,708
其实是茉儿的主意  这个...
It was Mal's, actually. This is...

659
00:48:44,727 --> 00:48:46,241
这个陀螺以前是她的
This one was hers.

660
00:48:46,241 --> 00:48:51,033
陀螺在梦里转起来就不会倒 
She'd spin it in a dream and it would never topple,

661
00:48:51,034 --> 00:48:52,830
就这么一直转下去
just spin and spin.

662
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:56,553
听亚瑟说她去世了
Arthur told me she passed away.

663
00:48:56,554 --> 00:48:59,021
迷宫设计得怎么样了
How are the mazes coming along?

664
00:48:59,071 --> 00:49:01,632
梦境的每一层都和我们
Each level relates to the part of the subject's

665
00:49:01,632 --> 00:49:04,302
要了解的目标潜意识有关
subconscious that we're trying to access, so...

666
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:06,475
所以最后一层设计成医院 
Making the bottom level hospital,

667
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:09,251
这样费舍就会见到他父亲...
so Fischer will bring his father, um...

668
00:49:10,271 --> 00:49:12,843
其实关于这层我有个疑问
You know, actually I have a question about this layout...

669
00:49:12,877 --> 00:49:15,228
不不不  不要告诉我细节
No, no, no. Don't... don't show me the specifics.

670
00:49:15,238 --> 00:49:17,477
只有梦主才能知道细节
Only the dreamer should know the layout.

671
00:49:17,478 --> 00:49:18,927
为什么这么在意这点
Why's that so important?

672
00:49:18,939 --> 00:49:21,475
以防我们中有人带入了自己的映射
In case one of us brings in our projections,

673
00:49:21,485 --> 00:49:24,740
可不能让映射知道迷宫的细节
we don't want them knowing the details of the maze.

674
00:49:24,773 --> 00:49:28,223
你是说茉儿吗
You mean in case you bring Mal in?

675
00:49:28,224 --> 00:49:30,595
你没法控制她吧
You can't keep her out, can you?

676
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,304
-对  -你之所以不能筑梦
- Right. - You can't build them because...

677
00:49:33,319 --> 00:49:36,180
因为只要你知道迷宫布局  她也就知道了
if you know the maze, then she knows it.

678
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,933
她就会破坏整个行动
She'd sabotage the whole operation.

679
00:49:38,941 --> 00:49:40,514
柯布  其他人知道吗  
Cobb, did the others know?

680
00:49:40,515 --> 00:49:41,301
不  不知道
No, they don't.

681
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,529
如果情况恶化  你得警告他们
You gotta warn them if this is getting worse.

682
00:49:43,545 --> 00:49:45,123
谁说会恶化了
No one said it's getting worse!

683
00:49:45,545 --> 00:49:48,123
我必须回家
I need to get home.

684
00:49:48,138 --> 00:49:50,659
我现在只关心这点
That's all I care about right now.

685
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,952
你为什么不能回家
Why can't you go home?

686
00:49:56,047 --> 00:49:58,836
因为警察认为我杀害了她
Because they think I killed her.

687
00:50:01,475 --> 00:50:04,263
-谢谢  -谢什么
- Thank you. - For what?

688
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:06,354
没有问我是不是真的杀了她
For not asking whether I did.

689
00:50:06,384 --> 00:50:08,963
"我要瓦解我父亲的帝国"
"I will split up my father's empire."

690
00:50:08,981 --> 00:50:10,914
显然这个想法
Now this is obviously

691
00:50:10,915 --> 00:50:13,492
会被罗伯特立刻拒绝
an idea that Robert himself would choose to reject.

692
00:50:13,502 --> 00:50:14,823
所以我们得把这个想法
Just why we need to plant it

693
00:50:14,824 --> 00:50:16,145
植入他潜意识深处
deep in his subconscious.

694
00:50:16,147 --> 00:50:20,111
潜意识由感性激发  而不是理性吧
Subconscious is motivated by emotion, right? Not reason.

695
00:50:20,122 --> 00:50:23,675
我们得设法把这转化为感性因素
We need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept.

696
00:50:23,692 --> 00:50:26,478
怎么把一个商业策略转变成感性因素
How do you translate a business strategy into an emotion?

697
00:50:26,504 --> 00:50:28,034
这不等着我们想办法么
That's what we have to figure out, right?

698
00:50:28,046 --> 00:50:30,878
而罗伯特与他父亲的关系紧张
Now, Robert's relationship with his father is stressed,

699
00:50:28,746 --> 00:50:29,878
费舍家族两代人之间的战争

700
00:50:30,879 --> 00:50:31,958
甚至更糟
to say the least.

701
00:50:31,967 --> 00:50:32,943
你看这样如何
Can we run with that,

702
00:50:32,956 --> 00:50:34,659
我们暗示他  让他认为解散公司
we could suggest to him breaking up his

703
00:50:34,659 --> 00:50:36,843
是对自己老子的一次反抗
father's company as a "screw you" to the old man?

704
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:37,512
不行
No,

705
00:50:37,513 --> 00:50:40,662
因为积极情感总是胜过消极情感
'cause I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time.

706
00:50:40,673 --> 00:50:44,409
我们的心理追求协调  需要宣泄
We all yearn for reconciliation, a catharsis.

707
00:50:44,435 --> 00:50:46,708
必须让罗伯特・费舍
We need Robert Fischer

708
00:50:46,709 --> 00:50:48,351
对整件事产生积极的情感
to have a positive emotional reaction to all this.

709
00:50:48,365 --> 00:50:50,626
好吧  试试这个...
Alright, well, try this, um...

710
00:50:50,637 --> 00:50:53,791
"我父亲希望我自己创业"
"my father accepts that I want to create for myself,

711
00:50:53,809 --> 00:50:55,675
"而不是跟随他亦步亦趋"
not follow in his footsteps."

712
00:50:55,772 --> 00:50:58,653
-有点意思  -有点
- That might work. - Might?

713
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,401
光是"有点"可不行
We need to do a little better than "might".

714
00:51:00,401 --> 00:51:02,385
多谢你的建议  亚瑟
Oh, thank you for your contribution, Arthur.

715
00:51:02,388 --> 00:51:06,765
明确点总没错吧  明确"一"点
Forgive me for wanting a little specificities. Specificity?

716
00:51:06,771 --> 00:51:10,182
植梦可不能指望明确  我们在他的意识里
Inception is not about being specific. When we get inside his mind,

717
00:51:10,197 --> 00:51:13,268
只能随机应变
we're gonna have to work with what we find.

718
00:51:13,433 --> 00:51:17,266
在第一层梦境  我们先拿父子俩的关系开刀
On the top level, we open up his relationship with his father,

719
00:51:17,276 --> 00:51:20,551
告诉他  "我不想再追随父亲的脚步"
say, "I will not follow in my father's footsteps."

720
00:51:20,564 --> 00:51:22,961
到了第二层  我们让他产生这样的想法
Then the next level down, we feed him,

721
00:51:22,961 --> 00:51:25,553
"我要创造自己的事业"
"I will create something for myself."

722
00:51:25,565 --> 00:51:28,817
最后在第三层  我们就亮出王牌
Then, by the time we hit the bottom level, we bring out the big guns...

723
00:51:28,828 --> 00:51:31,862
-"我父亲不想我变成他"  -没错
- "my father doesn't want me to be him. - Exactly.

724
00:51:32,037 --> 00:51:35,082
三层梦境很不稳定  稍有干扰
With three layers down, the dreams are gonna collapse...

725
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:36,587
梦境就会崩溃
with the slightest disturbance.

726
00:51:36,609 --> 00:51:39,012
用镇静剂让你入睡...
Sedation, for a sleep...

727
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,755
这样足够稳定  可以维持三层梦境
stable enough to create three layers of dreaming.

728
00:51:41,755 --> 00:51:45,036
我们得加入相当强效的镇静剂
We have to combine with an extremely powerful sedative.

729
00:51:56,588 --> 00:51:57,490
晚安
Good night.

730
00:51:57,899 --> 00:52:00,137
我们分享梦境时使用的药剂
The compound we'll be using to share the dream

731
00:52:00,137 --> 00:52:02,521
让每个人间的联结变得异常清晰
creates very clear connection between dreamers,

732
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:04,666
同时也会加快大脑运转速度
whilst actually accelerating brain function.

733
00:52:04,678 --> 00:52:07,239
换句话说  每层梦境的时间会增加
In other words, it gives us more time on each level.

734
00:52:07,253 --> 00:52:10,174
大脑功率在梦中是正常状态下的二十倍
Brain function in the dream will be about twenty times normal.

735
00:52:10,201 --> 00:52:13,738
而当你进入更深一层  时间会加倍
When you enter a dream within that dream, the effect is compounded.

736
00:52:13,747 --> 00:52:16,082
三层梦境  也就是十小时乘以二十...
Three dreams, that's ten hour times twenty...

737
00:52:16,083 --> 00:52:16,401
不好意思
I'm sorry, uh...

738
00:52:16,401 --> 00:52:17,749
我数学向来不好
math's never my strong subject.

739
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:22,011
-究竟是多长时间  -第一层是一周
- How much time is that? - It's a week the first level down.

740
00:52:22,054 --> 00:52:25,765
第二层是半年  而第三层则是...
Six months the second level down. And the third level...

741
00:52:25,783 --> 00:52:28,186
十年
Ten years.

742
00:52:28,783 --> 00:52:32,186
谁愿意困在梦里十年之久
Who would wanna be stuck in a dream for ten years?

743
00:52:32,231 --> 00:52:33,502
看是什么梦咯
Depends on the dream.

744
00:52:33,558 --> 00:52:36,563
那么完成任务后  我们要怎么回来
So once we've made the plant, how do we get out?

745
00:52:36,578 --> 00:52:37,896
巴望着你这回能优雅些
I'm hoping you have something more

746
00:52:37,896 --> 00:52:39,678
不用一枪把我的头打爆
elegant in mind than shooting me in the head?

747
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:42,493
-用坠落  -什么叫坠落
- A kick.- What's a kick?

748
00:52:42,508 --> 00:52:45,545
看这儿  艾莲涅  这就叫坠落
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.

749
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,844
是一种强烈的下坠感  将你震醒
It's that feeling of falling, you get the jolts to wake.

750
00:52:49,844 --> 00:52:51,637
进而把你拖离梦境
It snaps you out of the dream.

751
00:52:51,647 --> 00:52:53,520
用那种强力镇静剂  我们能感觉到坠落吗
Are we gonna feel a kick with this kind of sedation?

752
00:52:53,533 --> 00:52:54,762
妙就妙在这儿
Oh, that's the clever part.

753
00:52:54,775 --> 00:52:55,864
在这种镇静剂中
I customize the sedative

754
00:52:55,865 --> 00:52:58,198
我特意保留了内耳功能的完整
to leave inner ear function unimpaired.

755
00:52:58,243 --> 00:53:04,883
这样一来  无论你睡得多沉  都能感到下坠
That way, however deep the sleep, the sleeper still feels falling,

756
00:53:04,883 --> 00:53:06,211
或倾倒
or tipping.

757
00:53:06,227 --> 00:53:11,004
关键是  要让三层梦境的坠落同步发生
The trick is to synchronize a kick that can penetrate all three levels.

758
00:53:11,027 --> 00:53:13,074
我们可以用音乐倒计时为信号
We can use a musical countdown

759
00:53:13,075 --> 00:53:15,122
来同步不同层的坠落
to synchronize different kicks.

760
00:53:22,504 --> 00:53:26,529
他没有手术安排  不看牙医  什么都没有
He hasn't any surgery schedule, no dental, nothing.

761
00:53:26,539 --> 00:53:28,346
他不是该动个膝盖手术吗
Wasn't he supposed to have a knee operation?

762
00:53:28,363 --> 00:53:31,659
没有  没机会让他睡过去  我们...
Nothing. Nothing they'd put him under for, anyway. We need...

763
00:53:31,659 --> 00:53:33,636
我们至少需要十小时
We need at least a good ten hours.

764
00:53:33,662 --> 00:53:35,826
悉尼到洛杉矶
Sydney to Los Angeles,

765
00:53:36,256 --> 00:53:38,777
全世界飞行时间最长的航线之一
One of the longest flights in the world.

766
00:53:38,778 --> 00:53:40,759
他每两周要往返一次
He makes it every two weeks.

767
00:53:40,778 --> 00:53:43,411
那肯定也是坐他的私人飞机
And he must be flying private.

768
00:53:43,677 --> 00:53:46,997
要是私人飞机出故障就坐不成了吧
Not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane.

769
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,290
-那也得是波音747  -为什么
- It'd have to be a 747.- Why is that?

770
00:53:49,304 --> 00:53:50,792
因为波音747的驾驶舱在最上面
Cause on a 747, pilots are up top,

771
00:53:50,792 --> 00:53:52,848
头等舱在最前部
And the first class cabin's in the nose,

772
00:53:52,872 --> 00:53:54,298
所以没有人会走来走去
So no one would walk through.

773
00:53:54,309 --> 00:53:56,161
但你得包下整个头等舱
But you'd have to buyout the entire cabin,

774
00:53:56,161 --> 00:53:57,923
还要买通头等舱的所有空乘
And the first class flight attendant.

775
00:53:57,948 --> 00:54:00,478
我买下了那家航空公司
I bought the airline.

776
00:54:00,478 --> 00:54:03,009
应该会方便些吧
It seemed neater.

777
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:07,111
看来十小时不成问题咯
It looks like we have our ten hours.

778
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:11,767
艾莲涅  那啥  干得漂亮
Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way.

779
00:54:59,222 --> 00:55:01,422
你知道怎么找到我
You know how to find me.

780
00:55:02,818 --> 00:55:05,011
你知道你该怎么做
You know what you have to do.

781
00:55:08,115 --> 00:55:11,753
记得你向我求婚那时吗
You remember when you asked me to marry you?

782
00:55:12,456 --> 00:55:17,985
-我当然记得  -你说你做了个梦
- Of course I do.- You said you had a dream.

783
00:55:20,995 --> 00:55:26,846
-梦到我们白头偕老  -我们可以的
- That we grow old together.- And we can.

784
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:35,191
你不该来这里
You shouldn't be in here.

785
00:55:39,676 --> 00:55:41,009
我只是想看看
I just want to see what kind of

786
00:55:41,009 --> 00:55:42,988
你每晚都在独自做什么"实验"
"tests" you're doing on your own every night.

787
00:55:43,002 --> 00:55:44,861
不管是什么  都跟你没关系
Whatever it was, it has nothing to do with you.

788
00:55:44,861 --> 00:55:46,216
和我太有关系了
It has everything to do with me.

789
00:55:46,234 --> 00:55:50,418
-你让我和你分享梦境  -不是这些梦
- You've asked me to share dreams with you.- Not these.

790
00:55:50,418 --> 00:55:52,122
这些是我自己的梦
These are my dreams.

791
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:05,318
你为什么要这么做
Why do you do this to yourself?

792
00:56:05,882 --> 00:56:09,446
只有这样我才能继续做梦
This is the only way I can still dream.

793
00:56:10,246 --> 00:56:12,806
为什么必须得做梦
Why is it so important to dream?

794
00:56:12,807 --> 00:56:15,793
因为在梦里  我们仍能在一起
In my dreams we're still together.

795
00:56:30,058 --> 00:56:34,636
这些不仅是梦  这是你的回忆
These aren't just dreams. These are memories.

796
00:56:34,655 --> 00:56:38,132
-你说过不能用回忆造梦  -我知道
- And you said never to use memories.- I know I did.

797
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:42,805
你想尽办法让她活着  你放不下她
You're trying to keep her alive.you can't let her go.

798
00:56:43,001 --> 00:56:44,898
你不明白
You don't understand.

799
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,348
这些都是让我追悔不已的瞬间
These are moments I regret,

800
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:49,403
是我必须改变的记忆
the memories that I have to change.

801
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,664
那这下面有什么让你后悔的事
Well, what's down there that you regret?

802
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:56,900
听好  对于我  你只用了解一件事
Listen, there's only one thing you need to understand about me.

803
00:57:04,732 --> 00:57:09,055
-这是你家吗  -对  是我和茉儿的家
- This is your house? - Mine and Mal's, yes.

804
00:57:09,669 --> 00:57:13,285
-她人呢  -她已经不在了
- Where is she?  - She's already gone.

805
00:57:18,829 --> 00:57:20,621
那是我儿子詹姆斯
It's my son, James.

806
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:23,275
他在挖着什么  大概是条虫子
He's digging for something, maybe a worm.

807
00:57:24,501 --> 00:57:26,300
那是菲丽帕
That's Philippa.

808
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:28,689
你知道吗  我当时想喊他们
You see, I thought about calling out to them,

809
00:57:28,689 --> 00:57:31,329
让他们转过头来对我笑  我就能看到...
so they'd turn and smile and I can see those...

810
00:57:31,454 --> 00:57:37,021
他们俩可爱的面孔  但...一切都太晚了
Those beautiful faces of theirs.but... It's all too late.

811
00:57:37,072 --> 00:57:39,936
再不走就来不及了  柯布
Right now, or never, Cobb.

812
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,523
那时我真的慌了
Then I start to panic.

813
00:57:45,524 --> 00:57:49,534
我知道我不想为此后悔  我...
I realize I don't wanna regret this moment, that I..

814
00:57:49,815 --> 00:57:52,119
我要最后再看一眼他们的面孔
I need to see their faces one last time.

815
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,145
詹姆斯  菲丽帕  快过来
James! Philippa! Come on in!

816
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:57,810
但我错过了
But the moment's passed.

817
00:57:59,422 --> 00:58:02,996
我再怎么努力都无法改变
Whatever I do I can't change this moment.

818
00:58:03,846 --> 00:58:09,304
就在我想喊他们时  他们跑开了
When I'm about to call out to them, they run away.

819
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:14,937
我要想再见到他们  就一定得回家
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again, I've gotta get back home,

820
00:58:14,959 --> 00:58:17,387
在现实中相见
In the real world.

821
00:58:58,603 --> 00:59:01,532
-你来这干什么  -我是...
- What are you doing here?  - My name is...

822
00:59:01,654 --> 00:59:05,260
我知道你是谁  你来这干什么
I know who you are.  What are you doing here?

823
00:59:13,347 --> 00:59:18,014
-我只是想试着理解  -你怎么可能理解
- I'm just trying to understand.- How could you understand?

824
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:22,083
你知道成为彼此的爱人
Do you know what it is to be a lover?

825
00:59:23,222 --> 00:59:27,631
-成为彼此另一半的感觉吗  -不知道
- To be half of a whole?  - No.

826
00:59:29,498 --> 00:59:32,218
来猜个谜语吧
I'll tell you a riddle.

827
00:59:32,858 --> 00:59:40,098
你在等待一列火车  那列火车将载你远去
You're waiting for a train, a train that will take you far away.

828
00:59:40,867 --> 00:59:44,972
你了然自己心向何方
You know where you hope this train will take you,

829
00:59:44,972 --> 00:59:47,537
却不知自己会被载往何处
But you don't know for sure.

830
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,797
但这并不重要
But it doesn't matter.

831
00:59:50,075 --> 00:59:53,764
火车将载你去哪怎会不重要呢
How can it not matter to you where that train will take you?

832
00:59:53,785 --> 00:59:56,607
因为我们会在一起
Because you'll be together.

833
00:59:56,608 --> 00:59:58,687
你怎么能带她来这  道姆
How could you bring her here, Dom?

834
00:59:58,705 --> 00:59:59,909
这是什么地方
What is this place?

835
00:59:59,909 --> 01:00:03,282
这是我们庆祝结婚纪念日的套房
This is a hotel suite where we spent our anniversary.

836
01:00:03,302 --> 01:00:05,487
这里发生过什么
What happened here?

837
01:00:06,598 --> 01:00:09,374
你向我承诺过  我们会在一起
You promised! you promised we'd be together!

838
01:00:09,374 --> 01:00:12,211
求你了  留在这  暂时先留在这
Please, I need you stay here, just for now.

839
01:00:12,224 --> 01:00:15,917
你说过我们会在一起  白头偕老
You said we'd be together! you said we'd grow old together!

840
01:00:15,943 --> 01:00:19,475
我会回来找你  我保证
I'll come back for you, I promise.

841
01:00:36,173 --> 01:00:41,828
你觉得建起一座记忆监狱  就能关住她吗
Do you think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in?

842
01:00:42,602 --> 01:00:45,694
你真的觉得这样能锁住她吗
Do you really think that's gonna contain her?

843
01:00:45,731 --> 01:00:50,501
是时候了  莫里斯・费舍刚在悉尼去世
It's time.Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

844
01:00:50,532 --> 01:00:53,346
-葬礼在哪天  -星期四  在洛杉矶
- When's the funeral? - Thursday, in Los Angeles.

845
01:00:53,356 --> 01:00:55,470
罗伯特应该在周二前护送遗体回去
Robert should accompany the body no later than Tuesday.

846
01:00:55,471 --> 01:00:56,410
我们该行动了
We should move.

847
01:00:56,419 --> 01:01:00,098
-好  -柯布  我跟你一起去
- Right. - Cobb, I'm coming with you.

848
01:01:00,105 --> 01:01:01,762
我答应过迈尔斯  不行
I promised Miles. No.

849
01:01:01,774 --> 01:01:05,790
得有人了解你潜意识里的挣扎
The team needs someone who understands what you're struggling with.

850
01:01:07,214 --> 01:01:09,459
不带上我也可以
And it doesn't have to be me,

851
01:01:09,459 --> 01:01:13,547
但你得把我刚才看见的都告诉亚瑟
but then you have to show Arthur what I just saw.

852
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:21,553
在飞机上加个位子
Get us another seat on the plane.

853
01:01:24,648 --> 01:01:28,109
如果我上了这飞机  你却不履行我们的协议
If I get on this plane, and you don't honor our agreement,

854
01:01:28,125 --> 01:01:31,607
那着陆后  我就会在监狱里度过余生
When we land, I go to jail for the rest of my life.

855
01:01:31,901 --> 01:01:37,167
在途中完成任务  我只要在飞机上打个电话
Complete the job en route, I make one phone call from the plane,

856
01:01:37,188 --> 01:01:40,528
就能让你顺利入境
You'll have no trouble getting through immigration.

857
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:56,595
-抱歉  借过  -不好意思
- I'm sorry. - Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

858
01:01:56,595 --> 01:01:57,595
谢谢
Thank you.

859
01:02:31,657 --> 01:02:35,283
抱歉打扰了  这是你的吧  肯定是弄掉了
Excuse me, I think this is yours?  You must've dropped it.

860
01:02:35,394 --> 01:02:38,591
-先生们想要喝点什么吗  -来杯水  谢谢
- Would you gentlemen care for a drink?  - Oh, water, please.

861
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:40,073
一样  谢谢
Same, please.

862
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,960
那个...谢谢
Umm... thank you.

863
01:02:45,183 --> 01:02:46,990
那个  我忍不住看了一眼  你...
You know, I couldn't help but notice, but...

864
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,087
你不会恰巧和那位莫里斯・费舍是亲戚吧
You wouldn't happen to be related to "the Maurice Fischer", will you?

865
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:55,442
是的  他...他是我父亲
Yes, he, um... he was my father.

866
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,898
他是个很了不起的人  请你节哀顺变
He was a very inspiring figure. I'm sorry for your loss.

867
01:03:02,934 --> 01:03:04,682
-给  -谢谢
- Here you go. - Thank you.

868
01:03:04,753 --> 01:03:10,850
来  敬你父亲  愿他安息
Hey, to your father. May he rest in peace.

869
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,526
-你睡前就不能去解个手么  -抱歉
- Couldn't you have peed before you went under. - Sorry.

870
01:04:21,544 --> 01:04:23,819
免费香槟没少喝吧  尤瑟夫
Bit too much free champagne before takeoff, Yusuf?

871
01:04:23,846 --> 01:04:24,969
呵呵  真他妈好笑
Aha, bloody ha.

872
01:04:24,984 --> 01:04:28,009
这样的天气  他肯定在找出租车
Well now, he's gonna be looking for a taxi in this weather.

873
01:04:40,013 --> 01:04:43,423
-蠢货  你丫怎么不...  -滚
- Asshole! Hey man, why don't you try... - Walk away.

874
01:05:00,851 --> 01:05:03,883
我得挂了  出租车  谢谢
I gotta go. Taxi! Thank you.

875
01:05:06,407 --> 01:05:09,596
好  太好了
Alright...Snappy!

876
01:05:10,063 --> 01:05:12,567
-你干嘛  -抱歉  我以为是空车
- What're you doing?  - I'm sorry. I thought it was free.

877
01:05:12,582 --> 01:05:13,968
-不  有人了  -拼个车吧
- No, it's not. - Maybe we could share.

878
01:05:13,985 --> 01:05:16,662
还是不了  你能不能靠边停下让他...
Maybe not. Can you pull over to get this...

879
01:05:19,878 --> 01:05:21,259
这下好了
Great.

880
01:05:26,225 --> 01:05:27,293
快点
Come on.

881
01:05:38,407 --> 01:05:39,874
这里有五百美元
There's five hundred dollars in there,

882
01:05:39,874 --> 01:05:41,460
这钱包还不止这个价
And the wallet's worth more than that.

883
01:05:41,467 --> 01:05:44,768
-好歹送我到目的地吧  -恐怕...
- So you might at least drop me at my stop.  - I'm afraid...

884
01:05:53,974 --> 01:05:55,794
-掩护他  -不  不  不
- Covering him!  - No! no! no!

885
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:58,135
这什么情况
What was going on?

886
01:06:01,646 --> 01:06:03,727
我可没设计这个
This wasn't in the design.

887
01:06:04,782 --> 01:06:07,645
柯布
Cobb. Cobb?

888
01:06:58,351 --> 01:06:59,774
干掉他
Get him!

889
01:07:06,268 --> 01:07:09,863
-你没事吧  -没事  我没事  我还好
- Are you alright? - Yeah, I'm alright, I'm okey. I'm okey.

890
01:07:10,114 --> 01:07:13,552
-费舍也没事  没准有点晕车  -斋藤
- Fischer's okey. Unless he gets carsick. - Saito?

891
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:34,707
把费舍带到里屋去  快点
Get Fischer in the back room, now.

892
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:37,403
-把他带去里屋  快  -这是怎么回事
- Get him in the back room. Move! - What the hell?

893
01:07:37,938 --> 01:07:40,241
-他中枪了吗  他会死吗  -我不知道
- Has he been shot? Is he dying? - I don't know.

894
01:07:40,242 --> 01:07:41,881
老天呐
Jesus Christ!

895
01:07:41,468 --> 01:07:42,808
你们去哪儿了  发生了什么事
Where were you? what happened to you?

896
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:44,148
我们被一列货运火车截住了
We were blocked by a freight train.

897
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,230
你干嘛在闹市的十字路口上
Why would you put a train crossing in

898
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:46,357
放一列火车
The middle of a downtown intersection?

899
01:07:46,368 --> 01:07:47,697
-我没有  -那是哪儿来的
- I didn't.- Where did it come from?

900
01:07:47,707 --> 01:07:50,320
我还要问你呢  我们怎么会遭伏击  说啊
Lemme ask you a question! Why the hell we were ambushed, huh?

901
01:07:50,325 --> 01:07:51,322
那些绝不是普通的映射
Those were not normal projections.

902
01:07:51,323 --> 01:07:53,068
见鬼的他是受过训练的好不好
He'd been trained, for god's sakes!

903
01:07:53,074 --> 01:07:54,436
-你说的没错  -他怎么会受过训练
- You're right.- How could he be trained?

904
01:07:54,452 --> 01:07:57,031
费舍曾让盗梦人训练过他的潜意识
Fischer's had an extractor teach his subconscious

905
01:07:57,032 --> 01:07:58,797
进行自我防御  所以...
to defend itself. so...

906
01:07:58,849 --> 01:08:01,960
他的潜意识经过武装  我早该做好调查
His subconscious is militarized. This should have shown in the research.

907
01:08:01,976 --> 01:08:03,896
-抱歉  -那你他妈怎么没查出来
- I'm sorry.- Why the hell you didn't?

908
01:08:03,911 --> 01:08:05,812
-冷静点  -冷你妹
- Calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down!

909
01:08:05,824 --> 01:08:08,916
这是你分内的事  你他妈要负全责
This was your job, goddamnit! This was your responsibility!

910
01:08:08,935 --> 01:08:11,251
你应该彻查费舍的背景
You were meant to check Fischer's background thoroughly!

911
01:08:11,261 --> 01:08:13,124
我们可没准备好应付这种枪战
We are not prepared for this type of fire!

912
01:08:13,133 --> 01:08:14,935
我们之前处理过潜意识防卫情况
We have dealt with the subsecurity before.

913
01:08:14,951 --> 01:08:16,771
只要小心一点就会没事
We'll be a little more careful.we're gonna be fine.

914
01:08:16,889 --> 01:08:19,428
之前可没有过这种情况  他快死了  见鬼的
"Before" is not a part of the plan! He's dying, for god's sake!

915
01:08:19,437 --> 01:08:23,061
-那就帮他脱离苦海  -别  千万别
- Let's put him out of his misery. - Don't do that! Don't do that!

916
01:08:23,074 --> 01:08:25,984
他太痛苦了  我唤醒他而已
He's in agony. I'm waking him up.

917
01:08:25,985 --> 01:08:27,516
别  那样唤不醒他
No, it won't wake him up.

918
01:08:27,525 --> 01:08:29,401
-唤不醒是啥意思  -那样唤不醒他
- What do you mean, it won't wake him up? - It won't wake him up.

919
01:08:29,411 --> 01:08:31,921
在梦中死去  我们就会醒来
When we die in a dream, we wake up.

920
01:08:31,922 --> 01:08:32,706
这次不行
Not from this.

921
01:08:32,721 --> 01:08:35,708
我们用的镇静剂太强了  那样根本醒不过来
We're too heavily sedated to wake up that way.

922
01:08:35,723 --> 01:08:37,839
好吧  那我们死了会怎样
Right. so what happens when we die?

923
01:08:37,846 --> 01:08:39,561
-坠入迷失域  -开什么玩笑
- Drop into limbo. - Are you serious?

924
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:42,408
-什么迷失域  -原始的梦境
- Limbo?  - Unconstructed dream space.

925
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:44,152
那下面都有什么
What the hell is down there?

926
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:46,058
只有无尽的原始潜意识
Just raw infinite subconscious.

927
01:08:46,063 --> 01:08:46,592
什么都没有
Nothing is down there,

928
01:08:46,593 --> 01:08:48,921
除非与你分享梦境的某人
except for whatever might have been left behind

929
01:08:48,928 --> 01:08:51,932
曾被困在那里  并在那里留下过什么
by anyone sharing the dream who's been trapped there before,

930
01:08:51,945 --> 01:08:54,268
我们这里就只有你去过
Which in our case is just you.

931
01:08:54,269 --> 01:08:56,056
我们会被困在那里多久
But how long could we be stuck there?

932
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:59,504
在镇静剂消退前  不可能逃得出来
Not even think about trying to escape until the sedation eases...

933
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:00,033
到底是多久
How long?

934
01:09:00,034 --> 01:09:01,272
也许几十年  也许永远  我也不知道
Decades, it could be infinite, I don't know.

935
01:09:01,289 --> 01:09:03,403
问他  就他去过那儿
Ask him. he's the one who's been there.

936
01:09:03,404 --> 01:09:05,030
先把他抬楼上去再说
Let's just get him upstairs.

937
01:09:06,196 --> 01:09:09,598
好极了  多亏了你啊
Great. Thank you.

938
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:12,661
我们现在被困在费舍的大脑里
So, now we are trapped in Fischer's mind

939
01:09:12,662 --> 01:09:13,840
和他的私人武装军队搏命
battling his own private army.

940
01:09:13,845 --> 01:09:15,462
要是不小心翘了
And if we get killed,

941
01:09:15,462 --> 01:09:17,523
就会跌进迷失域
we'll be lost in limbo

942
01:09:17,524 --> 01:09:20,959
干等着脑子变成一锅浆糊  是吧
till our brains turn to scrambled egg. hmm?

943
01:09:25,994 --> 01:09:27,802
有急救箱吗
You got first aid?

944
01:09:29,772 --> 01:09:32,489
你知道其中的风险  却没有告诉我们
So you knew about these risks. You didn't tell us?

945
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,773
本来不会有任何风险
There wasn't meant to be any risk.

946
01:09:33,773 --> 01:09:35,895
我怎么知道要面对如此激烈的枪战
I didn't know we'd be dealing with a load of gunfire.

947
01:09:35,911 --> 01:09:37,114
你没权利这么做
You had no right.

948
01:09:37,115 --> 01:09:39,041
只有这样我们才能深入三层梦境
This is the only way to go three layers deep.

949
01:09:39,068 --> 01:09:41,458
还有你  你明知危险  为什么不吱声
And you, you knew about this and went along with it?

950
01:09:41,459 --> 01:09:42,142
我相信他啊
I trusted him.

951
01:09:42,157 --> 01:09:44,447
是吗  就因为他答应分你一半钱吗
You trusted him? When? When he promised you half his share?

952
01:09:44,459 --> 01:09:46,678
不是  他说全给我
No, his whole share.

953
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:48,182
而且他说他原来干过
Besides, he said he had done it before.

954
01:09:48,182 --> 01:09:49,675
干过  和茉儿那次吗
You had done it before? What? With Mal?

955
01:09:49,683 --> 01:09:51,604
-那次什么下场  -那次和现在没关系
- Cause that works so good? - That has nothing to do with it.

956
01:09:51,607 --> 01:09:53,734
我只是竭尽所能回到我的孩子身边
I did what I had to do to get back to my children.

957
01:09:53,747 --> 01:09:55,625
那你就带我们走上绝路吗
So you led us into a war zone with no way out?

958
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:56,824
这不是绝路   好吗
There's a way out, alright?

959
01:09:56,837 --> 01:10:00,067
我们继续按计划行事  速战速决
We continue on with the job, and we do this as fast as possible,

960
01:10:00,081 --> 01:10:02,838
然后靠坠落醒过来  和计划没差
And we get out using the kick, just like before.

961
01:10:02,853 --> 01:10:05,152
歇菜吧  越深入风险越大
Forget it. If we go any deeper, we just raise the stakes.

962
01:10:05,161 --> 01:10:07,361
我就在这层  坐等着醒来  又会怎样
I am sitting this one hour on this level, worse?

963
01:10:07,375 --> 01:10:08,061
我们说话这会功夫
Fischer's security is surrounding this place

964
01:10:08,062 --> 01:10:09,951
费舍的潜意识卫队就把这里包围了
Fischer's security is surrounding this place as we speak.

965
01:10:09,961 --> 01:10:12,294
十小时的航线  在这一层就是一星期
The ten hours of flight time is a week at this level.

966
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:16,571
我可以肯定  要是待在这我们全都死定了
That means each and every one of us will be killed, that I can guarantee.

967
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:20,456
我们除了速战速决  别无选择
We have no other choice but to continue on and do it as fast as possible.

968
01:10:21,767 --> 01:10:25,022
往下深入才是唯一的出路
Downwards, is the only way forwards.

969
01:10:26,017 --> 01:10:27,838
准备好  你跟我来
Get ready. You, come on.

970
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:30,875
我们去震他一下
Let's go shake him up.

971
01:10:34,054 --> 01:10:36,979
我为防绑架投了一千万保险
I'm insured against kidnaping for up to ten million.

972
01:10:36,979 --> 01:10:38,642
所以简单行事吧
This should be very simple.

973
01:10:38,657 --> 01:10:40,733
闭嘴  没那么简单
Shut up! It won't be.

974
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:44,299
你爸办公室的书架下  有个他的私人保险箱
In your father's office, below the bookshelves, is his personal safe.

975
01:10:44,305 --> 01:10:48,113
-我们要密码  -我不知道有什么保险箱
- We need the combination. - I don't know any safe.

976
01:10:48,122 --> 01:10:54,358
那不代表你不知道密码  快告诉我们
It doesn't mean you don't know the combination. Tell us what it is.

977
01:10:54,674 --> 01:10:56,577
我真不知道
I don't know.

978
01:11:01,387 --> 01:11:05,539
我们有可靠来源说你知道
We have it on good authority you do know.

979
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:07,070
是吗  是谁
Yeah? Who's this authority?

980
01:11:07,341 --> 01:11:11,222
-这玩意居然值五百美元  -打开看看
- Five hundred dollars this cost. - Open inside.

981
01:11:11,371 --> 01:11:15,057
现金  各种卡  身份证  还有这个
Cash, cards, ID, and this.

982
01:11:20,468 --> 01:11:23,816
-有用吗  -也许吧
- Useful? - Maybe.

983
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:27,515
-靠你了  给你一小时  -就一小时
- You're on. you've got an hour. - An hour?

984
01:11:27,585 --> 01:11:30,498
我本该有整晚时间来对付他
I was supposed to have all night to crack this.

985
01:11:30,498 --> 01:11:33,533
斋藤的胸口本不该中枪子儿
Saito wasn't supposed to be shot in the chest.

986
01:11:33,554 --> 01:11:36,976
一小时  挖出点有用的  拜托
Got one hour to get something useful, please.

987
01:11:37,614 --> 01:11:40,746
什么声音
What's that?

988
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:44,091
可靠来源呗
Good authority.

989
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:48,095
彼得叔叔
Uncle Peter.

990
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:52,257
-先让他们住手  -密码是多少
- Just... just make them stop. - The combination?

991
01:11:52,268 --> 01:11:55,246
-我真不知道  -那为什么布朗宁说你知道
- I don't know it.- What does Browning say you do.

992
01:11:55,272 --> 01:11:57,802
我不知道  让...让我跟他谈谈
I don't know. Just lemme... lemme talk to him,

993
01:11:57,803 --> 01:11:59,068
看是怎么回事
and I'll find out.

994
01:12:01,137 --> 01:12:04,376
给你一小时  谈吧
You have one hour. Start talking.

995
01:12:07,922 --> 01:12:10,394
你还好吧
Are you okey?

996
01:12:13,718 --> 01:12:17,264
这帮杂种已经关了我两天了
Those bastards've had me for two days.

997
01:12:18,144 --> 01:12:20,644
他们派人潜入了你爸的办公室
They have someone with access to your father's office.

998
01:12:20,659 --> 01:12:22,920
-试图打开他的保险箱  -我知道
- And they're trying to open his safe.- Yeah.

999
01:12:22,934 --> 01:12:25,743
他们觉得我知道密码  但我不知道
They thought I'd know the combination, but I don't know it.

1000
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:28,909
-是啊  我也不知  所以...  -什么
- Yeah, well, neither do I. so... - What?

1001
01:12:29,154 --> 01:12:30,882
莫里斯告诉我  在他死后
Maurice told me that when he passed,

1002
01:12:30,882 --> 01:12:33,104
只有你能打开它
you are the only one to be able to open it.

1003
01:12:33,113 --> 01:12:35,548
没有...他从没告诉过我什么密码
No, he never... he never gave me any combination.

1004
01:12:35,882 --> 01:12:37,719
也许他说过  我是说
Maybe he did, I mean,

1005
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,863
也许你只是不知道那是密码
maybe you just didn't know it was a combination.

1006
01:12:40,244 --> 01:12:41,629
-那会是什么  -我不知道
- Well, what then? - I don't know.

1007
01:12:41,645 --> 01:12:45,761
你和莫里斯的一些共同经历中
Some meaningful combination of numbers based on your...

1008
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:48,155
那些有意义的数字组合
your experiences with Maurice.

1009
01:12:49,369 --> 01:12:54,427
我们没什么...有意义的共同经历
We didn't have very many, um... meaningful experiences together.

1010
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,140
或许  在你妈妈去世后
Perhaps, after your mother died.

1011
01:12:58,633 --> 01:13:02,316
我妈去世后  你知道他跟我说什么吗
After my mother died, you know what he told me?

1012
01:13:03,216 --> 01:13:08,081
"罗伯特  我跟你真没什么好说的"
"Robert, there's really nothing to be said."

1013
01:13:08,097 --> 01:13:10,720
别较真  他不善表达情感
Oh, he was bad with emotions.

1014
01:13:10,721 --> 01:13:13,869
我当时才十一岁啊  彼得叔叔
I was eleven, uncle peter.

1015
01:13:14,285 --> 01:13:17,633
-他怎么样  -疼得不行
- How's he doing? - He's in a lot of pain.

1016
01:13:17,651 --> 01:13:21,599
等我们到下面几层  疼痛感就会减弱
When we get down to the lower levels, the pain will be less intense.

1017
01:13:21,668 --> 01:13:25,469
-他要是死了呢  -最坏的情况吗
- And if he dies? - The worst case scenario?

1018
01:13:25,493 --> 01:13:28,363
他醒来后  会完全迷失了神智
When he wakes up, his mind is completely gone.

1019
01:13:28,376 --> 01:13:31,622
柯布  我仍会履行我们的协议
Cobb, I'll still honor the arrangement.

1020
01:13:31,623 --> 01:13:34,699
我很感激  斋藤  但...
I appreciate that, Saito. But..

1021
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:38,573
你醒来后  不会记得我们曾有过协议
When you wake up, you won't even remember that we had an arrangement.

1022
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:40,950
你会将迷失域当做现实
Limbo's gonna become your reality.

1023
01:13:40,964 --> 01:13:42,865
你会迷失在里面
You're gonna be lost down there so

1024
01:13:42,865 --> 01:13:45,214
直到变成一个老人
long that you're gonna become an old man.

1025
01:13:45,229 --> 01:13:49,648
-心中充满悔恨  -孤零零地等死
- Filled with regret. - Waiting to die alone?

1026
01:13:49,661 --> 01:13:56,856
不  我会回来  我们会一起重回年轻
No, I'll come back. and we'll be young men, together again.

1027
01:14:02,341 --> 01:14:03,798
深呼吸
Breathe.

1028
01:14:03,816 --> 01:14:05,140
如果我们不交出密码
These people are gonna kill us here,

1029
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,653
这伙人会马上杀了我们
if we don't give them the combination.

1030
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:08,993
-他们不过是想要钱  -我听到他们说了
- They just want a ransom. - I heard them.

1031
01:14:09,009 --> 01:14:12,872
他们会把我们打晕了塞进货车  再开进河里去
They're gonna whack us in that van and then drive it into the river.

1032
01:14:12,951 --> 01:14:15,990
好吧  那保险箱里到底有什么
Alright, what is it in the safe?

1033
01:14:15,991 --> 01:14:17,242
是给你的东西
Something for you.

1034
01:14:17,297 --> 01:14:21,807
莫里斯总说  那是他留给你最珍贵的礼物
Maurice always said it was his most precious gift to you.

1035
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:25,537
-一份遗嘱  -莫里斯的遗嘱已经交给了律师
- A will.  - Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.

1036
01:14:25,549 --> 01:14:26,795
这份是候补遗嘱
That's an alternate.

1037
01:14:26,804 --> 01:14:29,380
如果你愿意  完全可以推翻前一份
This would supersede the other, if you want it to.

1038
01:14:29,394 --> 01:14:32,239
这份遗嘱是要解散费舍明日能源集团
It splits up the component businesses of Fischer-Morrow,

1039
01:14:32,248 --> 01:14:36,128
这么一来  费舍帝国将土崩瓦解
and it'd be the end of the entire empire as we know it.

1040
01:14:36,142 --> 01:14:38,790
不留给我一丝一毫吗
Destroy my whole inheritance?

1041
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:44,253
-他为什么要我这么做  -我也不知道
- Why would he suggest such a thing? - I just don't know.

1042
01:14:46,032 --> 01:14:51,664
他爱你  罗伯特  以他独特的方式
He loved you, Robert, in his own way.

1043
01:14:51,665 --> 01:14:52,916
他独特的方式吗
In his own way?

1044
01:14:53,665 --> 01:14:58,689
他临终前  把我叫到他床前
At the end, he called me to his deathbed.

1045
01:14:58,966 --> 01:15:01,198
他连说话都很困难了
He could barely speak.

1046
01:15:01,777 --> 01:15:06,484
却仍耗尽最后一口气  告诉我一件事
But he took the trouble to tell me one last thing.

1047
01:15:08,567 --> 01:15:10,790
他把我拉近
He pulled me close.

1048
01:15:12,932 --> 01:15:18,109
我只勉强听清了一个词
And I could only make out one word --

1049
01:15:21,062 --> 01:15:23,885
"失望"
"disappointed."

1050
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:31,143
你什么时候进过迷失域
When were you in limbo?

1051
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:35,270
你或许成功说服了其他人继续任务
You might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job,

1052
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:37,942
-但他们不知道真相  -真相  什么真相
- But they don't know the truth? - Truth? What truth?

1053
01:15:37,956 --> 01:15:39,523
真相就是  你随时都有可能
The truth that at any minute,

1054
01:15:39,523 --> 01:15:42,376
凭空造出一列货运火车来
you might bring a freight train through the wall.

1055
01:15:42,388 --> 01:15:46,626
真相就是  你无法控制你潜意识里的茉儿
The truth that Mal is bursting through your subconscious.

1056
01:15:46,639 --> 01:15:49,445
真相就是  我们不断深入费舍意识的同时
And the truth that as we go deeper into Fischer,

1057
01:15:49,445 --> 01:15:51,535
也在不断深入你的意识
We're also going deeper into you.

1058
01:15:51,637 --> 01:15:55,805
而且  我想大家不会乐于见到真相
And I'm not sure we're gonna like what we find.

1059
01:15:58,714 --> 01:16:00,498
我们曾一起工作
We were working together.

1060
01:16:00,504 --> 01:16:04,353
努力探索着梦中梦的概念
We were exploring the concept of a dream within a dream.

1061
01:16:04,367 --> 01:16:06,964
我费劲功夫向前走  想要走得更深
I kept pushing things. I wanted to go deeper and deeper.

1062
01:16:06,989 --> 01:16:09,866
走得更远
I wanted to go further.

1063
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:12,256
我当时还没意识到
I just didn't understand the concept

1064
01:16:12,256 --> 01:16:15,002
现实的几小时会变成梦中的几年
that hours could turn into years down there,

1065
01:16:15,018 --> 01:16:18,510
而我们陷得如此之深
And we could get trapped so deep that only

1066
01:16:18,510 --> 01:16:22,417
醒来时已经到了潜意识的边缘
wound up on the shore of our own subconscious.

1067
01:16:22,469 --> 01:16:26,182
我们已经无法分辨梦境和现实
We lost sight of what was real.

1068
01:16:31,233 --> 01:16:34,776
我们为自己创造了一个世界
We created and built a world for ourselves.

1069
01:16:35,387 --> 01:16:37,362
我们建了很多年
We did that for years.

1070
01:16:38,168 --> 01:16:40,822
建起了属于我们自己的世界
We built our own world.

1071
01:16:41,473 --> 01:16:47,258
-你们被困了多久  -大概有五十年吧
- How long were you stuck there? - Something like fifty years.

1072
01:16:50,063 --> 01:16:55,058
天呐  你们怎么能受得了
Jeez. How could you stand it?

1073
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,088
一开始还不错  感觉自己像上帝一样
It wasn't so bad at first, feeling like gods.

1074
01:16:58,161 --> 01:17:01,263
问题是这些都不是真的
The problem was none of them was real.

1075
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:05,885
到头来  我终于无法忍受下去
Eventually, it just became impossible for me to live like that.

1076
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:07,796
那她怎么想
And what about for her?

1077
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:15,290
她把某些东西锁进了内心深处
She had locked something away, something deep inside her.

1078
01:17:15,846 --> 01:17:19,355
她曾经知晓的现实
The truth that she had once known,

1079
01:17:19,356 --> 01:17:21,908
她却选择将其遗忘
but she chose to forget.

1080
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:27,437
她把迷失域当成了现实
Limbo became her reality.

1081
01:17:27,968 --> 01:17:30,232
你们醒来后怎么样了
What happened when you woke up?

1082
01:17:30,362 --> 01:17:34,760
过了这么多年后再醒来
Well, to wake up from that after... after years, after decades,

1083
01:17:35,495 --> 01:17:40,234
苍老的灵魂重新回到年轻的躯体
We come old souls thrown back into youth like that.

1084
01:17:40,362 --> 01:17:42,846
我知道她有点不对劲
I knew something was wrong with her.

1085
01:17:42,847 --> 01:17:44,880
只是她自己不愿承认
she just wouldn't admit it.

1086
01:17:45,585 --> 01:17:47,996
她最终告诉了我真相
Eventually, she told me the truth.

1087
01:17:48,085 --> 01:17:51,896
她一直挥之不去一个想法
She was possessed by an idea.

1088
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:57,797
这个微不足道的想法却改变了一切
This one very simple idea that changed everything,

1089
01:17:58,513 --> 01:18:01,473
那便是我们的世界不是真的
That our world wasn't real,

1090
01:18:01,971 --> 01:18:06,832
她必须醒过来回到现实世界
That she needed to wake up to come back to reality, that...

1091
01:18:07,108 --> 01:18:13,381
为此  我们必须自杀
In order to get back home, we had to kill ourselves.

1092
01:18:18,846 --> 01:18:20,768
那你们的孩子呢
What about your children?

1093
01:18:20,769 --> 01:18:23,215
她认为他们只是潜意识的映射
she thought they were projections,

1094
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:25,517
我们真正的孩子正在现实中等着我们
That our real children were waiting for us up there somewhere.

1095
01:18:25,527 --> 01:18:27,727
-我是孩子的妈妈  -冷静点
- I am their mother. - Calm down.

1096
01:18:27,742 --> 01:18:29,491
难道我看不出其中的区别吗
Don't you think I can't tell the difference?

1097
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,606
如果我在做梦  为什么我无法控制
If this is my dream, why can't I control this?

1098
01:18:31,606 --> 01:18:33,571
因为你不知道自己在做梦
Because you don't know you're dreaming!

1099
01:18:33,589 --> 01:18:36,409
她是如此坚决  不管我好说歹说
She was certain there was nothing I can do,

1100
01:18:36,417 --> 01:18:40,727
我怎么恳求  都无济于事
No matter how much I begged, no matter how much I pleaded.

1101
01:18:42,362 --> 01:18:45,734
她想回去  但她又不想一个人走
She wanted to do it, but she could not do it alone.

1102
01:18:45,744 --> 01:18:47,530
她太爱我了  所以...
She loved me too much, so...

1103
01:18:47,744 --> 01:18:51,530
在我们结婚纪念日那天  她想出个计划
She came up with the plan on our anniversary.

1104
01:19:18,374 --> 01:19:21,302
-亲爱的  你在干什么  -一起来吧
- Sweetheart, what are you doing? - Join me.

1105
01:19:21,317 --> 01:19:24,179
你先退回屋里  好吗
Just... just step back inside. Alright?

1106
01:19:24,197 --> 01:19:25,679
退回屋里  求你了
Just step back inside. now, come on.

1107
01:19:25,701 --> 01:19:27,117
不
No.

1108
01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:30,545
我要跳了  你要和我一起跳
I'm going to jump. And you are coming with me.

1109
01:19:30,573 --> 01:19:32,009
不  我不会跳
No, I'm not.

1110
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,793
现在你听我说
Now... now you listen to me.

1111
01:19:34,857 --> 01:19:38,570
如果你跳下去  你不会醒来  明白吗
If you jump, you're not gonna wake up. Remember?

1112
01:19:38,611 --> 01:19:41,659
而是会死  所以退回屋里去好吗 
You're gonna die. now just... just step back inside.

1113
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:42,337
求你了
Come on!

1114
01:19:42,363 --> 01:19:44,772
回到屋里  我们好好谈谈  
Step back inside so we can talk about this.

1115
01:19:44,773 --> 01:19:46,378
我们谈得够多了
we've talked enough.

1116
01:19:48,293 --> 01:19:49,331
茉儿
Mal.

1117
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:52,128
你快跨出来  不然我现在就跳下去
Come out onto the ledge, or I'll jump right now.

1118
01:19:52,148 --> 01:19:53,489
好
Okey.

1119
01:19:57,417 --> 01:20:00,556
我们好好谈谈  好吗
Let's talk about this. Alright?

1120
01:20:01,348 --> 01:20:06,501
-我要你心存信仰  -不  亲爱的
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith. - No, honey,

1121
01:20:07,244 --> 01:20:10,317
我做不到  你知道我做不到
I can't. you know I can't do that.

1122
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:13,154
再想想我们的孩子
Take a second to think about our children.

1123
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:17,688
想想詹姆斯  想想菲丽帕
Think about James, think about Phillipa, now.

1124
01:20:17,693 --> 01:20:20,964
如果你不和我一起跳  孩子还是会被带走
If I go without you, they'll take them away, anyway.

1125
01:20:20,978 --> 01:20:24,569
-什么意思  -我找律师留下了一封信
- What does that mean? - I filed a letter with our attorney,

1126
01:20:24,597 --> 01:20:28,452
信中说到我担心自己的安全
explaining how I'm fearful for my safety,

1127
01:20:30,205 --> 01:20:33,490
你是如何威胁要杀了我
How you threatened to kill me.

1128
01:20:34,847 --> 01:20:38,095
-你为什么这么做  -我爱你  道姆  
- why did you do this? - I love you, Dom.

1129
01:20:38,113 --> 01:20:40,053
你为什么这么对我
Why did you... why... why would you do this to me?

1130
01:20:40,071 --> 01:20:42,997
这样你就不会因离开孩子而内疚
Freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them.

1131
01:20:43,006 --> 01:20:45,968
我们要回真正的家和孩子团聚了
We are going home, to our real children.

1132
01:20:45,984 --> 01:20:48,474
不不不  茉儿  听我说  好吗  
No, no... no. Mal, you listen to me, alright?

1133
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,438
茉儿  看着我  求你了  
Mal, look at me, please!

1134
01:20:50,439 --> 01:20:51,523
你在等待一列火车
you're waiting for a train,

1135
01:20:51,539 --> 01:20:53,475
茉儿  见鬼的  别这样  
Mal, goddamnit! Don't do this!

1136
01:20:53,476 --> 01:20:55,412
那列火车将载你远去
a train that will take you far away.

1137
01:20:55,429 --> 01:20:57,294
詹姆斯和菲丽帕在等你回去
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!

1138
01:20:57,294 --> 01:20:59,765
你了然自己心向何方
You know where you hope this train will take you,

1139
01:20:59,776 --> 01:21:01,494
-他们在等我们  -却不知自己会被载往何处
- They're waiting for us! - But you don't know for sure.

1140
01:21:01,517 --> 01:21:04,184
-茉儿  看着我  -但这并不重要
- Mal, look at me! - But it doesn't matter,

1141
01:21:04,197 --> 01:21:07,321
-茉儿  该死  -因为我们会在一起  
- Mal, goddamnit! - Because we'll be together.

1142
01:21:07,337 --> 01:21:10,453
亲爱的  看着我
Sweetheart! Look at me!

1143
01:21:10,453 --> 01:21:13,570
茉儿  不要  老天爷啊 
Mal! No! Jesus Christ!

1144
01:21:15,897 --> 01:21:20,117
她找了三个心理医生  证明她心智正常
She had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists,

1145
01:21:20,134 --> 01:21:22,125
我根本没法解释
That made it impossible for me to

1146
01:21:22,125 --> 01:21:24,660
她的内心有多疯狂
Try to explain the nature of her madness.

1147
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,535
所以就这样了
So they're in.

1148
01:21:27,362 --> 01:21:30,399
再不走就来不及了  柯布
Right now, or never, Cobb.

1149
01:21:40,874 --> 01:21:42,534
好吧  我们走
Fine, let's go.

1150
01:21:42,544 --> 01:21:43,979
我丢下了我的孩子
I left my children behind,

1151
01:21:43,979 --> 01:21:47,020
自那以后我就一直努力设法回去
And I've been trying to buy my way back ever since.

1152
01:21:47,033 --> 01:21:51,125
你的内疚感塑造了她  她才如此强大
Your guilt defines her, it's what powers her.

1153
01:21:51,149 --> 01:21:55,207
但是她的想法害死了她  这和你无关
But you are not responsible for the idea that destroyed her.

1154
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:59,440
如果我们这次要成功 
And if we're gonna succeed in this,

1155
01:21:59,441 --> 01:22:01,204
你必须原谅自己
you have to forgive yourself,

1156
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:03,487
坦然面对内心的她
And you're gonna have to confront her.

1157
01:22:03,726 --> 01:22:05,708
但你不用孤身奋战  
But you don't have to do that alone.

1158
01:22:05,709 --> 01:22:06,590
不  你不能...
No, you don't...

1159
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,364
我这是为了其他人
I'm doing it for the others.

1160
01:22:08,397 --> 01:22:11,225
因为他们完全不知道
Because they have no idea of the risk

1161
01:22:11,225 --> 01:22:14,359
和你一起深入梦境有多危险
they've taken coming down here with you.

1162
01:22:18,353 --> 01:22:20,209
我们得走了
We have to move.

1163
01:22:20,472 --> 01:22:22,418
-时间到了  -好吧
- Time's up. - All right.

1164
01:22:22,527 --> 01:22:26,009
我不知道什么密码  反正清醒时是不知道
I don't know any combination, not consciously anyway.

1165
01:22:26,026 --> 01:22:27,842
那直觉呢
How about instinctively, huh?

1166
01:22:27,852 --> 01:22:29,833
我们有人正在你父亲的办公室里
I've got somebody standing in your father's office.

1167
01:22:29,855 --> 01:22:32,225
现在我们就要输入密码
Right now, we need to tap in the combination.

1168
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:35,224
说出你一下子想到的六位数字
We need the first six numbers that come to your head right now.

1169
01:22:35,242 --> 01:22:37,638
-我不知道  -快说
- I have no idea. - Right now!

1170
01:22:37,709 --> 01:22:40,001
我让你快说  你说不说
I said right now! Right now!

1171
01:22:40,033 --> 01:22:44,688
528  491
5...2...8...491.

1172
01:22:47,724 --> 01:22:49,721
这可不对
You'd have to do better than that.

1173
01:22:49,784 --> 01:22:51,710
好了  把他们蒙起来
Alright, bag them.

1174
01:22:52,223 --> 01:22:54,455
我们开车出去兜一圈
We're going for a ride.

1175
01:22:57,356 --> 01:22:59,812
让我们活着更有价值
We're worth much more to you alive...

1176
01:23:00,137 --> 01:23:01,666
听到了吗
You hear me?

1177
01:23:07,002 --> 01:23:08,422
你有什么收获
What did you get?

1178
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:11,738
他们父子间的关系比我们想象的还糟
That boy's relationship with his father is even worse than we imagined.

1179
01:23:11,756 --> 01:23:12,874
这有什么用
This helps us how?

1180
01:23:12,915 --> 01:23:16,266
问题越大就越需要宣泄
The stronger the issues, the more powerfully cathartic.

1181
01:23:17,187 --> 01:23:19,404
你要怎么协调这么恶劣的关系
How are you gonna reconcile them of so estranged?

1182
01:23:19,417 --> 01:23:21,604
-我不正在想嘛  -给我动作快点
- Well, I'm working on that, an't I? - Move fast.

1183
01:23:21,751 --> 01:23:24,204
他的映射正快速包围我们
The projections are closing in quick.

1184
01:23:24,205 --> 01:23:25,349
我们得赶快突围
we gotta break out of here,

1185
01:23:25,368 --> 01:23:27,871
不然就出不去了
Before we're totally boxed in.

1186
01:24:02,837 --> 01:24:03,874
真见鬼
Damn it!

1187
01:24:03,908 --> 01:24:07,751
亲爱的  怕什么  做梦就得做开点儿
You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling.

1188
01:24:23,455 --> 01:24:24,800
我们得把他对父亲的怨恨
Now, we need to shift his animosity

1189
01:24:24,801 --> 01:24:26,743
转移到他的教父身上
from his father to his godfather.

1190
01:24:26,756 --> 01:24:28,612
你要毁了他们这么好的关系吗
Would this destroy his one positive relationship?

1191
01:24:28,627 --> 01:24:28,737
不用
No,

1192
01:24:28,737 --> 01:24:30,876
我们一边修复父子间的关系
We'll repair his relationship with his

1193
01:24:30,876 --> 01:24:33,577
一边揭露他邪恶教父的真面目
father by exposing his godfather's true nature.

1194
01:24:33,876 --> 01:24:35,577
真是  比起斋藤  费舍该付我们更多钱
Hell, we should charge Fischer much more than Saito.

1195
01:24:36,692 --> 01:24:38,103
那怎么对付他的潜意识映射 
What about his security?

1196
01:24:38,104 --> 01:24:39,515
我们越深入梦境情况就越糟
It's gonna get worse as we go deeper.

1197
01:24:39,528 --> 01:24:41,919
我们可以用查尔斯先生那招
Now, I think we run with Mr. Charles.

1198
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:42,218
不行
No.

1199
01:24:42,226 --> 01:24:43,982
-查尔斯先生是谁  -馊主意
- Who's Mr. Charles? - Bad idea.

1200
01:24:44,002 --> 01:24:46,249
在第二层  只要我们一接近费舍
The second we get into that hotel and approach fischer,

1201
01:24:46,249 --> 01:24:47,831
他的潜意识就会蜂拥而至
His security's gonna be all over us.

1202
01:24:47,842 --> 01:24:49,187
我们可以用查尔斯先生那招
We run with Mr. Charles

1203
01:24:49,188 --> 01:24:50,196
就像上次斯坦那个活儿一样
like we did on the Stein Job.

1204
01:24:50,225 --> 01:24:52,406
-这么说你们做过  -对  但失败了
- So you've done it before? - Yeah, it didn't work.

1205
01:24:52,417 --> 01:24:54,118
目标意识到了他在做梦
The subject realized that he was dreaming,

1206
01:24:54,118 --> 01:24:55,819
而他的潜意识将我们撕成了碎片
And his subconscious tore us to pieces.

1207
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,564
好极了  吃一堑长一智嘛
Excellent. but you've learnt a lot, right?

1208
01:24:57,581 --> 01:25:00,197
-得有人分散目标注意力  -没问题
- I need some kind of distraction. - No problem.

1209
01:25:00,218 --> 01:25:02,788
我之前用过的那位靓女怎么样
How about a lovely lady I've used before.

1210
01:25:02,819 --> 01:25:04,612
-听好了  你小心开车  -好
- Listen to me. you drive carefully, alright? - Yeah.

1211
01:25:04,626 --> 01:25:07,196
下一层梦境会相当不稳定
The thing down there's gonna be unstable as hell.

1212
01:25:11,705 --> 01:25:13,407
别跳得太早
Don't jump too soon.

1213
01:25:13,423 --> 01:25:15,518
我们只有一次坠落机会
We only have one shot at that kick you're gonna make.

1214
01:25:15,529 --> 01:25:17,679
我会放音乐提前通知你们
I'll play the music, then you'll know it's coming.

1215
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:18,811
其他的只能靠你们自己了
the rest is on you.

1216
01:25:18,872 --> 01:25:20,127
-准备好了吗  -好了
- Are you ready? - Ready!

1217
01:25:21,902 --> 01:25:23,366
好梦
Sweet dreams!

1218
01:25:23,604 --> 01:25:25,272
我让你感到无聊了吗
Am I boring you?

1219
01:25:26,274 --> 01:25:30,011
我一直在讲我的故事  但你好像不喜欢
I was telling you my story. I guess it wasn't your liking.

1220
01:25:30,019 --> 01:25:34,442
我心里很乱
Oh, um... I have a lot in my mind.

1221
01:25:35,523 --> 01:25:37,465
查尔斯先生出场了
There goes Mr. Charles.

1222
01:25:42,171 --> 01:25:44,916
你是费舍先生吧
Mr. Fischer? Right?

1223
01:25:45,034 --> 01:25:48,254
很高兴再次见到你  我是营销部的罗德・格林
Pleasure to see you again. Rod Green from marketing.

1224
01:25:49,767 --> 01:25:52,153
-而你是...  -我是要走了
- And you must be...? - Leaving.

1225
01:25:55,551 --> 01:25:57,655
你无聊了就找我吧
In case you get bored...

1226
01:26:02,132 --> 01:26:03,780
她一定是把你甩了
Must have blown you off.

1227
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:07,171
除非她的号码真只有六位数
That is unless her phone number, really is only six digits.

1228
01:26:08,241 --> 01:26:10,967
这么乱搭讪陌生人
Funny way down, make friends,

1229
01:26:10,967 --> 01:26:13,693
很容易被顺手牵羊
someone stealing their wallet like that.

1230
01:26:15,594 --> 01:26:18,756
见鬼  光那钱包就值...
Ha, goddamnit! Wallet alone is worth at least...

1231
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:20,563
五百美元吗
About 500 dollars, right?

1232
01:26:20,578 --> 01:26:23,889
不用担心  现在我的人已经去处理了
Listen, don't worry about it. My people are already on it as we speak.

1233
01:26:23,903 --> 01:26:26,034
查尔斯先生到底是什么意思
Who or what is Mr. Charles?

1234
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:29,746
这招是用来诱使费舍对抗自己的潜意识
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious.

1235
01:26:29,791 --> 01:26:31,328
那你为什么不赞成
Then why don't you approve?

1236
01:26:31,345 --> 01:26:33,451
因为这就得告诉目标他在做梦
'cause it involves telling the mark that he's dreaming,

1237
01:26:33,488 --> 01:26:35,983
这样的话就会招来映射的注意
Which involves attracting a lot of attention on us.

1238
01:26:35,992 --> 01:26:38,025
柯布不是说绝不能这么做吗
Didn't cobb say never to do that?

1239
01:26:38,223 --> 01:26:40,459
你也注意到了吧  柯布口口声声的禁忌
So now you've noticed how much time

1240
01:26:40,459 --> 01:26:43,398
他自己却一犯再犯
Cobb spends doing things he says never to do.

1241
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:46,978
斋藤先生  能打扰一下么 
Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?

1242
01:26:46,979 --> 01:26:48,001
不好意思
Oh, I... I'm sorry.

1243
01:26:48,001 --> 01:26:49,275
等等
Wait!

1244
01:26:50,759 --> 01:26:55,157
-你看起来气色好多了  -兴致真好  伊姆斯先生 
- You look a bit perkier. - Very amusing, Mr. Eames.

1245
01:27:00,745 --> 01:27:02,668
飞机遇到气流了吗  
Turbulence on the plane?

1246
01:27:02,669 --> 01:27:06,691
不  更近一些  是尤瑟夫在开车
No, it's much closer. It's Yusuf's driving.

1247
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:19,188
-不好意思  你刚说你是谁  -营销部的罗德・格林
- I'm sorry, who did you say you were? - Rod Green from marketing.

1248
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:22,061
其实这不是真的吧
That's not true at all, is it?

1249
01:27:22,938 --> 01:27:26,735
我的名字是查尔斯  你还记得我吧
My name is Mr. Charles. You remember me, don't you?

1250
01:27:26,767 --> 01:27:29,941
我是你在这的安全主管
I'm the head of your security down here.

1251
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:32,289
到其他楼层下电梯  一直走别停下
Get out on a different floor and keep moving.

1252
01:27:32,308 --> 01:27:35,683
-扔了钱包  映射会过来找  -好
- Dump the wallet. The security will look for that. - Okey.

1253
01:27:35,738 --> 01:27:38,957
我们得为柯布多争取点时间
We need to buy cobb a little more time.

1254
01:27:41,706 --> 01:27:43,617
保安啊
Security, huh?

1255
01:27:45,705 --> 01:27:47,984
-你为这间酒店工作吗  -不是
- You work for the hotel? - No, no.

1256
01:27:48,005 --> 01:27:51,966
我专门负责特殊领域的安全
I specialize in a very specific type of security,

1257
01:27:52,005 --> 01:27:54,966
潜意识安全
subconscious security.

1258
01:27:55,028 --> 01:27:57,996
你是在说梦吗
Are you talking about dreams?

1259
01:27:57,996 --> 01:28:00,964
你是在说盗梦
Are you talking about, um... extraction?

1260
01:28:00,978 --> 01:28:03,502
我是来这保护你
I'm here to protect you.

1261
01:28:15,688 --> 01:28:17,741
费舍先生  我是来保护你
Mr. Fischer, I'm here to protect you

1262
01:28:17,752 --> 01:28:22,270
保护你不被拖入梦境入侵意识
In the event that someone tries access to your mind through your dreams.

1263
01:28:22,281 --> 01:28:28,082
你在这不安全  他们冲着你来了
You are not safe here. They are coming for you.

1264
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:47,732
天气很诡异吧
Strange weather, isn't it?

1265
01:28:52,709 --> 01:28:54,704
你感觉到了吗
You feel that?

1266
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:56,836
怎么回事
What's happening?

1267
01:28:56,909 --> 01:29:00,305
柯布正设法让费舍注意梦中的异常
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention to the strangeness of the dream,

1268
01:29:00,321 --> 01:29:03,176
所以他的潜意识开始寻找梦主了
which is making his subconscious look for the dreamer,

1269
01:29:03,202 --> 01:29:06,848
也就是我  快吻我
For me. Quick, give me a kiss.

1270
01:29:11,333 --> 01:29:15,686
-他们还是盯着我们  -没错  不过这也值了
- They're still looking at us. - Yeah, it's worth a shot.

1271
01:29:15,737 --> 01:29:17,842
我们还是离开这吧
We should probably get out of here.

1272
01:29:33,467 --> 01:29:35,042
你感觉到了吗
Do you feel that?

1273
01:29:35,057 --> 01:29:37,064
费舍先生  其实你受过训练
You've actually been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.

1274
01:29:37,081 --> 01:29:41,515
注意天气的反常和重力的转移
Pay attention to the strangeness of the weather, the shift of the gravity.

1275
01:29:41,526 --> 01:29:44,950
这一切都不是真的  你在做梦
None of this is real. You're in a dream.

1276
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:52,361
最简单的证明方法  就是设法回想一下
Now, the easiest way for you to test yourself is to try to remember,

1277
01:29:52,379 --> 01:29:55,911
你如何来到这家酒店  行吗
How you arrived at this hotel. Can you do that?

1278
01:29:56,507 --> 01:29:58,338
好  但我...
Year, I don't, I...

1279
01:29:58,357 --> 01:30:00,715
放松  呼吸  仔细回想你受过的训练
Now, breathe, breathe. Remember your training,

1280
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:05,824
接受你在做梦的事实  我是来保护你的
Accept the fact that you're in the dream, and I'm here to protect you.

1281
01:30:05,824 --> 01:30:06,413
继续想想
Go on.

1282
01:30:12,106 --> 01:30:15,371
-你不是真人吗  -对  我不是
- You're not real? - No, no.

1283
01:30:15,417 --> 01:30:17,820
我是你潜意识里的映射
I'm a projection of your subconscious.

1284
01:30:17,834 --> 01:30:20,064
我是来保护你
I was sent here to protect you in the event

1285
01:30:20,064 --> 01:30:22,657
防止盗梦人将你拖入梦中
that the extractors try to pull you into a dream.

1286
01:30:22,764 --> 01:30:27,085
费舍先生  我肯定他们正在动手
And I believe that's what's going on right now, Mr. Fischer.

1287
01:30:28,105 --> 01:30:29,820
好吧
Yeah, okey.

1288
01:30:30,438 --> 01:30:32,349
好的
Okey.

1289
01:30:34,559 --> 01:30:39,889
-你能带我离开这吗  -当然  跟我来
- Can you get me out of here? - Right away. Follow me.

1290
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:02,308
这算什么  你做了什么
This is what? What're you doing?

1291
01:31:02,332 --> 01:31:04,755
他们是被派来绑架你的  明白吗
These men were sent here  to abduct you, alright?

1292
01:31:04,786 --> 01:31:08,047
如果你要我帮忙  就得保持冷静
If you want my help, you have to remain calm.

1293
01:31:09,289 --> 01:31:11,866
费舍先生  你得和我合作
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.

1294
01:31:23,393 --> 01:31:27,346
如果这是梦  我只要自杀就能醒过来吧
If this is a dream, I should just kill myself to wake up. Right?

1295
01:31:27,381 --> 01:31:29,505
费舍先生  换做我就不会这么做
I wouldn't do that if I were you, mr. fischer.

1296
01:31:29,505 --> 01:31:31,299
我肯定他们对你用了镇静剂
I believe that they have you sedated.

1297
01:31:31,315 --> 01:31:34,916
如果你扣动扳机  就醒不过来了
If... if you pull that trigger, you may not wake up.

1298
01:31:35,223 --> 01:31:38,116
你会坠入更深层的梦里
You may go into a further dream state now.

1299
01:31:38,204 --> 01:31:40,532
你明白我在说什么
You know what I'm talking about.

1300
01:31:41,773 --> 01:31:46,931
回想下你受过的训练和我对你说的话
You remember the training. Remember what I said to you.

1301
01:31:46,994 --> 01:31:49,027
把枪给我
Give me the gun.

1302
01:31:59,726 --> 01:32:03,078
-这房间在528房间正下方吧  -没错
- This room should be directly below 528? - Yeah.

1303
01:32:11,818 --> 01:32:13,502
好好想想  费舍先生
Think, Mr. Fischer, think.

1304
01:32:13,519 --> 01:32:17,405
回想下做梦前发生了什么
What do you remember from before this dream?

1305
01:32:17,414 --> 01:32:20,887
好像发生了很激烈的枪战...
Oh... there was, um... there was a lot of gunfires.

1306
01:32:20,904 --> 01:32:23,409
还下着大雨...
There was... rain.

1307
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:25,710
彼得叔叔
Uncle peter.

1308
01:32:25,774 --> 01:32:28,872
-天呐  我们被绑架了  -你们被关在哪里
- Oh my god, we've been kidnaped. - Where were they holding you?

1309
01:32:32,273 --> 01:32:35,914
-我们被关在一辆货车后面  -难怪重力会转移
- They had us in the back of a van. - That explains the gravity shifts.

1310
01:32:35,938 --> 01:32:38,187
你们正在一辆货车后面  再好好想想
You're in the back of a van right now. Ke...keep going!

1311
01:32:38,211 --> 01:32:43,950
好像...和一个保险箱有关
It had something to do with, um... something to do with a... a safe.

1312
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,160
天呐  怎么这么难回想
God, why is it so hard to remember?

1313
01:32:46,178 --> 01:32:48,838
就像你醒来试图回想自己的梦一样
It's like trying to remember a dream after you've woken up.

1314
01:32:48,852 --> 01:32:51,439
这需要长时间的练习
Listen to this, it takes years of practice.

1315
01:32:51,453 --> 01:32:53,950
你和布朗宁被拖进了这个梦境
You and Browning have been pulled into this dream,

1316
01:32:53,961 --> 01:32:56,315
因为他们想从你的头脑中窃取某样东西
Because they're trying to steal something from your mind.

1317
01:32:56,328 --> 01:33:00,192
我要你集中精神  努力回想下那是什么
I need you to focus and try to remember what that is.

1318
01:33:00,238 --> 01:33:02,288
到底是什么  好好想想  费舍先生
What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!

1319
01:33:02,289 --> 01:33:03,504
是一组密码
Uh... a combination.

1320
01:33:03,659 --> 01:33:06,594
他们要我说出一下子想到的几个数字
They demanded the first numbers that popped into my head.

1321
01:33:06,606 --> 01:33:09,067
他们试图从你的意识里窃取数字
They were trying to extract the number from your subconscious.

1322
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:12,680
这可能代表任何东西  我们现在酒店里
It can represent anything. We are in a hotel right now.

1323
01:33:13,470 --> 01:33:17,015
也许是房间号码  那组数字是什么  费舍先生  
Should try hotel rooms. What was the number, Mr. Fischer?

1324
01:33:17,029 --> 01:33:19,662
快努力回想下  这很重要
Try and remember for me. This is very important.

1325
01:33:19,726 --> 01:33:23,321
5...52...这串数字很长
5...52... it was something long number...

1326
01:33:23,322 --> 01:33:24,120
已经很好了
That's good enough.

1327
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:26,212
我们先试试看
We could start there.

1328
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:28,002
-是五楼  -好
- Fifth floor. - Yep.

1329
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:32,301
-你准备用计时器吗  -不  我得自己判断
- So do you use a timer? - No, I have to judge it for myself.

1330
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,114
你们在528房间做梦时
While you're all asleep in 528.

1331
01:33:34,115 --> 01:33:36,059
我等着尤瑟夫的坠落信号
I wait for Yusuf's kick.

1332
01:33:36,084 --> 01:33:38,147
-你怎么知道  -他会放音乐提醒我
- Well, how will you know? - His music warns me.

1333
01:33:38,162 --> 01:33:40,469
到时货车会撞上桥边的护栏
And then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge,

1334
01:33:40,482 --> 01:33:45,523
这点清楚无误  我们就能完美地同步坠落
That should be unmistakable. So we get a nice, synchronized kick.

1335
01:33:45,542 --> 01:33:48,106
如果炸得太早  我们没法回到上层
If it's too soon, we won't get pulled out.

1336
01:33:48,114 --> 01:33:51,523
如果炸得太晚  我们也无法坠落
And if it's too late, I won't be able to drop this.

1337
01:33:51,535 --> 01:33:55,195
-为什么  -因为到时货车是自由下落
- Why not? - Because of the van that will be in free fall.

1338
01:33:55,753 --> 01:33:58,996
-失重情况下掉不下来  -也是
- Can't drop you without gravity. - Right.

1339
01:34:04,042 --> 01:34:05,923
我们是一起的
They're with me.

1340
01:34:31,025 --> 01:34:32,966
-查尔斯先生  -费舍先生  
- Mr. Charles. - Do you know

1341
01:34:32,967 --> 01:34:33,937
你知道这是什么吗
what that is, Mr. Fischer?

1342
01:34:33,961 --> 01:34:35,732
我想我知道  
Yeah, I... I think so. yeah.

1343
01:34:35,733 --> 01:34:37,268
他们想把你拖入梦里
They were trying to put you under.

1344
01:34:37,601 --> 01:34:39,802
-我已经在梦里了  -再拖入更深一层
- I'm already under. - Under again.

1345
01:34:39,905 --> 01:34:42,844
什么意思  梦里还能做梦吗
What do you mean? A... Dream within a dream?

1346
01:34:43,218 --> 01:34:46,908
-哎呀  你换了身行头  -不好意思  你是哪位
- Hey, I see you've changed. - I'm sorry?

1347
01:34:48,157 --> 01:34:53,007
抱歉  我把你当成了我的一个朋友   
Oh... I'm sorry. I've mistaken you for a friend.

1348
01:34:53,007 --> 01:34:55,741
你那朋友一定很帅
Good looking fella, I'm sure.

1349
01:34:57,649 --> 01:34:59,553
那是费舍潜意识里映射出的布朗宁
That's fischer's projection of browning.

1350
01:34:59,553 --> 01:35:01,554
我们跟着他  看他做什么
Let's follow him and see how he behaves.

1351
01:35:01,571 --> 01:35:03,840
-为什么  -这样我们就能知道
- Why? - Because how he acts would tell us...

1352
01:35:03,858 --> 01:35:06,897
费舍是否如我们设计般怀疑布朗宁
If Fischer's starting to suspect his motives as the way we wanted to.

1353
01:35:12,326 --> 01:35:15,495
-彼得叔叔  -你不是说你们被一起绑架的吗
- Uncle peter? - You said you were kidnaped together?

1354
01:35:15,519 --> 01:35:16,852
也不是
Well, um... well, not... not exactly.

1355
01:35:16,872 --> 01:35:18,855
他们先抓了他  还一直在拷问他
They... they already had him.they were torturing him.

1356
01:35:18,886 --> 01:35:20,867
你亲眼看到他们拷问他了吗
And you saw them torture him?

1357
01:35:27,834 --> 01:35:29,853
那些绑匪是你的人
The kidnapers are working for you?

1358
01:35:29,854 --> 01:35:32,074
罗伯特...
Oh, Robert...

1359
01:35:32,103 --> 01:35:36,629
你要打开保险箱  拿那份候补遗嘱吗
You're trying to get that safe open? So you get the alternate will?

1360
01:35:36,646 --> 01:35:38,708
费舍明日公司是我一生的心血
Fischer-Morrow has been my entire life.

1361
01:35:38,708 --> 01:35:40,770
我不能让你毁掉它
I can't let you destroy it.

1362
01:35:40,794 --> 01:35:43,437
我怎么会亲手毁掉自己的遗产呢
I'm not gonna throw away my inheritance! Why would I?

1363
01:35:43,470 --> 01:35:48,520
我不忍让你看到你父亲最后的嘲弄
I couldn't let you rise to your father's last taunt.

1364
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:49,147
什么嘲弄  
What taunt?

1365
01:35:49,148 --> 01:35:50,372
就是那份遗嘱  罗伯特
The will, Robert.

1366
01:35:50,393 --> 01:35:55,298
就是他对你莫大的侮辱
That will, that's his last insult, a challenge for you...

1367
01:35:55,354 --> 01:35:57,729
让你冒险去自己创造财富
you'd build something for yourself,

1368
01:35:57,740 --> 01:36:02,765
认为你不配继承他的成就
by telling you you're not worthy of his accomplishments.

1369
01:36:06,969 --> 01:36:12,647
-他的确对我很失望  -我很抱歉
- Well, that he was, um... disappointed. - Hmm, I'm sorry.

1370
01:36:13,849 --> 01:36:16,575
但是他错了
But... he's wrong.

1371
01:36:17,636 --> 01:36:20,364
你完全能超越他的成就
You can build a better company than he ever did.

1372
01:36:20,383 --> 01:36:23,996
-费舍先生  他在说谎  -你怎么知道
- Mr. Fischer, he's lying. - How do you know?

1373
01:36:24,024 --> 01:36:25,385
相信我  我就是干这行的
Trust me, it's what I do.

1374
01:36:25,386 --> 01:36:26,118
他有什么瞒着你
He's hiding something,

1375
01:36:26,145 --> 01:36:28,810
我们得找出真相
And we need to find out what that is.

1376
01:36:29,462 --> 01:36:34,144
我要你以其人之道还治其人之身
I need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you.

1377
01:36:35,213 --> 01:36:36,979
我们要进入他的潜意识
We'll enter his subconscious and

1378
01:36:36,979 --> 01:36:39,353
找出他内心隐藏的秘密
find out what he doesn't want you to know.

1379
01:36:40,584 --> 01:36:41,872
好
All right.

1380
01:36:48,002 --> 01:36:49,152
他睡过去了
He's out.

1381
01:36:49,175 --> 01:36:52,091
等等  我们到底要进入谁的潜意识
Wait, whose subconscious are we going into exactly?

1382
01:36:52,109 --> 01:36:53,441
费舍的潜意识
We're going into Fischer's.

1383
01:36:53,471 --> 01:36:55,396
我告诉他是进入布朗宁的潜意识
But I told him it was Browning's,

1384
01:36:55,397 --> 01:36:56,271
这样他就会协助我们
so he can be a part of our team.

1385
01:36:56,291 --> 01:36:58,646
他会帮助我们侵入自己的潜意识
He's gonna help us break into his own subconscious.

1386
01:36:58,669 --> 01:36:59,391
没错
That's right.

1387
01:37:00,119 --> 01:37:02,699
映射会追着你四处跑吧
The security's gonna run you down, huh?

1388
01:37:02,699 --> 01:37:05,409
看本少爷让他们疲于奔命
Then I will lead them on a merry chase.

1389
01:37:05,545 --> 01:37:06,995
记得赶在坠落前回来  
Just be back before the kick.

1390
01:37:06,996 --> 01:37:09,106
好好睡吧  伊姆斯先生
Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.

1391
01:37:13,395 --> 01:37:14,824
你没事吧
Are you good?

1392
01:37:17,591 --> 01:37:22,508
-喂  你准备好了吗  -没事  我准备好了
- Hey! Are you ready? - Yes, yes, I'm... I'm fine. I'm ready.

1393
01:37:35,424 --> 01:37:39,906
柯布  那里面会有什么
Cobb. cobb? What's down there?

1394
01:37:43,213 --> 01:37:45,918
我们希望费舍了解的真相
Hopefully the truth we want Fischer to learn.

1395
01:37:45,918 --> 01:37:48,094
我是指你的潜意识里会有什么
I mean, what's down there for you?

1396
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:25,584
你们看到了吗
Huh... did you see that?

1397
01:40:44,655 --> 01:40:46,424
伊姆斯  这是你的梦境
Eames, this is your dream.

1398
01:40:46,453 --> 01:40:49,634
我要你引开医院里的警卫  明白吗
I need you to draw the security away from the complex. Do you understand?

1399
01:40:49,675 --> 01:40:51,776
-那谁带费舍进去  -我不行
- Who will guide Fischer in? - Not me.

1400
01:40:51,816 --> 01:40:54,273
我如果知道了路线  会危及整个任务
If I know the route, everything could be compromised.

1401
01:40:54,321 --> 01:40:57,102
-这是我设计的迷宫  -不  你得跟着我
- I... I designed the place. - No, you're with me.

1402
01:40:57,138 --> 01:40:59,686
-我能行  -好吧
- I can do it. - Alright.

1403
01:40:59,702 --> 01:41:01,899
跟他简单说下前往医院的路线
You brief him on the route into the complex.

1404
01:41:01,899 --> 01:41:03,688
费舍  你跟着他走
Fischer, you'll be going with him.

1405
01:41:03,802 --> 01:41:05,778
好  你呢
Alright. What about you?

1406
01:41:06,089 --> 01:41:09,240
保持线路畅通  我会一直监听
Keep this live. I'll be listening in the whole time.

1407
01:41:09,312 --> 01:41:10,737
建筑上层的窗户都很宽敞
The windows on that upper floor're big

1408
01:41:10,737 --> 01:41:12,613
我可以在南面的塔楼上掩护你
enough for me to cover you from that south tower.

1409
01:41:12,634 --> 01:41:15,123
-看见了吗  -好  你不进去吗
- You see it? - Yeah. you're not coming in?

1410
01:41:15,134 --> 01:41:17,081
你要了解关于你父亲的真相
In order to find out the truth about your father,

1411
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:20,335
就得自己潜入布朗宁的潜意识
you're gonna need to break into Browning's mind on your own.

1412
01:41:20,945 --> 01:41:22,348
走吧  费舍
Come, Fischer!

1413
01:42:17,873 --> 01:42:21,004
拉警报  拉警报
Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!

1414
01:42:21,842 --> 01:42:23,185
行动
Move!

1415
01:42:25,061 --> 01:42:26,461
快上
Go!

1416
01:42:53,333 --> 01:42:54,732
但愿你们准备好了
Hope you're ready.

1417
01:43:03,788 --> 01:43:06,276
不  太早了
No, it's too soon.

1418
01:43:11,752 --> 01:43:13,330
柯布  听见了吗
Cobb, do you hear that?

1419
01:43:13,352 --> 01:43:17,499
二十分钟前就有动静  我还以为是风声
First heard it about twenty minutes ago. I thought it was the wind up here.

1420
01:43:17,524 --> 01:43:20,023
我听见了  是音乐
Yeah, I hear it. It's music.

1421
01:43:20,037 --> 01:43:23,382
-那怎么办  -抓紧时间
- So what do we do? - Move fast!

1422
01:43:28,352 --> 01:43:31,129
尤瑟夫还有十秒就跳了
Yusuf's ten seconds for the jump,

1423
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:35,032
也就是说亚瑟还有三分钟
which gives Arthur three minutes.

1424
01:43:38,493 --> 01:43:40,410
-我们有多少时间  -六十分钟
- Which gives us what? - Sixty minutes.

1425
01:43:40,432 --> 01:43:41,974
他们能在一小时内赶到那吗
Can they make that route in under an hour?

1426
01:43:41,974 --> 01:43:43,947
他们还得下到中层平台上
They still have to climb down to the middle terrace.

1427
01:43:43,958 --> 01:43:46,908
必须换条路线  找条捷径
Well, then they need a new route, a more direct route.

1428
01:43:49,984 --> 01:43:51,204
在那
There!

1429
01:43:57,743 --> 01:43:59,630
我可是照迷宫设计的
It's designed as a labyrinth.

1430
01:43:59,645 --> 01:44:02,693
迷宫里也能有近道吧
There must be access routes that cut through the maze, right?

1431
01:44:02,715 --> 01:44:04,008
伊姆斯
Eames.

1432
01:44:26,939 --> 01:44:29,835
-伊姆斯有改动过吗  -你还是不知道为好
- Did Eames add any features? - I don't think I should tell you.

1433
01:44:29,864 --> 01:44:31,573
-要是茉儿知道了...  -没时间了
- If Mal finds out... - We don't have time for this.

1434
01:44:31,597 --> 01:44:32,875
他改动过吗
Did he add any?

1435
01:44:32,898 --> 01:44:35,877
他加了套通风系统  通过这可以抄近道
He added an airduct system that can cut through the maze.

1436
01:44:35,886 --> 01:44:37,607
好极了  告诉他们
Good, explain it to them.

1437
01:44:37,630 --> 01:44:39,420
-斋藤  -说
- Saito? - Go ahead?

1438
01:45:11,884 --> 01:45:14,784
-死路一条  -不
- Paradox. - No...!

1439
01:46:23,278 --> 01:46:25,902
-怎么回事  -是坠落
- What was that? - The kick.

1440
01:46:26,041 --> 01:46:29,623
-柯布  我们错过了吗  -错过了
- Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it? - Yeah, we missed it.

1441
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:36,698
丫的就不能在梦里造个海滩吗
Couldn't someone have dreamt up a goddamned beach, huh?

1442
01:46:37,753 --> 01:46:42,255
-现在怎么办  -在下次坠落前完成任务
- What the hell do we do now? - We finish the job before the next kick.

1443
01:46:42,267 --> 01:46:45,866
-哪还有坠落  -货车坠入水中的瞬间
- What next kick? - When the van hits the water.

1444
01:47:07,554 --> 01:47:10,983
如需拨打电话  请先挂机重试
If you want to make a call, please hang up and try again.

1445
01:47:12,441 --> 01:47:15,794
失重情况下该如何让你们坠落
How can I drop you without gravity?

1446
01:47:18,121 --> 01:47:21,705
亚瑟还有几分钟  我们大概有二十分钟
Arthur has a couple of minutes, we have about twenty.

1447
01:47:44,723 --> 01:47:46,199
你没事吧
Are you okey?

1448
01:47:50,728 --> 01:47:53,905
快走  回基地去
Move on! To the base!

1449
01:47:58,672 --> 01:47:59,901
有点不对劲  警卫好像发现了什么
There's something wrong, they're heading your way,

1450
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:00,953
朝你们那边去了
like they know something.

1451
01:48:03,687 --> 01:48:07,023
多拖延些时间  好吗  走吧
Just buy us some more time, alright? Come on!

1452
01:48:07,224 --> 01:48:08,625
这就去
On my way.

1453
01:49:48,117 --> 01:49:50,509
那就是保险库外的前厅
That's the antechamber outside the strong room.

1454
01:49:50,519 --> 01:49:52,301
保险库有窗户吗
Does the strong room have windows?

1455
01:49:52,322 --> 01:49:54,217
要是有就不保险了
Well, I mean it wouldn't be very strong if it did.

1456
01:49:54,227 --> 01:49:57,499
但愿费舍喜欢我们的设计
Let's hope Fischer likes what he finds in there.

1457
01:49:58,124 --> 01:50:01,123
-这些映射是他的潜意识吗  -对
- Are those projections part of his subconscious? - Yes.

1458
01:50:01,333 --> 01:50:03,884
-这会损伤他的那部分意识吗  -不会
- Are you destroying those parts of his mind? - No, no.

1459
01:50:03,884 --> 01:50:05,183
这些只是映射
They're just projections.

1460
01:50:29,285 --> 01:50:32,241
好了  我们到了
Okey. We are here.

1461
01:50:32,273 --> 01:50:35,729
暂时安全  抓紧时间  一整支军队正朝你们涌来
You are clear but hurry. There's an entire army heading your way.

1462
01:51:01,532 --> 01:51:03,347
进来了
We're in.

1463
01:51:08,328 --> 01:51:10,016
看这里
Look here!

1464
01:51:51,672 --> 01:51:55,492
-还有人在里面  -费舍  是陷阱  快出去
- Someone else's in there. - Fischer, it's a trap. Get out!

1465
01:51:56,939 --> 01:51:59,026
快啊  再下来点
Come on, a little lower.

1466
01:52:04,182 --> 01:52:07,106
柯布  不  她...
Cobb. No, she...

1467
01:52:07,208 --> 01:52:10,446
-她不是真的  -你怎么知道
- She is not real. - How do you know that?

1468
01:52:10,469 --> 01:52:14,826
她只是映射  费舍...费舍才是真的
She is just a projection. Fischer... Fischer is real.

1469
01:52:18,429 --> 01:52:19,208
你好
Hello.

1470
01:52:24,392 --> 01:52:28,450
伊姆斯  快去前厅
Eames! Eames! Get to the antechamber now!

1471
01:53:11,544 --> 01:53:14,128
-怎么回事  -茉儿把费舍杀了吗
- What happened? - Mal killed Fischer?

1472
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:18,669
我下不了手
I couldn't shoot her.

1473
01:53:19,517 --> 01:53:23,163
他醒不过来了  他已经陷入了下一层
There's no use in reviving him, his mind's already trapped down there.

1474
01:53:23,196 --> 01:53:27,532
-都结束了  -就这样失败了吗
- It's all over. - So that's it? Then we failed?

1475
01:53:27,851 --> 01:53:30,474
完了  抱歉
We're done. I'm sorry.

1476
01:53:33,824 --> 01:53:37,346
回不了家的又不是我  是吧
Well, it's not me who doesn't get back to my family, is it?

1477
01:53:37,377 --> 01:53:39,400
真遗憾  我真想知道里面会发生什么
It's a shame. I really wanted to know what's gonna happen in there.

1478
01:53:39,537 --> 01:53:40,557
我肯定这次能成功
I swear we had this one.

1479
01:53:41,446 --> 01:53:43,264
装炸药吧
Let's set the charges.

1480
01:53:45,302 --> 01:53:47,270
等等  还有个方法
No, there's still another way.

1481
01:53:47,725 --> 01:53:51,383
-我们只要跟着费舍下去  -没时间了
- We just have to follow Fischer down there. - Not enough time.

1482
01:53:51,394 --> 01:53:54,478
不  进入下一层后就有足够时间
No, but there will... there will be enough time down there.

1483
01:53:55,317 --> 01:53:56,925
我们会找到他  好吗
And we will find him, okey?

1484
01:53:56,943 --> 01:53:58,820
亚瑟开始放音乐时
As soon as Arthur's music kicks in,

1485
01:53:58,820 --> 01:54:01,194
就用起搏器救活他
just use the defibrillator to revive him.

1486
01:54:01,224 --> 01:54:04,572
我们可以...在下层让他坠落回来
We can give him his... his own kick down below.

1487
01:54:04,889 --> 01:54:06,700
然后你让他进去
Look, you get him in there.

1488
01:54:06,725 --> 01:54:09,684
音乐一结束  就炸掉医院
As soon as the music ends, you blow up the hospital,

1489
01:54:09,699 --> 01:54:13,121
我们就能一起坠落回去了
and we all ride the kick back up the layers.

1490
01:54:13,838 --> 01:54:15,031
值得一试
That's worth a shot.

1491
01:54:15,031 --> 01:54:18,610
我布置炸药时  斋藤可以掩护我
Saito can hold the guards out, while I set the charges.

1492
01:54:18,659 --> 01:54:21,748
斋藤撑不了那么久吧
Saito will never make it, will he?

1493
01:54:22,076 --> 01:54:25,918
-柯布  我们必须试试  -行动吧
- Cobb, come on. We've got to try this. - Let's go.

1494
01:54:26,238 --> 01:54:28,631
你们要是没及时赶回来  我可不顾了你们了
If you are not back for the kick, I will go with or without you.

1495
01:54:28,652 --> 01:54:31,195
她说得没错  行动吧
She's right. She's right. Let's go.

1496
01:54:36,129 --> 01:54:38,257
我还能指望你完成接下来的任务吗
Can I trust you to do what needs to happen here?

1497
01:54:38,257 --> 01:54:39,876
我是说  茉儿也会在下面
I mean, Mal's gonna be down there.

1498
01:54:39,893 --> 01:54:42,326
我知道去哪找她  费舍肯定在她手里
I know where to find her. She'll have Fischer.

1499
01:54:42,361 --> 01:54:44,196
-你怎么知道  -因为...
- How do you know? - Because...

1500
01:54:44,214 --> 01:54:46,591
她想让我去下面找她
She wants me to come after her,

1501
01:54:46,591 --> 01:54:48,968
这样我们就能在一起了
she wants me back down there with her.

1502
01:55:15,626 --> 01:55:16,704
你没事吧
Are you alright?

1503
01:55:23,516 --> 01:55:28,811
-这就是你们的世界吗  -曾经是  她肯定在这
- This is your world? - Was. This is where she'll be.

1504
01:55:30,054 --> 01:55:31,326
走吧
Come on.

1505
01:56:09,531 --> 01:56:10,834
来
Come here.

1506
01:56:17,931 --> 01:56:19,646
斋藤
Saito, Saito!

1507
01:56:20,712 --> 01:56:23,105
你帮我保护好费舍
I need you, I need you to take care of Fischer,

1508
01:56:23,105 --> 01:56:24,977
我得去布置炸药  好吗
while I go set some charges. Okey?

1509
01:56:24,990 --> 01:56:28,700
这种工作可不能带观光客 
No room for tourists on this job.

1510
01:56:30,785 --> 01:56:32,386
收回我的话
Who said?

1511
01:57:04,817 --> 01:57:06,979
这些都你们造的吗  太不可思议了
You built all this? This is incredible.

1512
01:57:07,321 --> 01:57:08,661
我们造了许多年
We built it for years.

1513
01:57:10,343 --> 01:57:12,924
记忆是我们的蓝图
And we started it on the memories.

1514
01:57:19,357 --> 01:57:20,688
这边
This way.

1515
01:57:29,357 --> 01:57:31,688
紧急制动

1516
01:58:02,384 --> 01:58:04,092
这是我们住的街区
This is our neighborhood,

1517
01:58:04,623 --> 01:58:06,774
照我们曾经的住处造的
The place is from our past.

1518
01:58:07,026 --> 01:58:09,148
那是我们的第一间公寓
That was our first apartment.

1519
01:58:09,192 --> 01:58:12,971
茉儿怀孕后  我们搬去了那栋房子
And we moved to that building right there, after Mal became pregnant,

1520
01:58:12,971 --> 01:58:14,194
之后就住在那儿
that became my home.

1521
01:58:14,221 --> 01:58:17,113
你们按记忆重建了这一切吗
You reconstructed all of this from memory?

1522
01:58:17,113 --> 01:58:19,803
跟你说过  我们有的是时间
Like I told you, we had lots of time.

1523
01:58:19,826 --> 01:58:24,590
-那是什么  -茉儿在那房子里长大
- What's that? - It's the house Mal grew up in.

1524
01:58:24,663 --> 01:58:26,790
-她会在里面吗  -不
- Will she be in there? - No.

1525
01:58:27,567 --> 01:58:28,646
来吧
Come on.

1526
01:58:28,753 --> 01:58:32,193
我们都想住那种别墅  但又钟爱高楼大厦
We both wanted to live in that house, but we loved this type of building.

1527
01:58:32,205 --> 01:58:35,657
在真实世界里  我们必须取舍  但在这不用
In the real world, we'd have to choose, but not here.

1528
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:17,835
你准备怎么把费舍带回去
How would you bring Fischer back?

1529
01:59:17,835 --> 01:59:20,758
还是得想办法让他坠落
We have to come up with some kind of a kick.

1530
01:59:20,772 --> 01:59:24,845
-什么办法  -随机应变吧
- What? - We'd better improvise.

1531
01:59:24,860 --> 01:59:29,011
听着  你得了解我的一些事  关于植梦
Listen, there's something you should know about me, about inception.

1532
01:59:42,078 --> 01:59:48,476
想法就像病毒  顽强无比  感染性极强
An idea is like a virus, resilient, highly contagious.

1533
01:59:48,590 --> 01:59:52,231
再细微的念头也会生根发芽
A smallest seed of an idea can grow.

1534
01:59:52,603 --> 01:59:57,508
它能塑造你  也能毁灭你
It can grow to define or destroy you.

1535
02:00:00,517 --> 02:00:06,215
一个小小的念头  比如"你的世界不是真的"
The smallest idea such as "your world is not real,"

1536
02:00:06,487 --> 02:00:10,091
微不足道却改变了一切
Simple little thought that changes everything.

1537
02:00:11,486 --> 02:00:16,068
你是如此确信自己世界的真实
So certain of your world of what's real.

1538
02:00:16,099 --> 02:00:18,104
你觉得他可信吗
Do you think he is?

1539
02:00:19,729 --> 02:00:23,103
还是觉得其实他也像我一样迷失了
What do you think he is as lost as I was?

1540
02:00:23,704 --> 02:00:26,309
我能分得清真假虚实  茉儿
I know what's real, Mal.

1541
02:00:27,398 --> 02:00:29,585
从未心生疑虑吗
No creeping doubts,

1542
02:00:30,608 --> 02:00:32,907
也从没困扰过吗  道姆
not feeling persecuted, Dom?

1543
02:00:33,391 --> 02:00:37,784
满世界都有匿名组织和警察追捕你
Chased around the globe by anonymous corporations and police forces?

1544
02:00:37,810 --> 02:00:40,968
这难道不是映射追逐着梦主吗
Or whether the projections persecute the dreamer?

1545
02:00:42,027 --> 02:00:43,975
承认吧
Admit it,

1546
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:47,664
你已不再相信所谓的现实
you don't believe in one reality anymore.

1547
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:51,997
所以选择吧  选择留在这里
So choose, choose to be here,

1548
02:00:52,222 --> 02:00:53,761
选择陪着我
Choose me.

1549
02:01:19,710 --> 02:01:23,419
你知道我为何而来  我必须回到孩子身边
You know why I have the deal, have to get back to our children?

1550
02:01:23,419 --> 02:01:24,855
因为你抛弃了他们
Because you left them,

1551
02:01:24,986 --> 02:01:26,718
抛弃了我们
because you left us.

1552
02:01:26,731 --> 02:01:28,778
-你错了  -我没有
- You're wrong! - I'm not wrong.

1553
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:30,774
你头脑混乱了
You're confused.

1554
02:01:31,771 --> 02:01:34,196
我们的孩子在这里
Our children are here.

1555
02:01:34,418 --> 02:01:37,977
你也想再看到他们的脸庞吧
And you'd like to see their faces again, wouldn't you?

1556
02:01:38,051 --> 02:01:41,551
没错  但要在现实的世界  茉儿
Yes. But I want to see them up above, Mal.

1557
02:01:54,748 --> 02:01:56,700
现实的世界
Up above?

1558
02:01:57,710 --> 02:01:59,573
听听你的心声
Listen to yourself.

1559
02:01:59,618 --> 02:02:01,937
他们就是我们的孩子
These are our children.

1560
02:02:01,971 --> 02:02:03,028
自己看
Watch.

1561
02:02:03,684 --> 02:02:05,477
詹姆斯  菲丽帕
James! Phillipa!

1562
02:02:05,487 --> 02:02:07,166
别这样  茉儿  求你了
Don't do this, Mal. Please.

1563
02:02:07,312 --> 02:02:08,824
他们不是我的孩子
Those aren't my children.

1564
02:02:08,859 --> 02:02:10,932
你一直这么告诫自己  但你并不相信
You keep telling yourself that, but you don't believe it.

1565
02:02:10,948 --> 02:02:13,135
-不  我确信  -如果你错了呢
- No, I know it! - What if you're wrong?

1566
02:02:13,152 --> 02:02:15,411
如果我才是真实的呢
What if I'm what's real?

1567
02:02:16,620 --> 02:02:19,521
你一直用自己的那套想法蒙蔽自己
You keep telling yourself what you know.

1568
02:02:20,435 --> 02:02:22,871
但你真正相信什么
But what do you believe?

1569
02:02:23,612 --> 02:02:25,831
又感觉到什么
What do you feel?

1570
02:02:26,974 --> 02:02:28,458
愧疚
Guilt.

1571
02:02:29,617 --> 02:02:32,033
我很愧疚  茉儿
I feel guilt, Mal.

1572
02:02:32,412 --> 02:02:34,770
不管我做什么  不管...
No matter what I do, no...

1573
02:02:34,841 --> 02:02:39,581
不管我是多么无助  多么困惑  那愧疚...
no matter how hopeless I am, no matter how I confused, that guilt...

1574
02:02:39,594 --> 02:02:43,838
都与我如影随形  让我无法忘怀真相
is always there, reminding me of the truth.

1575
02:02:43,981 --> 02:02:45,729
什么真相
What truth?

1576
02:02:47,648 --> 02:02:51,630
你对真实世界的质疑
That the idea that caused you to question your reality

1577
02:02:51,630 --> 02:02:53,612
全是因我而生
came from me.

1578
02:02:56,360 --> 02:03:00,222
你把这个想法植入了我的意识
You planted the idea in my mind?

1579
02:03:00,944 --> 02:03:03,022
她在说什么
What is she talking about?

1580
02:03:03,337 --> 02:03:07,446
我之所以确信植梦是可能的  是因为...
The reason I knew inception was possible was because I...

1581
02:03:07,446 --> 02:03:09,207
我对她植入过
I did it to her first.

1582
02:03:09,654 --> 02:03:13,256
-我曾对自己的妻子植梦  -为什么
- I did it to my own wife. - Why?

1583
02:03:13,486 --> 02:03:15,485
我们在这里迷失了
We were lost in here.

1584
02:03:15,856 --> 02:03:20,855
我清楚我们得逃离这一切  但她不愿接受
I knew we needed to escape, but she wouldn't accept it.

1585
02:03:23,493 --> 02:03:29,594
她把某些东西锁进了内心深处
She had locked something away, something.... something deep inside.

1586
02:03:30,181 --> 02:03:34,603
她曾经知晓的现实  她却选择将其遗忘
The truth that she had once known, but she chose to forget.

1587
02:03:35,211 --> 02:03:37,635
她深陷其中  无法自拔
She couldn't break free.

1588
02:03:39,993 --> 02:03:43,009
于是我决定去寻找它
So I decided to search for it,

1589
02:03:43,431 --> 02:03:48,664
走进她内心最深处  找到那秘密的角落
going deep into the recess of her mind and found that secret place.

1590
02:03:48,817 --> 02:03:50,621
我闯了进去
I broke in.

1591
02:03:50,804 --> 02:03:53,552
植入了一个想法
Then I planted an idea,

1592
02:03:53,660 --> 02:03:58,218
微不足道却改变了一切
a simple little idea that would change everything.

1593
02:04:02,756 --> 02:04:05,505
"她的世界不是真的"
That "her world wasn't real."

1594
02:04:17,860 --> 02:04:21,380
"死亡是唯一的解脱"
"the death was the only escape."

1595
02:04:28,205 --> 02:04:31,186
你在等待一列火车
You're waiting for a train,

1596
02:04:32,489 --> 02:04:35,692
那列火车将载你远去
The train that'll take you far away.

1597
02:04:36,430 --> 02:04:40,096
你了然自己心向何方
You know where you hope this train will take you,

1598
02:04:40,672 --> 02:04:43,266
却不知自己会被载往何处
But you can't know for sure.

1599
02:04:43,775 --> 02:04:46,643
但这并不重要
But it doesn't matter.

1600
02:04:47,034 --> 02:04:48,272
告诉我为什么
Now tell me why!

1601
02:04:48,390 --> 02:04:50,364
因为我们会在一起
Because we'll be together!

1602
02:04:54,230 --> 02:04:56,334
但我从未想到的是...
But I never knew that...

1603
02:04:56,360 --> 02:04:59,596
那个想法就像顽疾一般蔓延在她的脑海
that idea would grow in her mind like a cancer,

1604
02:04:59,596 --> 02:05:01,706
甚至在她梦醒后依旧不散
that even after she woke up.

1605
02:05:03,808 --> 02:05:07,616
甚至在你回归现实后依然耿耿于怀
That even after you came back to reality.

1606
02:05:09,130 --> 02:05:13,683
你依然相信  自己的世界不是真的
That you continue to believe your world wasn't real.

1607
02:05:14,950 --> 02:05:17,762
死亡是唯一的解脱
That death was the only escape.

1608
02:05:17,777 --> 02:05:20,800
茉儿  不要  老天爷啊...
Mal! No! Jesus...

1609
02:05:20,824 --> 02:05:24,407
-你侵入了我的意识  -我是想救你
- You infected my mind? - I was trying to save you.

1610
02:05:24,428 --> 02:05:26,191
你背叛了我
You betrayed me.

1611
02:05:26,242 --> 02:05:30,264
但你仍可以弥补  遵守你的诺言
But you can make amends, you can still keep your promise.

1612
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:33,868
我们还能在一起
We can still be together,

1613
02:05:33,868 --> 02:05:37,456
就在这个我们一起创造的世界
right here, in the world we built together.

1614
02:06:57,072 --> 02:06:59,360
柯布  我们必须找到费舍
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.

1615
02:06:59,955 --> 02:07:02,169
你们找不到他
You can't have him.

1616
02:07:02,629 --> 02:07:06,809
-如果我留在这  能让他们走吗  -你说什么
- If I stay here, would you let them go? - What're you talking about?

1617
02:07:10,305 --> 02:07:12,811
费舍在门廊上
Fischer's on the porch.

1618
02:07:12,833 --> 02:07:15,497
-看看他还活着吗  -柯布  你不能这样
- Go check if he's alive. - Cobb, you can't do this.

1619
02:07:15,516 --> 02:07:18,944
快去看看他还活着吗  去吧
Go check if he's alive, right now. Do it.

1620
02:07:32,774 --> 02:07:37,027
柯布  他没事  时间到了  快来
Cobb, he's here. And it's time. You have to come now!

1621
02:07:37,107 --> 02:07:38,710
把费舍带走  好吗
Take Fischer with you, alright?

1622
02:07:38,947 --> 02:07:40,972
你不能留在这陪她
You can't stay here to be with her.

1623
02:07:43,332 --> 02:07:48,070
的确  斋藤此刻已经死了  他肯定在这里的某处
I'm not. Saito's dead by now, that means he's down here somewhere.

1624
02:07:48,112 --> 02:07:50,756
我必须找到他
It means I have to find him.

1625
02:07:51,506 --> 02:07:54,973
我不能再陪着她  因为她早已不复存在
I can't stay with her anymore, because she doesn't exist.

1626
02:07:54,998 --> 02:07:57,992
对你来说  我是唯一真实的存在
I'm the only thing you do believe in anymore.

1627
02:07:58,314 --> 02:08:02,186
是啊  我也想...
No. I wish...

1628
02:08:03,861 --> 02:08:07,290
我是多么地希望  但是...
I wish more than anything, but...

1629
02:08:07,657 --> 02:08:10,500
我想像不出你的复杂情绪
I can't imagine you with all your complexity,

1630
02:08:10,519 --> 02:08:14,078
你的种种完美和不完美
all your perfection, all your imperfection.

1631
02:08:14,380 --> 02:08:15,503
你还好吗
You alright?

1632
02:08:15,598 --> 02:08:17,653
看看吧
Look at you,

1633
02:08:18,791 --> 02:08:20,440
你只是个魅影
you're just a shade.

1634
02:08:20,517 --> 02:08:23,653
你只是我妻子的魅影
You're just the shade of my real wife.

1635
02:08:23,913 --> 02:08:27,069
我已经竭尽全力来想象了  但...
You're the best that I could do, but...

1636
02:08:27,249 --> 02:08:30,222
很遗憾  你远远比不上真实的她
I'm sorry, you are just not good enough.

1637
02:08:30,371 --> 02:08:32,518
这样感觉够真实了吧
Doesn't this feel real?

1638
02:08:33,917 --> 02:08:37,557
-你干什么  -随机应变
- What're you doing? - Improvise.

1639
02:08:45,084 --> 02:08:46,836
不  不  等等
No, no! No!

1640
02:08:48,042 --> 02:08:50,257
现在进去  快点  快去
Get in there, now. Go! Go, go, go!

1641
02:09:30,738 --> 02:09:32,005
罗伯特
Robert?

1642
02:09:35,260 --> 02:09:37,912
失...失...
Dis... disap...

1643
02:09:38,683 --> 02:09:43,048
-我很失...失...  -我明白  爸爸
- I was disa... disa... - I know, dad.

1644
02:09:50,407 --> 02:09:55,095
我明白你对我很失望  因为我成不了你
I know you were disappointed, I couldn't be you.

1645
02:09:55,222 --> 02:09:58,906
不  不  不
No, no, no.

1646
02:09:59,731 --> 02:10:01,181
我很失望...
I was disappointed...

1647
02:10:03,107 --> 02:10:04,762
因为你想成为另一个我
That you tried.

1648
02:10:28,505 --> 02:10:29,665
什么
What?

1649
02:10:47,925 --> 02:10:48,727
开启

1650
02:10:50,411 --> 02:10:51,068
遗嘱

1651
02:11:50,546 --> 02:11:54,225
该坠落了  艾莲涅  你快走
That's the kick, Ariadne! You have to go now!

1652
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:10,517
别迷失了自己  找到斋藤  把他带回来
Don't lose yourself! Find Saito and bring him back!

1653
02:12:10,522 --> 02:12:11,938
我会的
I will!

1654
02:12:51,355 --> 02:12:55,246
记得你向我求婚那时吗
Do you remember when you asked me to marry you?

1655
02:12:55,258 --> 02:12:56,156
记得
Yes.

1656
02:12:56,191 --> 02:13:00,142
你说你梦到我们白头偕老
You said you dreamt that we grow old together.

1657
02:13:01,824 --> 02:13:03,995
我们做到了
But we did.

1658
02:13:05,235 --> 02:13:08,044
我们的确白头偕老了  不记得了吗
We did, you don't remember?

1659
02:13:12,206 --> 02:13:15,649
我想你想到无法呼吸  但是...
I miss you more than I can bear, but...

1660
02:13:17,367 --> 02:13:20,788
我们厮守了一生
we had our time together.

1661
02:13:20,964 --> 02:13:23,938
现在我必须放手了
I have to let you go.

1662
02:13:24,918 --> 02:13:27,743
放手让你安息
I have to let you go.

1663
02:14:18,332 --> 02:14:20,152
我很抱歉  罗伯特
I'm sorry, Robert.

1664
02:14:46,999 --> 02:14:50,856
爸爸是想通过遗嘱告诉我  要我走自己的路
You know, the will means that dad wanted me to be my own man.

1665
02:14:51,717 --> 02:14:54,101
不要仅仅是为他而活
Not just to live for him.

1666
02:14:55,467 --> 02:14:58,167
我决定就这么做  彼得叔叔
That's what I'm gonna do, uncle Peter.

1667
02:15:07,586 --> 02:15:10,511
-怎么回事  -柯布留在了那
- What happened? - Cobb stayed.

1668
02:15:10,527 --> 02:15:13,188
-和茉儿一起吗  -不  为了找到斋藤
- With Mal? - No, to find Saito.

1669
02:15:15,197 --> 02:15:17,150
他会迷失的
He'll be lost.

1670
02:15:19,232 --> 02:15:21,062
不  他会回来
No, he'll be alright.

1671
02:15:36,862 --> 02:15:39,862
你是来杀我的吗
Have you come to kill me?

1672
02:15:43,087 --> 02:15:45,856
我一直在等一个人
I'm waiting for someone,

1673
02:15:49,909 --> 02:15:53,708
他来自一个梦  而那个梦你已经记不清了
someone from a half remembered dream.

1674
02:15:55,594 --> 02:15:57,234
柯布
Cobb?

1675
02:15:58,930 --> 02:16:00,748
不可能
Impossible.

1676
02:16:01,235 --> 02:16:03,881
我们的年龄差不多
We were young men together.

1677
02:16:05,535 --> 02:16:07,769
而现在我已垂垂老矣
I'm an old man.

1678
02:16:08,911 --> 02:16:11,434
心中充满悔恨
Filled with regret.

1679
02:16:14,334 --> 02:16:17,594
孤零零地等死
Waiting to die alone, huh?

1680
02:16:20,255 --> 02:16:22,451
我回来找你
I've come back for you,

1681
02:16:25,467 --> 02:16:27,782
是为了提醒你...
to remind you...

1682
02:16:27,955 --> 02:16:29,926
一些事...
of something...

1683
02:16:32,756 --> 02:16:35,421
一些你曾知晓的事
something you once knew.

1684
02:16:37,919 --> 02:16:40,927
这个世界不是真的
That this world is not real.

1685
02:16:45,033 --> 02:16:50,155
来说服我履行我们之间的协议
To convince me to honor our arrangement.

1686
02:16:50,518 --> 02:16:54,220
没错  让你心怀幻想
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1687
02:16:59,386 --> 02:17:01,077
回去吧
Come back,

1688
02:17:03,125 --> 02:17:07,099
这样我们又能重回年轻
so we can be young men together again.

1689
02:17:10,445 --> 02:17:12,687
跟我回去吧
Come back with me.

1690
02:17:15,416 --> 02:17:17,021
回去吧
Come back.

1691
02:17:26,676 --> 02:17:28,055
先生  需要热毛巾吗
Hot towel, sir?

1692
02:17:28,997 --> 02:17:32,028
我们将在二十分钟内抵达洛杉矶
We will be landing in Los Angeles in about twenty minutes.

1693
02:17:32,061 --> 02:17:34,050
您需要入境申请表吗
Do you need immigration forms?

1694
02:17:36,477 --> 02:17:37,850
谢谢
Thank you.

1695
02:17:38,330 --> 02:17:41,422
-先生  需要热毛巾吗  -不了
- Hot towel, sir? - Oh, no.

1696
02:17:41,455 --> 02:17:43,271
您需要入境申请表吗
Do you need immigration forms?

1697
02:18:55,384 --> 02:18:56,910
欢迎回家  柯布先生
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.

1698
02:18:57,509 --> 02:18:58,781
谢谢  先生
Thank you, sir.

1699
02:19:43,032 --> 02:19:44,291
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

1700
02:19:44,664 --> 02:19:46,219
这边
This way.

1701
02:20:07,701 --> 02:20:10,961
詹姆斯  菲丽帕
James? Philippa?

1702
02:20:14,647 --> 02:20:16,278
瞧瞧谁回来了
Look who's here.

1703
02:20:23,786 --> 02:20:27,252
-爸爸  爸爸  -孩子们  你们还好吗
- Daddy! Daddy! - Hey, kids! How are you?

1704
02:20:29,935 --> 02:20:32,970
-看我搭了什么  -你们玩什么呢
- Look what I built? - What're you doing there?

1705
02:20:33,039 --> 02:20:37,083
-我搭了一所悬崖上的小屋  -用石头搭的吗
- I built a house on the cliff. - Out of rocks?
