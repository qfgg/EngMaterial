道上的人都知道是要先付三分之二 事成之後再付三分之一
But the street knows it's two-thirds upfront, one-third when the deal is done.

493
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,940
l子F在以槭窍阮A付一半 事成後再付另一半
But cops... they still think it's half and half.

You are one hell of a businessman.

515
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,340
我意向如此
I tries.

516
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:37,770
