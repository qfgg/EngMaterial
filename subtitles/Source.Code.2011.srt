我觉得  自己要想过得好
You know, I think it's gonna be really

137
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,110
就得尽可能远离他
good for me to get as far away from him as possible.

They wouldn't put the doer in front of me.

142
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,770
行动干系人
The doer?

143
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,420
你很漂亮  你就是那个分心点
You are the pretty girl. The distraction.

-你在赶什么  -什么

You seem concerned about the time. What are you late for?

150
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,020
我要赶一个操蛋庆典  你多管什么闲事
I'm late to an asshole festival... I hear you're headlining.

爆炸是在我后面来的
The explosion came from behind me.

169
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,710
-你是怎么回事  -我现在没空和你聊天

Goodwin, you gonna tell me how to disarm this?

174
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:43,500
我该...拆了它  还是该忽略它
Should I... unplug it? Or do you want me to just leave it?

175
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,790
那我不管了
I am just gonna leave it.

176
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,710
可以吗
Ok?

手提  手机统统关闭  请关掉手机  先生

Pagers, anything electronic. Thank you.

185
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,170
这只是防范措施  无须担心
It's a precautionary measure, it's nothing to worry about.

186
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,550
到底是什么  有安全侵害还是防患于未然
So which is it, security breach or precautionary measure?

187
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,980
先生  关掉
Sir!

188
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,790
先生  你没听明白吗
Is there a problem here, Sir?

189
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,740
这个重要的谈判才到一半
I am in the middle of a very big deal...

190
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,430
肖恩
Shawn?

191
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,440
把那个关掉
I need you to turn that off.

192
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,860
把你的证件再给我瞅眼
Why you don't show me that ID again?

00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,480
肖恩

你有毛病啊  混蛋
What's your problem, asshole?

196
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,230
肖恩  你搞什么鬼
Shawn, what are you doing?

197
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,720
女士  那么做可不妥
Hey, not a good idea m'am.

198
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,230
最好别  最好别打电话哦
Not a good idea. Oh, that's not a good idea.

199
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,580
你把他下巴打断了
I think you broke his jaw.

200
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,290
无妨  他跟你一样  全是幻象
It's ok, he is not any more real than you are.

201
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,840
幻象  你下次自己开车上班去啊
I am not real? How about next time you drive to work!

202
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,370
没有下次了
There's not gonna be a next time.

203
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,860
稳住
Stabilize.

204
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,140
放慢心跳
Lower your pulse.

205
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,830
-你找到炸弹了吗  -是的
- Did you find the bomb? - Yes...

206
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,430
地上都是液压油
There is hydraulic fluid all over the floor.

207
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,530
无须担心  上尉
It's not a concern, Captain.

208
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,550
-这是  -跟我说说炸弹
- What is... -Tell me about the bomb.

209
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,720
他是谁  在监控里拄根拐杖的男人
Where is that man? I saw a guy with a crutch on the monitor.

210
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,180
貌似他才是老大
He looks like he is in charge,

211
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,170
-我要和他谈谈  -那不可能  上尉
- I wanna talk to him. - That's irrelevant, Captain.

212
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,240
我要跟你的指挥官谈谈
I wanna talk to your commanding officer!

213
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,530
你可以在完成任务之后与他交谈
You can talk to him upon completion of your mission.

214
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,230
我的分队在阿富汗  我在那执行任务
My mission is in Afghanistan, where my unit is.

215
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,760
我他妈昨天飞了两次
I flew two god damn sorties yesterday.

216
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,720
你这两个月都跟我们在一起
You've been with us for 2 months.

217
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:28,060
-找到设弹人了吗  -没  我的分队在哪里
- Did you id the bomber? - No, where is my unit?

218
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,160
这个模拟实验是谁负责的
And under whose jurisdiction is this simulation?

219
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,210
上尉  这不是模拟实验
Captain, this is not a simulation.

220
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,960
你肩负了无数人的性命
Lives are depending on you.

221
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,840
什么性命
What lives?

222
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,410
关于炸弹  你还记得什么  描述一下引爆器
What do you remember about the bomb? Tell me about the detonator.

223
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,860
等下  什么性命  你在说什么
No, no, no, what lives? What you are talking about?

224
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,980
你得跟我说清楚
I need to be briefed!

225
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,490
-长官  得告诉他点内情  -没事  说吧
- Sir, I need to give him something. - That's fine, go ahead.

226
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,040
准备把他送回去
Get ready to send him back in.

227
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:14,100
今早  中央标准时间七点四十八分
48 this morning CST, a bomb exploded on a

228
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,780
在芝加哥一辆市郊往返列车上
commuter train outside of Chicago,

229
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,380
一枚炸弹爆炸  无人生还
killing everyone on board.

230
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,960
也就是你所在的那辆列车
And that's the train that you've been on.

231
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,270
不可能  我不在这吗  你正在跟我说话
No, no, no, I am right here, you are talking to me right now!

232
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,290
一名叫肖恩・芬特雷斯的男人在那趟列车上
A man named Shawn Fentress was on that train.

233
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,830
总而言之  他现在就是你了
He, for all intents and purposes, is now you.

234
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,180
每多花一秒钟解释
Every second spent explaining

235
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,690
就会有更多无辜人的性命陷入危险
things puts more innocent civilians at risk.

236
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,490
胡说八道
This makes no sense.

237
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,410
火车爆炸只是一系列袭击的第一波
The train explosion was the first attack of a series.

238
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,850
接下来会有更多
There are going to be more.

239
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,470
你找到炸弹了吗
Now, did you find the bomb?

240
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:52,500
在厕所里  水槽上方的通风板那
In the restroom, ventilation panel above the sink.

241
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,840
引爆器是手机  行了吗
Cell phone detonator. Are we done?

242
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,750
还没  不过你干得很不错  上尉  做得好
Eh, no no. But that's good, that's very very good, Captain. Good.

243
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,250
数据显示  爆炸时刻
Our record show that 1812

244
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,450
共有1812通电话完成通话
calls ended at the moment of the explosion.

245
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,880
有五十二通电话
52 of those calls

246
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,080
经由离火车最近的信号塔转接
were tethered to the cell tower nearest the train.

247
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,430
其中就有设弹人打的电话
So one of those calls was made by our bomber.

248
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,230
你记不记得爆炸时
Do you remember a freight

249
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,380
正好有辆货运列车经过
train passing by just before the explosion?

250
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,290
记得
Yes.

251
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,760
在爆炸发生的时刻  货车刚好经过  
The explosion was timed to engulf the passing freight train

252
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,580
这表明
which means,

253
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,920
设弹人是在可见两车的情况下打的电话
the bomber had to be watching both trains when the call was made.

254
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,870
五十二个人  其中一个是设弹人
52 callers, one of those is our bomber.

255
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,560
我要你留意同车厢的乘客
I want you to concentrate on the passengers in your car.

256
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,630
了解他们  缩小嫌疑人范围
Get to know them, narrow the suspect pool.

257
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,030
留意那些不动声响或孤僻的家伙
Look for ones who seem quiet or withdrawn,

258
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,420
和面露不安的人
who seem nervous.

259
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,120
同样  你只有八分钟
As always, you'll have 8 minutes.

260
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,550
八分钟  然后我又被炸飞
8 minutes, and I blow up again?

261
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,410
是的
Yes.

262
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,220
我要你这次严于律己
I need you to discipline yourself on this next pass.

263
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,650
执行我们指定你做的任务  
Perform only the task that we assign you.

264
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,290
其它的都无关紧要
Everything else is irrelevant.

265
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,140
驱动通电
Charge the drivers.

266
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,050
我爸爸...
Is my father even...

267
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:20,390
我采纳了你的意见  很不错
I took your advice... It was very good advice.

268
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:26,180
-你今天挺沉默的啊  -烦心事比较多  小心
- You're kinda quiet today. - Just got a lot on my mind. Careful.

269
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,770
-对不起啊  -没事
- Oh, so sorry - Don't worry about it.

270
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,810
你真善良
That's very kind of you.

271
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,380
知书达理
You're very decent.

272
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,340
多谢夸奖
Thank you.

273
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,960
-也很真实  -您的车票
- And real. - Ticket.

274
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,650
-今天还好吗  -不错
- How's everything today? - It's good.

275
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,720
-有没有什么异常 -没有
- Anything out of the ordinary? - Uhmm no.

276
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,070
我是指  车上人的行为
I mean behavior on the train.

277
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,190
有没有...在你看来很诡异的人
Is anything... Anybody seems strange to you?

278
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,870
你就很诡异
You look strange.

279
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,220
你呢  有没有觉得谁比较可疑
How about you, does anybody looks suspicious?

280
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:22,000
-你是喝醉了还是怎么  -过来  就一会
- Are you drunk or something? - Come here. For a second.

281
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,430
来吧
Come on.

282
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,720
-把它当成一个游戏  -游戏
- Just think of it as a game. - A game?

283
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,380
他们再正常不过了
They are all so utterly normal,

284
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,750
肖恩  这也是他们的可怕之处
Shawn. That's what so terrifying about them.

285
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,640
也许他们暗中是一伙的
Maybe there's a team network.

286
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,120
睡觉的胖子和牧师还有那几人有勾搭
The sleeping giant coached with the minister and them out there.

287
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,530
别忽略掉这个忧郁的大学生  他可是牺牲品
Don't forget the sullen college kid, he is the expendable one.

288
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:00,030
我打赌  所有人都听命于售票员
I bet they are all controlled by the conductor.

289
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:06,040
他就站在那里专横地查看车票
Standing there dictatorial demanding tickets.

290
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,800
-你太搞了  -该死的
- You are funny. - Damn it.

291
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,610
-那他呢  -失业中
- What about that guy? - Deposition.

292
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,100
他对面的那女人呢
About that woman sitting across from him?

293
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,460
每周一  她都会去做头发  你不知道吗
Hair appointment, every Monday, you know this.

294
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,980
你跟他们比我跟他们聊的多啊
You talk to this people more than I do.

295
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,900
没错  她后面那男的呢
Right, right. And the guy behind her?

296
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,820
他试镜要迟到了  对吧
He's late for an audition, right?

297
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,980
他可有犯罪记录  被送进过...
To record offenses... That's the guy that was sided...

298
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,030
酒后驾车  我懂  信号咋样
A DUI, I know. Hey, how's the signal in here?

299
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,420
不错
It's good.

300
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,540
平时教书还不够刺激吗  大侦探
Is teaching not stimulating enough for you anymore, Sherlock?

301
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,640
看来我们又遇到种族问题了
Oh oh, now we slip to the racial profiling, that is.

302
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,550
还有别人从厕所出来过吗
Did anyone else come out of the bathroom over there?

303
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,630
-我看到你从里面出来  -我
- Well, I saw you coming out of there. - Me?

304
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,940
-没错 -不可能
- Yes. - No.

305
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,470
真的是我
Me?

306
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,860
等下先生
Hey Mr..

307

Hold on, hold on a second. Just hold on a second.

308
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,950
这附近肯定有什么东西
It's gotta be something near.

309
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,870
一个破手机
A broken phone.

310
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,680
和克莉丝汀娜喝咖啡

311
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,060
-克莉丝汀娜  -怎么了
- Christina? - Yeah?

312
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,430
等下
Excuse me.

313
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,010
-跟我一起下车  -我们还没到站呢
- Hey, hey come with me. - This isn't our stop!

314
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,860
-来吧  去走走  -我们不在这站下
- Now come on, let's take a walk. - We don't get off here.

315
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,240
-我一时性起  -你把我吓到了
- I don't know, just be spontaneous. - You gonna freaking me up...

316
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,350
虽然听起来很怪  但我总觉得
I know this gonna sound really weird but I have a

317
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,690
这趟车会发生什么不幸  
really bad feeling about this train

318
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,810
我们该下车  好吗
and I think that we should get off, ok?

319
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,070
把你的东西带上
Just get your stuff.

320
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,470
车门即将关闭  请全员上车
All aboard. Doors are closing.

321
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,050
快点  跟我来
Come on, come with me.

322
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,930
-现在呢  -等下  我马上回来
- So what now? - Wait, one... I'll be right back!

323
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,070
现在可以去喝咖啡了吗
Ready to get that coffee now?

324
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:43,740
对不起  再等一会  就一会好吗
Oh sorry, yeah, ah... Jus... just one more second, ok?

325
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,980
有完没完
Oh for God's sake.

326
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,510
不舒服吗
Feel sick?

327
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,920
晕动病  一直都有
It's motion sickness, I get it all the time.

328
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,380
坐过去点 过去点
Excuse me... Excuse me.

329
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,190
-你在跟踪我吗  -能用下你的手机吗
- Are you following me? - Can I borrow your phone?

330
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,480
不行  我没有手机
No, I don't have one.

331
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,830
-你肯定  -当然
- Sure? - Yeah, I am sure.

332
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,470
你能不能离我远点  我要报警了
Why you don't leave me alone please? Or I call the police.

333
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,470
用什么打  你说你没有手机
With what? I thought you said you didn't have a phone.

334
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,150
要知道  你没权利...
You know, you have no right...

335
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,910
你干什么  把包还我
What are you doing? Give me my bag back.

336
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,630
你疯了啊
Are you crazy?

337
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:47,840
他们是谁
Who are they?

338
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,440
-肖恩  -别过来
- Shawn! - Get back!

339
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,700
肖恩  怎么回事
Shawn, what's going on?

340
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,360
肖恩
Shawn!

341
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,660
快停下  肖恩
Stop, Shawn!

342
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:11,720
-不是你  -你到底有什么毛病啊
- It wasn't you. - What the hell is wrong with you?

343
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,020
-你疯了吗  -不  不  不
- Are you insane? - No! No, no!

344
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,970
-它在哪里  -松开我
- Where is it? - Get away from me!

345
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,910
-它到底在哪里  -离我远点
- Where is it? - Get away from me, please!

346
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,240
肖恩  肖恩  快起来  肖恩
Shawn, Shawn, get up! Shawn!

347
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,420
肖恩  听我说  快起来
Shawn, listen to me, get up!

348
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,940
-肖恩  -把手给我  从铁轨那上来
- Shawn. - Give me your hand, get off the track...

349
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:35,460
-先生  快点  -肖恩  肖恩  肖恩  快起来
- Mr. C'mon. - Shawn, Shawn, Shawn, get up...

350
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,610
考尔特
Colter.

351
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,820
戈德温  快回答  听到我说话了吗
Goodwin? Come in, do you read me?

352
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,730
斯蒂文斯上尉  这是围城
Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle,

353
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,670
收了吗  请回答
do you copy? Please respond.

354
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,830
这在结冰  怎么回事
It's freezing here, what's going on.

355
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,120
什么情况
What's that?

356
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,110
他有麻烦了
He is in trouble.

357
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,770
舱内停止供氧了
I think the oxygen just went out.

358
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,490
戈德温
Goodwin?

359
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,540
戈德温
Goodwin!

360
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,990
想办法联系上他
Find a way to get through to him.

361
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:13,850
怎么了  发生了什么事
What is it? What's going on?

362
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,950
三层制冷系统也没出现异常
It's not the tertiary cooling either.

363
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,070
继续联系他  看他能不能收到信息
Just keep sending strings out, see if he hooks on to something.

364
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,880
我不清楚里面是个什么情况
It's hard to say exactly what he's going through.

365
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,230
-长官  -拜托
- Sir? - Please.

366
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,020
我们现在也无能为力
It's not a whole lot we can do from here.

367
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,950
要是情况没好转  他还能坚持多久
If nothing changes, how much time does he have?

368
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,230
一会吧
Some...

369
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,670
坚持不了多久
and not long.

370
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,930
莉莉醒来时穿着晚礼服  披着夜礼服斗蓬
Lilly awoke in an evening dress and an opera cloak,

371
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,450
她手上有五张牌  
in her hand were 5 playing cards.

372
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,300
分别是红桃Q  梅花4
They were the queen of space, 4 of club.

373
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,810
戈德温  你听得见吗
Goodwin, you out there?

374
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,050
戈德温  谁是戈德温
Goodwin, who is Goodwin.

375
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,020
我是斯蒂文斯上尉  听得见吗
This is Captain Stevens, do you copy?

376
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,040
斯蒂文斯上尉
Captain Stevens?

377
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,520
机舱内停电了
The capsule lost power.

378
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,410
机舱吗  上尉  你在机舱里吗
The capsule? Is that where you are now, Captain, in a capsule?

379
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,690
你难道不知道吗  你是谁
You should know, who are you?

380
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,700
我去叫戈德温上尉  去叫她
Let me get Captain Goodwin, get to it!

381
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,320
是你发明了这玩意儿吧
You invented this thing, right?

382
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,420
-是的  -你是这的主管吗
-I did. - Are you in command here?

383
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:55,240
是的  你找到设弹人了吗  上尉
I am. Were you able to locate the information we need, Captain?

384
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,280
没能找到 长官
That's a negative Sir. I was unable to find the bomber,

385
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,180
但我救了她  一个火车上的乘客
but I did save her. A passenger on the train.

386
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,920
我让她安全下了车  一个女人
I got her off safely, a woman.

387
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,310
上尉  如果你试图拯救车上的任何一人
Captain, it's gonna be counterproductive for you

388
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,130
系统都将对你产生反作用
to try to save anyone on that train.

389
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,490
他们在你的任务范畴之外
They're outside the mission.

390
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:12,280
但她逃过了这场爆炸  或许其他人也可以
Well, but she survived. And maybe the rest could too.

391
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,620
她仅仅是在源代码中获救
She survived, but only inside the Source Code.

392
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,700
他们所有人都难逃一死
None of them will be safe.

393
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,200
什么是源代码
What is this Source Code?

394
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,520
这是量子力学寓式微积分
It's quantum mechanics parable calculus.

395
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,350
非常复杂
It's very complicated.

396
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,620
试着跟我解释一下
Try me!

397
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,120
好吧
Fine.

398
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,590
当你关闭电灯  灯泡仍然有余辉
When a light bulb's turned off, there is an afterglow,

399
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,640
这叫延迟光圈效应  你见过吧
a lingering halo-like effect. You seen it?

400
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,730
-是的  -很好
- Yes. - Of course.

401
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,460
我们的大脑也一样
The brain is like that, its electromagnetic

402
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,730
人死后大脑的电磁场仍然处于通电状态
field remains charged, just briefly even after death.

403
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,510
电路依然通畅
Circuits remain open.

404
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,820
大脑还有一个特性
Now there is another peculiarity about the brain.

405
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,850
它存有一个短期记忆轨迹  
It contains a short-term memory track

406
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,640
时长约8分钟
that's approximately 8 minutes long

407
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,160
就像便利店的安全摄像机一样
like a convenience store's security camera that

408
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,340
只能在硬盘上记录
only records the last portion of the day's activity

409
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,850
每一天的最后部分
on its hard drive.

410
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,350
把这两种现象结合起来
Now combining these two phenomena,

411
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:01,030
人死后脑电图保持接通  
circuitry that remains viable postmortem and a memory bank

412
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,480
记忆库前调8分钟
that goes back 8 minutes

413
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,070
源代码就能帮助我们利用那重叠部分
Source Code enables us to capitalize on the overlap.

414
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,410
肖恩・芬特雷斯死在了那列火车上
Shawn Fentress died on that train,

415
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,860
在所有乘客中  他是你最好的纽带
of all the passengers aboard he was your best link.

416
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:15,190
你们在性格  体型  和突触图谱上
You two share the compatibility in terms of gender,

417
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,740
都十分匹配
body size and your synaptic maps.

418
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,750
-那8分钟后会怎么样  -之后  什么都没了
- What happens after the 8 minutes? - After? Nothing.

419
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,880
你将不存在于列车上
You cease to exist on the train.

420
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,770
在源代码中
You cannot exist inside the Source Code,

421
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,230
你无法存在于芬特雷斯记忆的8分钟外
beyond Fentress' 8 minutes.

422
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,540
源代码不是时间穿梭
Source Code is not time travel.

423
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,400
而是对时间的再赋值
Rather, Source Code is time reassignment.

424
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,710
它能让我们进入与现实平行的世界
It gives us access to a parallel reality.

425
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,450
车上人的遇难是个悲剧
Now the deaths on the train were a tragedy

426
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:47,940
-但是源代码使我们...  -不对  我确实救了...
- but Source Code empowers us... - No, but I saved...

427
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,550
一个人  那个坐在我对面的女人
one person, that girl, that's always

428
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:53,270
我让她下了车
sitting across from me. I pulled her off the train.

429
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,750
告诉我她的名字
Give me her name.

430
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,270
克莉丝汀娜  我记不得她姓什么了
Christina, I don't remember her last name.

431
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,270
-她叫克莉丝汀娜・沃伦   -没错
- Her name was Christina Warren. - Yes!

432
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,190
-今年28岁  -就是她
- She was 28. - That's her

433
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:16,270
生于伊利诺斯州莫林市  死于今早的火车爆炸
born in Moline, Illinois. Died this morning on the train.

434
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,890
不对  我让她下了车  她没死
No, no, I pulled her off. She's fine.

435
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,620
-不  她死了  -相信我  她没死
- No, she isn't. - Believe me, she is.

436
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,130
-相信我  -她看见我被一列快车压死了
- Believe me. - She saw me get hit by the express train.

437
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,500
-事情没有任何进展  -不  等等
- This isn't us getting anywhere. - No, no, no, wait,

438
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,930
-等等  -必须把他送回去
- Wait. - We have to send him in.

439
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,150
第二轮爆炸迫在眼前  拉特里奇博士
A second attack is imminent, Dr. Rutledge.

440
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,440
-什么二轮爆炸  -列车的爆炸只是一个开始
- What second attack? - The train was just the beginning.

441
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,880
一系列爆炸的开始
A letter of intent.

442
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,930
抱歉  我听不懂你们在说什么
I am sorry, what are you telling me here?

443
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,090
我们得到消息
We have information that

444
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,120
芝加哥市中心是下一个目标
Downtown Chicago is the next target.

445
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,270
他们准备在市中心引爆放射性炸弹
And they're planning to detonate a dirty bomb.

446
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,950
你知道如此程度的爆炸
You have any idea how many people would die

447
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,510
会使多少人丧命吗
if an explosion of that magnitude were to occur in the city?

448
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,290
说话这会儿  我们已经在疏散人群
We're evacuating as we speak.

449
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,720
我们得在炸弹爆炸之前阻止它  懂吗
We've to stop it before it happens, do you understand?

450
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,530
如果你找到了设弹人  他的第二次爆炸
If you find the bomber, his second attack,

451
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:02,060
他的真正意图  就能被阻止
the real attack, we think, can be prevented.

452
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,790
我们没时间了
We have very little time left.

453
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,820
爆炸一旦发生就无法挽回了
Out here the clocks only move in one direction.

454
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,230
驱动通电
Charge the drivers.

455
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,700
旁边车厢的二楼
On the upper deck of the next carriage

456
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,190
有一个乘务员室
there is aconductor's compartment.

457
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,570
里面有一个保险箱
It's a small office containing a strongbox.

458
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:16,610
箱内有一把上膛的手枪  找到它
Inside is a loaded handgun. Get to it.

459
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,850
必要时你可以使用任何武力
You are authorized to use whatever force necessary.

460
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,420
我采纳了你的建议
I took your advice.

461
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,580
很不错的建议
It was very good advice.

462
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:37,020
-你还在这儿  -当然
- You're still here. - Of course I am.

463
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,950
你猜怎么着
Guess what?

464
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,430
你辞了职  报上了NALSAR的课程
You've quit your job and you enrolled in a NALSAR course.

465
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,100
猜得真准
Good guess.

466
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,240
苏打水罐  咖啡洒了
Soda can. Coffee spill.

467
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,380
听着  别接这电话
Listen to me... Don't answer this.

468
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,550
他配不上你
You deserve better than that guy.

469
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:56,480
把一切留给回忆不是更好吗
Everything looks more beautiful in retrospect, doesn't it?

470
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,630
你怎么知道...
How did you know there was...

471
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,360
-你对我有多了解  -显然不是很了解
- How well do you know me? - Not that well apparently.

472
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,870
那我们有没有熟到
Do you know me well enough, that if I did something

473
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,310
如果我做了些不合常理
that looked a little strange and was maybe

474
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,360
甚至有点危险的事情
even a little bit dangerous

475
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,180
然后叫你无论如何都要相信我  你会信吗
and told you to trust me anyway, that you could do that?

476
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,500
不会
No.

477
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,700
真是大实话
Wow, that was honest.

478
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,360
你漂亮  善良
You are beautiful, you're kind,

479
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,820
也有着令人神伤的坦率
and you are painfully honest.

480
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,290
你是谁
Who are you and what did

481
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,650
你对肖恩・芬特雷斯做了什么
you do with Shawn Fentress?

482
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,100
这是全新的我
It's the new me.

483
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,730
您的车票
Ticket?

484
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:43,840
我不想伤害你
I don't want to hurt you.

485
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,810
我不会坐回去
No I am not gonna sit in my seat, alright?

486
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,840
他在流血  需要救治
He is bleeding, he needs medical attention.

487
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,810
你想从火车保险箱里面偷枪
Is it true that you tried

488
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,930
这是真的吗
to steal a gun out of the train security box?

489
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,330
小心点  女士
Careful ma'm!

490
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,800
-该死  -你疯了吗
- Damm it! - What were you thinking?

491
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,100
-我能借用下你手机吗  -不行
- Can I borrow your phone? - No!

492
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,420
-肖恩  你需要去医院  -求你了
- You need to go to the hospital, Shawn. - Please!

493
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,550
-求你了  -不行  你需要救治
- Please. - No, you need help.

494
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,220
-我能借用下你手机吗  -不行
- Can I borrow your phone? - No!

495
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,700
你借我手机做什么
Why do you want my phone?

496
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,360
要是你只有一分钟可以活了
What would you do if you only

497
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,450
-你会怎么做  -我不知道
- had one minute left to live? - I don't know.

498
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,110
我会打电话给我爸
I would call my dad.

499
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,310
仔细聆听他的声音
I would hear his voice

500
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:32,640
然后跟他道歉
and I'd tell him I am sorry.

501
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,530
告诉我一切都会没事的
Tell me everything is gonna be ok.

502
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,280
一切都会好起来的
Everything is gonna be ok.

503
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,580
是的  枪在保险箱内
Oh yeah, the gun in the strongbox,

504
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,200
真是个好主意  多谢你了
that was a really great idea. Thanks for that.

505
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:07,230
-有进展吗  -我能用下电话吗
- Did you make any progress? - Can I get access to a phone?

506
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,080
我要和我父亲通电话
I need to talk to my father.

507
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,960
我待会试下  不骗你
I will try to work on that soon. Yes, I will try.

508
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:20,830
戈德温  我表现得怎样
Goodwin, how I am doing?

509
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,170
我只是知道自己在这的表现如何
I am just trying to measure my performance here.

510
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,290
你有没有回去过  我比你表现得好吗
Have you ever gotten back in? Am I doing any better than you did?

511
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,530
我们这是在浪费宝贵的时间
No, we're wasting valuable time here.

512
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:43,250
没有  我只参与过源代码的指挥工作
No, no, I have never been on the other side

513
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,080
我不适合这项任务
of a Source Code mission. I wouldn't be a viable candidate.

514
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,150
为什么  CAOC-N  那是什么
Why not? CAOC-N, what is that?

515
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,600
因为适用范围很窄
Because the specifications are extremely narrow.

516
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,460
什么适用范围
What are they?

517
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,810
上尉  你现在本该已经找到设弹人了
Captain, you should have found the suspect by now.

518
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:01,800
我们赐予了你如此强大的战略性武器
This tactical advantage, this tremendous tool that we've given you.

519
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,740
别胡思乱想  暴殄天物
Don't squander it thinking.

520
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,150
拿出实际行动来
Do.

521
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,000
请帮我联系我父亲
Please contact my father for me.

522
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,080
船到桥头自然直  上尉
This will stop at some point, Captain.

523
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,400
只要你完成了任务
As soon as you finish the mission.

524
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,030
你表现得真的很好  你能做到的
And you're doing really great. This will end.

525
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,240
安置炸弹的人都需要特定的工具
Whoever planted the bomb had to have equipment of some kind.

526
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:28,540
像手套  开头顶通风口的螺丝刀  
Gloves, a screwdriver to get into the over the head vent,

527
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,820
手电之类的
flashlight, something.

528
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:33,500
检查下乘客的提袋  背包  公文包等等
Check bags, backpacks, briefcases, anything.

529
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,720
于是...我采纳了你的建议
So... I took your advice.

530
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,620
-很不错的建议  -老头
- It was very good advice. - Hey Grandpa!

531
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,310
-你在干什么  -我只是...
- What are you doing? - I am just...

532
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,000
在回想些事情
trying to remember something.

533
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:03,010
-那是什么  -军队的臂章
- What is that? - It's a Military patch.

534
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,750
你参过军吗
Were you in the Military?

我死了吗

627
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,150
一个广播节目说一架直升机在乡村坠毁

我父亲替我接受了勋章

630
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:07,180
你的情况与此任务无关
Your condition is not the issue here

631
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:09,700
你应该尽力阻止接下来的爆炸
You need to focus on preventing any subsequent attacks.

632
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,650
其他的都无关紧要
Everything else is irrelevant.

633
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:14,610
新闻说我死了  这无关紧要吗
News report saying that I am dead is irrelevant?

634
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:16,460
在火车设弹人
Until the person or persons

635

将心比心  我是死了吗
One soldier to another. Am I dead?

638
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:40,830
你大脑的一部分仍在运作
Part of your brain remains activated.

639
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,230
那我身体的其它部分呢
What about the rest of me?

640
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:46,350
我的手脚仍然可以动
I can see my hands and my feet. They still move.

641
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,420
它们只是表象
They're a manifestation.

642
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,310
是你的主观想象
They're just your way of making sense of all this.

643
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:55,070
你是说  这一切都是我的想象吗
So..What are you saying? Are you saying that I am imagining this?

644
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:00,290
我想象...自己仍然
I'm imagining that ...I am still alive,

645
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:01,720
活在这机舱里吗
that I am in this capsule?

646
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:07,480
第四安培数下降
We have fourth amp dropping.

647
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,930
上尉  里面怎么了
Captain, what just happened?

648
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:47,760
能问你个问题吗
Can I ask you a question?

649
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,290
这个机舱也只是个表象
The capsule is a manifestation as well.

650
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:57,560
-我在哪儿  -这是机密
- Where am I? - That's classified.

651
00:49:58,310 --> 00:49:59,490
操你妈的
Fuck you!

652
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:07,600
上尉  我不能体会你现在的心情
Captain, I can not imagine what you must be feeling right now,

653
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,420
但我们必须马上
but if are to prevent a second attack,

654
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,040
送你回去阻止第二场爆炸
we need to send you back immediately.

655
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:15,140
上尉  你在源代码中时
And Captain, you cannot deviate from the mission

656
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,950
不能分心想任务以外的事情  甚至...
while inside the Source Code. Even to investigate your...

657
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:21,040
不能去深究自己发生了什么事
Even to investigate what happened to you.

658
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,990
这个终端的程序一致连续  由不得你乱搅和
There is only one continuum on this end and it can't be unsettled.

659
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:29,090
我刚还真就搅和了  我从车上给你打电话了
Well, you know, I did unsettle it. I called you from the train.

660
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:31,460
就在爆炸之前
Just before the explosion,

661
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:34,250
今早7点46分  他们呼叫了你...
so 7:46 this morning they paged you with a call...

662
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:36,430
你可能在火车上给我打了电话
You may have made that call from the train,

663
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:38,350
但我在这收不到
but I would never receive it here.

664
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:40,400
这是不同的世界  上尉
It's a different reality, Captain.

665
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,490
就算电话接通了
If the call even went through it would be

666
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:45,450
接电话的也是一个完全不同的我
received by a different me entirely.

667
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,840
这你听起来可能很费解
This may be difficult for you to hear,

668
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,080
但你就是时钟上的指针
but you are a hand on a clock, understand?

669
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,140
我们给你上了发条  你就开始转动
We set you, you move forward.

670
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,730
再上一次发条  你又开始转动
We reset you, you move again.

671
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:57,920
你的作用就体现在此
And that represents the entirety of your function here.

672
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,990
下次我要给你寄个披萨
You know what, next time, I'll send you a pizza.

673
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,700
我倒要看看  这有没有用
I see, if that makes an impression.

674
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,400
你无法在源代码中
You cannot alter the continuum

675
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,490
改变现实的连续性
of this reality from within the Source Code.

676
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,460
你弄的这玩意肯定是违法的
This can't be legal what you are doing.

677
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,390
实际上  
In fact,

678
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:11,980
你大脑的使用权和整个项目
your acquisition by this program as well as the program itself,

679
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:14,910
都通过了军事法庭的审核
has been reviewed and sanctioned by a military court.

680
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,870
许多士兵都会认为
You know, many soldiers would

681
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:20,780
执行这任务比死了要好
find this preferable to death.

682
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,670
因为有机会继续为国家效力
The opportunity to continue serving their country.

683
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,360
长官
Have you...

684
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:28,700
你到底经历过真刀真枪的战斗吗
Have you spent much time in battle, sir?

685
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,090
这无关紧要
That's immaterial.

686
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,060
我的战友们都会认为
Any soldier I've ever served with

687
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:37,070
为国效力  死一次就够了
could say that one death is service enough.

688
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,410
好吧  只要你完成了任务  我就答应你的要求
Fine, you can have that in return for completing this mission.

689
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,590
-什么要求  -给你你想要的
- Wha... Have what? - I'll give you what you want...

690
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:47,320
终结你的服役  让你安息
Terminate your service, let you die.

691
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,120
浪费太多时间了
This is taking too long,

692
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,790
你对他太仁慈  现在起不许休息了
you've been to easy on him. No more rest periods.

693
00:51:57,370 --> 00:52:00,940
我相信  我们会找到跟你受过类似伤
I am certain, we can find other service men with wounds

694
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,330
但却把执行此任务
similar to yours who'll

695
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:04,520
视为无上荣耀的士兵
consider being a part of this program an honor.

696
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:08,340
不不  等等  什么
No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait. What?

697
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,460
送他回去  驱动通电
Send him back. Charge the drivers.

698
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,050
斯蒂文斯上尉
And Captain Stevens,

699
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:21,970
我得提醒你 这可不只是为了你自己
I'd like you to remember that it's not only about you,

700
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:25,190
更是为了外面两千万美国人
but it's also about 2 million real world Americans.

701
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:27,390
你可能不珍惜你的命
Now you may not value your own life,

702
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,180
但我请你珍惜他们的生命
I do however ask that you value theirs.

703
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,560
建议
Advice...

704
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:34,560
老头
Hey Grandpa...

705
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,730
冷静下来  你回来了
Calm yourself, you're back.

706
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,410
找到设弹人了吗
Did you find the bomber?

707
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:52,210
车上有几百个人
There... are hundreds of people on that train.

708
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:55,540
那就一个一个地去检查
Well, then check them out one by one.

709
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:58,120
你怎样对他们都无所谓  反正他们都死了
Doesn't matter what you do to them, they're already dead.

710
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,080
有必要的话  就拿枪杀了他们
Get to that gun and shoot them all if you have to,

711
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,650
但是一定要搞到有用的情报
but get us some usable intel.

712
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,830
不  等等
No! No, wait!

713
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,140
在找到设弹人之前  你必须反复穿越
We have to keep doing this, until you find the bomber.

714
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,460
拜托  我一直在努力
Please, I am trying, I am trying

715
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,010
谁是投弹人
Who is the bomber?

716
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:26,920
我在努力
I am trying.

717
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:32,440
抱歉  上尉  我知道你很累
I am sorry, Captain. I know you are exhausted

718
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,220
我们也都很沮丧  但我们输不起
and we are all frustrated, but we can not fail.

719
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,470
你做得到的
You can do this.

720
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:40,060
-我做不到  -你可以
- I can't, I can't. - Yes, you can.

721
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:44,670
你天生就是英雄  即使你父亲也这样想
You are a born hero, son. Even your father thinks so.

722
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,910
你最擅长的就是救人于危难之中
Saving people is what you do best.

723
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:53,870
我们之前有些矛盾  我不想和他修复关系
It was about a stir, too. I didn't wanna regroup back.

724
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:55,340
我只是开始觉得
I just... started feeling

725
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:57,020
他再也不想回家了
like he didn't wanna come home anymore.

726
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,270
-爸  是你吗  -他还是没能回来
- Dad? - Somehow, he couldn't come home.

727
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:02,800
也不愿意跟我沟通  或是听我说话
and he wouldn't talk to me... wouldn't hear me.

728
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:06,140
他只说...他不能就这样
Hardly said he just... couldn't

729
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:09,380
离开他的部队  所以一直在服役
leave his unit out there without him and that was that.

730
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,760
那些战友  才是他的家人
Those guys... were his family.

731
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:17,570
我说了两件我不该说的事  也许吧
I said two things I shouldn't have. I don't know.

732
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:21,010
我从未真正了解过他
I never fully understood him.

733
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:23,740
也不敢相信他就这样死了
And I can't believe he is gone.

734
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:30,730
送我回去
Send me back in.

735
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,890
拜托别再把我炸飞了
Please don't blow me up again.

736
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:30,040
拨号  065-012-6758

737
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:38,310
我知道是你
Hello? I know, it's you.

738
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:44,320
我会找到你的  给我回头
I am gonna find you. Turn around?

739
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:49,470
-你好啊  -我吗
- Hey there. - Me?

740
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:51,960
你惊讶个什么
Why you look so surprised?

741
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:57,540
坐着别动
Don't.

742
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,680
坐边上点  快  把包放那儿
Move. Move. Move. The bag over there.

743
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,050
往里点  把包放对面然后往里坐
Move over, put the bag over there and move over.

744
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:08,030
坐过去  把手机给我
Move over. Now hand me your phone.

745
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:12,090
-这下你玩完了  -什么
- You're done! You're done. - What?

746
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:14,960
-你不能再害人了  -什么  我不明白
- You can't kill anybody anymore. - What? I don't understand.

747
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,100
-你要用手机引爆炸弹  -什么
- You gonna trigger the bomb with your phone. - What?

748
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:20,840
我发誓我不知道你在说什么
I swear I don't know what you're talking about.

749
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,300
听着  我叫乔治・特洛克山  是个软件工程师
Listen, my name is George Troxel, I am software engineer, ok?

750
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:27,980
刚在跟老婆打电话
I was talking to my wife.

751
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:34,050
再打一次  你再拨一次
Try it again. Your call, dial it again.

752
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:37,430
那好  我只要按下重播键
Ok, I am gonna press redial.

753
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:40,940
你的电话就会响  然后我就一枪解决你
Your phone is gonna ring and then I gonna shot you.

754
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,260
该死  很抱歉
Shit, I am sorry. Sorry.

755
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:54,320
你的东西掉了
Hey! You dropped this.

756
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,080
谢谢
Wow, thanks.

757
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,530
车门即将关闭  请全员上车
All aboard. Doors are closing.

758
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:34,920
该死  不  开门
Shit, no, no!

759
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:37,480
不
No!

760
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:39,800
紧急出口

761
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:45,420
你可以的
Come on!

762
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,030
停车
Stop the train!

763
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:38,440
伊利诺斯  5CGY847

764
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,740
-德里克・弗罗斯特  -什么事
- Derek Frost - Yes?

765
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:45,060
-瞧瞧这个  -干啥
- See this? - Yes?

766
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:47,240
-眼熟吗  -没见过
- Recognize it? - No.

767
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:55,120
-上帝啊  -把钱包给我
- Jesus. - How about you give me your wallet?

768
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:57,240
好的
Ok.

769
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:02,060
别摸了  你故意落在火车上了
No, you left it on the train deliberately.

770
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:06,070
我肯定是...不小心掉的
I... must dropped it.

771
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,110
不  你是故意的
No, you planted it there,

772
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,070
这样别人就会以为你死了
so everybody would think you were dead.

773
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:20,290
-我知道是你干的  -你怎么什么都知道
- I know, it's you. - How do you know so much?

774
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,300
这他妈是什么
Hell is that thing?

775
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,270
给我悠着点
Wow, wow, wow. Wow, wow. Slow down, slow down.

776
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:38,620
-你想看看吗  -挺爱国的嘛
- Do you wanna see it? - Very patriotic...

777
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,630
动作慢点
Slowly, slowly!

778
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:49,360
好了好了  退后  退后
All right, all right. Back up, back up! Back up!

779
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,790
不是人人都做得出来的
Not many people could build that.

780
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:10,280
好吧  你下一个目标是什么
Alright, where is your next target?

781
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,670
肖恩
Shawn?

782
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:16,430
我的天啊
Oh my god.

783
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,980
肖恩・芬特雷斯
Shawn Fentress.

784
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:54,380
老师  教历史的
Teacher. History.

785
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:58,450
我不认识你
I don't know you.

786
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:01,590
我好像把你女朋友杀了
I think I killed your girlfriend.

787
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:05,080
为什么
Why?

788
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,910
你把我的计划搞乱了
Oh, you messed up my timing.

789
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,540
为什么
Why!?

790
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:13,220
你是说为什么做这个
Oh, you mean why this.

791
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:19,750
因为这世界简直是地狱
Because the world is hell.

792
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,780
但我们可以从废墟中创造一个新世界
But we have a chance to start over in the rubble

793
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:26,180
前提是  先把它夷为平地
but first there has to be rubble

794
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:30,180
你是老师  你会明白的
You are teacher. You... will understand.

795
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:03,700
克莉丝汀娜  挺住
Christina... Stay with me!

796
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:05,420
挺住
Stay with me!

797
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:12,210
一切都会好起来的
Everything is gonna be ok.

798
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:21,130
一切还没有结束
This isn't the end.

799
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:25,460
那儿检查一遍  我查这边
Check through there I'll go check this way.

800
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:16,170
这里是围城
This is Beleaguered Castle.

801
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:23,730
上尉  这里是围城  请确认通信
Captain, this is Beleaguered Castle. Acknowledge transmission.

802
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:33,820
斯蒂文斯上尉  这里是围城
Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle,

803
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:35,290
请确认通信
acknowledge transmission.

804
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:38,610

我希望你能站在这个项目的立场上
I had hoped that you might reconsider that

819
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,680
重新考虑一下
for the sake of the program.

820
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:27,060
考虑过了  我现在想要点别的
I have, I want something else now.

821

好啊

那不会有用的

我不指望你相信我  先生

856
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,180
不好意思  无意冒犯

860
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:31,010
你觉得有没有另一个自己
You think there is an alternate version of you?

861
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:34,030
一个做出不同选择的戈德温
A Goodwin who made different choices?

862

什么意思
What do you mean?

863
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,280
比如说  你没有结婚

不  我不觉得  上尉
No, I don't, Captain.

867
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:55,490
你所经历的只是幻影
What you experienced was a shadow,

868
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:58,160
是一个遇害者脑中的残像
it was an afterimage of a victim on a train.

869
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,370
这里才是真实世界
This is real life, here.

870
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,650

这个程序的初衷不是为了改变过去
The program wasn't designed to alter the past,

872
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:17,310

it was designed to affect the future. And you have done that.

873
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:19,130
我搞砸了点事情  上尉
I missed something, Captain.

874
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:21,770
那列车不该爆炸
That train shouldn't have blown up.

875
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,550
肯定还有另一个引爆器
There must have been a second detonator.

876
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:25,400
备用的  我没发现
Something I couldn't see. A fail-safe.

877
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,110
这是电脑程序  上尉
It's a computer program, Captain.

878
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:34,030
车上的姑娘  还有其他人  都已经死了

量子物理  寓式积分
I know, quantum physics, parable calculus.

882
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:45,790
但你错了  戈德温  大错特错
You're wrong, Goodwin. You're just plain wrong.

883
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:47,800
上尉  克莉丝汀娜已经死了
Captain, Christina is dead.

884
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:50,910
她有机会活下去的
She doesn't have to be, Ma'm.

885
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,230
我问问拉特里奇
I'll ask Rutledge.

886
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:56,730
我求求你
I'm asking you.

I'm asking you... Just... send me...

888
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:12,010
送我回去  终止我的生命

889
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:33,460
只要八分钟而已  戈德温

890
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,070
上尉
Captain.

891
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:03,080
决定权在你
It's your choice.

892
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:08,890
这段源代码结束时我会关闭生命维持系统
At the end of this Source Code I'll terminate your life support.

893
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:18,160
你再也不会回来了
There willl be no coming back.

894
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:24,060
我一定能拯救她  戈德温
I am gonna save her, Goodwin!

895
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,550
我一定能拯救她  戈德温

896
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:28,300
很荣幸为你效劳  上尉

901
01:09:58,380 --> 01:09:59,320
当心  女士

902
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:02,040
没错  我要在深山里找寻自我
Yeah, I am gonna go find myself in the mountains.

903
01:10:04,590 --> 01:10:07,200
走之前  你也许可以跟我喝杯咖啡
Well maybe you have a cup of coffee with me before you go.

904

We, we... we told Captain Stevens,

935
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,200
让他安息的吗
that we were gonna let him die.

936
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:35,700
让他死  他刚刚救下了无数条生命
Let him die? He just saved millions of lives today.

937
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:38,580
有了他  以后能避免多少灾难
How many other disasters might he avert down the line?

938
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,830
而且据我们所知  他可能
For all we know, he may be

939
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:43,680
是能让这套系统运行的唯一人选
the only candidate with which the system works.

940
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:50,960
所以  清除他的记忆  初始化源代码
So, let's clear his memory and reinitialize Source Code.

941
01:12:51,290 --> 01:12:52,640
好吗
Shall we?

942
01:12:57,770 --> 01:12:58,940
遵命
Yes, sir.

943
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:05,980
不好意思  我...
Sorry, I just...

944
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:08,980
德里克  你不在这站下呀
Hey Derek, this isn't your stop.

945
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:11,720
先生  你把这个掉了
Hey Mr. You dropped this.

946
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,000
过来  到后面来
Come on, back here.

947
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:50,840
德里克
Derek.

948
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:53,990
都结束了
It's over.

949
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:57,080
明白吗
Do you understand?

950
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,840
我叫德里克・弗罗斯特
Hey, my name is Derek Frost.

951
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:06,350
我在一辆白色货车中安置了一个核装置
I planted a nuclear device in a white van,

952
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:09,350
车停在格伦布鲁克站的CCR停车场
parked in a Glenbrook Station CCR parking lot

953
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:11,670
现在我被铐在944 CCR列车的扶手上
right now I am handcuffed to a pole

954
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:15,210
列车正驶往芝加哥联合站
on the 944 CCR train, headed to Chicago Union Station.

955
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:18,620
我是个变态的可怜虫
I am a sick and pathetic human being.

956
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,390
我渴望一段漫长的监狱之旅
And I need to be locked away for a very long time.

957
01:14:24,770 --> 01:14:25,870
好了
Ok.

958
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:32,290
德里克  今天你是夷不平这个世界了
Derek, there's no more burying the world in rubble today.

959
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,710
不介意我借用一下吧
You mind if I borrow this?

960
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:44,390
上尉  我们哥几个要去庆祝一下
Captain, some of the guys and I are gonna go celebrate.

961
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:50,150
他们让我启动记忆清除程序  上尉
And... they want me to initiate the memory wipe, Captain.

962
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:23,100
你好  上尉
Hello, Captain.

963
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:35,180
-你好  -是唐纳德・斯蒂文斯吗
- Hello? - Donald Stevens?

964
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:37,060
是我
Yes.

965
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:45,960
-我叫肖恩・斯蒂文斯  -你是谁
- My name is Shawn Fentress. - Who?

966
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,280
我和您儿子考尔特一起服役
I served with your son, Colter.

967
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:53,550
天哪
Oh boy...

968
01:15:53,550 --> 01:16:00,550
很抱歉这么久才打电话给你
It's a... I am sorry it has taken me so long to... call you.

969
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:03,140
有时候自己需要一些时间  
Sometimes it just takes a while

970
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:06,170
才能找到最想说的话
to figure out what you wanna say, you know.

971
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:08,790
别太勉强自己
Ah, don't be too hard on yourself...

972
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:11,680
打这个电话并不容易
It's not an easy call to make.

973
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,410
先生  您过得还好吗
How are you doing, Sir?

974
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:25,070
运回来的只有些骨灰
All that came back was some ash.

975
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,760
很难相信那就是他
It's hard to believe that it was him.

976
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,930
你有多了解他
How well did you know him?

977
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:49,870
他牺牲的时候我在场  他说...
I was there when he died, Sir. He said...

978
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:56,910
你们的最后一次谈话  言辞很激烈...
that the last time that you guys talked, ehm... was tough ...and

979
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:06,640
他想说声对不起
he wanted to say that he was sorry.

980
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,370
我只想让他平安回来
I just wanted him back.

981
01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:38,340
我很爱他
I loved him so much.

982
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:51,430
-真希望能亲口告诉他  -他知道的
- I wish I could have told him that. - He knows it.

983
01:17:55,210 --> 01:17:57,670
保重  斯蒂文斯先生
Take care, Mr. Stevens.

984
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:30,200
-你没事吧  -没事
- You ok? - Yeah.

985
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:34,800
-拯救世界了  -差不多吧
- Saved the world? - Sorta.

986
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:38,010
刚说到哪儿了
So, where were we?

987
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,220
去喝咖啡
Getting some coffee.

988
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:44,760
这是拉特里奇博士
Dr. Rutledge?

989
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,800
什么
What?

990
01:18:58,410 --> 01:18:59,480
该死
Shit!

991
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,100
这有什么难的  我是经商的好吗
What is too hard about it? I run a business, ok?

992
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,820
要么按时完成工作  要么卷铺盖滚蛋
Everything moves on time or people get fired.

993
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:06,290
现实世界就是这么残酷
That's how it works in the real world.

994
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,680
-十分钟  -老兄
- 10 Minutes. - Hey buddy.

995
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:11,710
别为些琐事汗流浃背  小心汗水逆流成河
Don't sweat the small stuff, you'll drown.

996
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:13,960
多谢大师指点迷津
Oh thank you for the moment of Zen,

997
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:15,060
但我又没跟你说话
but nobody was talking to you.

998
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:16,750
你算什么  大喇叭广播吗
What do you sound, self help cds today?

999
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:18,860
管好自己的事得了
Why don't you just mind your own business?

1000
01:19:18,970 --> 01:19:23,590
保安  带一队人马过来  速度
Security? Get me a detachment of MPs here. This instant!

1001
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:26,790
为什么你老爱挖苦人呢  马克思
Why are you always so bitter, Max?

1002
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:29,010
朋友  这世界就是如此残酷
It's a bitter world we living my friend.

1003
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:30,790
你想让我怎么办
What you want from me?

1004
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:33,950
没必要这样的
It doesn't have to be.

1005
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:37,430
我赌一百块
I will bet you 100 dollars,

1006
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,310
赌你不能把车里所有人逗笑
that you can't make all the people on this train laugh.

1007
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:43,640
好了
Oh right...

1008
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:50,170
这总共有...126块
Actually, 126 bucks.

1009
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:52,420
你就这么玩儿我吗
Is that your way of making fun of me?

1010
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:54,010
不  为了让今天多点欢乐
No, it is to have a better day...

1011
01:19:54,010 --> 01:19:58,590
不  我接受  手到擒来
No, no. It's good. Easiest money ever.

1012
01:19:58,690 --> 01:20:03,370
打扰一下  朋友们  我的一个乘客朋友
Hey, I... excuse me, people. One of our fellow passengers

1013
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:06,220
给了我点钱
has decided to offer me some money...

1014
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:07,680
你今天怎么了
What has just gotten into you today?

1015
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:09,460
像是变了个人
You're like a different person.

1016
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:12,130
-这是全新的我  -我喜欢
- It's the new me. - I like it.

1017
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:20,230
女人们总把我的姓搞错
Women always mess up my last name.

1018
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:21,310
有天晚上我跟一姑娘在一起
I was with a girl the other night and

1019
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:21,310
她总是叫我"滚开"
she kept calling me "Getoff".

1020
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:22,460
译注: 滚开在英语中与此人姓氏谐音

1021
01:20:22,970 --> 01:20:25,130
她说  滚开  滚开  我说  不  我叫丹诺夫
She goes "Get off, get off" "I am "No, Denoff,

1022
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:27,380
她说  不是  你又胖又重  快滚开
Denoff", she: "No, you are fat and you are heavy, get off!"

1023
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:32,470
好了吗  还要二十秒
Good? 20 seconds.

1024
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,380
给你十秒
Make it 10.

1025
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:37,890
戈德温

1026
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:41,610
看看这一切
Look at all this.

1027

01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,500
所有这些生命
All this life.

1029
01:20:57,090 --> 01:21:00,600
戈德温  快把安全门打开
Goodwin, open the SC door!

1030
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:14,510
为什么你总不停看表
Why you keep looking at your watch?

1031
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:17,370
克莉丝汀娜  如果你只有一分钟不到的生命
Christina, what would you do...

1032
01:21:18,730 --> 01:21:21,030
你会怎么做
if you knew you had less than a minute to live?

1033
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:29,940
我会让每秒都过得有意义
I'd make those seconds count.

1034
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:34,740
-我会再吻你一次  -你吻过吗
- I'd kiss you again. - Again?

1035
01:21:36,410 --> 01:21:38,630
戈德温  把这该死的门打开
Goodwin, open this god damn door!

1036
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:42,180
他已经付出够多了  博士
He has done enough, Dr.

1037
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:06,110
一切都会好起来的
Everything is gonna be ok.

1038
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:21,790
今天是周一  芝加哥的天气很好

1043
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:37,490
搞的我现在没钱了

-你相信命运吗  -不太信
- Do you believe in fate? - Not really.

1048

I'm more of a dumb luck kind of gal. Come here.

1049

你今天想干什么

我们应该在这多待一会儿
I think we should stay here for a while.

1051
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:34,690
我们命中注定要来这个地方  不是吗
This feels like exactly where we're supposed to be, doesn't it?

1052
01:24:51,030 --> 01:24:53,170
-早上好  杰夫  -早上好  上尉
- Good Morning, Jeff. - Good Morning, Captain.

1053

1055

今天某个时候

1056
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:08,560
你会得知在芝加哥附近的列车上
you re gonna hear about

1057
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:12,110
有一个作案未遂的恐怖袭击犯
a failed terrorist attack on a commuter train near Chicago.

1058
01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:15,620
是我们阻止了炸弹爆炸
You and I kept that bomb from going off.

1059
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,690
有人想在芝加哥城外的CCR列车上引发爆炸
An attempted bombing on a CCR train outside Chicago

1060
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:24,090
危险已被解除  在列车上发现了嫌疑犯
but it was foiled. And the suspect was found on board...

1061
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:27,420
名叫德里克・弗罗斯特
Named Derek Frost.

1062

1063
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:40,850
没什么  我一会儿再来

1064
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,920
瞪大你的眼睛
Well, keep an eye out.

1065
01:25:49,150 --> 01:25:54,780
这几天  总会有危机浮出水面
One of these days, the right crisis is going to rear its head

1066
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:59,330
那时候就该源代码大展身手了
and Source Code is going to have its moment in the sun.

1067
01:25:59,410 --> 01:26:00,620
遵命  长官
Yes, Sir.

1068
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:10,030
如果你现在正在读这封邮件
If you re reading this email,

1069
01:26:10,030 --> 01:26:11,890
那说明源代码比你和拉特里奇博士
then Source Code works even better than

1070
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:13,760
想的要强大
you and Dr. Rutledge imagined.

1071
01:26:14,530 --> 01:26:17,330
你们以为自己在重现过去的8分钟
You thought you were creating 8 minutes of a past event,

1072
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:18,800
但事实并非如此
