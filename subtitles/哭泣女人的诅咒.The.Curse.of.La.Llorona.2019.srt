00:00:43,363 --> 00:00:46,000
I will save this forever.

3
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:16,297
Mama, where are you?

4
00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:22,165
Mama.

5
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:38,000
Mama, where are you?

6
00:01:43,726 --> 00:01:45,330
Mama.

7
00:01:45,726 --> 00:01:47,561
Where?

8
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:09,033
Mama don't!

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,462
Sam, come on! We're late!

12
00:02:28,627 --> 00:02:30,660
You! The bus is almost there!

13
00:02:31,363 --> 00:02:34,000
Chris, if I'm late, you make dinner first.

14
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,330
Meatloaf, good.

15
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,330
Mission.

16
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,033
Sorry dear.

17
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,363
Mother, where is the jacket?

18
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:43,429
Above?

19
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:46,792
Take the key.

20
00:02:48,396 --> 00:02:50,198
Throw here.

21
00:02:50,198 --> 00:02:51,693
Here it is, take your backpack and leave.

22
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:54,792
Okay.

23
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:57,363
Come on, guys! Oh, I see it.

24
00:02:57,726 --> 00:02:59,726
What? Honey, no. You can't use this.

25
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:02,099
Okay. We will miss the bus.

26
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:05,462
Come on! Come on! Come on!

27
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:07,528
Shit.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,297
I'm fine mom.

29

Child Protection Services

30
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,066
Oh Donna, what is the case of Alvarez?

31
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:30,495
I called several times, but | he didn't answer the phone.

32
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:33,033
I'll take the patrol there, something happened in that house.

33
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:34,594
Patricia Alvarez ?!

34
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:35,792
What happened?

35
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:37,297
We got a call from school.

36
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:39,264
Alvarez's children don't go to school anymore.

37
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:40,495
Okay, why is Donna there?

38
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:42,000
I moved some of your cases.

39
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:43,231
Donna has more energy.

40
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:45,033
Energy? And more time.

41
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:47,330
He has no responsibility outside like you have.

42
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,297
He did not have children.

43
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:50,660
From her husband or father?

44
00:03:53,396 --> 00:03:56,165
He is on time every week this week.

45
00:03:57,165 --> 00:03:59,396
Believe me, we all understand.

46
00:03:59,396 --> 00:04:00,627
Is it true?

47
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:02,660
It doesn't feel like that.

48
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,660
Less time here, more time at home.

49
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:06,759
Maybe not a bad thing.

50
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,396
Patricia Alvarez won't talk to someone like Donna.

51
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:12,297
Someone like Donna. I mean, only he knows me.

52
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:15,495
I was with that family for 4 years, | I saw the children grow up.

53
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:18,000
Patricia trusts me, she knows that I'm a mother too.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,396
His job is to do the best for children.

55
00:04:19,396 --> 00:04:21,660
Okay, okay, listen, just continue the case.

56
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:24,231
You brought Donna here to check with the patrol.

57
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,066
I don't need patrol. Bring the officer.

58
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:27,759
That is not a request.

59
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:31,264
Sorry.

60
00:04:31,264 --> 00:04:33,396
You know I can handle this myself, okay.

61
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,660
I'm sure you can.

62
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:44,066
Hi Patricia.

63
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:47,033
How are you?

64
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,462
Are children at home?

65
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,198
Mom, open the door.

66
00:04:52,198 --> 00:04:53,759
It's okay, give us time.

67
00:04:55,264 --> 00:04:56,594
Patricia, where are the children?

68
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,099
They are somewhere safe Anna.

69
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,462
Oh.

70
00:05:01,363 --> 00:05:02,660
I do not know what happened.

71
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,759
But I'm your best bet to get rid of all the problems.

72
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,198
Why don't you let me enter.

73
00:05:06,198 --> 00:05:08,594
And you can show me | they're as safe as you say.

74
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:14,396
He doesn't even need to enter.

75
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:17,132
Okay? Why aren't you | just let me in.

76
00:05:19,396 --> 00:05:21,429
Ah, promise you will enter alone.

77
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:24,495
With all due respect for officer Garcia.

78
00:05:24,495 --> 00:05:26,165
Your husband is a police officer.

79
00:05:26,165 --> 00:05:28,264
You think I'll leave | you in there alone?

80
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,495
Yes, me.

81
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:34,726
I'll be out here. Thank you.

82
00:05:43,561 --> 00:05:45,792
Patricia, help me here.

83
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:49,594
Where are the children?

84
00:05:54,132 --> 00:05:56,330
If you drink again, if you | experience some sort of ... / Shh ..

85
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,561
Did you hear that?

86
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,528
You hear.

87
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:01,660
Above.

88
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,759
What?

89
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,000
What did you hear?

90
00:06:12,297 --> 00:06:13,759
Weeping.

91
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:16,429
Above.

92
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:20,462
Not.

93
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:22,099
Not.

94
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:32,264
Carlos?

95
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:39,198
Tomas?

96
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,429
Get away from the door Anna.

97
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:49,198
You have to get out Anna.

98
00:07:49,396 --> 00:07:51,165
What do you have in here?

99
00:07:51,165 --> 00:07:53,462
Patricia, please. I just ... / Get out!

100
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:56,627
Please tell me what is inside here. Get out!

101
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,792
Get away from that door!

102
00:08:00,165 --> 00:08:02,396
Open the door! Can't open!

103
00:08:02,396 --> 00:08:04,594
Get up from him now!

104
00:08:05,627 --> 00:08:08,066
Don't open the door! This is jammed!

105
00:08:08,066 --> 00:08:09,462
Oh god, Anna!

106
00:08:09,462 --> 00:08:11,264
Everybody's down! One more night!

107
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:13,726
Help me!

108
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,330
You do not understand!

109
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,231
Oh, God.

110
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:02,429
Close the door.

111
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,429
Please.

112
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:06,165
He will hurt us.

113
00:09:07,495 --> 00:09:09,198
Not.

114
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:10,297
He won't.

115
00:09:11,462 --> 00:09:12,462
I promise.

116
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:21,198
You guys, everything is OK.

117
00:09:21,198 --> 00:09:22,693
You will have ...

118
00:09:22,693 --> 00:09:23,495
Warm bed.

119
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:25,495
And hot food.

120
00:09:26,297 --> 00:09:27,330
And shower.

121
00:09:28,462 --> 00:09:29,462
Okay?

122
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:42,066
Gosh.

123
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,000
How did that happen?

124
00:09:47,231 --> 00:09:48,495
He did it.

125
00:09:51,528 --> 00:09:52,759
Did your mother do that to you?

126
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,561
Not.

127
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:56,297
Not him.

128
00:10:03,627 --> 00:10:05,759
Your mother loves you, you know that, right?

129
00:10:06,462 --> 00:10:08,792
Whatever happens, we will take care of it okay.

130
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:12,528
For tonight, you will be safe.

131
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:15,792
I promise you.

132
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:20,231
We are not safe anywhere.

133
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:31,594
Hey.

134
00:10:32,594 --> 00:10:34,132
Sorry I'm late.

135
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:36,297
How is school?

136
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,759
The same.

137
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,528
Please tell.

138
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:41,726
Here.

139
00:10:42,264 --> 00:10:44,330
Is there meat in the fridge, do you want me to heat it for you?

140
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,561
I do not know.

141
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:48,231
Hello.

142
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,198
Yes, I can hear it.

143
00:10:50,297 --> 00:10:51,660
Okay, where is he.

144
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,000
He plays in dad's office.

145
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:58,000
Don't watch too much tv, okay.

146
00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:00,330
I see it.

147
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,330
The suspect escaped.

148
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,297
I chased on foot.

149
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,561
I think I saw something.

150
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:06,759
There he is!

151
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:09,396
I see the suspect!

152
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,066
I need help!

153
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:12,462
Bam! Bam!

154
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:15,264
I need help! I got shot!

155
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:18,099
Do not move!

156
00:11:18,099 --> 00:11:19,330
Bam! Bam! Bam!

157
00:11:19,396 --> 00:11:20,429
I got him.

158
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,792
I got the suspect.

159
00:11:22,396 --> 00:11:24,165
Calling Coop, we get it.

160
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,660
My mother is done!

161
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:58,033
Uh ..

162
00:11:58,231 --> 00:11:59,561
I come.

163
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:06,198
Here.

164
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,297
Okay.

165
00:12:12,726 --> 00:12:14,165
Dry it.

166
00:12:14,528 --> 00:12:16,033
Dry it.

167
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:32,726
Kill him!

168
00:13:30,594 --> 00:13:32,033
Tomas.

169
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,033
Tomas.

170
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,660
Tomas!

171
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,099
Tomas!

172
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,132
Thomas what are you doing?

173
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,561
Thomas returned.

174
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,198
Halo./Anna.

175
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:29,165
This is Coop.

176
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,759
We pull out the kids | Alvarez from the river.

177
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:35,165
I want you to get out of the mission immediately.

178
00:15:36,528 --> 00:15:38,066
Okay, I'll be there soon.

179
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:06,000
Stay in the car, okay.

180
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,528
And please don't wake your sister.

181
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,462
I'll be back in a few minutes.

182
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:22,627
Here, bro.

183
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:35,165
Oh, God.

184
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:38,231
I don't understand, what happened?

185
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,528
We found it in the river, they sank.

186
00:16:41,231 --> 00:16:43,396
When you see them, how are they? / They're fine.

187
00:16:43,396 --> 00:16:46,066
They're scared, but | they're fine.

188
00:16:46,693 --> 00:16:49,528
I promise them | they will be safe, Coop.

189
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:52,297
I promise them. - You don't blame yourself.

190
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:56,627
[speak spanish]

191
00:16:56,627 --> 00:16:58,165

194
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:04,726
This is your fault!

195
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:08,462
I tried to stop him!

196
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,594
[speak spanish]

197
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:11,693
Who?

198
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,495
Who are you trying to stop?

199
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:17,792
La Llorona

200
00:19:27,594 --> 00:19:29,396
[speak spanish]

201
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,429

[speak spanish]

206
00:19:59,396 --> 00:20:02,528
Sam! Sam! Let me in!

Open the door! I want to come in!

208
00:20:06,396 --> 00:20:08,561
Open!

209
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,396
What happened?

210
00:20:24,396 --> 00:20:25,627
Didn't you see him?

211
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:27,066
Who?

212
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,297
Chris, what happened?

213
00:20:59,066 --> 00:21:00,099
Chris?

214
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,561
Hey, what are the kids.

215
00:21:39,594 --> 00:21:41,231
Why, you're fine.

216
00:21:45,627 --> 00:21:47,000
Yes.

217
00:21:47,396 --> 00:21:49,627
Yes. I am fine.

218
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:53,132
I am fine.

219
00:22:01,495 --> 00:22:02,759
Are you ok honey?

220
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:07,000
Yes, I just imagined something.

221
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:12,000
Okay. Good night.

222
00:22:13,627 --> 00:22:15,132
Love you.

223
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:03,066
He is Khurandero.

224
00:23:03,462 --> 00:23:06,066
The ritual is called Smudging (dirtying)

225
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:08,495
That should get rid of the body from negative things

226
00:23:08,495 --> 00:23:12,000
which may stick to it at times of severe stress.

227
00:23:12,165 --> 00:23:14,132
Do you believe it will work?

228
00:23:16,165 --> 00:23:18,660
What is the difference between what I believe

229
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,759
This is what they believe.

230
00:23:21,363 --> 00:23:24,462
And if they believe that, then

231
00:23:24,462 --> 00:23:27,693
They believe in this.

232
00:23:28,693 --> 00:23:30,759
Do you know those kids?

233
00:23:33,528 --> 00:23:35,759
I'm their case worker.

234
00:23:40,495 --> 00:23:43,759
Can I ask, priest? / Yes.

235
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,594
You know something about La Llorona

236
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:53,660
I haven't heard that name since I was a kid.

237
00:23:55,363 --> 00:23:57,660
Woman crying.

238
00:23:58,396 --> 00:23:59,792
He is known for his beauty.

239
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:04,792
The most beautiful woman in the area of ​​Mexico.

240
00:24:06,132 --> 00:24:09,000
And one day Ranchero was rich and handsome

241
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,561
Take her to her village.

242
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:13,462
He loved her.

243
00:24:13,462 --> 00:24:15,594
The wedding is beautiful.

244
00:24:15,594 --> 00:24:19,231
They are two children who are sweet, whom they care about.

245
00:24:19,528 --> 00:24:22,462
But then, after all this time.

246
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,627
He found it in younger women.

247
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,429
What did he do?

248
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:32,231
He took it from him.

249
00:24:32,231 --> 00:24:34,165
What is most valuable.

250
00:24:35,231 --> 00:24:37,198
He killed their children.

251
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:42,528
In his jealous anger, he drowned them in the river.

252
00:24:43,528 --> 00:24:46,132
After he realized what he had done.

253
00:24:46,132 --> 00:24:48,429
He fell into his guilt.

254
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:51,363
He threw himself in the same water.

255
00:24:51,363 --> 00:24:53,726
And he was cursed to roam on earth.

256
00:24:54,066 --> 00:24:57,297
Looking for children to replace their place.

257
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:01,165
Children are told to take care of their behavior.

258
00:25:01,297 --> 00:25:03,363
Listen to the old one.

259
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,198
Or La Llorona will come.

260
00:25:06,462 --> 00:25:08,330
Steal them.

261
00:25:10,165 --> 00:25:12,462
So it's a fairy tale.

262
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,495
For some people.

263
00:25:21,165 --> 00:25:22,396
This.

264
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:26,627
This has taken me through many dark nights.

265
00:25:27,198 --> 00:25:29,561
Maybe I'll do the same for you.

266
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:33,462
Thank you, but my husband | is religious, not me.

267
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:37,132
You don't need to be religious.

268
00:25:37,132 --> 00:25:38,792
To have faith.

269
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,594
Chris.

270
00:28:14,297 --> 00:28:15,330
Chris!

271
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:20,561
Sam!

272
00:28:21,792 --> 00:28:23,066
Sam!

273
00:28:30,594 --> 00:28:32,462
Sam!

274
00:28:49,132 --> 00:28:50,198
Sam?

275
00:29:10,396 --> 00:29:12,000
Sam.

276
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,594
What is it, honey?

277
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:17,726
Honey what happened to your hand?

278
00:29:18,363 --> 00:29:20,099
I fall.

279
00:29:21,099 --> 00:29:23,099
It was a terrible fall.

280
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:27,264
Hey.

281
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:30,198
I know things are a little difficult now.

282
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:34,297
I know your little world sometimes | looks scary.

283
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,627
But I think

284
00:29:37,726 --> 00:29:40,231
Remember what dad always said?

285
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,495
There's nothing to fear when he's not there.

286
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,693
I told you to hold it | and squeeze it tightly.

287
00:29:50,231 --> 00:29:54,396
Feel better? I feel | a little better, right?

288
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,594
What do you see?

289
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,033
Coop here.

290
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:16,000
Come on

291
00:30:18,495 --> 00:30:20,066
Come on, dear.

292
00:30:36,396 --> 00:30:37,561
A tough day, man.

293
00:30:40,363 --> 00:30:42,000
Can we go watch TV.

294
00:30:43,231 --> 00:30:44,297
Certain.

295
00:30:58,033 --> 00:30:59,033
Toast.

296
00:31:01,462 --> 00:31:02,759
What a mess, huh?

297
00:31:03,033 --> 00:31:04,297
Sunday. / Month?

298
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:06,099
Year.

299
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,561
I don't know, this won't end, I guess.

300
00:31:10,561 --> 00:31:12,330
I do not know.

301
00:31:13,528 --> 00:31:14,528
Time.

302
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:16,099
Yes.

303
00:31:17,132 --> 00:31:18,594
And the usual wrap.

304
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,132
Thank you, you're welcome.

305
00:31:22,726 --> 00:31:26,198
You don't want to talk about personal problems, what if it's a professional?

306
00:31:27,165 --> 00:31:31,429
I don't know what? / About | Patricia Alvarez.

307
00:31:33,132 --> 00:31:36,792
We know he was accused of death | his son, but he has a strong alibi.

308
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:40,198
Some people in the church saw him when his son was taken.

309
00:31:40,528 --> 00:31:42,396
Really? / You know the story ...

310
00:31:43,165 --> 00:31:46,363
Just look at the file, maybe you'll see something I miss.

311
00:31:48,066 --> 00:31:50,792
I will be happy to help you, but he ...

312
00:31:50,792 --> 00:31:54,066
Don't want to meet me. Well, it's like I said.

313
00:31:54,594 --> 00:31:56,462
He is angry with you.

314
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:01,033
And the first thing your husband teaches me is ... Angry people talk.

315
00:36:56,726 --> 00:36:57,726
Chris.

316
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:03,165
What are you doing?

317
00:37:05,165 --> 00:37:06,330
Chris.

318
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,198
Hey.

319
00:37:12,495 --> 00:37:15,429
Chris. Dear?

320
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
You are okay?

321
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:20,429
Are you ok honey?

322
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:22,396
Chris.

323
00:37:41,396 --> 00:37:45,297
Chris?

324
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:48,495
Come on Hey, wake up.

325
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:51,528
What happened? / You sleep | while walking dear.

326
00:37:53,066 --> 00:37:56,363
You sleep the whip goes, it's okay.

327
00:37:56,693 --> 00:38:00,000
Come on Come on baby, we bring | you up, we see Sam,

328
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:54,495
Is there someone here?

329
00:39:04,462 --> 00:39:07,792
Because my husband is a police officer, and | he will be home soon.

330
00:39:47,462 --> 00:39:48,594
Chris! Children!

331
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,330
Oh god, open the door! Open the door!

332
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,099
What are you doing at my house?

333
00:40:06,198 --> 00:40:08,165
What are you doing at my house!

334
00:40:10,429 --> 00:40:12,528
Get out of my house!

335
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:15,693
Mother.

336
00:40:15,693 --> 00:40:19,099
What happened?

337
00:40:22,363 --> 00:40:24,264
There is no. There is no.

338
00:40:24,264 --> 00:40:26,627
Nothing dear, nothing. Sorry.

339
00:40:26,627 --> 00:40:29,693
Come on, dear.

340
00:40:30,363 --> 00:40:34,693
Come on baby, back to your bed okay.

341
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:58,429
Get rid of your feet from me. I can't.

342
00:41:26,495 --> 00:41:29,033
Patricia.

343
00:41:33,132 --> 00:41:36,429
I'm very sorry for your loss.

344
00:41:39,132 --> 00:41:41,627
I can't even imagine how you feel.

345
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:47,792
How do i feel

346
00:41:50,363 --> 00:41:52,396
I don't feel anything.

347
00:41:53,264 --> 00:41:55,429
Because I feel the worst.

348
00:41:57,693 --> 00:41:59,132
I am done.

349
00:41:59,495 --> 00:42:01,462
I don't care what | they do to me.

350
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:06,132
You should sit here, not me.

351
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,033
You killed my children, not me

352
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,132
[speak spanish]

353
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,792
But you locked them up. I hid them.

354
00:42:14,792 --> 00:42:16,462
[speak spanish]

355
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,297
Now he has them. | He owns them.

356
00:42:23,198 --> 00:42:24,693
You see yours.

357
00:42:30,198 --> 00:42:32,330
What happened to your hand?

358
00:42:32,792 --> 00:42:35,165
What happened to you Patricia?

359
00:42:38,528 --> 00:42:40,165
La Llorona

360
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:44,561
Your children.

361
00:42:45,561 --> 00:42:47,660
Did they hear him cry?

362
00:42:48,594 --> 00:42:51,462
Do they feel the smell from the tears?

363
00:42:53,693 --> 00:42:56,594
They are real, soon.

364
00:42:57,099 --> 00:42:59,132
He will come for them.

365
00:42:59,132 --> 00:43:01,495
Do you know why?

366
00:43:02,627 --> 00:43:04,396
Because I told him.

367
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:07,594
Please don't. You know my children.

368
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,495
Die.

369
00:43:09,495 --> 00:43:14,396
I do not pray to God for their salvation, but vice versa

370
00:43:14,396 --> 00:43:16,264
I pray to him.

371
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:20,000
I pray...

372
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:21,660
And I pray ..

373
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,462
And I pray to him to return my children to me,

374
00:43:24,462 --> 00:43:26,297
and take your children instead.

375
00:44:40,066 --> 00:44:41,396
Sam?

376
00:44:54,396 --> 00:44:56,264
Sam?

377
00:45:18,462 --> 00:45:21,033
Sam ...

378
00:45:59,165 --> 00:46:01,000
What?

379
00:46:02,264 --> 00:46:05,363
Chris! Chris!

380
00:46:10,693 --> 00:46:13,033
This is terrible, champ.

381
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:56,792
Cooper, hi.

382
00:47:00,033 --> 00:47:03,000
What? The hospital called?

383
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,462
Yes. Have been checked.

384
00:47:18,495 --> 00:47:22,033
Samantha, how did you get that burn?

385
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,297
How about you Chris? / I told you we fell.

386
00:47:34,528 --> 00:47:37,726
Is it true? Where is your mother?

387
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,693
Anna you know you can't be here.

388
00:47:44,693 --> 00:47:47,363
Come on, Donna. They try to protect you.

389
00:47:47,363 --> 00:47:49,066
They tell you the truth.

390
00:47:49,264 --> 00:47:52,363
I will never | hurt my child. / He is right.

391
00:47:53,297 --> 00:47:55,759
He can't be here.

392
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:14,132
You might not believe this, but ... | I'm here.

393
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:25,165
I promise your father to look after you guys, | if you need anything, just call me.

394
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:26,726
Understand?

395
00:48:29,627 --> 00:48:31,726
We have to release Patricia Alvarez.

396
00:48:31,726 --> 00:48:34,594
There is not enough evidence to detain him.

397
00:48:36,264 --> 00:48:38,726
Maybe he didn't do it.

398
00:48:39,264 --> 00:48:40,528
What do you mean?

399
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,462
I don't know, forget it.

400
00:48:48,231 --> 00:48:51,330
Anna, whatever happens here.

401
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:53,594
Fix it.

402
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,198
Father, first time in my life.

403
00:49:06,561 --> 00:49:07,726
I fall in love.

404
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,066
Hey. But he doesn't know that.

405
00:49:16,066 --> 00:49:17,429
Chris.

406
00:49:20,198 --> 00:49:21,693
Can we talk

407
00:49:26,132 --> 00:49:28,132
Honey, I want to know what really happened.

408
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,363
I saw a woman. / In the house.

409
00:50:07,264 --> 00:50:08,792
Samantha's room

410
00:50:10,198 --> 00:50:13,099
I saw Sam, but

411
00:50:16,165 --> 00:50:18,693
Woman in white clothes.

412
00:50:19,132 --> 00:50:21,264
He cried.

413
00:50:21,594 --> 00:50:23,198
He wants us.

414
00:50:25,495 --> 00:50:27,693
He wants us to be hurt

415
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:34,495
Aww, ma'am, it hurts.

416
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,594
Dry it.

417
00:50:44,693 --> 00:50:46,198
Do you believe me?

418
00:50:48,033 --> 00:50:49,099
Yes.

419
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,132
Sam?

420
00:51:33,363 --> 00:51:34,627
Sam ?!

421
00:51:42,462 --> 00:51:45,396
Sam, open the door, Sam!

422
00:51:45,396 --> 00:51:47,132
Sam!

423
00:51:59,759 --> 00:52:01,462
What happened.

424
00:52:03,627 --> 00:52:05,165
You are okay?

425
00:52:05,165 --> 00:52:06,297
What happened?

426
00:52:08,066 --> 00:52:09,495
Sam.

427
00:52:19,231 --> 00:52:22,528
Mother ... Mother ... Mother ...

428
00:53:12,594 --> 00:53:15,528
I know that sounds | difficult to believe.

429
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:20,528
A few years ago.

430
00:53:20,528 --> 00:53:24,264
I believe in stories, fairy tales, legends ...

431
00:53:25,099 --> 00:53:27,000
Things that float at night.

432
00:53:28,231 --> 00:53:31,561
But then, there was an incident.

433
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,264
With darkness.

434
00:53:41,033 --> 00:53:44,528
That opened my mind to the possibility of something out of the ordinary.

435
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,627
The church works with people

436
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:54,363
Which specializes in situations like this.

437
00:53:54,759 --> 00:53:56,297
Okay. But.

438
00:53:56,792 --> 00:53:58,264
To get to them.

439
00:53:58,264 --> 00:54:00,495
We have to go through the council session

440
00:54:01,528 --> 00:54:03,726
How long this will last.

441
00:54:03,726 --> 00:54:08,396
At the latest a few weeks | for this case, it's approved.

442
00:54:15,396 --> 00:54:17,462
Maybe there is another way.

443
00:54:17,627 --> 00:54:20,462
This is unusual, but he is a local.

444
00:54:21,726 --> 00:54:24,627
However you choose.

445
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:29,759
I must obey church law and | not interfere in this process.

446
00:54:30,528 --> 00:54:34,033
Like I said, the way he is is unusual.

447
00:54:34,033 --> 00:54:36,330
And the church ...

448
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:39,561
The church has a way, and | he has his way.

449
00:54:39,561 --> 00:54:42,429
That's why he left us many years ago.

450
00:54:43,429 --> 00:54:46,297
He used to be a pastor?

451
00:54:48,231 --> 00:54:50,396
But now he is a mystic.

452
00:54:51,198 --> 00:54:53,132
Shaman in operation

453
00:54:53,132 --> 00:54:55,561
Between Religion and science.

454
00:54:58,165 --> 00:54:59,627
AlKhurandero.

455
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,264
Don't touch anything, okay.

456
00:55:13,429 --> 00:55:16,495
Hello, excuse me. / Have seen you before.

457
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,198
At Alvarez's funeral.

458
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:26,264
Yes. I'm their case worker. You come too fast.

459
00:55:26,264 --> 00:55:27,660
OK.

460
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:30,264
I have more important things to do.

461
00:55:31,363 --> 00:55:34,660
I don't think we're in the right place, sorry, let's go kids.

462
00:55:40,792 --> 00:55:42,792
Have you seen this before?

463
00:55:43,759 --> 00:55:45,561
Yes? / What is that.

464
00:55:46,627 --> 00:55:48,099
The church can help you.

465
00:55:48,099 --> 00:55:51,363
No, no. Please, church | send us here to you.

466
00:55:51,462 --> 00:55:52,561
This.

467
00:55:53,693 --> 00:55:56,033
Is a church affair.

468
00:55:57,792 --> 00:55:59,528
Please.

469
00:56:09,495 --> 00:56:13,066
This is a sign from La Llorona.

470
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:15,264
You have seen him.

471
00:56:19,726 --> 00:56:21,693
Have you ever seen him?

472
00:56:23,594 --> 00:56:25,231
Indirectly.

473
00:56:26,033 --> 00:56:28,198
But I have seen what he did.

474
00:56:29,627 --> 00:56:33,198
What do we do? We face the devil.

475
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:36,033
There is no law.

476
00:56:38,066 --> 00:56:39,759
He is not human.

477
00:56:40,693 --> 00:56:42,660
Right? / No.

478
00:56:43,198 --> 00:56:45,198
But he used to be.

479
00:56:46,033 --> 00:56:48,000
To..

480
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,132
His man is not loyal to him.

481
00:56:51,264 --> 00:56:54,099
He is only an evil spirit.

482
00:56:54,099 --> 00:56:56,528
That is not holy and left by God.

483
00:56:56,528 --> 00:56:59,165
I'll take them to the motel.

484
00:56:59,759 --> 00:57:02,396
He has attached himself to your family.

485
00:57:02,396 --> 00:57:04,099
Not your house.

486
00:57:04,396 --> 00:57:07,462
If you move, he will follow you.

487
00:57:09,231 --> 00:57:11,330
What should I do then?

488
00:57:19,132 --> 00:57:20,627
I don't think that will help.

489
00:57:21,363 --> 00:57:22,594
Not.

490
00:57:23,264 --> 00:57:24,759
Not only this.

491
00:57:28,594 --> 00:57:30,297
At the funeral.

492
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:34,231
I saw you talking | with Pastor Perez.

493
00:57:34,231 --> 00:57:36,792
He said you were a pastor.

494
00:57:39,429 --> 00:57:41,792
My journey started at church.

495
00:57:43,264 --> 00:57:44,759
Yes.

496
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,759
It's been a long time.

497
00:57:53,495 --> 00:57:57,132
Take me to your house, this must be started immediately.

498
00:58:03,528 --> 00:58:05,033
We're done.

499
00:58:05,033 --> 00:58:07,726
Sorry, are you going to scrub the eggs at all?

500
00:58:08,264 --> 00:58:10,132
You think this is ridiculous.

501
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:12,462
Not bad.

502
00:58:15,165 --> 00:58:16,495
Come with me.

503
00:58:18,264 --> 00:58:20,528
This ritual is La Libya.

504
00:58:20,528 --> 00:58:24,132
Used to detect the presence of demons.

505
00:58:28,297 --> 00:58:32,165
More bloody contents, more demon.

506
00:58:36,528 --> 00:58:39,330
[speak spanish]

507
00:58:39,726 --> 00:58:42,165
[speak spanish]

508
00:58:42,165 --> 00:58:43,462
[speak spanish]

509
00:58:43,462 --> 00:58:46,066

00:58:46,066 --> 00:58:48,363

00:58:51,429 --> 00:58:52,759
[speak spanish]

513
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:07,330
Oh, that's a trick, I saw it on John Carson.

514
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:12,330
Mother.

515
00:59:26,231 --> 00:59:27,363
Cistern.

516
00:59:28,693 --> 00:59:30,528
Did you see that in Carson?

517
00:59:34,429 --> 00:59:38,264
In the name of the Father, son and holy spirit

518
00:59:40,099 --> 00:59:41,231
Amen.

519
00:59:46,132 --> 00:59:48,627
We all have to work together.

520
00:59:48,792 --> 00:59:52,033
La Llorona is strong in the dark.

521
00:59:52,561 --> 00:59:54,528
Let's get ready.

522
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,264
The cross.

523
01:00:17,561 --> 01:00:20,231
Carved from trees in Mezico.

524
01:00:20,231 --> 01:00:24,264
It blooms with red flowers, making it look like a fire.

525
01:00:24,561 --> 01:00:26,594
La bolrbol de fuego

526
01:00:29,132 --> 01:00:32,264
Fire tree.

527
01:00:32,594 --> 01:00:36,231
The fire tree cried when La Llorona | drowned her children.

528
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:39,462
That is the only witness to his sin.

529
01:00:39,693 --> 01:00:42,429
They have special powers against him.

530
01:01:00,759 --> 01:01:05,627
[speak spanish]

531
01:01:17,693 --> 01:01:19,594
What is that?

532
01:01:20,132 --> 01:01:22,264
Tears from La Llorona

533
01:01:22,264 --> 01:01:25,099
And Santo Pedro.

534
01:01:25,693 --> 01:01:29,297
Antidote.

535
01:01:52,099 --> 01:01:53,462
Do you have another ritual?

536
01:01:53,462 --> 01:01:56,297
Yes, breakfast for dinner.

537
01:01:57,495 --> 01:02:00,759
That's what David used to say, | breakfast for dinner.

538
01:02:01,429 --> 01:02:05,033
They started coding him, because | he could only make cereal.

539
01:02:05,033 --> 01:02:08,693
Tonight, Akumina for comfort.

540
01:02:08,693 --> 01:02:10,561
After everything you've experienced.

541
01:02:10,561 --> 01:02:12,726
The worst will arrive.

542
01:02:12,726 --> 01:02:15,033
You don't seem too sure.

543
01:02:15,033 --> 01:02:17,462
I believe in God.

544
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,462
How do you turn away from the church? / Church

545
01:02:22,132 --> 01:02:24,759
Yes. God.

546
01:02:24,759 --> 01:02:28,099
Never.

547
01:02:29,792 --> 01:02:31,561
Take the kids.

548
01:02:40,627 --> 01:02:42,759
Watch the fire.

549
01:02:44,198 --> 01:02:47,759
A stable fire tells us, the protective spell works.

550
01:02:47,759 --> 01:02:50,132
Will he come?

551
01:02:54,132 --> 01:02:55,561
He is here.

552
01:03:21,066 --> 01:03:25,000
What? What did he do? He searched.

553
01:03:25,594 --> 01:03:29,693
What for? / We.

554
01:04:50,792 --> 01:04:52,363
Mother!

555
01:04:52,792 --> 01:04:54,231
Mother?

556
01:04:57,693 --> 01:05:00,198
Calm down

557
01:05:08,495 --> 01:05:11,462
Help us.

558
01:06:38,726 --> 01:06:39,726
Sam!

559
01:06:41,198 --> 01:06:43,033
Sam! Help me!

560
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:46,297
Hold my hand!

561
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,264
Not!

562
01:07:32,363 --> 01:07:34,198
You told us they would be safe.

563
01:07:34,198 --> 01:07:38,066
You said the light would protect us. Not true. Mom.

564
01:07:38,066 --> 01:07:40,495
Misty is gone, I can't | find him. Not now.

565
01:07:40,495 --> 01:07:42,066
He let him get me.

566
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:45,033
What are you talking about?

567
01:07:47,528 --> 01:07:50,033
You use my son as bait?

568
01:07:50,297 --> 01:07:51,561
Of course not.

569
01:07:51,561 --> 01:07:54,495
You see what he did. I don't see.

570
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:57,462
You don't get him ... / But I'm there.

571
01:07:57,495 --> 01:07:59,792
Now La Llorona has come out of your house.

572
01:08:00,627 --> 01:08:04,264
What is that? / Remember the fire tree?

573
01:08:04,726 --> 01:08:07,330
That is the seed.

574
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:10,297
As long as this line does not break.

575
01:08:10,297 --> 01:08:13,099
He can't enter, | can't touch them.

576
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:17,231
La Llorona will do everything she can to get back into this house.

577
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:38,066
Fast! Get her hand now!

578
01:08:38,099 --> 01:08:39,363
He will enter!

579
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:43,759
Don't let him in! Go! / Go spirit!

580
01:08:44,132 --> 01:08:45,594
You have no business here!

581
01:08:46,264 --> 01:08:48,066
Get away from this building!

582
01:10:34,693 --> 01:10:38,264
Sam! Get away from that door!

583
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:41,792
Mother, I get Misty, | I don't damage the seeds.

584
01:10:52,627 --> 01:10:56,429
Sam! Sam! Sam!

585
01:10:56,429 --> 01:10:59,726
Sam!

586
01:11:00,462 --> 01:11:03,594
He will sink | him. Oh god, the pool.

587
01:11:12,297 --> 01:11:15,759
Sam!

588
01:12:00,594 --> 01:12:01,660
Mother!

589
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:15,660
[speak spanish]

590
01:12:15,726 --> 01:12:18,165
[speak spanish]

591
01:12:18,297 --> 01:12:21,066
[speak spanish]

592
01:12:21,396 --> 01:12:25,198
[speak spanish]

593
01:12:25,561 --> 01:12:26,693
Amen

594
01:13:04,099 --> 01:13:07,726
Is he okay? / He's good | just, he's breathing, he's fine.

595
01:13:26,528 --> 01:13:28,132
What are you doing?

596
01:13:29,726 --> 01:13:32,462
You are now filled with holy water.

597
01:13:32,594 --> 01:13:35,363
La Llorona has no choice but to leave.

598
01:13:41,528 --> 01:13:42,594
Thanks.

599
01:13:46,627 --> 01:13:48,066
Dear.

600
01:13:49,165 --> 01:13:52,198
Are you okay baby? Sam, Sam!

601
01:13:53,033 --> 01:13:54,594
Sam!

602
01:13:58,693 --> 01:14:00,561
What did he do?

603
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:08,297
Sam.

604
01:14:08,297 --> 01:14:10,165
Rafael.

605
01:14:13,033 --> 01:14:14,792
What is up with her?

606
01:14:17,693 --> 01:14:20,429
La Llorona has grabbed your daughter.

607
01:14:20,429 --> 01:14:23,759
When he calls him, he will leave.

608
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:27,099
When we destroy that spirit, his possessions will be broken.

609
01:14:27,099 --> 01:14:29,264
Until then, we have to keep him closed.

610
01:14:35,132 --> 01:14:37,033
Closed, what are you thinking?

611
01:14:37,033 --> 01:14:40,297
What? What are we doing?

612
01:14:57,759 --> 01:15:01,759
Do we have to? Yes, just | till sunrise.

613
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:04,726
Okay.

614
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:11,330
Sit down, Sam.

615
01:15:11,330 --> 01:15:13,363
Dear.

616
01:15:18,099 --> 01:15:19,495
You are very brave.

617
01:15:19,495 --> 01:15:22,000
Your father will be very proud of you.

618
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,561
The way you look after Sam, and me.

619
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:28,693
I want to tell you, it's okay to be afraid.

620
01:15:28,693 --> 01:15:31,726
Everyone is, sometimes, me too.

621
01:15:32,231 --> 01:15:34,000
Dad too.

622
01:15:34,231 --> 01:15:37,462
Rafael. No. / He's lying.

623
01:15:38,792 --> 01:15:40,330
I love you mom.

624
01:15:41,561 --> 01:15:45,066
Yes, I love you too son.

625
01:15:49,363 --> 01:15:51,264
I love you both.

626
01:16:00,099 --> 01:16:02,297
It's okay, ma'am, do it.

627
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:29,561
Where did you get that?

628
01:16:32,396 --> 01:16:36,099
This has him. - Has he? / Dileher him.

629
01:16:41,594 --> 01:16:43,462
Save.

630
01:16:44,363 --> 01:16:46,726
We might need it | to fight him.

631
01:18:10,693 --> 01:18:12,264
No! Children!

632
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:14,363
Crish!

633
01:18:14,495 --> 01:18:16,033
Mother!

634
01:18:19,726 --> 01:18:21,561
Patricia

635
01:18:22,396 --> 01:18:26,396
Patricia, please ... You take my baby from me.

636
01:18:26,396 --> 01:18:30,099
Don't do this. Give it back to me! Don't do this.

637
01:18:30,099 --> 01:18:32,066
Please, please put the gun down.

638
01:18:32,066 --> 01:18:36,330
Okay, we can talk about this, you and I can talk about this, Patricia, please

639
01:18:39,231 --> 01:18:43,264
Please, please bring them back to me.

640
01:18:43,264 --> 01:18:46,033
Return my children!

641
01:18:52,759 --> 01:18:54,627
Not.

642
01:18:55,627 --> 01:18:57,363
Mother!

643
01:18:58,165 --> 01:19:00,000
Mother!

644
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,198
Use this one.

645
01:19:21,198 --> 01:19:24,594
Chris, we all want to believe you.

646
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:40,066
Chris, please ... oh ...

647
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:43,099
He came, he came.

648
01:19:43,132 --> 01:19:47,528
I know. He tried to hurt me. I can.

649
01:19:47,528 --> 01:19:49,561
Go! Go! Go!

650
01:19:50,759 --> 01:19:53,594
Come on, quickly.

651
01:19:53,594 --> 01:19:56,297
Go up to the roof.

652
01:19:58,099 --> 01:20:01,099
He came.

653
01:20:09,363 --> 01:20:12,198
Take the lamp. This is him.

654
01:20:43,429 --> 01:20:45,033
Through this way.

655
01:20:46,627 --> 01:20:48,693
Follow me. You can't enter.

656
01:20:49,264 --> 01:20:50,759
Not.

657
01:20:54,429 --> 01:20:56,000
Oh no.

658
01:21:24,099 --> 01:21:25,759
My mischief.

659
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:31,396
They are not your children!

660
01:21:32,528 --> 01:21:34,528
Go!

661
01:21:34,528 --> 01:21:36,528
Help her!

662
01:22:37,297 --> 01:22:41,231
Let them go!

663
01:22:48,231 --> 01:22:49,231
Go.

664
01:22:51,759 --> 01:22:53,363
Chris!

665
01:22:53,363 --> 01:22:55,462
Sam!

666
01:23:18,396 --> 01:23:19,132
Children!

667
01:23:19,132 --> 01:23:22,495
On behalf of Christ! Get rid of evil creatures!

668
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,627
Not!

669
01:24:33,759 --> 01:24:36,066
Cistern!

670
01:25:14,198 --> 01:25:16,396
How can I repay you?

671
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:33,066
You two are very brave.

672
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:35,792
I even fear for a moment.

673
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:39,066
Really? / No.

674
01:25:39,594 --> 01:25:42,132
Not really.

675
01:25:55,726 --> 01:25:57,792
We look inside.
