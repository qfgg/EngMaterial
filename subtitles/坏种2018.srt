早餐就要好了 小甜熊

好的 爸爸
Ok, daddy.

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,900
我尝一点
I'm gonna steal one of these.

5
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,040
要多点鸡蛋吗
Want some more eggs?

6
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,970
不了 谢谢
No thanks.

7
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,510
埃利斯老师给我们看了今年的奖项

It's really big.

10
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,280
像奥运金牌那样
Like the Olympics.

11
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,310
真的吗
Really?

12
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,550
呃 也没那么大
Well, not that big.

13
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,320
但是也很大了
But it's pretty big.

14
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,620
我会拿下它的
I'm gonna win it.

15
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,720
我觉得你肯定会赢得它的
It wouldn't surprise me a bit if you did.

16
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,490
金牌颁给有圣奥尔登价值观的人
It's given to the person who exemplifies St. Alden's values.

18
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,260
如果你没赢得金牌
I just don't want you to be disappointed

19
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,760
你也不用沮丧
if you don't win it.

20
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,430
你什么时候再去约会
When are you having another date?

21
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,430
怎么了
Why?

22
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,140
你很在意这事吗
Does it bother you when I date?

23
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,500
没有 我怎么会在意呢
No, why would it bother me?

24
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,240
嘿
Hey.

25
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,240
嘿 安琪拉姑姑
Hey, Aunt Angela.

26
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,240
嘿
Hey.

27

嘿 小甜熊

我给你找了个妹子
I found your gal.

29
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,980
艾玛正和我聊我约会的事呢
Em and I were just talking about me dating.

30
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,580
不是约会 是找到新保姆了
Not a date, I found you a nanny.

31
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,850
那不是我的任务吗
Wasn't that the assignment?

32
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,220
我是说 新保姆
I- I mean, new babysitter.

33
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,420
我知道你不需要新保姆
I know you don't need a new nanny.

34
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,150
我也不需要临时保姆
I don't need a new babysitter, either.

35
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,850
太逊了
It's stupid.

36
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,120
她还在为莱薇娅难过
She's still upset about Miss Levia.

37
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,890
你应该照顾我 安琪拉姑姑
You should babysit me, Aunt Angela.

38
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,230
那是我的荣幸 我的女王
It would be an honour, my queen,

39
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,000
但我的病人可能会反对
but I think my patients might object.

40
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,400
别担心 艾玛
Don't worry, Em.

41
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,930
我会找一个你喜欢的保姆
I'm gonna find you someone you like.

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,370
哦 她还说这个学期会再拿个金牌
Oh, she also says she's gonna win another award this semester.

43
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,270
哦
Oh.

44
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,910
她真有干劲啊
She's got drive.

45
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,510
你该很兴奋吧
You should be thrilled.

46
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,080
是吗 艾玛
Right, Emma?

47
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,380
艾玛
Emma?

48
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,850
外面喷水池里有只死猫
There's a dead cat in the fountain.

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,870
别伤心
Don't be sad.

50
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,140
可能事发迅疾
It probably happened very fast.

51
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,970
我觉得它不会感到痛苦
I don't think it felt a thing.

52
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,770
啊 啊啊啊
Ah! Ahhh!!!

53
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,000
冷静 各位
Calm down, everyone.

54
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,270
我保证 它更加害怕你
I guarantee you it's more afraid of you than you are of it.

55
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,670
艾玛·格罗斯曼
Emma Grossman!

56
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,300
谢谢你 艾玛
Thank you, Emma.

57
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,170
不客气 埃利斯老师
You're welcome, Mrs. Ellis.

58
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,110
你怎么做到的
How did you do that?

59
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,380
我们家后院有个蜂窝
We have a nest in our back yard.

60
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,380
我爸爸说黄蜂只有受到威胁才会攻击
My dad says wasps only attack when they feel threatened.

61
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,410
这是它们的本能 麦洛
It's nature, Milo.

62
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,020
但愿你不会对尘土过敏
I hope you're not allergic to dust.

63
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,460
这里可能不是开会的好地方
This probably isn't the best place in the house

64
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,390
但是 我们开会的时间不多
to have a meeting but I'm on a deadline.

65
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,430
没事
No worries.

66
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,890
你什么工作都在这里做吗
Do you make everything here?

67
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,730
不 几乎都不会来这里
No, hardly anything anymore.

68
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,070
我有两个工厂 这里是刚刚创业的地方
I have two factories going but this is where it all began.

69
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,670
厉害
Cool.

70
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,540
那说说你吧
So tell me about you.

71
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,810
简历上说你是职业滑雪运动员
Your resume says you were a professional snowboarder.

72
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,480
对 直到我交叉韧带断了
Yep, right up until I blew out my ACL.

73
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,780
我不希望听到这个
I hate to hear that.

74
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,690
那样最好
It's for the best.

75
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:30,750
我深受打击 于是就试着做些安稳的工作
I still hit it hard, I just try to avoid the dangerous stuff.

76
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,250
也对
Sure.

77
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,790
那你做保姆有五年了
So you've been a nanny for five years?

78
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,960
是的
That's right.

79
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,990
看起来你挺喜欢这样
You seem to like it.

80
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,090
我喜欢孩子
I love kids.

81
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,860
没有别的 他们都很单纯
There's no BS. They're not complicated.

82
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,830
如果他们伤心了 就会哭
If they're sad, they cry.

83
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,090
倘若他们开心了 就会笑
If they're happy, they laugh.

84
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,260
惹人喜欢
It's refreshing.

85
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,900
那还有别的事我需要了解的吗
So is there anything else I need to know?

86
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,030
你的推荐人好像都很喜欢你
Your references all seem to love you.

87
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,330
烤奶酪是我的拿手
I make a mean grilled cheese.

88
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,240
你想知道秘密配方吗
You want to know the secret ingredients?

89
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,240
好啊
Sure.

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,140
腌菜和芥末
Pickles and mustard.

91
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,440
嘣 完成
Boom. Done.

92
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,480
那么 呃 你下周就开始工作吗
Well, uh... can you start next week?

93
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,010
艾玛就快放假了
Emma's about to begin her spring break.

94
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,610
当然 你想什么时候开始我就...
Sure. I can start whenever you need-

95
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,850
呃 格罗斯曼先生
Uh, Mr. Grossman?

96
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,080
这是昙花计划
Here are the steagle plans,

97
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,190
在五分钟后你会有一个关于材料的电话

98
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:09,690
谢谢
Thank you.

99
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,520
还有想说的吗
Is there anything else?

100
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,390
没有了
Nope.

101
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,400
你还有什么问题吗
Is there anything you want to ask me?

102
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,960
你女儿她性格怎么样
What's your daughter like?

103
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,200
艾玛她...做事很专心
Emma is... very focused.

104
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,640
虽然只是个小女孩 但她总是能专心做事
She's a normal little girl, but she can be very focused.

105
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,210
我都不知道如何形容了
I don't know how else to say it.

106
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,010
她很聪明 成绩全优 从没惹过麻烦
She's smart, straight A's, never gets into trouble...

107

我能和她见见面吗
Should I meet with her, too?

112
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,650
她在艾玛出生后就去世了
She died just after Emma was born.

113
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,420
我深表同情

但我不怎么戴
I don't really wear it.

123
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,690
小心点
Careful there!

124

128
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,300

Here, let me help you up.

129
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,740
对不起
I'm so sorry.

130
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,540

不用了 爸爸
We don't have to, daddy.

136

我知道你很忙
I know how busy you are.

137
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,380
如果我给你个拥抱 你会给我什么

147
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,460
谢谢
Thanks.

148
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,390
他一直盼望着这一天的到来呢
He has been counting down the days.

149
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,400
哦 可不是吗
Oh, tell me about it.

150
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,560
现在是颁奖时刻
And now, our final award.

151

152
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,470
每年我们都会颁给一位最有个性的
Every year we honour someone of character.

153
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,670
一位真正代表着
Someone who truly embodies the values

154
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,940
学校价值观的人
that this school was founded on.

155
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,740
今年我很荣幸将
This year I am proud to award

156
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,880
圣奥尔登奖章颁发给麦洛·柯蒂斯
the St. Alden's Citizenship Medallion to Milo Curtis.

157
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,460
你真棒
Good job.

158
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,300
给你 麦洛 你真棒
Here you go, Milo. Good job.

159
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,870
谢谢
Thanks!

160
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,850
哇
Wow!

161
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,650
很抱歉我错过了家长会
I'm sorry I missed your parent-teacher conference,

162
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,750
我在城里有个重要的工程
I had a big installation in the city.

163
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,150
别担心 我们可以改时间
No worries. We can reschedule.

164
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,350
艾玛表现得如何
How is Emma doing?

165
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,150
我并不想为难你
I mean, not to put you on the spot.

166
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,060
嗯
Right.

167
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,020
她挺好的
She's fine.

168
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,860
她 呃 我得说
She's um... I have to say,

169
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,590
我教书20年
I've never met anyone quite like her

170
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,160
从没见过像她这样的孩子
in my 20 years of teaching.

171
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,770
为什么听起来像是件坏事
Why does that sound like a bad thing?

172
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,600
不 我没有那个意思
No, I didn't mean that in any fashion at all.

173
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,200
艾玛她有很多优点
Emma's never had one mark against her

174
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,870
而且她还是班上的优等生
and she's one of our top students.

175
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,110
她都可以当班长了
She can be a real leader when she wants to be.

176
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,780
但是呢
But?

177
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,840
她活在自己独特的世界里
Emma lives in her own particular world

178
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,210
但是那世界不是像
and I'm sure it isn't anything like the world

179
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,750
你我活着的这个世界一样
that you and I live in.

180
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,650
我是说 她拥有许多对孩子来说
I mean, she has many remarkable qualities

181
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,420
非常优秀的卓越品质
that are great in a child.

182
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,650
她的勇气是最难得的
Her courage is most unusual.

183
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,490
她没有任何生理恐惧
She's almost without any physical fear.

184
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,830
而且必要时她能给人留下深刻的印象
And she really knows how to come across when she has to.

185
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,360
我打赌她能成为一名演员
She can be an actress, I bet.

186
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,400
算了吧 演员就算了
Please, not an actress.

187
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,200
好吧
Alright.

188
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,170
埃利斯老师
Mrs. Ellis.

189
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,000
噢 嗨 失陪了
Oh, hi. Excuse me.

190
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,600
好吧
Sure.

191
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,680
我真替你骄傲 小甜熊 我知道你很失望
I'm proud of you, honey bear. I know you're disappointed.

192
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,480
那奖牌本来应该属于我
That medal's mine. I deserve it.

193
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,180
麦洛甚至都不敢当着全班的面说话
Milo can't even talk in front of the class.

194
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,450
艾玛
Emma.

195
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,690
每个人都有他们的特长
Everybody has something special to offer.

196
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,320
麦洛是个好孩子
Milo's a good kid.

197
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,490
是吗
Yeah?

198
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,120
但他就是个糟糕的演讲者
Well, he's an awful public speaker.

199
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,160
他连拼写都不会
And he can't spell.

200
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,560
艾玛
Emma.

201
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,230
你说的对
You're right.

202
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,330
对不起
Sorry.

203
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,540
麦洛是我的朋友
Milo's my friend.

204
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,540
我很开心他赢得了奖牌
I'm really happy he got it.

205
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,980
被你说对了 这里简直太酷了
You're right, this place is cool!

206
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,930
我们应该回去了
We should go back now.

207
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,480
艾玛 你怎么了
Emma, what's wrong?

208
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,710
你想干嘛
What do you want?

209
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,650
你应该知道我要干嘛
I think you know.

210
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,800
一二三
One, two, three.

211
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,970
不错 我会发邮箱给你的
That's good, I'll email it to you.

212
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,140
嘿 爸 我们能回家了吗
Hey dad, can we get going?

213
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,140
当然
Sure.

214
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,410
你知道麦洛去哪了吗
Has anyone seen Milo?

215
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,280
我没看到他
I haven't seen him.

216
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,980
艾玛 你见到他了吗
Emma, have you seen him?

217
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,380
呃 之前看到他是在篝火那里
Um, the last place I saw him was by the bonfire.

218
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,180
救命啊 救命啊
Help! Help!

219
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,520
快点
Quickly!

220
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,510
哦 我的天哪
Oh my god!

221
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,510
麦洛 麦洛
MiloMilo?

222
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,180

223
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,350

Somebody do something!

224
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,950
打报警电话
Call 911!

225
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,320
麦洛
Milo!

226
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,990
醒醒 麦洛 醒醒
Come on, Milo. Come on.

227
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,760
麦洛
Milo?

228
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,430
快救救孩子
Somebody help us!

229
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,000
可怜的孩子
That poor kid.

230
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,700
在他们来抬走他之前
He was lying there on the rocks for hours

231
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,270
他在岩石上躺了几个小时
before they came and took him away.

232
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,340
太可怕了
It was horrible.

233
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,970
她还好吗
How is she?

234
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,180
她还好
She's ok.

235
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,010
她应该是受到惊吓了
I think she's in shock.

236
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,510
我们都被吓到了
I think we all are.

237
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,110
她在楼上看书
She's up in her room, reading.

238
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,250
这件事可能会成为她的阴影
I'm sure it'll hit her later.

239
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,650
嗯 但愿不会这样
Yes, I'm sure it will.

240
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,220
艾玛
Emma.

241
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,450
早上好 爸爸
Morning, dad.

242
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,920
早上好 亲爱的
Morning, hon.

243
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,220
你要麦片吗
Do you want some cereal?

244
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,860
还有剩的
There's just enough left.

245
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,790
不用了 谢谢
No, I'm ok, thanks.

246
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,530
你感觉怎么样
How are you feeling?

247
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,300
我很好
I'm alright.

248
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,230
希望今天不会下雨
I hope it doesn't rain today.

249
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,740
我是说昨天的事
I meant about yesterday.

250
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,570
你一定很难过吧
You must be pretty sad, right?

251
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,780
如果你想倾诉 我会听你说的
If you want to talk about it I'm here for you.

252
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,910
好啊
Ok.

253
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,080
你想和我谈谈吗
Do you need someone to talk to?

254
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,680
我不觉得有什么好谈的
I don't really think there's anything to talk about.

255
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,860
给她点时间 孩子的处理方法不同
Give her time. Kids process differently.

256
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,500
别让她为难
Don't make her feel self-conscious.

257
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,100
你可能是对的
You're probably right.

258
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,300
她就是很要强 知道吗
She's just so strong, you know?

259
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,970
我是说 她的老师都这么说
I mean, even her teachers were talking about it.

260
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:05,410
我只是希望她能花点时间...然后
I just hope that she can take some time and... feel.

261
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,150
瞧瞧是谁来了
Look who's here.

262
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,580
顺便说一句 干得好
Great job, by the way.

263
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,620
她看起来很不错
She seems perfect.

264
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,620
米勒说她和萨姆相处得很好
Miller said she was great with Sam.

265
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,190
我就是专业猎人
Professional head hunter, that's me.

266
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,590
你是想约我朋友利兹出去吗
Are you gonna finally take my friend Lizzy out?

267
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,890
哦老天 你真是没完没了啊
Oh my god, you are relentless.

268
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,330

269

嘿 你好
Hey there.

270
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
我的任务是什么
Let's get this party started.

271
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,340
这是洗衣机 这是干衣机
Washer, dryer, obviously.

272
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,070
哇 这里太棒了
Wow, this place is amazing.

273
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,240
谢谢
Thanks.

274
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,880
是艾玛出生前
It was a fixer-upper my wife and I bought

275
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,410
妻子和我买的旧房子
right before Emma was born.

276
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,980
这是你妻子吗
Was this your wife?

277
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,280
哦 没错
Oh, yeah.

278
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,950
那是某一年的圣诞贺卡
That was our Christmas card one year.

279
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,490
她来了
There she is.

280
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,550
艾玛 这是克洛伊
Emma, this is Chloe.

281

克洛伊 这是艾玛

282
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,990

很高兴见到你
It's very nice to meet you.

284
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,230
你的项链不错
I like your necklace.

285
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,200
你想看看我的奖牌吗
Do you want to see my medals?

286
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,200
我们得先参观完房子
We have to finish the tour first.

287
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,270
好了 这是紧急报警器
Anyway, emergency numbers here,

288

所有的钥匙都放在那个小地方

We have a couple upstairs in the bedrooms...

291
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,510
我想看电影
I wanna watch a movie.

292
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,140
风吹开了窗户
The wind was blowing a window open.

293
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,180
我关好窗就下来
I'll be down in a minute.

294
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:24,350
电视播出的影片为《百纳衣到华服》 由孩子们扮演大人

295
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,010
艾尔玛
Elmer!

296
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,680
奈儿
Nell!

297
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,290
看不懂 这太蠢了
I don't get it. This is stupid.

298
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,620
什么蠢
What's stupid?

299
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,600
秀兰·邓波儿
Shirley Temple.

300
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,630
她可是一名美国大使
The woman was a United States ambassador.

301
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,770
不敢想象她有多蠢
I can't imagine she was very stupid.

302
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,700
我是说电影
I meant the movie.

303
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,580
爸爸什么时候回来
When's my dad coming home?

304
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,810
快了
Soon.

305
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,680
他在开会
He has a meeting.

306
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,320
你会为那个溺水的孩子伤心吗
So are you sad about the kid that drowned?

307
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,420
我伤不伤心没什么关系
I don't think it matters if I'm sad.

308
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,890
反正他都死了
He's dead, anyway.

309
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,330
况且 爸爸说我看到他溺水的时候面无表情
Besides, my dad said you don't feel anything when you drown

310
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,430
那你真是无忧无虑 是吧
You're all warm and fuzzy, aren't you?

311
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,930
那你喜欢些什么
So what're you into?

312
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,900
音乐
Music?

313
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,870
骑马
Horses?

314
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,030
我都喜欢
I'm into everything.

315
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,300
你爸怎么样 有女朋友吗
What's the deal with your dadGot a girlfriend?

316
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,840
没有 怎么了
No. Why?

317
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,940
就问问 没什么大不了
Just asking, no biggie.

318
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,280
他有段时间交过一个
He had one for a while.

319
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,780
我不喜欢她
I didn't like her.

320
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,180
所以你爸甩了她吗
So he dumped her?

321
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,320
嗯
Yep.

322
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,760
你真是个让我捉摸不透的人啊
You're sorta something else, aren't you?

323
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,590
那你就是个小偷
And you're sort of a thief.

324
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,790
你在说什么
Excuse me?

325
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,260
而且还挺聪明
And you're smart.

326
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:45,600
我刚看见你从我爸爸卧室拿走了药
I saw you take the pills from my dad's bedroom.

327
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:50,140
但是又不足以让我爸爸注意到
But not enough for my dad to notice.

328
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,210
别担心 我不会说的
Don't worry, I won't tell.

329
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,450
我想我今晚就不用按时睡觉了
I think I'm gonna stay up past my bedtime tonight.

330
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:03,080
你现在去给我拿点冰淇淋
Now go and get me some ice cream.

331
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,480
你个小婊子
You little bitch.

332
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,130
顺便再给我拿点饼干
And bring me a couple of cookies while you're at it.

333
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,660
没事了
It's okay.

334
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,500
谢谢
Thank you.

335
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,630
我深表遗憾
I'm so sorry.

336
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,230
谢谢
Thank you.

337
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,940
感谢到来
Thanks for coming.

338
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,610
嘿 艾玛
Hi, Emma.

339
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,110
噢 别问我怎么样了
Oh, don't ask me how I am.

340
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,780
我不想骗你
I don't wanna lie to you.

341
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,450
仪式很棒
It was a beautiful service.

342
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,550
他也度过了他的最后一日
He had a good last day.

343
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,920
一个非常好的日子
A really good last day.

344
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,020
我是说 他以前从未赢过什么
I mean, he has never won anything before

345
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,960
而他对那奖牌感到特别骄傲
and he was so proud of that medal.

346
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,390
我只想知道那奖牌哪里去了
I just wish I knew where it was.

347
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,000
你没有拿到奖牌吗
You don't have the medal?

348
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,700
呃 可能是沉入海底了吧
Well, I think maybe it sunk to the bottom.

349
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,000
我能为你做些什么吗
Is there anything I can do for you?

350
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,770
我想要一些他那天的照片
If you have any pictures of that day I'd like them.

351
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,370
一些他开心的照片
Pictures of him playing, happy.

352
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,040
这算最好的帮助了
It really does help.

353
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,620
爸爸
Dad?

354
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,420
你在我房间干什么
What're you doing in my room?

355
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,520
就收拾一下
Just picking up a little.

356
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,890
但这里很整齐
It is picked up.

357
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,990
一直都很整齐
It's always picked up.

358
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,870
还有事吗
Anything else?

359
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,600
没了
No.

360
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:16,640
埃利斯老师
Miss Ellis.

361
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,980
很高兴见到你
It's nice to meet you.

362
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,580
相信我 我们建校95年来
Believe me, nothing like this has ever happened

363
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,510
从未发生过这种事
in our 95-year history

364
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,350
而我们调用了手头上的一切资源
and we're using every resource we have

365
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,450
确保这种事不会再发生
to make sure that it never happens again.

366
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,950
但是有些法律问题我们必须处理下
But there is a legal issue that we have to contend with.

367
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,260
请便
Sure.

368
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,620
我们联系了所有的家长
We're reaching out to all the parents to gather

369
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,860
收集一切能收集到的情报
whatever information we can.

370
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,860
呃 好吧 我 我听不太懂
Well, ok, I- I don't really understand.

371
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,860
所以这是保险之类的 还是...
So this is an insurance thing, or...?

372
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,230
没错 那是其中之一
That's one component, yes.

373
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,100
那么 究竟发生了什么
Well, what did happen?

374
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,800
也没人和大家说具体情况
No one's given anybody an update.

375
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,240
麦洛怎么摔下悬崖的
How did Milo fall off that cliff?

376
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,810
这就是我们想弄清楚的
That's what we're gonna find out.

377
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,810
有警察介入吗
Are the police involved?

378
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,310
我们无权透露
We're not at liberty to share that.

379
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,650
显然 如果警察介入调查时
Obviously, if and when the authorities are involved,

380
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,420
有些家庭可能会不得安宁
we may share that information with the families.

381
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,780
有些家庭
Some families.

382
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,490
抱歉 你们是不是有什么瞒着我
Excuse me, but is there something you're not telling me?

383
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,050
请别误会
Please don't misunderstand.

384
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,420
我们只是想得到事情的真相
We're just trying to get to the facts.

385
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,930
但是我们必须知道艾玛听见或看见了什么
But if Emma heard or saw something, we need to know.

386
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,660
那男孩不会游泳 他还怕水
That boy couldn't swim and he was afraid of water.

387
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,800
他为什么要去海岸岩壁上面
Why was he out on the rocks?

388
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,330
你个小混球
You little shit.

389
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,770
艾玛是最后一个见过那男孩的
Any information would be helpful

390
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,640
她知道的消息对我们有很大帮助
as it seems Emma was the last to see the boy.

391
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,710
你说什么
I'm sorry?

392
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,380
至少有三个人看见她在岩壁边
At least three people saw her near the rock face.

393
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,280
现在 我们不是在说艾玛做了错事
Now, we're not saying Emma did anything wrong

394
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,710
呃 我希望没有
Well, I should hope not.

395
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,780
听着 我会注意你说的话
Listen, I'd be very careful what you insinuate.

396
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:33,890
艾玛
Emma?

397
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:34,990
艾玛
Emma?!

398
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,020
艾玛
Emma!

399
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,990
怎么了
What happened?

400
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,030
你还好吗
Are you ok?

401
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,430
我们先走了
We'll show ourselves out.

402
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,930
好 好的
Yeah, sure.

403
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,100
好了
Ok.

404
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,300
让我看看你的手
Let me see this arm.

405
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,400
看看
Let's see it.

406
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,970
好了 我给你清理清理
Alright, let's get you cleaned up.

407
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,470
好了
Ok?

408
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,100
很庆幸你没有刮得很严重 小甜熊
You are lucky you didn't cut yourself worse, honey bear.

409
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,540
对不起 爸爸
I'm sorry, daddy.

410
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,510
没事的
It's ok.

411
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,380
意外经常发生
Accidents happen.

412
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,650
你知道埃利斯老师来了吗
Do you know why Mrs. Ellis was here?

413
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,550
是来问麦洛的事吧
It was about Milo I bet.

414
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,790
告诉我那一天你到底发生了什么
Is there anything you wanna tell me about that day?

415
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,720
什么都行
Anything at all?

416
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,460
没有
Nope.

417
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,790
你确定
You're sure?

418
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,360
你从未去过岩壁那 对吧
You weren't ever out on that rock face, were you?

419
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,930
没有
No.

420
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,900
埃利斯老师说你有
Mrs. Ellis says you were.

421
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,340
她撒谎
She's lying.

422
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:27,270
亲爱的 埃利斯老师为什么要撒谎呢
Honey, why would Mrs. Ellis lie?

423
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:31,010
因为她讨厌我
Because she hates me.

424
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,480
她一直都不喜欢我
She never liked me.

425
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,720
我不知道为什么
I don't know why.

426
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,650
她为什么要那么说
Why would she say that?

427
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,020
我 我不知道发生了什么
I- I don't know what's going on,

428
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:43,220
我只...我只是担心你
I'm just... just worried about you.

429
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,160
对不起 爸爸
I'm sorry, daddy.

430
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,430
我不是有意的
I don't mean to get upset.

431
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,730
我只是因为麦洛而伤心
I'm just sad about Milo.

432
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,240
想让我给你讲故事吗
Want me to read to you?

433
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,270
我没有那心情
I'm not really in the mood.

434
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,770
好吧
Ok.

435
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,280
爸爸
Daddy?

436
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,710
给你一个吻 你会给我什么
What would you give me for a basket of kisses?

437
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,650
一个拥抱
A basket of hugs.

438
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,110
嗨
Hi.

439
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,010
抱歉 我只是想来看看艾玛
Sorry, I was just checking on you and Emma.

440
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,480
还有牛奶喝完了
And we're out of milk.

441
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,200
嘿
Hey.

442
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,270
呃 很抱歉
Um, I'm sorry.

443
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,740
昨晚我不是有意吓你的
I didn't mean to startle you last night.

444
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,070
我本来可以写个购物清单的
I probably could have waited to do the market list.

445
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,210
嗯
Yeah.

446
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,210
有事吗
So what's up?

447
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,110
不介意的话 我可以在这里抽烟吗
Um, hey, do you mind if I, like, smoke in here?

448
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:53,150
我不能在艾玛身边抽 在这里应该可以吧
I would never do it around Emma but out here I thought maybe?

449
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,450
你看见墙上的东西了吗
Can you see everything against that wall?

450
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,990
都是易燃品
It's all flammable.

451
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,520
所以不可以 这里不是抽烟的最佳地点
So no, I don't think this is the best place for a smoking area.

452
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,560
好 知道了
Ah. Got it.

453
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,790
还有其它事吗
So how can I help ya?

454
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,400
艾玛的伤口好了
Emma's arm seems good.

455
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,900
抱歉 我本来应该看住她的
I'm sorry, I should have been paying closer attention to her.

456
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,970
原本还和她在一起
I was with her one minute

457
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:10,000
我一转身她就不见了
and when I turned around she was gone.

458
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,370
是的
Yeah.

459
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,670
我知道 这些事难免的
I understand, stuff happens.

460
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,370
就是这样
Stuff happens.

461
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,110
没错 确实
Hell yeah, it does.

462
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:24,620
那么 你和艾玛相处得怎么样
So let me ask you, how are things with you and Emma?

463
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,580
一切都好吗
Everything ok?

464
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,520
哦 她很棒
Oh, she's great.

465
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,920
很酷的孩子
Such a cool kid.

466
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,190
那就好
That's good to hear.

467
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:32,890
她特别...幽默、聪明
She's so... fun and smart.

468
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,530
很有趣
And funny.

469
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,300
艾玛和有趣可不能相提并论
I never would have thought of Emma as funny.

470
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,000
这不是简单的有趣
Oh, not in a weird way.

471
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,030
她有趣在...
She's funny like...

472
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,230
不清楚 就是与众不同
I don't know, like different.

473
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,640
好的方面
In a good way.

474
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,240
和她同龄女孩都很无聊
Most girls her age are pretty lame.

475
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,110
到处是紫色紧身裤和公主海报
Purple leggings and princess posters everywhere,

476
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:52,640
但艾玛就像个淑女 知道吗
but Emma is like... a lady, you know?

477
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,210
那当然
I do know.

478
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,680
我刚才看了你妻子的一些照片
Oh, I was looking at more pictures of your wife.

479
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,450
她身材真火辣
She was pretty hot.

480
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,290
对 没错
Yes, she was.

481
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,790
谢谢夸奖
Thank you.

482
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:10,760
得赶走这些黄蜂了
Gotta get rid of these wasps.

483
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,560
那我得回去看看艾玛了
Well, I better get back to Emma.

484
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,100
她想开滑板车
She wants to go on the scooter.

485
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
挺好
Great.

486
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:18,370
总之 我很喜欢这份工作
Anyway, I love my job here.

487
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,540
我只想让你知道
I just wanted you to know.

488
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,880
谢谢 这么说我很高兴
Thank you, I appreciate that.

489
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,540
艾玛也是这么想的
I'm sure Emma does, as well.

490
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,140
是的
Yeah.

491
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,180
我们相处的很好
We love each other.

492
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,190
你爸觉得你惹出大麻烦了 小卷毛
Your dad thinks you have major issues, Curly Sue.

493
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,360
你什么意思
What do you mean?

494
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,490
他知道那件事了
He knows what's up.

495
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,190
他在拷问我关于你的事
He was grilling me about you.

496
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,330
他问了什么
What'd he ask?

497
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,100
你很在意吗
Wouldn't you like to know?

498
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,860
别担心 我当着他的面夸你呢
Don't worry, I told him how great you are.

499
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,330
我挺你 小妹
I got you, girl.

500
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,370
别惹我就行
Just don't mess with me.

501
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,170
为什么老师会来麦洛家
Why is Mrs. Ellis at Milo's?

502
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,810
你不会是害怕了吧
You must be shitting bricks.

503
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:57,940
恶心
Gross.

504
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,440
你为什么要那样说
Why would you say something like that?

505
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,110
因为他们在调查你 宝贝
'Cause they're closing in on you now, babe.

506
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,750
来搜寻证据
Building their case.

507
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,580
你什么意思
What do you mean?

508
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,080
总有一天警察会介入调查
One day the police will get involved

509
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,050
然后就会拷问是不是你害了麦洛
and you'll have to come clean about what you did to Milo.

510
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,390
我才没有害麦洛
I didn't do anything to Milo.

511
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,760
你当然没有
Sure you didn't.

512
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,390
总之 等着瞧吧
Anyway, you'll see.

513
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,860
你还是先把谎话编好
You better get your story straight

514
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,600
不然你就会被抓走
or you're gonna get busted.

515
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,420
这要是我 也会害怕的
Yeah, I would be worried too if I were you.

516
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,550
我才没害怕呢
I'm not worried about anything.

517
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:37,120
你只是太婊了
You're just being a bitch.

518
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,450
听着
Look,

519
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,450
我不知道你岩壁边对麦洛做了什么
I don't know what you did to that kid on the rocks

520
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,120
但这肯定不是什么好事
but I know it wasn't good,

521
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,960
我知道你对他们都说谎了
and I know you're lying to everybody.

522
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,530
而你在爸爸房间偷东西
And you stole from my dad's room.

523
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,090
哇 我想我们都有不可告人的秘密了
Well I guess we both have secrets to keep for each other,

524
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,260
对吧
don't we?

525
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,360
我爸爸说有秘密不好
My dad says it's not good to keep secrets.

526
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:57,040
必须得实话实说
If you see something you should tell.

527
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,400
你是在威胁我吗 小甜熊
Are you threatening me, honey bear?

528
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,340
知道他们怎么对待进监狱的孩子吗
Do you know what they do to kids that go to jail?

529
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,350
不想知道
Not really.

530
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,750
如果是偷了东西或者伤害了别人
Well, if it's something like stealing or hurting someone

531
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,620
你会被送进医院 那里的孩子很可怕
you get sent to a hospital where kids yell

532
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,450
会尖叫 还会自残
and scream and cut themselves.

533
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,620
你永远也出不来
You never get out.

534
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,590
但是如果你闯了大祸
But if it's something really bad,

535
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:23,500
比如把人...杀死
like maybe if someone... dies,

536
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,730
你就会被送上电椅
you get sent to the electric chair.

537
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,970
你傻了吧
You're silly.

538
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,300
他们才不会把孩子送上电椅
Nobody would put a kid in the electric chair.

539
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,700
他们当然会
Sure they do.

540
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,870
知道他们把你送上电椅会干什么吗
Do you know what happens in the electric chair?

541
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,140
会烤了你
It cooks you.

542
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,440
你皮肤会噼啪响然后萎缩
Your skin crackles and shrivels

543
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,750
就像早上烤培根
like when we make bacon in the morning.

544
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,480
我才不信你
I don't believe you.

545
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,220
小孩都坐不上那么大的椅子
A kid wouldn't even fit in that big chair.

546
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,750
他们有专门给小孩的电椅
They have a special one for kids.

547
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,180
甚至还刷上粉色 下面还放着
It's even painted pink and they put pee-pee pads underneath

548
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,890
当你吓尿时用的尿垫
for when you piss yourself.

549
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,760
天呐 你真恶心
God, you're disgusting.

550
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,560
网上搜
Google it.

551
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,240
艾玛
Emma?

552
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,380
艾玛
Em?

553
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,680
艾玛
Emma?

554
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,850
艾玛 你在外面吗
Emma, are you out there?

555
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,820
艾玛
Emma?

556
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,370
有人吗
Hello?

557
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,070
她在这里啊
There she is.

558
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,300
你今天过得有趣吗
How was your dayYou do anything fun?

559
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:25,800
呃 我不确定有不有趣
Well, I don't know if it was fun exactly,

560
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,840
但过得不错
but I had a good day.

561
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,880
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

562
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,120
哦 没什么
Oh, nothing.

563
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,220
你手上拿着什么
What's in your hand?

564
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,260
没什么
Nothing.

565
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,420
哦 艾玛
Oh, Emma.

566
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,020
这是哪来的
Where did this com from?

567
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,020
艾玛
Emma?

568
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,560
麦洛的奖牌怎么会在我们家
How did Milo's medal get into this house?

569
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,230
我...我不知道
I... I don't know.

570
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,630
你在哪里找到的
Where did you find it?

571
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,860
就藏在床底下
It was hidden under the bed.

572
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,000
我打扫的时候找到的
I found it cleaning.

573
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,070
谢谢 克洛伊
Thank you, Chloe.

574
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,170
我想和艾玛单独谈谈
I need to talk to Emma alone.

575
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,040
那请便
Sure thing.

576
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,510
艾玛
Emma?

577
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,680
麦洛的奖牌为什么会在你的床下
How did Milo Curtis's medal get under your bed?

578
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,920
我不知道它就在我床下
I don't know how it got there.

579
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:26,560
我怎么知道为什么在我床下
How should I know how it got there?

580
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:31,160
你是不是什么时候去了岩壁那...
Were you ever, at any time, out on that rock face?

581
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,530
有 爸爸
Yes, daddy.

582
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,000
我去过那里
I went there once.

583
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:41,510
那埃利斯老师是不是并没有说谎
So Mrs. Ellis wasn't lying when she said you were there.

584
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,840
她应该没说谎
I guess she wasn't lying.

585
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:46,380
应该 爸爸
Yes, daddy.

586
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,050
是不是和麦洛在一起
Were you with Milo?

587
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:52,780
待了一会
For a minute.

588
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,320
然后发生了什么
And what happened?

589
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,230
艾玛
Emma!

590
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,330
这事很严重 我不知道真相的话
This is very serious and I can't help you

591
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,670
我就帮不了你
if I don't know the truth.

592
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,270
麦洛和我玩了一个游戏
Milo and I were playing a game we made up.

593
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:19,140
类似于夺旗游戏
It was kinda like Capture the Flag,

594
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,550
只是用他的奖牌当旗子
but with his medal instead.

595
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:26,150
我赢了 所以他给我戴了一下奖牌
I won, so Milo gave me his medal to wear.

596
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:29,220
所以他是在岩壁外给你的奖牌吗
So he gave you the medal out on the rock?

597
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,460
不
No.

598
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,390
我之后拿的
I got it later on.

599
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,590
然后我就不知道麦洛去哪了
I don't know where Milo went after that.

600
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,670
艾玛
Emma.

601
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,370
你知道柯蒂斯女士一直在找这个
Do you know that Mrs. Curtis has been looking for this?

602
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,440
她想把奖牌和麦洛一起安葬
She wanted to bury Milo with it.

603
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,010
这太蠢了
That's stupid.

604
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,980
麦洛才不会知道有没有埋下奖牌
Milo wouldn't even know if he was buried with it or not.

605
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,390
爸爸
Daddy?

606
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,050
怎么了
What's wrong?

607
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,920
你去哪里
Where are you going?

608
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,890
我只想透透气
I just need some air.

609
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,230
嘿 安琪 是我
Hey, Ange, it's me.

610
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,400
听着 我需要一个
Listen, I need the name

611
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:20,140
给艾玛看病的精神科医生
of a good child psychiatrist for Emma.

612
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,440
并不是急事
It's nothing urgent,

613
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,270
我只是想让她找个人倾诉一下
I just think that she needs someone to talk to.

614
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,140
我这有个不错的人选
Ok. I have the perfect person.

615
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,780
太棒了
Oh, ok.

616
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:28,850
好 谢谢了
Good, thanks.

617
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,420
那我等会再打给你
Um, I'll call you back.

618
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,320
二位先生和女士
Mr. and Mrs. Grossman,

619
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,250
你们的女儿有点问题
there's something wrong with your daughter.

620
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,920
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

621
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,080
好像有东西在喷水池那
I think I saw something in the fountain.

622
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,390
谁干的
Who did this?

623
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:56,070
觉得自己小有成就 对吧
Pretty happy with yourself, aren't ya?

624
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,340
你什么意思
What do you mean?

625
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,940
你知道我什么意思
You know exactly what I mean.

626
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,070
不 我真听不懂
Nope, I really don't.

627
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:05,710
是说我把麦洛的奖牌藏在你爸房间吗
Oh, you mean I shit-boxed you with Milo's medal?

628
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,910
你真恶心
You're so gross.

629
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,450
吃你的鸡蛋
Eat your eggs.

630
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,080
真为你感到遗憾
I feel bad for you.

631
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,450
是我的话我才不想去
I wouldn't wanna go do this.

632
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,090
我也不想去
And I don't want to.

633
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,050
是我我就什么都不说
I wouldn't say anything.

634
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,860
这件事你不会有好下场的
Nothing good can come of this for you.

635
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,790
我忘了我是在和谁说话了
I forgot who I was dealing with.

636
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,460
你会没事的
You'll be just fine.

637
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,500
你个小贱人
You little psycho.

638
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,400
艾玛
Emma?

639
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,130
我们该走了
We have to go.

640
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,310
很高兴见到你 艾玛
It's good to see you, Emma.

641
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:36,440
我每次见到麦洛就会让我想起
Any time I see one of Milo's classmates it reminds me

642
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:41,180
他有多少朋友还有他是多好的孩子
of how many friends he had and what a good person he was.

643
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,910
你假期过得怎么样
How's your school break going?

644
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,550
还行 谢谢
Fine, thank you.

645
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:49,490
柯蒂斯女士 我们有东西想给你
Mrs. Curtis, we have something that we wanna give to you.

646
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,600
你哪里弄来的
Where did you find that?

647
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:05,940
是麦洛让艾玛戴了一会儿
Apparently Milo let Emma wear it for a while and...

648
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:12,510
然后 看他没回来 她就留着了
and then, when he... didn't come back she kept it.

649
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,280
她现在知道错了 她会道歉的
She knows it was wrong and she wants to apologize,

650
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,750
对吧 艾玛
isn't that right, Emma?

651
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,480
是的
That's right.

652
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:18,780
我很抱歉
I'm very sorry.

653
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:22,190
我不该留着的
I shouldn't have kept it.

654
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:23,420
我不明白
I don't understand.

655
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,320
为什么麦洛会给你戴
Milo gave it to you to wearWhy?

656
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,920
就是个游戏
It was a game.

657
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:31,330
我正准备还给他 他却...
I was gonna give it back, but he...

658
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,500
我再也没见到他
I never saw him again.

659
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:40,740
呃 我不知道该说什么了
Well, I don't know what to say.

660
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,440
很高兴你把它带给了我
I'm glad you brought it back to me.

661
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,180
我这一整天...
This whole day is...

662
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,520
都为埃利斯老师的事惶恐不安
I'm still in shock about Mrs. Ellis.

663
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,790
你说什么
I'm sorry?

664
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,890
她去世了
She's dead.

665
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,920
她在格伦瓦尔大道出了车祸
She rolled her car on Glenvale Avenue

666
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:03,030
在这之前还在这里谈麦洛的事
and she was just here talking about Milo.

667
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,400
我 我不知道
I- I didn't know.

668
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:08,030
我深感遗憾 爸爸
I'm really sad, daddy.

669
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:13,200
埃利斯老师是我最爱的老师
Mrs. Ellis was my favourite teacher.

670
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,670
她是怎么出车祸的
Do we know how it happened?

671
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:18,580
电视上说她车上有黄蜂窝
On the TV it said there was a wasp's nest in her car.

672
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:21,050
她被黄蜂给蛰了 然后才出的车祸
It was a science project or something and she was stung.

673
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:23,210
我也不明白黄蜂窝为什么会在她车上
I don't know, it doesn't make any sense to me.

674
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,020
爸爸 我不太舒服
Daddy, I'm not feeling well.

675
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,450
能回家了吗
Can we go home?

676
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:27,690
当然
Sure.

677
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,960
所以我们现在不用再提
So now we don't have to talk about Milo

678
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,790
麦洛了 对吧
ever again, right?

679
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,460
那我得快点了 爸爸
I'm gonna run, daddy.

680
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,730
克洛伊今天要和我做纸杯蛋糕
Chloe and I are baking cupcakes today.

681
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,280

00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:16,960
包 括 精 神 病

732
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,790
包 括 精 神 病

733
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,510
嘿
Hey.

734
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,010
我们马上就要去医生那里了
We gotta leave soon for our doctor's appointment.

735
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,180
我快好了
I'll be ready.

736
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,720
爸爸 我在想 你说得对
Daddy, I was thinking, you're right.

737
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:36,220
我想这对我来说会有好处的
I think something good will come of this.

738
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,960
我也希望
I hope so.

739
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:55,810
艾玛 我给准备了一些你喜欢的东西
Emma, I have some magazines on the table you might like

740
00:46:52,970 --> 00:47:08,000
马奇医生的扮演者 帕特里夏·麦科马克 曾扮演过1956年版《坏种》小女主

741
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,110
桌上有杂志
while you wait.

742
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,210
可以的话 我得先和你爸爸
I'm just gonna have a little chat with your dad,

743
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:00,610
谈一会
if that's ok.

744
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,650
当然可以 马奇医生
Yeah, of course, Dr. March.

745
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,760
那么
So.

746
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:16,030
需要我帮你们什么
How can I help you and Emma?

747
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,530
我不知道
I don't know.

748
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:18,830
呃...
Um...

749
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,970
关于你女儿 你觉得哪里最烦恼
Well, what is your primary concern?

750
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,870
艾玛从小就与众不同
Emma has always been different.

751
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:34,380
很大部分是好的那种不同 但是同时
Very, very much in a good way, but also...

752
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,820
会有一股...冷漠
there's a... coldness.

753
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,620
我不知道如何形容
I don't know how to say it.

754
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,920
呃 缺乏感情
Um, a lack of emotion.

755
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,620
我是说 她有感情 但是 呃
I mean, she has emotions, but uh,

756
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:47,560
她会笑会哭什么的
she laughs and cries and all that,

757
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,460
但是会 呃...
but it can be um...

758
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:55,430
我不清楚
I don't know.

759
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:01,370
她对我撒谎 让我有点不相信她
She's lying to me and I don't trust her anymore.

760
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,010
对于她这么大的孩子来说撒谎是常见的
Well, it's very common for children her age to lie.

761
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,810
大多数孩子会与内心情感作斗争
Most kids struggle with their emotions.

762
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:14,120
通常情况下 他们都不知道该如何
They very often don't know how or what they should be feeling

763
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,790
展露自己的情绪
at any point in time.

764
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,830
对于家长负担是挺大的
It can be very taxing on a parent.

765
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:23,930
很多人都认为事情的严重性
Mr. Grossman, everyone thinks their issues

766
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,960
比实际意义上的更大
are bigger than they are.

767
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:27,830
更独特
More unique.

768
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,770
但还是会有罕见情况
Obviously there are the rare cases,

769
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:36,540
我也曾见过一种心理疾病
and I've had them, of real psychological illness.

770
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,150
总之 我很期待和艾玛谈话
Anyway, I'm looking forward to talking to Emma.

771
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:55,830
那么 我不是那种给人做手术
So, I'm not that kind of doctor who operates on people

772
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:58,200
之类的医生 我是那种...
or things like that, I'm what's called-

773
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,330
你是心理医生
You're a shrink.

774
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:03,070
哇 原来你知道啊
Well, you know that term.

775
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:05,670
我看过《介入》
I watch Intervention.

776
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,010
哦 好吧
Oh, yes.

777
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:12,280
那么 我是精神科医生 这是个名词 就是帮助...
Well, I'm a psychiatrist, which is a fancy word for someone

778
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:15,980
那些有心理疾病的病人
to talk to who can help you sort things out.

779
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:19,350
我没有什么心理疾病
I don't really need anything sorted out.

780
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,420
真的吗
Really?

781
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:23,620
为什么没有呢
Well, why is that?

782
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:27,490
我是说 大多数人都会有的
I mean, most people have something that they would like

783
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,830
每个人的都不一样
to be different.

784
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:31,730
我没有
I don't.

785
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:34,530
啊 我懂了
Ah, I see.

786
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:41,340
我理解你对麦洛的悲痛
I understand that your friend Milo recently passed away.

787
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,110
说得没错
That's right.

788
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,180
你对这件事的感受如何
How did that make you feel?

789
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,680
我肯定你很难受吧
Pretty sad, I bet.

790
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:56,390
我哭了两天
I cried for two days.

791
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:58,520
哦
Oh.

792
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:01,730
我理解你
I understand.

793
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:06,030
这是你第一次看到认识的人去世吗
Was that the first time someone you knew died?

794
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,570
不是
No.

795
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,710
哦
Oh.

796
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:20,040
明白了
I see.

797
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,750
马奇医生
Dr. March?

798
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,820
为什么人去世时 他身边的人会伤心呢
Why do people get so upset when people die?

799
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:29,150
这事迟早会发生在每个人身上啊
It's gonna happen to everyone sooner or later.

800
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,460
问得好 艾玛
It's a great question, Emma.

801
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:36,090
我们知道这事不可逆 但依旧会很痛心
We all do know it's inevitable and we grieve anyway.

802
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,830
为他而感到同情
To feel or to have empathy for others

803
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:43,730
这是我们人的本性
is what it means to be human.

804
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:59,450
艾玛 我要告诉你个秘密
Emma, I'm going to tell you a secret.

805
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,450
我像你那么大的时候我也这么做过
I did the exact same things as you when I was your age.

806
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:11,060
你们俩看起来挺融洽嘛
Well, you two seemed to really hit it off.

807
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:13,600
我们谈的很畅快 是吧 艾玛
Oh, we had a great talk, didn't we, Emma?

808
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,070
当然
Yes.

809
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:16,470
爸爸 我能出去玩会吗
Daddy, can I go outside?

810
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:17,740
当然
Sure.

811
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,870
格罗斯曼先生 我在职业生涯里见过
Mr. Grossman, I have seen thousands of kids

812
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:23,510
许多孩子
in my practise,

813
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:27,750
艾玛是我遇到的最正常的孩子
and Emma seems 100 percent perfectly average.

814
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:33,820
实际上 和她聊天让我想起了小时候
In fact, I told her she reminds me of myself.

815
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,850
你好
Hey there.

816
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,050
嘿
Hey.

817
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,390
检查得怎么样
How'd the appointment go?

818
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,420
很好
Fine.

819
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,800
艾玛在楼上
Emma's up in her room.

820
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:21,100
那么 我得穿上衣服
Well, I guess I better put on some clothes,

821
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,870
上去看看了
head up there.

822
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,540
希望你不会介意我趁机晒晒太阳
I hope you don't mind me taking advantage of the sun.

823
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:28,970
不 你得抓紧时间好好享受
No, you... gotta take advantage of it.

824
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:33,180
确实得抓紧时间
Gotta take advantage.

825
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,810
没错
Yep.

826
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:47,630
你没有朋友吗
Don't you have any friends?

827
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:49,760
关你什么事
What do you care?

828
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:51,700
显然大家都认为你有精神病
Clearly everyone thinks you're mental.

829
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,160
随你怎么说
Whatever, Chloe.

830
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:54,670
现在大家都知道
Now that everyone knows

831
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:58,170
你偷了那孩子的奖牌 只是时间问题
you stole that dead kid's medal it's just a matter of time.

832
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:00,270
什么时间问题
A matter of time until what?

833
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,110
调查出你对他做了什么
They find out what you did to him.

834
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:04,310
我听不懂你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

835
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,380
也许你马上就会被送上电椅了
Maybe you'll end up in the little pink chair.

836
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,150
我马上让爸爸赶走你
I'm gonna have my dad get rid of you.

837
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:12,250
去啊
Go for it.

838
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,550
他可不会听你的
He won't do it.

839
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:18,760
你爸爸看上我了
Your dad and I understand each other.

840
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,390
随便你怎么像疯子一样盯着我
You can give me that psycho stare all you want

841
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,830
但告诉你个事实 你爸是个痴男
but the fact is this: your dad's a DILF.

842
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:25,760
我要定他了 懂吗
D-I-L-F, ok?

843
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:29,130
他还是单身 他刚才还在打量我身材呢
And he's single, and he was totally just scoping me out.

844
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,270
他和我搞在一起 你不介意吧
You wouldn't mind if he and I hooked up, would you?

845
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,970
可怜的小家伙 放松点
The poor guy needs a release.

846
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:36,410
我是说 他真不错
I mean, just look at him.

847
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:39,380
离我爸爸远点
Stay away from my dad.

848
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:44,750
不然呢
Or what?

849
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:47,120
我不能做你的继母吗
Wouldn't I make a good stepmom?

850
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,460
你吓不到我的 小不点
You don't scare me, little girl.

851
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,290
我不管 你就只是站在一边
I don't care if you stood there

852
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:55,590
看着那小孩子淹死
and watched that little kid drown,

853
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,360
还是你把他推下去的
or even if you pushed him in.

854
00:53:57,430 --> 00:54:00,300
在我那 就你这种宠坏的小贱种
Where I come from a spoiled little princess like you

855
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,740
就算是个屁 相信我
ain't nothing, believe me.

856
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,840
威胁别人可不好
It's not nice to threaten people.

857
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,610
但我在你眼里
But you and me?

858
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:13,410
也不算什么好人 对吧
We're not nice, are we?

859
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,430
噢 艾玛 你吓到我了
Oh, Emma, you scared me.

860
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,740
你喜欢克洛伊吗
Do you like Chloe?

861
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,600
等等 什么
Wait, what?

862
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:42,510
她说你喜欢她
She said that you like her.

863
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:47,180
说你 看上她了
That you... understand each other.

864
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,410
她还说她想做我的继母
She said she could be my stepmother some day.

865
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,450
哇 哇 哇
Woah, woah, woah.

866
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:51,620
等等 让我缓缓
Wait, hold on a second.

867
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,120
首先 这件事绝不可能
First of all, that would never happen,

868
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,920
其次 她为什么要这么说
and why would she say something like that?

869
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:56,920
你自己清楚
You tell me.

870
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,260
艾玛
Emma.

871
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:01,890
我不想要继母
I don't want a stepmother.

872
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:03,360
绝不想
Ever.

873
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:09,100
没你想象的那么严重
Everything's gonna be ok.

874
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:12,300
我有约会 不过很快会回来的
I have a meeting but I'll be home early, ok?

875
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:14,140
回来再说
Then we'll talk.

876
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,840
好吧 我等你回来
Great. I'll wait up.

877
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,110
约会愉快
Have fun on your date!

878
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:21,350
所以你没再结过婚
So you never remarried?

879
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:21,800
没有
Nope.

880
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,380
你有多喜欢玩转情场
You like playing the field that much, huh?

881
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,980
简直爱死了
Yeah, I love it.

882
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,890
很让人满足
It's so fulfilling.

883
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,950
你知道吧 特别是抚养一个小女孩
I mean, you know, especially raising a young girl.

884
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:40,260
很棒
Great.

885
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:49,370
我开第一家店时折腾了将近四个月
When I first opened the store I had about four months.

886
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,710
我担心店会倒闭 但生意逐渐好了起来
I was really worried but then business picked up

887
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:55,180
到现在有六年了 都很顺利
and it's been really good for six years now.

888
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,880
艾玛
Emma?

889
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,400
该死的 艾玛
Dammit, Emma.

890
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,120
艾玛
Emma?

891
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:02,350
艾玛
Emma!

892
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,550
艾玛 快开门 这可不好玩
Emma, let me out of here. This isn't funny.

893
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:07,020
艾玛
Emma!

894
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:35,310
艾玛
Emma?

895
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:39,580
艾玛
Emma!

896
00:57:58,370 --> 00:58:00,340
借过一下 这是我的房子
Let me through! This is my house!

897
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,180
艾玛
Emma!

898
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:10,050
你是房主吗
Are you the homeowner

899
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:10,750
是的
Yes.

900
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:11,050
你是房主吗
Are you the homeowner

901
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:11,550
没错
Yes, yes.

902
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:12,820
我有个九岁的女儿 她叫艾玛
I have a nine-year-old daughter, her name is Emma,

903
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:13,750
她和她保姆一起
she's here with her nanny.

904
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:14,850
先生 你女儿没事
Sir, your daughter is fine,

905
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,920
她和我们副警长在房子里
she's in a house with one of my deputies.

906
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:19,220
很不幸 发生了这么突然的事
Now, unfortunately there's been a terrible accident.

907
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:20,560
那个叫克洛伊的保姆
The nanny, Chloe,

908
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,930
当时还在起火的工棚里
was in the work shed when the fire broke out.

909
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,670
她可能被吓到了
I think she's in shock.

910
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,540
她没告诉我们太多 但他说那个保姆
She hasn't told us much but apparently the young woman

911
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:36,170
在工棚里偷偷抽烟
would sneak a smoke in the work shed.

912
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:46,980
好了 给你们一点独处时间
Ok, I will give you two a moment.

913
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,260
小甜熊
Honey bear.

914
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:01,300
没事了 爸爸
It's ok, daddy.

915
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,700
我没事
Nothing happened to me.

916
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,650
艾玛 我知道你醒着
Emma, I know you're awake.

917
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,070
我觉得我们有麻烦了
I think we're in trouble.

918
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:43,670
我觉得我们惹上大麻烦了
I think we're both in very big trouble,

919
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:47,380
我们谈谈 你必须告诉我事情的真相
and we need to talk and I need you to tell me the truth.

920
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:53,220
我是你父亲 我爱你
I'm your father, I love you,

921
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:56,220
我会竭尽所能来帮你
I'm going to do anything I can to help you.

922
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,070
是你杀了麦洛 对吧
You hurt Milo, didn't you?

923
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,970
是不是
Didn't you?

924
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:21,140
他要告状说我拿走了他的奖牌
He was gonna tell on me that I took his medal.

925
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,820
我不想伤害他的
I didn't mean to hurt him.

926
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:34,660
我推了一下 他就摔下去了
When I pushed him, he fell.

927
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:39,960
他一直喊 喊着说他不会游泳
He kept on yelling, yelling that he couldn't swim,

928
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,570
但我没有相信他
but I didn't believe him.

929
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,600
他老是夸大事实
He always over-exaggerated.

930
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:54,440
一会他就没有再喊 然后我再也没看到他了
After a while he stopped yelling and I couldn't see him anymore.

931
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:57,010
对不起 爸爸
I'm so sorry, daddy.

932
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,750
我不想惹麻烦
I didn't want to get into trouble.

933
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:01,920
我不会再犯了
I won't do it again.

934
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:12,630
莱薇娅 片头部分提起过
还有莱薇娅 你的第一任保姆
And Mrs. Levia, your first nanny,

935
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,700
你又把她怎么了
what happed to her?

936
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:20,240
她紧紧抓着我的手
She should have never grabbed my arm,

937
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:27,380
所以我踢了她 她就摔下了楼梯
so I kicked her, and she fell down the stairs.

938
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,950
我并没做错什么
I didn't do anything wrong.

939
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:31,980
她是成年人
She's the adult.

940
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:36,250
她应该更好地保护自己
She should have protected herself better.

941
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:41,560
那埃利斯老师和黄蜂呢
And Mrs. Ellis and the wasps?

942
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:45,860
还有今晚 你对克洛伊做了什么
And tonight, what did you do to Chloe?

943
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,470
艾玛
Emma!

944
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,030
警长迟早会发现这事实真相的
The sheriff will get to the bottom of this eventually

945
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,240
所以别再该死地骗我了
so don't give me the bullshit story.

946
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:53,500
你说了"该死"
You said "bullshit".

947
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:57,170
艾玛 你知道你会怎么样吗
Emma, do you know what could happen to you?!

948
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,940
知道吗
Do you?!

949
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:04,380
我们会怎么样
What could happen to us?

950
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,780
知道 爸爸
Yes, daddy.

951
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,550
他们会抓走我然后把我送上
They're gonna take me and they're gonna put me

952
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:12,520
小椅子 粉色小电椅
in the little chair, the little pink electric chair.

953
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:15,390
我真的不想去
I really don't wanna go there.

954
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:17,330
我不想尿到自己身上
I don't wanna pee myself.

955
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:19,400
艾玛 你在说什么
Emma, what're you talking about?

956
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:20,500
克洛伊说我伤害麦洛
Chloe said she knew about

957
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:25,500
这事总有一天会被大家知道
Milo and one day everyone would.

958
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:26,870
她说他们会把我
She said that they were gonna take me

959
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:31,040
送上专门放小孩子的电椅
to this little electric chair that they put kids in.

960
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:33,610
还告诉我说她会做我的继母
She told me she was gonna be my stepmother.

961
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:34,580
艾玛 冷静
Emma, calm down.

962
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:36,910
我不想要继母
I don't want a stepmother!

963
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,620
绝不
Ever!

964
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:45,220
她从你房间偷药片
She stole pills from your room.

965
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:48,190
我看见了
I watched.

966
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:51,090
她欺骗你
She fooled you.

967
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,860
你不会做任何事
You weren't gonna do anything about it.

968
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:59,040
什么都不会
Not one thing!

969
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:02,370
所以你杀了她
So you did.

970
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:06,740
是不是这样
Isn't that right?

971
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:09,610
也是迫不得已
Someone had to.

972
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:17,320

之后两周我可能会不在
I'm out of the office for the next two weeks.

974
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:21,860
如有急事 可以打报警电话
If this is an emergency please call 911

985

I don't want to intrude but there are some questions

986
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:06,070

呃 艾玛有点不舒服
Uh, yeah, Emma's very sick.

988
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,240

She's upset about the accident as you can imagine,

989
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:16,080
而我 我今天有很多工作

能先推迟几天吗
Could we postpone maybe for a few days?

991

你讨厌那里
You hate it there.

1002

我不讨厌那里
I don't hate it there.

1003

我不清楚
I don't know.

1006
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,590
我们为什么要去那
What're we gonna do there?

1007
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:36,590
我想找个地方冷静冷静
I just need a place to think.

1008
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:56,010
哈哈 又见面了

Look at you.

1010
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:58,480
你还是老样子
You haven't changed a bit.

1011
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:00,720
寒酸 困苦 还没装有线电视
Well, cold air, hard work, and no cable tv,

1012
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,790
希望你们俩能常住在这
and you too could live forever.

1013
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:05,920
这是我盼望的那个她吗
Hey, is that who I think it is?

1014
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:07,990
不可能 艾玛还只是个孩子
It can't be, 'cause Emma's just a baby

1015
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:09,660
你真是个成熟的女孩

You look just like your ma.

1019
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,240
我很高兴你们终于回来了
Well, I'm glad you finally got to come up here.

1020
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:21,470
你妹妹安琪拉一直住在这里
Your sister has been bogarting the place.

1021
01:06:21,570 --> 01:06:23,370
她如果同意 你们就可以住在这了
Angela would live here full time if she could.

1022
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,580
如果有什么需要可以叫我
Well, if you need anything you let me know

1023
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,380
我会马上过来
and I'll be right out.

1024
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:30,550
过了这么多年很高兴再见到你 艾玛
And it's uh, good to see you after all the years, Emma.

1025
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:31,750

You too.

1026
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:33,150
谢了 布莱恩 有需要会叫你
Thanks, Brian. I'll call you if I need you.

1027

好
Alright.

1028
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:00,740
你应该事先打电话给我
You still should have called me David.

1029
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,480
那有什么用
What good would that have done?

1030
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:05,450
我没想通
And I wasn't thinking straight.

1031
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:07,580
我现在都还没想通
I'm still not thinking straight.

1032
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:08,950
克洛伊 可怜的女孩
Chloe, that poor girl.

1033
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:10,150
怎么会发生这种事呢
How could such a thing have happened?

1034
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:13,290
警察和消防员怎么说的
What did the police or firefighters say?

1035
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:17,160
他们...还在调查
They're... investigating.

1036
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:18,760
那艾玛怎么样了
Well, how's Emma?

1037
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:19,900
需要我过来帮忙吗
Should I come up to the lake house?

1038
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:23,000
我可以请假
I could take off work.

1039
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:26,000
不 没事的
No, it's fine.

1040
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:28,910
我们只想花点时间安静一下
We're just taking some time away.

1041

我很担心你们 大卫
I'm worried about you, David.

1044
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:41,650

Hello?

1045
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:44,120
我们找到起火源了
We've found the source of the fire.

1046
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:45,560
是蓄意纵火
It was deliberately set.

1047
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:48,730
知道是谁干的吗
Do you know who did it?

1048
01:07:48,790 --> 01:07:49,260
还不清楚
Not yet,

1049
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:50,660
不过我们已经把证据送往了研究所
but uh, from what we've sent the lab

1050
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,130
我们会很快找出凶手的

你不去接吗
Aren't you gonna answer?

1055
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:19,780
一开始只是对宠物下手
The killing started with the family pet,

1056
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:21,150
但随着蒂莫西的成长
but as Timothy grew,

1057
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:23,150
他的犯罪率也逐渐变大
so did his crimes.

1058
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:24,490
马沙洛维茨博士
Dr. Marshalovitz,

1059
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,290
一位研究反社会儿童的专家讲解道
an expert on violet child sociopaths explains:

1060
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,860
暴力行为似乎存在于他们的内心
The violence seems to be inside them,

1061
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,830
像坏种一样深埋着
buried like a bad seed.

1062
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,330
最终成长 一旦发芽...
Eventually it grows and once it starts...

1063
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,800
就不会再停下
...it doesn't seem to stop.

1064
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:38,190
杀 手 的 特 征

1065
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:38,190
我们得谈谈
非常紧急
- 彼得森警长

1066
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:42,710
艾玛
Emma.

1067
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:46,210
我不希望你这么偷看我
I don't like you sneaking around like that.

1068
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:49,710
你在那里站多久了
How long have you been standing there?

1069
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:52,820
你在偷窥我吗
Were you snooping on me?

1070
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,190
我觉得是你在偷窥我
I think you were snooping on me.

1071
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:00,520
我说过了
I told you,

1072
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:03,430
我没做错什么
I didn't do anything wrong.

1073

我绝不会无缘无故伤害别人
I would never hurt anyone for no reason.

1074
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:09,370
我绝对不会那么做
I would never, ever do that.

1075
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:14,340
你觉得我会吗
Do you think I would?

1076
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:16,310
会吗 爸爸
Do you, daddy?

1077
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,410
我可不会再信你了
I don't know anymore.

1078
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:24,950
我太失望了
That makes me sad.

1079
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:54,430
为什么
Why?

1080
01:12:58,270 --> 01:13:00,570
你为什么要这么对我
Why would you do that to me?

1081
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:05,410
我可是你唯一的亲人
I'm the only person you have.

1082
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,640
不
No.

1083
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:12,620
如果你死了我还可以找安琪拉姑姑
If something happened to you I'd live with aunt Angela.

1084
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,150
至少她还觉得我不错
At least she thinks I'm nice.

1085
01:13:16,990 --> 01:13:19,160
哦 天呐
Oh my god.

1086
01:13:50,000 --> 01:14:15,450

我觉得你该睡了

但是你不懂

九岁的小孩怎么会杀人

01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:12,720
但我不会让警察把她抓走
but I'm not gonna let them take her away.

1143
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:16,020
她以后可不能在什么收容所或者

01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:17,450
监狱里度过
Or prison.

1145
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:23,160

01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:26,660
我必须保护她

我真的很抱歉

1150
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:36,470
已经别无他法了

1151
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,510
我已经想好了其他的办法

1152

因为 她还会继续下去

他才是罪犯
She's not right.

1187
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:34,680
