你还好吧? 糟透了

宝格丽珠宝窃案有重大突破

很清晰的靴印
A really good one.

17
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,280
左靴的鞋跟磨损得很严重
The left heel was worn way down.

18

...what kind of conditioner he uses, if he streaks his hair...

25
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,100

26
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,240
是啊
That is amazing.

27
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,440
局里的男人真有一套
You know, having those extra men really paid off.

28
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,710
你也不要妄自菲薄
Oh, you're just being modest.

29
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,410
你上不上床?
Are you coming to bed, baby?

没有人听过我朋友佛瑞德・凯利
You think it's a accident no one know about Fred "Bud" Kelly?

138
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:51,580
新泽西州  
东橘市

139
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,290
这并不是意外  这只有一个原因
Ain't no accident. There's one explanation...

140
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,860
你们这些美女一定知道
...and you ladies know exactly what it is.

141
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,660
让我告诉你们
I'm gonna tell you what it is.

142
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,930
这是个大阴谋  大诡计
Conspiracy, collusion, complicity. That's all it is.

143
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,100
我就跟你们一一细说我老友佛瑞德的丰功伟业
Let me break it down like a fraction for you about my man Fred "Bud" Kelly.

144
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,080
十世纪初  他在新斯科细亚... 
Fred "Bud" Kelly made skates out of whiskey bottles...

145
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,080
在他叔叔的农场里用威士忌酒瓶做冰刀
...at his uncle's farm in the early 1900s. That was over there in Nova Scotia.

146
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,520
我再跟你们说他从来没赢过史丹利杯
I'm gonna tell you something else. You never seen his name on the Stanley Cup.

147
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:22,490
为什么?因为臭白人... 
You know why that is? Because that son of a bitch Jim Crow...

148
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,030
把他从历史上除名
...took his name off the history books. You kind of...

149
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,030
好像我每次碰到你  你都用种族歧视这一招
Seems like every time I see you, you're playing the race card, Frank.

150
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,000
为什么?
Now, why is that?

151
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,200
请你放开我的脚
You can let go of my feet now.

152
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,580
英国  伦敦

153
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,680
- 你不觉得这很烦吗?   -我... 当然烦
- This don't bother you? - Of course it bothers me, mate.

154
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,290
-你他妈的要我怎么办?  -真烦人
- What the do you want me to do? - Well, it's up.

155
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,250
都听不到歌词了
You can't hear none of the lyrics.

156
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,820
那么多消音把节奏都搞乱了
You can't get with the beat with all them                      bleeps in it.

157
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:58,120
你想他妈的当红歌星就得这么搞
You want a single on the radio, it's what you have to do.

158
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,700
狗屁  这太扯了
Well, it's, isn't it? Totally!

159
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,300
没错  你他妈的
right, it's .

160
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,930
那是什么屁音乐?
What the is that?

161
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,270
有人在二号录音间
Somebody must be in 2.

162
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,850
见鬼
Oh, !

163
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,010
伊利诺州 
 芝加哥

164
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,850
你没找上我老爸吧?
And you haven't contacted my father about any of this?

165
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:28,480
你没有必要把我爸妈拖下水
Because, really, I don't think there's any reason to involve him or my mom.

166
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,530
我只针对你  莱纳斯
It's all on you, Linus.

167
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,860
好  那就好
Okay. Good.

168
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,100
-我在这儿有很多人脉...   -给我下车
- Good. Because I have a whole network... - Get out of my car.

169
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,900
谢谢你
Thank you.

170
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,780
-布鲁先生?  -是的
- Mr. Bloom? - Yes.

171
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,640
您的信用卡有点问题
There appears to be a slight problem with your card.

172
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,750
纽约州 
 东汉普顿

173
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,450
好  用这个吧
Oh, well, yes. Here.

174
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,180
这张卡也不能刷
I'm afraid not, sir.

175
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,830
为什么?
Why?

176
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,520
您的财务经理说您会理解
Your business manager said you would understand.

177
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,760
陶德这么说吗?
Todd said I would understand?

178
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,800
不  是班奈狄先生
No, Mr. Benedict.

179
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,460
班奈狄先生... 
Mr. Benedict. Mr...

180
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,470
是的
Oh, yes.

181
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,630
这是一位老朋友的恶作剧
An old friend, a practical joker.

182
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,110
请转告班奈狄先生  说他赢了
Tell Mr. Benedict he's won this round, yes.

183
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,840
泰瑞班奈狄
Terry Benedict.

184
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,040
泰瑞真行
Old Terry.

185
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,710
她一直盯着我
She's looking at me from across the room.

186
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,480
她一定看上我了  我看得出来
And she's crazy about me, I can tell...

187
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,820
路易斯安那州  
纽奥良

188
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,020
因为她含情脉脉地看着我
...because she's been staring at me all night. So suddenly...

189
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,260
于是我突然站起来抱住她
...I just go up to her, and I grab her.

190
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,990
当我紧紧地抱着她
And I've got her really close to me...

191
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,600
她的眼睛在向我放电
...and her eyes are all fiery.

192
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,240
顿时天雷... 
And my eyes are fiery.

193
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,100
勾动地火
And it's like... It's electric.

194
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,010
我跟她说:"老妈"
And I say to her, "Mom...

195
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,780
我居然说老妈
Mother... "

196
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,310
什么?
What?

197
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,550
谢谢你让我表演完
Thanks for letting me finish.

198
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,060
没办法
What can I say?

199
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,130
谁叫你这么会搞笑
You're a funny guy.

200
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,490
内华达州  
拉斯维加斯

201
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,300
我朋友罗斯  我很担心他
Oh, yeah. My friend Rusty. I'm worried about him.

202
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,570
他在洛杉矶有家饭店
He owns this hotel in Los Angeles...

203
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,680
赔了不少钱  他忙得不行
...losing a lot of money, and he's got no life.

204
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,610
他人很好  只是很不会赚钱
He's a nice, bright kid, but he's beating his brains out.

205
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,410
你可以用念力传话给他吗?
Do you think I could send something through you, like, a message to him?

206
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,890
我是在看你的手相耶
I read your palm, not his.

207
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,820
你有这本事就能赚人钱  我的身体没毛病吧?
Somebody who could do that could do very well. Anything on my health?

208
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,760
-我的腰怪怪的 　-请出去
- My hips are bothering me. - Please.

209
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,800
你算不出我会有这种衰运吗?
This? You couldn't see this?

210
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,990
加州 
 西好莱坞

211
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,300
-他不肯开门 　-让我来  我认识他
- I tried knocking, he won't open. - I'll handle it. I know him.

212
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,880
拜托  你们是智障吗?
Jesus Christ, are you people retarded?

213
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,210
-门外写着"请勿打扰"   -是我
- It says, "Do not disturb"! - It's me.

214
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,920
嗨
Hey.

215
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,880
进来吧
Come on in.

216
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,390
托佛  别学人家乱砸房间嘛
Jeez, Topher, you didn't have to go all Frankie Muniz on me.

217
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,830
抱歉  我知道这是你的饭店
I'm sorry. Rust, look, I know this is your joint.

218
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,430
我只是
I just...

219
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,400
我交了一个女朋友
There's this girl.

220
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,430
我很爱她
I love her, man.

221
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,630
不过  她快把我逼疯了
I love her, but she is driving me crazy!

222
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,900
我不能睡觉  不能工作
I can't sleep. I can't work.

223
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,340
节目也停掉了  那部新片我也演砸了
I quit the show. I totally phoned in that Dennis Quaid movie.

224
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,140
-我真的是...   -喂?
- I mean, it's like... - Hello?

225
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,050
这烂喀巴拉手环根本没用
God, it's almost like this Kabbalah crap doesn't even work!

226
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,090
罗斯  电话
Rusty, call for you.

227
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,450
老兄  别走
Dude, don't leave.

228
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,030
-喂?  -我要给罗伯莱恩留言
- Yeah? - I have a message for Robert Charles Ryan...

229
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,730
他很快会失去史坦德饭店
...soon to be ex-owner of the Standard Hotel.

230
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,370
-我就是 　-上次你挂我电话... 
- You got him. - Last time we spoke, you hung up on me.

231
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,310
谁叫你骂脏话  我不爽听
You used some nasty words. I got sensitive ears.

232
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,970
我那天是有点激动
I admit I was a little emotional that evening.

233
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,240
你常想到那件事  对吧?
Think about that night a lot, don't you?

234
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,650
你竟然还先打电话来  我以为我死定了
I thought I'd be dead before I heard the sound that killed me.

235
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,480
有人叫我节制一点  要不然你哪天早上出门
I've been asked to show restraint. Otherwise, you would've gone out...

236
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,600
坐上你的名贵轿车  用车钥匙启动引擎... 
...to your favorite car of all the 17 you own, and as soon as you turned on the ignition...

237
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,340
你有两个礼拜
You got two weeks.

238
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,730
第一个星期四  只剩十三天

239
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,650
你老婆说他称我们为"欧逊的十一大盗"
Now, you told me that your wife said that he called it Ocean's 11.

240
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,680
搞什么?我可是个体户
Now, who decided that? I'm a private contractor.

241
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,450
大家都出了力  不是你的功劳
It was a collaboration. That moniker is insulting.

242
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,560
对  大家分工合作
It was one job we did together.

243
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,720
怎么会变成你一个人挂名?这有点过分
I don't know where this proprietary stance comes from. It seems possessive.

244
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,690
也许是因为这是丹尼的点子
One could make the argument that because it was Danny's idea...

245
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,890
等一下  每个人都有专长
Hang on a minute. We all had our own areas of expertise.

246
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,730
没有我们  你连屁都没有
I mean, without us, it don't leave your head, mate.

247
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,800
这很伤人
It just hurts, you know, because...

248
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:12,140
因为我以为大家说好了  叫它是"赌城那一票"
...it seemed we all agreed to call it "the Benedict job. "

249
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,740
当时我们都是这么叫的
That's what we called it when we were doing it.

250
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,070
你不能随便改名字
If you wanted to call it something else...

251
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,440
等等  有麻烦都找谁搞定?
When you have a problem, who do you go to?

252
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,640
-罗斯 　-罗斯
- Rusty. - Rusty.

253
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,680
谢了  莱纳斯  言归正传吧
Thanks. Let's get back on the topic.

254
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,950
每个人分的钱加上利息... 
Based on what we stole, plus interest...

255
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,420
是多少? 一千七百三十四万
...how much does everybody owe? - $ 17.34 million.

256
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,500
但是班奈狄绝不会给我们优惠利率
Assuming Benedict gives us prime plus one, which I doubt.

257
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,660
抓一千九百万比较保险
Figure 19 to be safe.

258
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,670
好  有谁还得起一千九百万吗?
Okay, 19 each. Anybody got that?

259
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,610
干嘛?难道股市那么深奥
What, you think the stock market's some great mystery...

260
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,910
真的有那么难懂吗?你们都没看到征兆吗?
...beyond the realm of human understanding? Didn't you see the signs?

261
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,240
我就有看到
I saw the signs.

262
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,050
大家各缺多少?
How much is everybody short?

263
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,450
你缺多少?
How much you short?

264
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,590
一千四百万
Fourteen. Fourteen.

265
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,560
-你花到剩五百万?  -是啊  你要跟我说教吗?
- All but 5 million? - Yeah. You gonna start with me?

266
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,030
自己创业很不容易的
You don't know what it's like to create something from scratch.

267
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,830
-我只缺七百万 　-八百万
- Well, with interest, I'm short 7. - Eight.

268
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,090
我花了一百万栽培新人
I spent about a million, mostly on talent development.

269
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,540
我也缺七百万  利息真是要人命
That makes it 7 for me. Boy, the interest just kills you.

270
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,870
-我缺九百万 　-利息有多少?
- I'm light 9. - What's the interest?

271
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,770
-六百万 　-那我只缺六百万
- About 6. - Then I owe 6.

272
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,410
-怎么会?   -什么?
- How? - What?

273
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,910
我都住在父母家里
I've been staying at my parents'.

274
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,150
我缺两千五百万
I owe 25.

275
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,920
饭店赔惨了
Hotels, man.

276
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,060
索尔?
Saul?

277
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:41,300
我钱还没花完  但很快就会了
I haven't spent it all, but I will.

278
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,830
别把我算在内
I'm out, fellas.

279
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,670
我是个老人  不得不承认  我干不动了
As ranking old-timer, I gotta say, I just can't do it.

280
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,710
我这把年纪总可以自私点吧
At my age, I think I earned the right to be selfish.

281
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,580
谢谢各位给我这个机会  你们都是高手  但是... 
I wanna thank you all for the wonderful opportunity. You're all aces in my book.

282
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,650
我打算在死前... 把每一分钱花光
But I want the last check I write to bounce.

283
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,020
索尔  你在耍我们吗?
Saul, you having a laugh?

284
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,830
索尔
Saul.

285
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,630
-我可以替索尔还钱 　-你不必这么做
- I can handle Saul's share. - You don't have to.

286
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,270
你们都挂了  我找谁聊天?
Who would I talk to if you were all dead?

287
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,030
有道理  我欠一千万  小颜呢?
That's a good point. All right, I owe 10. Amazing?

288
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,710
不过你那栋豪宅超豪华的
Yeah, but it's a nice place.

289
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,050
-加起来一共是...   -差不多九千七百万
- So that comes to...? - Ninety-seven, give or take.

290
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,620
凭他自已是找不到我们的
He didn't find us on his own.

291
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,220
-一定有人帮忙 　-另一个小偷
- Someone helped him. - Another thief.

292
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,990
我们的熟人不会违反第一条行规
Nobody we know would violate rule number one.

293
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,360
咱们得干一票  很大的一票
What we do know is we need a job. We need a high-paying job.

294
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,960
咱们在美国太惹人注意了
We're too hot to work anywhere in this country.

295
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,660
-那就出国 　-下十五点钟的班机
- So we go abroad. How about we go...? - We're on the 5:00.

296
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,300
好  去哪儿?
Good. Where are we going?

297
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,870
-阿姆斯特丹 　-就这么办吧
- Amsterdam. - Amsterdam it is.

298
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,070
-时间紧迫  出发吧 　-我没去过阿姆斯特丹
- Clock's running. Let's go. - Never been to Amsterdam.

299
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,710
听说德国妞很辣
I hear German girls are really hot.

300
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,610
罗斯
Rusty.

301
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,150
-阿姆斯特丹?  -是的
- Amsterdam? - Yeah.

302
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,980
别告诉丹尼
Don't tell Danny.

303
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,660
罗斯
Hey, Rusty. Rusty.

304
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,290
不好意思
Sorry, sorry. Hey.

305
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,300
搞什么?怎么了?
What are you doing? What's wrong with you?

306
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,800
-没什么?  -什么?
- Nothing. - What?

307
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,870
-我能不能...   -什么?
- Can I...? Can I...? - What?

308
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,800
-我想跟你聊聊 　-怎么了?
- Just for a second, can I talk to you? - What's wrong?

309
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,770
我只是... 
I just... I don't know.

310
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,570
现在谈这件事也许不太好
This might not be the perfect time or whatever to talk about it.

311
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,880
-好吧 　-我只是在想... 
- Okay. - I've been thinking.

312
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,710
我一直在用功
I've been doing my homework.

313
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,590
这次我很想... 
And I'd really like...

314
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,690
扮演比较有份量的角色
...to play a more central role this time around.

315
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,750
-我觉得我... 
- Right. - I feel like I've...

316
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,870
-是哦我都准备好了
- Right. - I'm ready for that, and I...

317
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,260
是哦 　我都准备好了
Way overdue.

318
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:01,460
我想跟你们一起去谈生意  帮忙出主意
I was wondering if I could come to the meeting and help you guys negotiate.

319
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:06,640
好吧  只是跟松井开个会
Okay. It's just a sit-down with Matsui.

320
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,310
这家伙讲话不太好懂
He's got his own language, this guy.

321
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,320
上次我仔细观察过你跟丹尼  我学到很多
I watched you and Danny really closely last time around. I learned a ton.

322
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:18,290
我专业的意见是  你还不行
Linus, in my professional opinion, you're not ready.

323
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,850
-好吧  是啦 　-不过... 可是... 
- Okay. Yeah, I mean... - But... But... But...

324
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,020
如果你觉得有把握
...if you're convinced you are ready...

325
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,130
我可以说服丹尼让你跟去
...I can speak with Danny. We can make this happen.

326
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,820
不过你得有把握
But you gotta be sure.

327
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,070
-你没有把握?   -不  我有
- Not sure? - No, I am.

328
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,080
-你肯定?   -不过要是有问题... 
- You're sure? - But if I had a question, I could...

329
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,110
-你可以来找我 　-对
- You would call me? - Right. Okay.

330
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,840
随时都行
Any time.

331
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,510
-好啊 　-好啊
- Okay. - Okay.

332
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,670
-好了 　-好  太好了  谢谢你
- All right. - Okay. Awesome. Thank you.

333
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,180
好
Yeah.

334
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,960
我差点就决定不来找你
I almost wasn't gonna come over and say anything.

335
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,490
我就可以继续睡大觉
Then I'd still be sleeping.

336
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,120
-谢了  小伙子 　-好
- Thanks, buddy. - Yeah.

337
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:13,440
阿 姆 斯 特 丹

338
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,520
-谁呀?   -莱纳斯
- Who's there? - Li... It's...

339
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,390
-什么?   -莱纳斯
- What? - It's Linus.

340
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,930
罗斯人呢?
Is Rusty here? Rusty...?

341
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,570
-罗斯在哪儿?   -不知道
- Do you know where Rusty is? - No.

342
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,770
你见过松井吗?
So have you met Matsui?

343
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,530
说真的  你觉得我... 
Seriously, what do you think of me...

344
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,440
有当一哥的潜力吗?
...you know, in terms of just leadership potential?

345
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,130
你得忘了咱们不能工作
The fact that we're unemployable shouldn't enter your mind.

346
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,590
第一个星期六  
只剩十一天

347
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,090
不然  你只会浪费你的时间
Otherwise, you're wasting time.

348
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,600
千万别提到班奈狄
Don't mention Benedict unless he does first.

349
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,670
他先提起的话  就坦白地说出来
And if he does, tell him everything.

350
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,360
说重点  别忘了我说的那件事
Right. Stay on point. And don't forget the other thing I told you.

351
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,840
-什么事?   -认真听话
- What? - About listening.

352
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,840
别紧张  记住  接不到这一票就死定了
Relax. Remember, if we don't get this job, we're dead.

353
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,210
我昨天一直在找你
Rusty, I tried calling you all yesterday.

354
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:34,250
最后她把酒杯摔在托盘上说:
So finally, she slams her vodka tonic down on the tray and says:

355
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:39,080
"怪不得我最近觉得这么热"
"Hey, maybe that's why I've been feeling so warm recently. "

356
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,200
好啊
Yeah.

357
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,010
-谈正事吧 　-谈正事
- So to business? - To business.

358
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,270
有一位皮肤科医生... 
A doctor who specializes in skin diseases...

359
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,750
会梦到他在电视前面睡着
...will dream he has fallen asleep in front of the television.

360
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,720
然后在电视前面醒来
Later, he will wake up in front of the television...

361
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,220
而不记得他做的梦
...but not remember his dream.

362
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,760
你同意吗?
Would you agree?

363
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,960
如果住在赤道的动物够厚道... 
If all the animals along the equator were capable of flattery...

364
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,540
就会把感恩节和万圣节
...then Thanksgiving and Halloween...

365
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,610
放在同一天
...would fall on the same date.

366
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,980
是啊
Yeah. Hey.

367
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,880
我四岁时... 
When I was 4 years old...

368
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:52,390
看到我妈用茶壶保温袋  杀死一只蜘蛛
...I watched my mother kill a spider with a tea cozy.

369
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,090
多年后  我才发现那不是蜘蛛
Years later, I realized it was not a spider.

370
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,600
而是我的哈洛叔
It was my Uncle Harold.

371
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:23,290
让阳光照射我的睑颊
Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face

372
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,930
让星辰进入我的梦中
Stars to fill my dreams

373
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,690
我是一名时空的旅客
I am a traveler in both time and space

374
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,600
重返我曾去过的地方
To be where I have been

375
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,750
他怎样?没事吧?
Is he all right? Are we all right?

376
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,860
《喀什米尔》的歌词? 你这是在帮倒忙
- "Kashmir"? - Is that your idea of making a contribution?

377
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,360
-我们都还没谈条件 　-你差点就把这一票搞砸
- We hadn't even started yet. - We were this close to losing that.

378
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:02,730
我完全被搞糊涂了  我到底说了些什么?
Okay, I don't even understand what happened in there. What did I say?

379
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,400
-你骂他侄女是妓女 　-还是廉价妓女
- You called his niece a whore. - A cheap one.

381
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,540
-别跟他说了 　-没错  对不起
- No, don't tell him about it. - I'm sorry.

382
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,210
这代表什么?
Okay. So, what does this mean?

383
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,210
你要乖乖待在这儿
It means you stay here.

384
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,780
目标是范德沃特一个有钱的神秘客
The mark's name is van der Woude. A semi-known, wealthy recluse.

385
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,920
多年来他都自称是古董商  却没卖过古董
He claims to sell antiques, but hasn't actually sold one.

386
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:31,420
他的店就是他家  没人进去过
His store is his privately owned home, which no one ever enters.

387
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,390
别被这个怪人给骗了
But don't let van der Woude's eccentricity fool you.

388
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,800
他的房子戒备森严
The house is extremely well-protected.

389
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,250
-我们要偷什么?   -一份文件
- What are we after? - It's a document.

390
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,550
一份很珍贵的古老文件
It's a very old, very valuable document.

391
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,020
-什么文件?   -一张股票

两百五十万欧元?
2.5 million euro.

396
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,390
每个人吗?
Wait. Each?

397
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:18,230

491
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,940
我就是狗改不了吃屎
Can't turn my brain off, you know. It's me.

492
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:33,380

We go into some place, and all I can do is see the angles.

493
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:37,960
这一行我干了一辈子  我就爱这样子
It's what I do. It's what I've always done. I love it.

494
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,260

495
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,900
真的很难熬
Some sort of weird irony, you know?

496

- The whole house? - We're just raising it slightly.

500

It's really our best plan, considering it's our only plan.

-要抬到多高?   -这是唯一的办法
- Crank for how long? - Like I said, it's our only plan.

使他们很难被抓到

520
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:06,230
虽然他活跃了五十几年

有很多人想当他的接班人

522

...only one is worth mentioning in the same breath as LeMarc:

523
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:19,250
就是被称为"夜狐"的神偷
The thief we know only as the Night Fox.

524
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:23,850
他总是在现场留下狐狸小玩偶
So named for the small onyx figurines he leaves behind to taunt us...

525
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:28,790
夜狐是我们的头号嫌犯
...the Night Fox must be considered our number-one priority.

526
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,160
他犯下的一连串惊人窃案
His string of high-profile crimes are an embarrassment to our branch...

527
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,860
让国际刑警颜面尽失
...to our entire profession.

528
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:40,030
我们需要比传统资源更有效的方法才能逮到像他这种神偷
We need more than traditional resources to pursue thieves like the Night Fox.

529
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:46,400
我们必须用他们的思考逻辑看出一件案子的蹊跷
We need to train ourselves to think the way they think, to see what they see.

530
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,380
我们也不能被任何事分心
And we should not allow ourselves to be distracted...

531
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,750
对不起  刚才有人爆窃范德沃特的家
I'm sorry. Someone just robbed the van der Woude house.

532
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,440
什么?
What?

533
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:14,030
伊莎贝  这次又要请你帮忙了
Hi, Isabel. Well, we could really use your help on this one.

534
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:17,140
希望现场没遭到破坏
I hope the scene hasn't been contaminated.

535
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,290
几时能跟范德沃特先生说话?
When can I speak to Mr. Van der Woude?

536
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,620
明天吧  他服了镇静剂
Probably tomorrow. He's heavily sedated.

537
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:40,460
想不透他们怎么解除警铃  也许是造成电线短路
We can't figure out how they disabled the alarm. Shorted it out somehow?

538
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,760
不可能  那会触动警铃  破坏系统线路
No, that would have triggered the system and damaged the circuits.

539
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,770
那我就不知道他们是怎么进来的了
Well, then. Then I don't know how they got in.

540
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,540
他们有密码  除了屋主  别人也有密码
They had the code. Someone other than the owner must have known it.

541
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:01,210
他发誓这是不可能的  保安密码是他亲自设定的
Impossible. Van der Woude programmed the last nine steps of the system.

542
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,220
设定后就没再出门
He set it and never left the house again.

543
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:08,410
密闭回路系统  钛合金保险箱
Closed loop. Redundant servers. Titanium encasement.

544
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,060
保安系统非常严密
It's not bad, actually.

545
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,520
谢谢
Yeah. Thanks.

546
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,680
我们认识吗?
Do we know each other?

547
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:08,110
-我昨天见过你 　-是吗?
- I think I saw you yesterday. - Oh, yeah?

548
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,810
你被警察追着跑
Yeah, you were being chased by the police.

549
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:14,890
我被警察追?不  不可能是我
Chasing me? No. I don't think so.

550
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,030
我很确定是你
I'm quite sure it was you.

551
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,320
那么警察真无能
Doesn't say much for the police.

552
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,330
我喜欢罗马  我很爱罗马
No, I love Rome. I love it.

553
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,200
不过  我有一个升迁机会
But there's an opening at work the level above me, and it's...

554
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:34,710
我想去阿姆斯特丹试试看
I was thinking I was gonna try out for it. It's in Amsterdam.

555
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,310
我妈在那儿有亲戚  很方便
My mother has family there, so it'd be... It'd be good.

556
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:48,180
他把整栋房子抬高了? 没错
- He lifted the whole house? - The whole house.

557
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,350
-整栋房子?  -对
- The entire house? - The entire house.

558
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,690
这叫做舒曼手法
It's called a Schumann Special...

559
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:56,990
以一个天才神偷舒曼命名
...named after this guy, a brilliant guy, Max Schumann.

560
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:02,030
他在1973年... 在伊斯坦堡又干过一次
Then he did it in Istanbul in 1973.

561
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,360
那是什么?
What is it?

562
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,370
十字弓射出来的洞
It's where the crossbow bolt hit.

563
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,420
十字弓?
The crossbow bolt?

564
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:20,120
他们从对面屋顶射入窗口
They fired from that rooftop through this open window.

565
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,450
从对面屋顶射入窗口?
With a crossbow bolt from that roof through that window?

566
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:27,390
-这难度太高了吧?  -这是不可能的任务
- That's a very difficult shot. - No, it is an impossible shot...

567
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,620
直到他们把房子抬高了
...until they raised the building.

568
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,060
检查梁枉  应该都被升高了
Check the pylons. They'll be elevated.

569
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:35,670
-你听过舒曼这名字吗?  -没有
- You know the name Max Schumann? - No.

570
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,140
-他们听过 　-谁?
- Well, they do. - Who?

571
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,900
那伙美国人
The Americans.

572
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,360
启动

573
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,770
慢着
Wait a minute.

574
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:30,290
派不上用场  何必带电钻?
Exactly. Why would they bring the drill if they weren't planning to use it?

575
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,590
-怎么了?   -天啊
- What? - Oh, God.

576
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,270
-什么事?   -我不知道
- What? - I don't know.

577
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:59,810
请按播放键

578
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:09,600
恭喜了  你是今晚第二个成功侵入的小偷
Congratulations. You are the second person to crack the van der Woude safe tonight.

579
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:13,200
欧逊先生  你就跟一大堆... 
In arriving second, Mr. Ocean, you have joined a long line...

580
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:16,370
辛苦卖力的二流小偷一样赌上生命却只能沦为第二名
...of people who've worked hard and risked a great deal only to get somewhere second.

581
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:25,170
你不会记得这些人的名字  因为他们都默默无闻
You don't know these people by name, of course, because they enter oblivion.

582
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,140
你知道默默无闻这句成语吗?
You know this word, "oblivion"?

583
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,450
意思是被世人永远遗忘
It means to be totally forgotten by everyone forever.

584
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:35,610
你只是靠贝拉吉赌场那一票出名
And it's where you would be now if it weren't for the Bellagio heist.

585
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:37,780
这家伙怎么知道我们是谁?
How does this guy know who we are?

586
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,360
其实是我害你们大老远跑来这儿
In a way, I'm responsible for you coming to Amsterdam in the first place.

587
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:45,560
我请松井找你们干这一票
I hired Matsui, and Matsui hired you.

588
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,000
他就是向班奈狄泄密的家伙
That's the guy who dimed us to Benedict.

589
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,470
-他们全部?包括欧逊?  -对
- All of them, including Ocean. - Yes.

590
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,840
一个
月
之前

591
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,840
我不信  你是谁?
I find that hard to believe. And you are?

592
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,000
你可以叫我夜狐
You can call me the Night Fox.

593
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,580
夜狐?夜狐先生
The Night Fox. Okay, Mr. Night Fox.

594
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,850
-这消息要多少钱?   -放心  不用钱
- What will this information cost me? - Don't worry. Nothing.

595
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:09,960
不用钱?少唬我  没有什么是不用钱的
Nothing? Who do you think you're dealing with? Nothing costs nothing.

596
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:12,790
这消息的价值很难用钱衡量
And this information is definitely worth something.

597
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,800
姑且说咱们目前的兴趣相同
Let's just say our interests are temporarily aligned.

598
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:18,700
怎么说?
How so?

599
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:22,430
我不要钱  不过我有一些条件
Well, the information is free, but it comes with certain conditions.

600
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:25,800
-什么条件?   -你必须有点节制
- Such as? - Restraint on your part.

601
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:29,780
节制?这要求很高  还有呢?
Restraint? That's asking a lot. What else?

602
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:32,440
给他们两个礼拜时间去凑钱
Two weeks to buy themselves out of trouble.

603
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,240
两个礼拜
Two weeks?

604
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:38,120
我能接受  虽然他们不见得能
I can live with that, even if they can't.

605
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:42,620
我很好奇  你要多少钱?
Just out of curiosity, what will you make them pay?

606
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:47,820
饶他们一命?他们偷走的钱加上利息
For letting them live? Everything they stole, plus interest.

607
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:50,330
很高的利息
A lot of interest.

608
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,530
那笔钱保险公司都赔给你了
But didn't your insurance cover what was stolen?

609
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,330
没错
Of course.

610
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,130
你要他们加倍偿还这笔钱
So you're asking them to double your money?

611
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:00,300
你不觉得不公平吗?
Well, do you really think that's fair?

612
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,910
不公平?越不公平越好  你说的消息呢?
Fair? I certainly hope not. So, what about the information?

613
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:08,270
就在你办公桌上
Okay. It's on your desk.

614
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:15,280
他半夜三点半来过这儿
He was here. Around 3:30 this morning. I can tell.

615
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,450
-谁?  -夜狐
- Who? - The Night Fox.

616
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,290
到丹客提咖啡馆抓松井
Go down to the Dampkring and pick up a guy called Matsui.

617
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,490
真名是伊恩尼可拉麦纳利
Real name, Ian Nicolas McNally.

618
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:30,330
夜狐跟美国人同时下手?为什么?
The Night Fox was here at the same time as the Americans? Why?

619
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:33,500
所以我们要查出真相呀
That's what we're gonna find out.

620
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:39,980
他在干嘛?
What is he doing?

621
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,210
把他叫出来
Get him out of there.

622
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,750
天啊
God.

623
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,640
那家伙守口如瓶

624
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:15,610
要他开口比登天还难

625
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:36,330
指甲美容院

626
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,540
你好  法兰克
Hello, Frank.

627
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,080
咱们到底是哪里惹到这家伙?
I can't understand what we did to this guy.

628
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:54,950
-他干嘛对我们不爽?  -他又怎么弄到密码的?
- Why does he have it out for us like this? - How did he get that code?

629
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:58,460
这不重要  他犯了行规  被列入黑名翠
Doesn't matter. He broke rule number one. He's on the list.

630
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:00,220
这节骨眼还要争地盘
Great time for a turf war.

631
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,920
我跟法兰克的朋友通过电话  她会查出这家伙名宇
I spoke with Frank's associate in Dublin. She's trying to get us a name on this guy.

632
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,860
火车明天一点半出发
Our train leaves tomorrow at 1:38, okay?

633
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,100
-法兰克人呢?   -我不知道
- Where is Frank? - I don't know.

634
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:15,610
这件丑事一定会传出去  到时候我们会没案子接
It's gonna get out. Then we'll be dead, and no one will wanna work with us.

635
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:18,280
清理客房
Housekeeping.

636
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:32,060
我要为莱恩先生整理房问
Turndown service for Mr. Ryan.

637
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,100
嗨
Hi.

638
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,310
很棒的套房
Nice room.

639
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,070
你一个人住吗?
You have it all to yourself?

640
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:57,650
你要抓我吗?
You here to take me in?

641
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:03,120
我为什么要抓你?你又没有偷东西
Why would I do that? It's not as if you stole something.

642
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,650
罗伯  很高兴能再见到你
It's nice to see you again, Robert.

643
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:09,590
我也是
You too.

644
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:14,790
当然罗  你经常来看我
Of course, you've been seeing plenty of me, haven't you?

645
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,310
我喜欢这张
I like this one.

646
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,470
我取名为"小偷加冰淇淋"
I call it "thief ?la mode. "

647
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:32,290
你用了舒曼那一招
Schumann Special, huh?

648
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,390
谁叫我当时那么大嘴巴告诉你
I guess that's what I get for opening my mouth.

649
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,430
夜狐怎么样?
So, what about the Night Fox?

650
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,830
他有没有留言给你?
Did he leave you a message?

651
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,360
小玩偶还在吗?
What about the figurine? You still have it?

652
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:52,300
我猜这算是一种赞美
I suppose it's a compliment in a way.

653
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:57,810
他觉得你是个对手  我倒不这么认为
I guess he's threatened by you, though I can't imagine why.

654
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,510
你不知道他有多厉害
You have no idea what you're up against.

655
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,280
法国警方认为  他比勒马克强
The French police think he's better than LeMarc.

656
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:07,510
他是法国人
Well, he is French.

657
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,220
我给你个良心建议
Let me give you some advice.

658
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:15,390
查出你怎么惹毛了他  向他道歉求饶
Find out how you offended him. Apologize. Beg for mercy.

659
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,200
我得走了
Got to go.

660
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:26,140
想传话给法兰克吗?他在警局里
Any message for Frank? He's been hanging around the station.

661
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:28,110
什么罪名?
On what charge?

662
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:33,480
犯罪现场找到一双战斗靴的印子
Well, we found a print of a size 14 Hi-Tec Magnum boot at the crime scene.

663
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:35,450

用盗刷信用卡买的
Bought with a fraudulent credit card.

665
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:44,050
而且阿姆斯特丹只有一两家高级指甲美容院
From that point on, well, there's only one, maybe two great nail salons in Amsterdam.

666
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:04,010
-你骗了我们  -也骗了我
- And you lied to us. - Yeah, and to me.

667
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,840
法兰克早就知道了
Well, Frank knew.

668
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:11,110
-他知道你跟她联络?  -我没跟她联络
- Frank knew you were in touch? - I wasn't in touch.

669
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:13,350
只是跟踪她
I was more like keeping tabs.

670
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,450
-她是个警察 　-其实是警探
- She's a cop! - Detective, actually.

671
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:19,320

00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,020
-他也是警察?  -他是小偷
- What, he was a cop? - Thief.

673
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,290

674
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:27,400
抓狂前女友的神偷老爸
Great. Pissed-off ex-girlfriend whose thief father...

675
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:29,700
把一身本领传授给她
...taught her every trick in the book.

676
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,740
她认得出丹尼跟小颜了
Well, she just made Danny and Yen.

677
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:35,870
过两天欧洲每一间警局就会有你们的照片

679
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:41,280
-是警探 　-她老爸是同行
- Detectives. - You'd think she'd have sympathy for us...

680
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:45,650
-也许会同情我们 　-同情还是怜悯?
...if her old man was a thief. - Is that sympathy or empathy?

681
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:49,780
她九岁那年老爸就被逮捕  后来死在牢里
No, her old man got popped a day before her 9th birthday. Died in jail.

682
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,550
她不会同情或怜悯我们
So I wouldn't count on much sympathy. Or empathy.

683
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:56,230
饭店一定受到监视
She's gonna have the hotel under surveillance.

684
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,100
这下只能叫客房服务  看电视  直到班奈狄干掉我们
Great. We'll just eat room service, watch movies and wait for Benedict to kill us.

就是转机
...is an opportunity in disguise.

688
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,810
他死到临头就不会这么说了
He couldn't say that with a. 45 in his mouth.

689
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,170
你们要往好处想
No, you're missing the silver lining here.

690
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:16,250
她给了个名字"夜狐"
Now, she gave us a name, didn't she? The Night Fox.

691
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:20,990

The team's in Rotterdam. The bag's in Brussels.

696
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:05,780
一个现代人和社会完全断线
He's the modern man: Disconnected, frightened...

697
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,660
惊慌失措  六神无主
...paranoid, but with good reason.

698
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:12,290
太惨了  不好笑
It's too sad to be funny. Unusable.

I got it. The team's in Barcelona. The bag's in Madrid.

701
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,110
太夸张了  这是不道德的
This is a moral issue we're dealing with here.

702
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,040
而且又失去一位好手  因为他被困在一个袋子里
And we don't have a grease man anymore, because he's in a bag somewhere.

703
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,710
可以叫他袋子男
We got a bag man.

704
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,320
你真是个没心肝的禽兽
Such an ape. An animal with no feelings.

- Maybe he should've asked me. - Nobody should ever ask you anything.

719
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:22,560
他已经够难过了  你还这样
That guy doesn't have a hard enough life right now? You gotta...

720
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,710
你在替他说话?他把小颜塞进手提袋耶
You're gonna defend him? They put Yen in a handbag.

721
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:30,510
-我问你... 你有没有注意到 　-想问什么就直说
- Can I ask you something? Ever notice...? - Lf you're gonna ask a question...

722
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,480
除非这句话是口头禅
...give me time to respond, unless it's rhetorical...

723
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:35,950

Don't worry. You'll be dead in five days, and I'll get my paintings back.

778
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:11,020
-除非你先出意外 　-我想不会吧  丹尼
- Unless you have an accident first. - I don't think so, Daniel.

779
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,490
让我解释  我为何要折磨你
Perhaps I should explain to you why I'm tormenting you.

780
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,820
请说
I'd like that.

781
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,900
上个月我到葡萄牙见我师父
Last month I was in Portugal to see my mentor.

782
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:21,660
-勒马克 　-没错
- LeMarc. - Indeed.

783
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:27,640
那天来了一个大嘴巴的美国佬
A very loud and annoying American businessman was there the same day.

784
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,240
他替一家保险公司做事
He worked for a big insurance company.

785
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:34,970
他就是建议你向班奈狄下手的人
He's the one who suggested Benedict to you as a potential mark.

786
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:37,450
-你认识他吗?  -他怎么样?
- You know the man? - What about him?

787
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:40,780
他说那是他见过最高明的窃案
He said it was the most beautiful job he'd ever seen.

788
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,360
他一直说个不停  最后还说
He went on and on about this job, and then he said...

789
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:47,430
这证明你是世上最伟大的神偷
...it showed you were the greatest thief in the world.

790
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:51,590
最槽的是  勒马克并没有反驳
But the worst part is that LeMarc never corrected him.

791
00:59:55,800 --> 01:00:00,400
我说你不可能比我更厉害
I told LeMarc that you can't be better than me.

792
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:04,640
他却说  这永远无法确定
And he answered that it was impossible to know for sure.

793
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:10,750
我为了这件事茶不思饭不想  整整想了三个礼拜
So I thought about that for, like, three weeks in a row, day and night.

794
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:16,050
后来  我突然觉悟了他说得没错
And then suddenly, I realized that he was actually right.

795
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:19,720
两个小偷没办法同台较劲
It is impossible to compare one theft to the other.

796
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:26,530
想要一较高下  唯一的办法... 
So I guess the only way to know who's the best of us for sure...

797
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:30,000
就是去偷同一样东西
...is to go after the same object. Do the same job.

798
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:33,330
你不觉得这样很好玩吗?
Don't you think that would be fun?

799
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:38,980
你为了玩这无聊游戏枉顾人命
You're being awfully cavalier with a lot of people's lives so you can play out a game.

800
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,570
你一定会后悔的
You're gonna regret it.

801
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,050
别傻了  欧逊先生
Come on, Mr. Ocean.

802
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:50,420
你弄不到九千七百万美元的
How are you gonna possibly get $97 million by next Wednesday?

803
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:55,550
我会把每一个保险箱偷光
Especially if every safe you crack between now and then is already empty?

804
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:58,030
如果你接受挑战  赢了这场比赛
Whereas if you accept my challenge and win...

805
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,830
我就帮你还钱给班奈狄
...I promise I'll pay your debt to Benedict...

806
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,770
勒马克会帮我保管这笔钱
...and LeMarc will hold my money in escrow as a guarantee.

807
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:13,940
我们要偷什么?
What are we stealing?

808
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:15,740
巴黎

809
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,150
着名的俄国沙皇加冕彩蛋
The famous Faberg?Coronation Egg.

810
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:21,550
-这是你还是勒马克的主意?  -他应该会同意... 
- Was that your idea or LeMarc's? - I think he would agree...

811
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,950
这是最好的目标
...that it's the most appropriate thing for us to compete over.

812
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:26,990
它在哪里
Where is it located?

813
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:30,390
今天一早从巴黎送到罗马
The egg left Paris this morning on its way to Rome.

814
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:35,090
一路上戒备森严  有一个或更多复制品
It travels with heavy security and usually with one or more replicas.

815
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:39,540
有时候展览的  也可能是复制品
Sometimes they even show the replicas without anybody knowing.

816
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:42,570
彩蛋将在星期一一早开始展览
When the egg goes on display Monday morning...

817
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:46,810
你要在48小时内偷出来
...you'll have 48 hours to steal it before your deadline's up.

818
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:50,210
期限到了  你没把它偷出来
When the deadline passes and you don't have the egg...

819
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:53,580
勒马克就知道... 谁才是第一名
...LeMarc will know who's the best.

820
01:01:57,730 --> 01:02:02,030

824

他说他在甘特那儿
He said if you called, to say he was at Gunther's.

825
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:25,510
他有说他在那儿干什么吗?
Gunther's? What's that about? Did he say something?

826
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:27,180
要我传话吗?
Do you have a message?

827
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:31,120
好  跟他说价钱要加倍
Yes, I do. Tell him this thing is gonna cost him double what I told him.

828
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:34,960

And tell him I had to go three times as thin on the layers.

如果他明天就要  价钱就会更高
And tell him if he wants it tomorrow, it should cost him more than double.

830

跟他说我人很好  还有他打扮得像牛郎
And tell him I'm being a nice guy. And tell him he dresses like a gigolo.

Is that it?

834
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:58,950
等等  跟他说找了个性感女助手

Because LeMarc stole it in 1980 when 23 others failed.

This is ridiculous. You say the egg will be stolen.

859
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:23,960
又说勒马克24年前就把它偷走了
Then you say LeMarc already stole it 24 years ago.

It's complicated, but it's got a high success rate. The only problem is...

879
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:36,250
小颜不上场  就办不到
We can't do it without a grease man on the inside, without Yen.

880
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:41,490
只好冒险让他乔装上阵了
We'll have to risk it. We'll put him in disguise.

01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:40,580
-很好 　-10点45分我们被逮捕
- Great. - 10:45, we all get arrested.

903
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,160
没错
You bet.

904
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,720
-杜鲁怎样?   -老样子
- How was Toulour? - He was predictable.

905
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:47,090
奈格有消息吗?
You hear from Nagel?

906
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:48,660
他会来
He'll be here.

907
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:51,230
奈格那种人不太可靠
That's a lot to presume from a guy like Nagel.

908
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,990
你要催他
Follow it up.

909
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,500
我是伊莎贝
This is Isabel.

910
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:05,270
这是约翰  你六点要跟安卓西蒙碰面
It's Johan. I just set a 6:00 meeting for you with an Andre Ciment...

911
01:08:05,450 --> 01:08:10,150
他在科木湖的豪宅丢了四幅名画
...who says he had four paintings stolen from his house in Lake Como.

912
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,310
-什么时候?  -礼拜五
- And when was this? - Sometime Friday.

913
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:15,050
莫内两幅  透纳和窦加各一幅
He's missing two Monets, a Turner and a Degas.

914
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:17,520
-窦加的哪一幅?  -《蓝色舞群》
- Which Degas was it? - Blue Dancers.

915
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:22,390
他说监视摄影机有录到窃贼  不过还没有确认
Supposedly, there's surveillance video, but I haven't been able to confirm that yet.

916
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:24,930
关键是更正错误
It is all about error correction.

917
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:29,870
一共有三千条透明数位细线
Three thousand separate, translucent, digital slivers...

918
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:33,170
不是我原来说的一千条
...instead of the 1000 I thought it would be.

919
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,670
幸好不必移动这玩意
Thank God it doesn't have to move.

920
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:42,850
重造光源非常麻烦  我融合了钨丝灯泡和自然光
Re-creating the lighting was a pain. It's a mixture of tungsten and real light.

921
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:46,080
不过  色彩校正很精准
But I think the color rendition is pretty damn accurate.

922
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:50,280
电池藏在基座  最多两分钟
Batteries are in the base. Two minutes maximum.

923
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,050
你很厉害
You're good.

924
01:08:52,230 --> 01:08:55,220
真的很棒  你是个天才 　我的确是
- It's good, Roman. You're a genius. - I think I am.

925
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:59,200
你们没有我  根本就进不去
You'd have never got past that grid.

926
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:01,270
所以价钱要加倍
That's why you're paying me double.

927
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,530
-什么?不行 　-我给你留了言
- What? No, no, no. - You got my message.

928
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:07,200
-那个性感声音很像庞德女郎 　-什么留言?
- Who's that sexy phone voice? Early Bond. - What message?

929
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:10,370
我给性感美女的留言呀
The message I left with Sexy Phone Voice Nicole.

930
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:12,170
替你接手机的妮可
On your mobile.

931
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:15,480
甘特那一票有我的份吗?
Got something going with Gunther? Am I in?

932
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:19,880
-你几时留的言?  -两天前
- Okay, when did you leave the message? - Two days ago.

933
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,180
她替你接手机
She had your phone.

934
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:25,590
-她拿了你的...   -对
- She has your...? - Yeah.

935
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,030
-这代表她...   -没错
- That means that she's...? - Yeah.

936
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,070
-那你最好...  -是啊
- Well, you better... - Yeah.

937
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:36,560
-这下可好了 　-我意思是... 
- That's great. - I mean...

938
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:41,070
我的钱呢?
So...? So who's got my money?

939
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:47,240
谁来付我钱?
Who has got my bloody money?

940
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,530
天啊
Jesus.

941
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,580
我听说你妈过世了  我很遗憾
Sorry to hear about your mom.

942
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:26,650
她很了不起
She was an amazing...

943
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:29,150
至少我是这么想
Well, I thought so, at least.

944
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:33,020
她讨厌你  我早该想到了
She hated you. I should've picked up on that.

945
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,600
-她最讨厌小偷 　-怪不得你们常吵架
- She hated all thieves. - No wonder you fought.

946
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,030
什么?
Excuse me?

947
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,500
-手机还我 　-不要
- May I have my phone back? - No.

948
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:45,100
-手法很高明 　-谢了
- That's a nice pull, by the way. - Thanks.

949
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:48,970
你下手时有没有很爽?
Did you get that tingling sensation down your spine when you did it?

950
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:51,410
也许我不该过问
Or is that none of my business?

951
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:56,380
你想改行吗?
You considered a career change?

952
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:58,040
你想吗?
Have you?

953
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:02,390
我开过饭店
I tried hotels.

954
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,960
但我干这行比较行
I'm better at this.

955
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,630
我去吃了提拉米苏
Went by the caf?for some tiramisu.

956
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,960
-跟以前不一样了 　-夜狐是谁?
- It wasn't the same. - Who's the Night Fox?

957
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:16,870
-师傅用的蛋不一样 　-你为什么接受这个挑战?
- They did something to the eggs. - Why accept his challenge?

958
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:19,570
因为他会输
Because he'll lose.

959
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:21,270
你们能赢他?
And how can you beat him?

960
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,810
不能
We can't.

961
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:26,040
那我就不懂了
You're not making any sense.

962
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:27,770
好吧
Okay.

963
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:36,390
你跟法兰克犯下了宝格丽窃案
The Bulgari job you pulled with Frank when we were together...

964
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:38,840
我早就猜到是你
...I knew it was you.

965
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:44,560
你为什么不说?
Why didn't you say something?

966
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,630
你为什么不说?
Why didn't you...

967
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:51,630
罗伯?
...Robert?

968
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:54,910
我不想要结束我们之间的事
I didn't want it to end.

969
01:11:58,280 --> 01:11:59,650
那是你自己猜会结束的
You assumed it would.

970
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:02,380
我猜错了吗?
Was I wrong?

971
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,450
你不该来的
You shouldn't be here.

972
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:11,180
我得去开会了
I have a meeting.

973
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,590
有人在科木湖偷了名画
Someone stole a whole bunch of paintings in Lake Como.

974
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:19,000
是吗?有线索吗?
Interesting. Any leads?

975
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:20,530
下次我见到你... 
The next time I see you...

976
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,270
肯定把你跟欧逊... 
...I'm arresting you.

977
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:27,700
和我认得的人全都抓起来
And Ocean and anybody else I recognize.

978
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,340
好吧
Fair enough.

979
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:29,900
-好了吗?  -好了
- Ready? - Right.

980
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:41,440
法语

981
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:47,080
对不起  你会讲英文吗?

982
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:48,750
当然会
Yes, of course I do.

983
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:51,150
窦加的《蓝色舞群》
My Blue Dancers, my Degas.

984
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:54,120
他们偷走了  我很想... 
They took it, unfortunately, and I really would like...

985
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,160
你有仇家吗?
Do you have any enemies?

986
01:13:56,330 --> 01:13:59,430
你有得罪过什么人吗?
Anybody out there who would feel wronged by you?

987
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:05,470
没有啊  我想不出来
No. I can't see anyone.

988
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,200
你认为那个贼... 
But why? You think... You think maybe the thief...

989
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:10,440
是冲着我来?
...is trying to harm me personally now?

990
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:13,410
我以为他是为了那些画
Well, I assumed he was after the paintings themselves.

991
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:14,810
那些画很值钱
I think it's enough.

992
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:16,180
好了吗?
Ready?

993
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,130
行吗?
Good?

994
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:30,890
我有样东西  你可能会有兴趣
I have something you might be interested in.

995
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:36,440
我房子的监视摄影机DVD
It's a DVD with all the hidden surveillance cameras I have to my place.

996
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:39,340
我有很多  我还没看过
It's plenty. I haven't checked it out yet.

997
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:42,810
也许小偷会不小心被拍到
Maybe the thieves have been careless enough to be photographed.

998
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:46,070
他们很高明  应该不会  不过我会看看
I doubt it, this level of thief, but I'll take a look.

999
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:47,510
搞不好有拍到
Yeah. You never know.

1000
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:49,610
谢谢
Okay. Well, merci.

1001
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:54,080
谢谢你  谢谢你的帮忙
Thank you, Mademoiselle Lahiri, for everything.

1002

你收到1077表格传真了吗?
Did you get the faxed copy of the 1077? Good.

1005
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:08,470
很好  听好  我要调动十二名制服员警
Here's what I need: A dozen... Twelve uniformed officers.

金属探测器  额外摄影机
Metal detectors, extra cameras.

1007
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:16,470

So I'll e-mail you the photographs. Do you happen to have a pen?

1008
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:19,270
我告诉你姓名
I'll just give you the names. Okay.

1017
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:04,230
睡觉啊  你穿好衣服干嘛?   
- What...? Sleeping. Why are you dressed?

1018
01:16:04,230 --> 01:16:06,250
五点半了  该出发了
- It's 5:30, day of. We gotta go. Let's go.

1019
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,120
现在才十一点半
It's 11:30.

1020
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,930
前一天的晚上
The night before.

1021
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:17,670
但是... 
But...

1022
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:25,670
他好贱哦  他好坏哦
Oh, he's mean. He's just mean-spirited.

1023
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:27,910
-你喝了几杯浓缩咖啡?   -五杯
- How many espressos did you have? - Five.

1024
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,740
进来吧
Yeah, come on.

1025
01:16:39,630 --> 01:16:41,620
我不知道她是闹脾气... 
I don't know if she's just confused...

1026
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,630
还是真的把我恨之入骨
...or she's really turned the corner and hates me now.

1027
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:48,470
我做得到底对不对?
You think I handled this wrong?

1028
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:51,470
我太霸道  太像美国佬了
I was too forceful. I was too American.

1029
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,400
她跟我们不同
She's different.

1030
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:57,510
你说得对  也许她不爱我了
Maybe you're right, maybe she has moved on.

1031
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:03,140
我想过要把刺青除掉
You know, I talked to a doctor about getting that tattoo removed.

1032
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:11,820
不过因为位置尴尬  医生说最好不要
But given its location, he advised against it.

1033
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:19,830
意大利配音员真不是盖的
That guy doing Potsie is unbelievable.

1034
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:35,580
第二个星期一  
只剩两天

1035
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:25,420
这家伙有什么毛病?
I mean, what's this guy's problem?

1036
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:30,320
他为了面子  整了我们两次
He's stitched us up twice in two weeks, all over his ego.

1037
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:33,660
咱们难得能好好共度一晚
It's the first decent evening we've had together in I don't know how long.

1038
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:36,700
够了  咱们谈正事吧
All right, all right, let's just stay on point here.

1039
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:38,630
再过滤一下清单
Let's go over the list again.

1040
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,170
谁死了让你当老大?
Who died and made you Danny?

1041
01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:46,740
没有啊
No one.

1042
01:20:46,910 --> 01:20:49,380
抱歉  我只是心情很乱
I'm sorry. My emotions are all over the place.

1043
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:52,040
是我不应该
I was forceful, trying to show good leadership...

1044
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:54,370
-废话少说  谈正事吧 　-你是个好领袖
- For fuck's sake. Let's go. - You're a good leader.

1045
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:55,910
谢了
Thanks.

1046
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,750
好吧  再过滤一下清单
All right, well, let's go over the list again.

1047
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,510
-假扮神父那招? -人手不够
- Swinging Priest? - Not enough people.

1048
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:02,160
-疯子赖瑞?   -人手不够
- Crazy Larry? - Not enough people.

1049
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,120
-肩头酸痛?   -人手不够
- Soft Shoulder? - Not enough people.

1050
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:06,780
-面包师傅? 找不到女生  -人手也不够
- Baker's Dozen? - No woman and not enough people.

1051
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,360
菜篮族地狱?
Hell in a Hand basket?

1052
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:12,930
没时间训练猫咪  人手还是不够
We can't train a cat that quickly. And not enough people.

1053
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:17,730
-泰丝呢?   -她怎么样?
- What about Tess? - What about her?

1054
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:20,140
她长得有点像
Well, you know how she kind of looks like...

1055
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:22,210
-又怎样?  -是啊  你想说什么?
- So what? - Yeah, what's your point?

1056
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:24,310
用声东击西那一招
So we do a Lookie-loo.

1057
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:28,950
-声东击西加上混水摸鱼 　-找泰丝... 
- It's a Lookie-loo with a Bundle of Joy. - A Lookie-loo with Tess...

1058
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,450
用这两招?
...and a Bundle of Joy?

1059
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:33,380
你发疯了  小子
You've gone right out of your tree, my son. He's mad.

1060
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:36,960
他疯了  简直异想天开  而且还缺一个人
It's crazy. It's Italian-television crazy, and we're still one short.

1061
01:21:37,130 --> 01:21:40,120
想想看  她能在白天接近彩蛋
No, think about it. She can get near the egg during daylight with half the system down.

1062
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:42,260
保安系统至少能解除一半

1063
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:44,360
这是一石三鸟之计
I mean, that's a trifecta.

1064
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:51,810
他说得有道理  打电话
He might be right. Make the calls.

1065
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:58,210
莱纳斯卡得威  你这臭小子
Linus Caldwell, you are not following the procedures...

1066
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:01,110
你没按照我跟丹尼说好的程序
...Danny talked about if Terry Benedict shows up.

1067
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,080
一定出了事  出了什么事?
Something is wrong. What is wrong?

1068
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:04,840
丹尼没事  他跟罗斯在一起
Danny's fine. He's with Rusty.

1069
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:08,220
只是现在他们处于失去联络状态
During this part of the plan, they can't communicate with us.

1070
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:09,820
向我保证他没受伤
Promise he isn't hurt.

1071
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:12,260
我保证他没受伤
I promise he isn't hurt.

1072
01:22:13,230 --> 01:22:14,860
你们会错过期限
You're gonna miss the deadline.

1073
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:18,760
我想这一票干完  丹尼一定很想在罗马见到你
Danny would be thrilled if you met him in Rome when the job's finished.

1074
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:20,400
他想你想得要命
He misses you like crazy.

1075
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:23,500
你念过艺术  一定很爱罗马
Plus, you studied art, so I know how much you love Rome.

1076
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:25,940
只有好处  没有坏处
There's no downside here.

1077
01:22:27,410 --> 01:22:30,000
他们把你调教得真好
Wow, they're bringing you along fast, aren't they?

1078
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:32,200
是啊  如果你搭上七点的... 
Yes. Danny would be more thrilled...

1079
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:36,650
... 班机就太棒了  你现在就得出门
...if you were on the 7 p. m. Out of JFK, which means you have to leave right now.

1080
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,870
第二个星期二 
 只剩一天

1081
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:08,680
我只要求一台中型房车
I thought I'd requested a midsize.

1082
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:12,080
-丹尼有来吗?  -他很想来
- Danny here? - He wanted to be.

1083
01:23:18,230 --> 01:23:22,490
这趟飞行舒适吗?我不确定你要走道或窗口座位
Did you have a nice flight? We weren't sure if you were a window or aisle person.

1084
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:26,030
-丹尼被关了多久?   -只有两天  真的
- How long's Danny been in jail? - Just a couple of days, really.

1085
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:30,870
往好处想  班奈狄动不了他
Which, you know, on the bright side, he's completely safe from Benedict.

1086
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,740
他说一切OK  居然敢骗我
He told me everything was fine. He lied right to me.

1087
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:37,670
我想他的意思是  我们的时间和金钱都不多
What I think he meant by "fine" is we're running low on time and money...

1088
01:23:37,850 --> 01:23:40,910
现在欠的钱  比一开始更多
...and we're deeper in debt than when we started.

1089
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,710
我想你们有计划要救他吧
I assume that you have a plan to get him out.

1090
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:47,290
-她说起话来很像她 　-才怪  她有南方口音
- Actually, she sounds like her. - No, she needs a Southern accent.

1091
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:51,020
-你会装南方腔吗?   -你们在搞什么鬼?
- Can you do a Southern...? - What the hell is going on with you guys?

1092
01:23:51,190 --> 01:23:54,790
这样不行  口音很重要  人们最注意口音
Not quite. The accent is crucial. It's the first thing people notice.

1093
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,930
-给我说清楚  开辆顶级礼车干嘛?   -抱歉
- This ridiculous car, what is it doing? - Okay, I'm sorry.

1094
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:03,770
我就直话直说吧  因为我们不幸... 
All right, I'm just gonna level with you. Due to certain personnel losses...

1095
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:06,200
折损了一些人手
...that we have sustained...

1096
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:09,430
我们得做一些调整
...we're... Various readjustments had to be made.

1097
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:12,410
你要扮演一个小角色
You're gonna have to play a small role in this thing.

1098
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:14,450
请你把这个戴上
Okay? So can you put these on?

1099
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:18,710
还有这顶帽子
I'd like you to put this hat on.

1100
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:22,380
穿上孕妇装  底下塞枕头
You're gonna put on that, and you're gonna stuff it with that.

1101
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:27,220
我们转过去  给你点隐私
And we'll turn around, just give you a little moment.

1102
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,230
小角色
Small role.

1103
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,420
我要扮谁?
Who am I supposed to be?

1104
01:24:32,630 --> 01:24:33,930
这个嘛... 
Well...

1105
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:37,670
真的吗?
Oh, really?

1106
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,170
没问题
Well, absolutely.

1107
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:45,470
我们可以把套房空出来
I can have... We can make the suite available.

1108
01:24:45,650 --> 01:24:47,440
不会麻烦
No, no, no trouble at all.

1109
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:52,080
这真是太... 她再度莅临  我们深感荣幸
I mean, we would love... We are honored that she would think of us again.

1110
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:53,850
好的
Okay.

1111
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:55,460
谢谢
Okay. Thank you.

1112
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:57,490
再见
Bye.

1113
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,990
茱莉亚罗勃兹要来

1114
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:09,830
这要怎么把丹尼救出来?
How is this going to get Danny out?

1115
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,240
-我们需要一个名人 　-怎么不去找一个?
- We needed someone famous. - Why didn't you get someone famous?

1116
01:25:13,410 --> 01:25:16,040
回想《你是我今生的新娘》
Just think Four Weddings and a Funeral.

1117
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:18,370
那部电影不是她演的
She wasn't in Four Weddings and a Funeral.

1118
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:21,540
要说"我"  不是"我"演的
"I." "I wasn't in Four Weddings and a Funeral. "

1119
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:23,710
保护你的假胎儿
Just protect your fake baby.

1120
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,150
天啊  我快昏倒了
I'm hyperventilating.

1121
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:30,550
-欢迎  罗勃兹小姐 　-谢谢  她很累了
- Welcome back, Signora Roberts. - Thank you. She's very tired.

1122
01:25:32,190 --> 01:25:33,790
-拿吧  拿吧  -好
- Take it. Take it. - Okay.

1123
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:38,360
快躲起来
Oh, let's hide. Let's hide.

1124
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:41,530
茱莉亚?
Julia?

1125
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:44,070
我叫泰莉莎
My name is Teresa.

1126
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:49,030
意大利语

1127
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:52,210
我好像见到一位好朋友
I thought I saw a friend of mine, someone that I know.

1128
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:56,010
不  不能关掉压力感测器  不
No, absolutely not. You can't turn off the pressure sensors. No.

1129
01:25:57,420 --> 01:25:58,750
她不能碰
Well, she can't touch it.

1130
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:02,150
她只是电影明星  不是教宗
She's a movie star. She's not the pope, for Chris sake.

1131
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:05,120
你是乔治亚州人  67年出生
You're from Smyrna, Georgia. You were born in 1967.

1132
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:08,350
-你喜欢织毛衣 　-中间名是费欧娜
- You like croquet and knitting. - Your middle name is Fiona.

1133
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:10,360
你有十只狗和七匹马
You've got 10 dogs, seven horses.

1134
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:14,130
-你最喜欢桃子的颜色 　-她的马没有比狗多啦
- Your favorite color is peach. - She doesn't have more horses than dogs.

1135
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:17,000
-我不行  我办不到 　-泰丝  没时间了
- I can't do this. I can't. - Tess, we're out of time.

1136
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:18,400
-叫她茱莉亚 　-茱莉亚
- "Julia," please. - Julia.

1137
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:22,200
我知道你很没安全感  这就对了
No, we understand you're feeling insecure. That is totally natural.

1138
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:26,940
-电影明星都很没安全感 　-不是啦  我快抓狂了
- You're playing an actress. They're insecure. - No, I'm not insecure. I'm freaking out.

1139
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,710
-这就对了 　-你演得很棒
- Yes. That's right. - Brilliant!

1140
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,110
你在演戏
You're playing a role.

1141
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:33,620
你才在演戏  我在冒充一个人
No, you're playing a role. I'm apparently playing a real person.

1142
01:26:33,790 --> 01:26:37,880
-又怎样?   -这是不对的
- Yeah, so? - It's just wrong.

1143
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:43,960
你是说很没道德吗?
You mean, like, morally?

1144
01:26:44,130 --> 01:26:46,530
不是啦  对... 是啦
No. Well, yes.

1145
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:50,560
这不是重点  你要我冒充一个... 
Probably... It's not the point. The point is you want me to speak...

1146
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:53,540
活生生的真人  这太过分了
...for someone who's out there somewhere. It's too personal.

1147
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:56,230
你要害你老公坐一辈子牢吗?
More personal than your husband doing 25-to-life?

1148
01:26:56,410 --> 01:26:59,870
他不会坐太久的牢  班奈狄会马上把他做掉
He won't do 25-to-life. Benedict will have him killed immediately.

1149
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:02,020
-不要 　-抱歉  我不该这么说
- Don't. - I'm sorry, that was stupid.

1150
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:06,210
从进去到出来只要花十分钟  我们也只有十分钟
We're gonna be in and out in 10 minutes. We have to. That's our time frame.

1151
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:10,150
你不想说话就别开口  只要微笑对着镜头挥手就行
You don't even have to talk. Give them a big smile, wave at the cameras.

1152
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,350
-她只会这一招 　-要是开口... 
- That's all she ever does. - But if you do say something...

1153
01:27:13,530 --> 01:27:17,360
别忘了南方口音  去掉尾音  母音轻声带过
...don't forget your accent. Drop your G's, and longer vowels.

1154
01:27:17,530 --> 01:27:19,000
客房服务
Room service.

1155
01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:21,860
不会有事的  你只要记住
It's gonna be fine. You've gotta remember something.

1156
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:25,060
你只是个明星  影迷的偶像
You are an image to these people. You're like an object.

1157
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:29,400
没人真的认识你  你不会碰到任何朋友
Nobody actually knows you. The last thing this is gonna be is personal.

1158
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,550
-你的预产期不是过了吗?   -你跑来罗马干嘛?
- Aren't you overdue? - Why are you in Rome?

1159
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:39,650

我是伊莎贝  幸会
Isabel Lahiri. Nice to meet you.

1282
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:32,530
你是真的有男友... 
Do you really have a boyfriend?

1283
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:36,760
还是在骗他们?
Or were you just...? Was that just part of the whole thing with them?

1284
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:16,870
进行得如何?
So how'd it go?

1285
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:51,280
你是拉希芮?
You Lahiri?

1286
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:54,680
我是联邦调查局分局局长莫莉史塔
I'm Section Chief Molly Starr.

1287
01:35:54,850 --> 01:35:58,940
我跟欧洲刑警组织葛斯曼组长谈过
I spoke to a very nice man at Europol this morning, Commissioner Greisman.

1288
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,920
他要你搭机回阿姆斯特丹
He wants you on the next flight to Amsterdam.

1289
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:05,180
你的文件有一点问题
There seems to be some irregularity with your paperwork.

1290
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:08,890
意大利语

1291
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:41,420
那一个
That one.

1292
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,760
先从那小子开始
Let's start with that one.

1293
01:36:45,270 --> 01:36:48,200
想像你在一个房间
Imagine yourself in a room...

1294
01:36:48,370 --> 01:36:53,400
低到你站不直  窄到你躺不平的房间
...that's too short for you to stand up in and not wide enough for you to lie down in.

1295
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:56,770
没有灯  没有暖气
A room with no light, no heat...

1296
01:36:56,940 --> 01:37:00,710
石樯上有牙齿和指甲的抓痕
...and stone walls scratched by the teeth and nails of desperate men...

1297
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:03,540
囚犯都被孤独逼疯
...men driven crazy by isolation.

1298
01:37:04,690 --> 01:37:07,380
只有老鼠与你作伴
You will have rats for company...

1299
01:37:07,550 --> 01:37:11,850
你只能从窗口看外面的世界
...and a small window that looks out on the world that has passed you by.

1300
01:37:12,390 --> 01:37:17,390
你父母有一天会老死  就跟你的梦想一样
Your parents will grow old and die, just like your dreams.

1301
01:37:17,730 --> 01:37:21,330
你朋友会遗忘你的名字  把你的故事当成他们的
Your friends will forget your name, tell your stories as their own...

1302
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:25,340
因为当事人早已从世上消失
...because what good is a story when the person who owns it has vanished?

1303
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:28,030
-你要什么?   -作证指控其他人... 
- What do you want? - Testify against the others...

1304
01:37:28,210 --> 01:37:30,180
犯下赌场窃案
...in the Benedict case.

1305
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:32,240
意大利的起诉会被撤销
The Italian charges will be dropped.

1306
01:37:32,410 --> 01:37:35,970
你们下午就被引度回美国
You and the others will be extradited to the U.S. This afternoon.

1307
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:40,150
只要认罪  就能假释出狱
Plead, and you walk with parole.

1308
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:43,650
办不到
I can't.

1309
01:37:52,030 --> 01:37:55,520
你再想想看  莱纳斯
Think about it, Linus.

1310
01:37:56,740 --> 01:38:00,070
我差点就忘了你的名宇
For a moment there, I was already forgetting your name.

1311
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:04,610
等等
Wait.

1312
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:11,450
请你等一下
Just hang on a sec.

1313
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:24,380
莱纳斯
Linus.

1314
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:28,230
谢了
Right. Thanks.

1315
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:31,120
你还好吧?
You okay?

1316
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:34,890
-我搞砸了跟松井的会面 　-松井?
- Well, I blew the meet with Matsui. - Matsui?

1317
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:38,570
让我猜  他用"鸡同鸭讲"那一招耍你
Let me guess. He pulled a Lost in Translation on you.

1318
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:44,030
他每次都用这招整新手
That's his idea of fun for first-timers.

1319
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:48,410
-我怎么会那么笨?   -别自责
- I mean... How do I not see these things? - Don't get down on yourself.

1320
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:50,310

1324
01:40:01,630 --> 01:40:03,690
-你跟爸说了?   -我们在度假
- You told Dad? - We were on vacation.

1325

对不起
I'm sorry.

1326
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:09,530
这下可好了  他一定会拿这件事一直臭我
Great. Thanks. You're gonna be dining out on this one for months.

1327
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:13,040
你老妈得大老远赶去罗马... 
"Hey, remember the time your mom had to come to Rome... "

...your entire crew got pinched. I gotta tell you something.

1410
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:18,780
你跟她长得一点都不像  鼻子是有点像  可是耳朵
You don't look anything like her. Eventually, the nose, but the ears...

1411
01:49:18,950 --> 01:49:21,320
还有你走路打扮的模样
I mean, the way you walk and you dress...

1412
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:45,340
这表示你们跟勒马克谈过
That means that you spoke to LeMarc.

1413
01:49:47,310 --> 01:49:48,910
你们去找过勒马克?
You spoke to LeMarc?

1414
01:49:55,860 --> 01:49:57,720
第二个星期四  
只剩六天

1415
01:49:57,790 --> 01:50:02,820
既然我人都死了  这件事只有我们三个知道
Since I'm dead, I think my involvement in this should stay among the three of us.

1416
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,260
-当然 　-没问题
- Of course. - Absolutely.

1417
01:50:04,430 --> 01:50:10,130
这真的很讽刺  我们的问题竟然要靠杜鲁解决
It's ironic that the solution to all of our problems will be provided by Toulour.

1418
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:15,040
我同意我美国朋友说你们比他强  的确激怒了他
I'm sure I provoked him by agreeing with my American friend that you might be better.

1419
01:50:15,210 --> 01:50:18,300
抱歉我害你们惹上这么多麻烦
I apologize sincerely for the trouble I've caused you.

1420
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:20,670
-你不用道歉 　-尤其是现在
- There's no need. - Especially now.

1421
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:25,640
你们到他的别墅去见他  开始比赛之后
Remember, from the time you see Toulour at his villa and the challenge begins...

1422
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:30,980
就要假设他会监视你们的行动
...you must assume he will have you under surveillance everywhere you go.

1423
01:50:31,490 --> 01:50:35,050
你们一定要演一场好戏
You'll have to put on a very elaborate show.

1424
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:38,390
真正的彩蛋
The egg, the real egg...

1425
01:50:38,570 --> 01:50:42,130
有人会在早上九点半用背包把它从巴黎... 
...will be carried in a backpack on a train leaving Gare du Nord...

1426
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:45,240
北站带走 　谢谢你
...at 9:30 a. m. - Thank you.

1427
01:50:45,410 --> 01:50:47,370
你救了我们一命
You saved our lives, Gaspar.

1428
01:50:47,540 --> 01:50:51,310
这证明我还是比你们厉害
Yeah. And I'm still getting the better of you.

1429
01:53:03,310 --> 01:53:05,500
我偷了复制品?
And I stole a replica?

1430
01:53:06,510 --> 01:53:10,810
你的画放在米兰的仓库
Your paintings are in a high-security warehouse in Milan.

1431
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:15,750
安德列欧迪街17号222室
It's 17 Via Andreotti, unit 222.

1432
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:21,950
-密码是23116...  　-646  谢谢
- Security code is 2-3-1-1-6... - 6-4-6. Thank you.

1433
01:53:23,860 --> 01:53:28,430
你竟然连密码都知道
Listen, all games aside, that was... That was very good.

1434
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:31,000
真厉害  你怎么知道?
That was good. How'd you do that?

1435
01:53:36,010 --> 01:53:40,170
我今晚讲一个故事就够了
Well, I told you one story tonight. I think that'll be enough. So now...

1436
01:53:40,350 --> 01:53:45,180
现在请你们... 请走吧
...if you, both of you, could please... Now.

1437
01:54:19,590 --> 01:54:23,540
-这是谁的房子?   -我在巴黎认识的一位小偷
- Whose house is this? - It belongs to a thief I know in Paris.

1438
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:26,180
他认识我父亲?
He knows my father?

1439
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:28,760
他比谁都了解他
Probably better than anyone.

1440
01:54:30,100 --> 01:54:31,430
他是谁?
Who is he?

1441
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:35,290
-他帮我们搞定夜狐 　-他叫什么?
- He helped with the whole Night Fox thing. - What's his name?

1442
01:54:35,470 --> 01:54:38,930
我不知道他的真名
His real name? I don't know, actually.

1443
01:54:41,870 --> 01:54:44,210
我只知道他叫勒马克
I've only known him as LeMarc.

1444
01:54:44,380 --> 01:54:46,040
勒马克?
LeMarc?

1445
01:54:58,090 --> 01:54:59,990
天啊
Oh, my God.

1446
01:55:16,580 --> 01:55:18,810
你这些日子都在哪里?
Where the hell have you been?

1447
01:55:19,850 --> 01:55:21,840
我在等
Waiting.

1448
01:55:22,450 --> 01:55:24,470
等什么?
For what?

1449
01:55:24,820 --> 01:55:26,410
这一刻
For this.

1450
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:38,960
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

1451
01:56:12,630 --> 01:56:17,360
付给:泰瑞班奈狄1亿9千8百万

1452
01:56:14,530 --> 01:56:16,560
行了吗?
So we done?

1453
01:56:16,740 --> 01:56:18,500
没事了吧?
Issue closed?

1454
01:56:19,110 --> 01:56:23,100
-这不会跳票吧?   -不会啦  相信我
- Is it actually good? - It's good. Trust me.

1455
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:26,910
我不相信你  也不相信欧逊  等支票兑现才算数
I don't trust you, and I don't trust Ocean. If it's good, we're done.

1456
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:30,170
冤冤相报  对谁都没好处
These grudges, they're awful. Nobody wins.

1457
01:56:30,350 --> 01:56:32,680
这件事让丹尼受够了
Danny's had enough of this meshugaas.

1458
01:56:32,850 --> 01:56:35,450
小偷之间的竞争比我们还槽
And the competition, it's worse than our business.

1459
01:56:35,620 --> 01:56:38,350
总是有新人想要强出头
Always some new young punk trying to prove himself.

1460
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:44,930
欧逊这种人不肯善罢干休  他们不喜欢输的感觉
Guys like Ocean, they keep coming back. They don't like to lose.

1461
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:49,030
-自尊心太强  太爱面子了  -有些人会  丹尼不会
- Too much ego, too much pride. - Maybe for some guys, but not Danny.

1462
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:52,660
你可以相信我  其实丹尼并不觉得他输了
Trust me on that. Danny don't feel like he lost in all this.

1463
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:55,710
很难令人相信  不过这是真的
It's hard to believe, but that's how he feels.

1464
01:56:55,880 --> 01:56:59,900
如果他或是别人想乱来  我会等着他们
Well, if he tries anything... If anybody tries anything, I'll be waiting.

1465
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:02,240
泰瑞  我不会算命
Terry, I can't predict the future.

1466
01:57:02,420 --> 01:57:06,010
我花大钱请的命理师都会算错
I pay professionals to do that, and even they get it wrong sometimes.

1467
01:57:06,190 --> 01:57:09,310
我不能保证没人会再抢你的钱
I can't say that nobody'll ever try to rob from you again.

1468
01:57:09,490 --> 01:57:14,220
不过我保证  万一你又吃了什么亏
But I can say this: Lf, God forbid, anything does happen to you...

1469
01:57:14,390 --> 01:57:16,490
绝不会是我们干的
...we will not be involved.

1470
01:57:16,660 --> 01:57:20,390
你最好说话算话  鲁本
You better not be, Reuben. You better not be.

1471
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:26,700
星期一晚

1472
01:57:34,410 --> 01:57:35,400
嗨
Hey.

1473
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:39,710
Good to see you guys.

1474
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:44,690
嗨

1475
01:57:44,860 --> 01:57:48,420
你们记不记得  把我整得好惨?
You don't remember? You put me through hell, and you don't remember?

1476
01:57:49,630 --> 01:57:51,720
-嗨 　-嗨

1477

1478
01:57:57,770 --> 01:57:59,240

- Five-oh-five? - Four-oh-five.

1479
01:57:59,410 --> 01:58:01,430
-谁在赢钱?  -我小赢
- Who's winning? - I'm little.

1480
01:58:01,610 --> 01:58:03,170
-你大赢 　-你是大?
- And you're big. - You're big?

1481
01:58:03,340 --> 01:58:04,780
我的天
Oh, my God.

1482
01:58:05,410 --> 01:58:07,140
-好的 　-我的天
- Hello. - Oh, my God.

1483
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:10,910
你们被捕了
You're all under arrest.

1484
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:13,180
你们全都是贼
You're thieves. You're crooks.

1485
01:58:15,250 --> 01:58:17,750
伊莎贝  李文斯顿戴尔
Isabel, Livingston Dell.

1486
01:58:18,210 --> 01:58:19,740
谢谢
Thank you.

1487
01:58:20,130 --> 01:58:21,680
是啊

1488
01:58:21,860 --> 01:58:22,950
伊莎贝泰丝
Isabel, Tess.

1489
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:25,930
这是大人的桌子  那是小朋友坐的桌子?
The adult table. That's the kids' table.

1490
01:58:26,470 --> 01:58:28,900
-让我帮你 　-我要参一脚
- Let me clear that for you. - I'm in.

1491
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:31,070
我可以再来一瓶啤酒吗?
Can I get another beer?

1492
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:34,300
-我好像认识你 　-等等  我们还没下注
- I feel I know you. - Wait, wait. We didn't... We didn't bet.

1493
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:36,000
你要五个?
You want five?

1494
01:58:39,180 --> 01:58:40,650
-五个 　-好狠啊
- Five. - So nasty.

1495
01:58:40,850 --> 01:58:42,400
好啊
Okay.

1496
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:47,470
Is that a joke?

1497
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:50,790
你就得这样搞

1498
01:58:51,460 --> 01:58:53,020
好啊
Yes.

1499
01:58:53,490 --> 01:58:56,620
-我的天啊 　-她喝醉了
