看这世界
* On the planet *

你会发觉充满神奇

想要抓

总是遥不可及
* Than can ever be done *

31
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:47,107
人生旅程
* There's far too much *

32
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,985
坎坷不平
* To take in here *

33
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,653
你要去
* More to find *

34
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,156
体会它的真谛
* Than can ever be found *

35
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,577
尝尝人情冷暖
* But the sun rolling high *

36
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,163
或是体会
* Through the sapphire sky *

37
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,290
世间的风险
* Keeps great and small *

38
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:06,251
没有办法逃避
* On the endless round *

39
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:11,548
看这世界在转
* It's the circle of life *

40
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:17,596
永远不停息
* And it moves us all *

41
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:21,934
尽管向前走
* Through despair and hope *

42
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:29,107
是对是错
* Through faith and love *

43
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:34,154
希望和失望
* Till we find our place *

44

世事没有绝对
* On the path unwinding *

看这世界
* In the circle *

是生生不息

世界正在转动
* It's the circle of life *

54
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,435
永远不停息
* And it moves us all *

55

黑夜与白昼
* Through despair and hope *

56
00:03:55,152 --> 00:04:00,699
不停转动
* Through faith and love *

57
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:06,205
靠着阳光走
* Till we find our place *

58
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:12,794
慢慢你会知道
* On the path unwinding *

59
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:17,925
看这世界
* In the circle *

60
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:24,306
是生生不息
* The circle of life *

片名：狮子王

62
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:48,664
生命真不公平啊！
Life's not fair, is it?

63
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:52,835
你看我呢，永远都当不上王
You see, I... Well, I shall never be king.

64
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:58,507
而你永远也见不到明天了
And you shall never see the light of another day.

65
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:01,176
再见
Adieu.

66
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,471
你妈妈没有教你 不要玩弄你的食物
Didn't your mother tell you not to play with your food?

67
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,473
你想干什么？
What do you want?

68
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,935
我是来这里宣布
I'm here to announce that King Mufasa's on his way.

69
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,167
大王木法沙要来了

70
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,937
所以对你今天早上 没有出席那个仪式
So you'd better have a good excuse...

71
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,605
最好找个借口
for missing the ceremony this morning.

72
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,650
你害我的午餐都没了
Oh, now, look, Zazu. You've made me lose my lunch.

73
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,110
等大王跟你算帐之后
Ha! You'll lose more than that...

74
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,653
你不见的东西还会更多
when the king gets through with you.

75
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:22,322
他就像只拉肚子的河马 一样愤怒
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.

76
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:25,951
我怕得全身发抖
Oooh. I quiver with fear!

77
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,370
好了，刀疤，不要那样看我
Now, Scar, don't look at me that way.

78
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,538
救命啊！
Help!

79
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,082
刀疤，吐出来
Scar?

80
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,458
Drop him.

81
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,712
你来得可真是时候，大王陛下
Impeccable timing, Your Majesty.

82
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,718
这不是我大哥吗？
Why, if it isn't my big brother...

83
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:46,180
屈尊降贵的 来跟我这普通人厮混
descending from on high to mingle with the commoners.

84
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,308
我跟沙拉碧在辛巴的 介绍仪式中没有看到你
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba.

85
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,435
那是今天吗？
That was today?

86
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,729
我觉得好害怕呀！
Ohh, I feel simply awful!

87
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,983
我八成是给忘了
Must've slipped my mind.

88
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,153
是呀，你忘的不只如此
Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is...

89
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,362
身为大王的弟弟 你应该站在第一位
as the king's brother...

90
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:03,906
you should've been first in line!

91
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,201
我原本是第一位 直到这个小毛球出生
Well, I was first in line...

92
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,244
until the little hairball was born.

93
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:12,080
这个小毛球是我儿子
That hairball is my son...

94
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,249
他也是你未来的国王
and your future king.

95
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,085
我该学学我的礼节啦
I shall practice my curtsy.

96
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,713
千万不要背对着我，刀疤
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.

97
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,006
不，木法沙
Oh, no, Mufasa.

98
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:24,009
或许是你不该背对着我
Perhaps you shouldn't turn your back on me.

99
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,929
Is that a challenge?

100
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,639
这是一个挑战吗？
Temper, temper.

101
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,892
冷静！冷静！
I wouldn't dream of challenging you.

102
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,983
我哪敢向大王你挑战呢？

103
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,936
可惜，为什么呢？
Pity. Why not?

104
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,356
要说脑袋的话 我是有狮子的智慧
As far as brains go, I got the lion's share.

105
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,776
说到蛮力嘛…
But when it comes to brute strength...

106
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,445
恐怕我就是基因遗传 比较不明显的例子了
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end...

107
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:44,988
of the gene pool.

108
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,369
每个家庭都会有这个问题 陛下
There's one in every family, sire.

109
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,205
事实上我家有两个
Two in mine, actually, and they always manage...

110
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,207
而且他们总会想尽办法 破坏特别的场合
to ruin special occasions.

111
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,251
我该拿他怎么办？
What am I going to do with him?

112
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,127
拿他做地毯会非常好看
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.

113
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,337
沙祖
Zazu!

114
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,756
而且想一想
And just think, whenever he gets dirty...

115
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,883
每次弄脏的时候 你可以拿出去打一打
you could take him out and beat him.

116
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,014
Simba.

117
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,862
爸，爸
Dad! Dad!

118
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,740
快起来，我们要走了啦！
Come on, Dad, we gotta go! Wake up

119
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,825
对不起
Sorry.

120
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:15,162
爸…爸…
Dad. Dad.

121
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,039
你儿子已经醒了
Your son is awake.

122
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,540
Dad, Dad, Dad...

123
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,293
在天亮前，他是你儿子
Before sunrise, he's your son.

124
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,462
爸…拜托啦！
Dad! Come on, Dad.

125
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,005
Dad!

126
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:29,718
You promised.

127
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,986
你答应过我的呀！

128
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,722
好吧，好吧
- OK, OK. I'm up. - Yeah!

129
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:34,562
我醒了，我醒了

130
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,031
辛巴，你看
Look, Simba.

131
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:55,327
阳光所照到的一切 都是我们的国土
Everything the light touches is our kingdom.

132
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,162
Wow.

133
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,206
一个国王的统治 就跟太阳的起落是相同的
A king's time as ruler...

134
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:02,084
rises and falls like the sun.

135
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:06,505
总有一天，太阳将会 跟我一样慢慢下沉
One day, Simba, the sun will set on my time here...

136
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:09,675
并且在你当国王的时候 一同上升
and will rise with you as the new king.

137
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,427
这一切都是我的吗？
- And this'll all be mine? - Everything.

138
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,764
所有的一切
Everything the light touches.

139
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:16,100
阳光能照到的所有东西…

140
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,808
那有阴影的地方呢？
What about that shadowy place?

141
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,643
那在我们的国度之外
That's beyond our borders.

142
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,395
你绝不可以去那个地方
You must never go there, Simba.

143
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,438
我以为国王可以随心所欲呀！
But I thought a king can do whatever he wants.

144
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,274
你错了
There's more to being king...

145
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,067
国王也不能凡事随心所欲
than getting your way all the time.

146
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,278
不能吗？      辛巴
- There's more? - Simba...

147
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:35,325
世界上所有的生命 都有他存在的价值
Everything you see exists together...

148
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,119
身为国王，你不但要了解
in a delicate balance.

149
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:40,122
As king, you need to understand that balance...

150
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:41,915
还要去尊重所有的生活
and respect all the creatures...

151
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:45,127
包括爬行的蚂蚁和跳跃的羚羊
from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope.

152
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:47,129
但是，爸… 我们不是吃羚羊吗？
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?

153
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,756
是呀，我来跟你解释一下
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.

154
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,676
我们死后呢，尸体会成为草
When we die, our bodies become the grass...

155
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:55,262
而羚羊是吃草的
and the antelope eat the grass.

156
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:58,682
所以…
And so we are all connected...

157
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,976
在这个生命圈里面
in the great circle of life.

158
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:01,178
都是互相有关联的

159
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:03,228
早安，陛下
- Good morning, sire! - Good morning, Zazu.

160
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,855
沙祖，你早
Checking in with the morning report.

161
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:06,315
我来做早上的例行报告
Fire away.

162
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,347
你说吧

163
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,616
黑猩猩激动 而长颈鹿高高在上

164
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:12,625
大象非常清楚我所忘记的事情

165
00:10:12,795 --> 00:10:15,525
鳄鱼爬到岸上咬住新鲜的猎物

166
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:17,289
他向我展示巢里的蛋

167
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:18,900
我说不客气

168
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:21,969
我们没去看犀鸟 而秃鹰有第六感

169
00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:26,301
不是每个受邀的人 都会来吃午餐

170
00:10:26,475 --> 00:10:31,105
哈哈，这就是晨间报告

171
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,544
大事小事不漏掉

172
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,615
每个呼吸微笑

173
00:10:37,753 --> 00:10:40,551
每个轻声吼叫

174
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:44,989
都在晨间报告

175
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,356
儿子，你在干什么？
- What are you doing, son? - Pouncing

176
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,901
扑东西
Let an old pro show you how it's done.

177
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:49,997
让个老手示范给你看看

178
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:55,531
今年草地肥美
Stay low to the ground.

179
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:54,100
水牛个个吃得强又壮 尽量的压低身子

180
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,931
豪猪受到阻挠 趴在地上

181
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,866
意图节省他毒气 趴在地上，好，我知道了
Yeah, OK. Stay low to the ground.

182
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,954
…不停追逐文书鸟 别出声
Shhh... Not a sound.

183
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:02,902
番红花是本季色彩 随处都可见

184
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:06,959
动一动行列纵队进行慢慢往下 慢慢来，向前一步
Take it slow. One more step...

185
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,962
…聚集在水肥处 然后…
then...

186
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:11,510
噗…

187
00:11:11,987 --> 00:11:14,751
这就是晨间报告

188
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,882
大事小事不漏掉

189
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:20,994
每个呼吸微笑

190
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:24,064
每个轻声吼叫

191
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:28,898
都在晨间报告

192
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,654
哈...非常好
That's very good.

193
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:37,239
沙祖 什么事呀？
- Zazu! - Yes!

194
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:38,991
地下传来的消息
Sir! News from the underground.

195
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,242
好，这一次呢...
Now, this time...

196
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:43,912
陛下
Sire! Hyenas in the pride lands!

197
00:11:41,516 --> 00:11:44,212
土狼到了荣耀石啦！

198
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,205
沙祖，带辛巴回家
Zazu, take Simba home.

199
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:48,584
我不能去吗？
- Dad, can't I come? - No, son.

200
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,253
不行，儿子
I never get to go anywhere.

201
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:51,682
哼！什么地方都不准我去

202
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:55,007
哦，小主人 将来你也会当国王的
Oh, young master, one day, you will be king.

203
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,093
然后你就可以随心所欲地 去追逐那些流着口水
Then you can chase those slobbering, mangy...

204
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:01,471
卑贱愚蠢的非法入侵者
stupid poachers from dawn until dusk.

205
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,981
嘿！刀疤叔叔 你猜怎样？
Hey, Uncle Scar! Guess what?

206
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:14,193
我最痛恨猜谜游戏了
I despise guessing games.

207
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,403
我将成为这里的国王耶
I'm gonna be king of Pride Rock.

208
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,447
哦！真好啊
Oh, goody.

209
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,532
我爸刚刚带我看了整个国度
My dad just showed me the whole kingdom...

210
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,410
而我将会统治一切
and I'm gonna rule it all.

211
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:27,164
是啊
Yes, well, forgive me for not leaping for joy.

212
00:12:25,393 --> 00:12:27,452
哦！请原谅我没有 高兴地跳起来

213
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:30,584
我的背不好你知道的
Bad back, you know.

214
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,586
嘿，刀疤叔叔
Hey, Uncle Scar. When I'm king...

215
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:34,046
如果我是国王 那你是什么？
what'll that make you?

216
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,380
你这猴子
A monkey's uncle.

217
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,050
你好奇怪哦！
You're so weird.

218
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,052
还有更怪的呢！
You have no idea.

219
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,639
哦！原来你爸爸带你 看过整个王国了，是吗？
So, your father showed you the whole kingdom, did he?

220
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,806
看过啦
Everything.

221
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,642
他没有带你到北方边界 太阳升起的地方吗？
He didn't show you what's beyond that rise...

222
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,143
at the northern border?

223
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:51,772
没有
Well, no. He said I can't go there.

224
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:55,234
他说我不能去那里
And he's absolutely right. It's far too dangerous.

225
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,211
他说的完全正确

226
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,778
那里太危险了
Only the bravest lions go there.

227
00:12:55,623 --> 00:12:58,114
只有勇敢的狮子才会去呀

228
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,572
我很勇敢啊
Well, I'm brave. What's out there...

229
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,824
那有什么？
I'm sorry, Simba, I just can't tell you.

230
00:13:00,995 --> 00:13:03,293
对不起，辛巴 我就是不能告诉你

231
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,034
为什么？
Why not?

232
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:05,994
辛巴，辛巴
Simba, Simba, I'm only looking out...

233
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,705
我只是在为我 最喜欢的侄子着想
for the well-being of my favorite nephew.

234
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:11,625
没错，我是你唯一的侄子
Yeah, right. I'm your only nephew.

235
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:14,211
所以罗，我才更要保护你
All the more reason for me to be protective.

236
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:16,421
一个年轻的王子 不适合到大象墓园去的
An elephant graveyard is no place...

237
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,549
for a young prince. Oops!

238
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,093
哦！
An elephant what? Whoa!

239
00:13:18,947 --> 00:13:20,539
大象的什么？

240
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,263
哇...
Oh, dear, I've said too much.

241
00:13:21,516 --> 00:13:24,974
哦！天啊 我说的太多了

242
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,307
不过我猜你早晚总会发现的
Well, I suppose you'd have found out sooner or later...

243
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,269
你一直是这么样的聪明
you being so clever and all.

244
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,020
帮我个忙吧！
Just do me one favor.

245
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:36,733
跟我保证你绝对 不会去那个可怕的地方
Promise me you'll never visit that dreadful place.

246
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,945
没问题
- No problem. - There's a good lad.

247
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:42,781
这才是乖孩子
You run along now and have fun.

248
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:43,133
你现在自己出去玩吧

249
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:46,827
并且记得哦...
And remember, it's our little secret.

250
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:49,204
这是我们的小秘密

251
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,044
嘿！娜娜
- Hey, Nala. - Hi, Simba.

252
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,338
嗨！辛巴
Come on. I just heard about this great place.

253
00:13:56,684 --> 00:13:58,845
走吧 我刚才听到一个很棒的地方

254
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,841
辛巴，我现在正在洗澡啊
Simba! I'm kinda in the middle of a bath.

255
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,926
你也该洗澡罗
And it's time for yours.

256
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,597
妈...
Mom!

257
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:09,266
妈...你把我的毛弄乱了啦
Mom, you're messing up my mane!

258
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,145
好了！好了
OK, I'm clean. Can we go now?

259
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:16,190
我干净了 我们可以走了吗？
Where are we going? It better not be anyplace dumb.

260
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:14,728
我们要到哪里去呀？

261
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,066
最好不要什么烂地方
No, it's really cool.

262
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:18,435
不！那真的很酷耶

263
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,694
这个很酷的地方是在哪里呢？
So, where is this really cool place?

264
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:23,614
Oh. Around the water hole.

265
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:24,907
就在水洞附近
The water hole?

266
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,742
水洞附近？
What's so great about the water hole?

267
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:27,009
水洞附近有什么了不起的啊？

268
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,994
等到了那里我再告诉你
I'll show you when we get there.

269
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:32,247
哦
Oh. Mom, can I go with Simba?

270
00:14:30,718 --> 00:14:33,516
妈，我能去吗？

271
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,416
沙拉碧你说呢？
What do you think, Sarabi?

272
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,584
这个嘛...
Well...

273
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,127
拜托...
- Please. - Please.

274
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,295
我是没什么意见
It's all right with me.

275
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:39,588
哦，耶...
- All right! - Yeah!

276
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,423
不过要沙祖跟你们一起去
As long as Zazu goes with you.

277
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:43,467
不...不要沙祖
No, not Zazu.

278
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:44,718
开心一点嘛
Step lively.

279
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,428
越快到水洞 我们就可以越快回家
The sooner we get to the water hole...

280
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,597
the sooner we can leave.

281
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,557
我们到底要去哪里呀？
So, where are we really going?

282
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:53,101
一个大象的墓园
- An elephant graveyard. - Wow!

283
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,895
哇！
Shh! Zazu.

284
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:55,689
嘘...沙祖

285
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:57,648
对了 我们要怎么摆脱那个笨蛋呀？
Right. So how are we gonna ditch the dodo?

286
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,651
我们摆脱沙祖以后...
Oh, just look at you two.

287
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,904
哦！看看你们俩个 再去大象的墓园
Little seeds of romance blossoming in the savannah.

288
00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:04,093
大草原上一段 小小的罗曼史正在孕育

289
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,198
你们的父母会很高兴的
Your parents will be thrilled...

290
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,617
等到你们订婚之后 还有...
what with your being betrothed and all.

291
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:11,495
什么？
- Being what? - Betrothed. Intended.

292
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:13,708
准备成婚 订下婚约、海誓山盟

293
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:13,455
Affianced.

294
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:14,623
意思是...
Meaning...?

295
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:17,793
有一天你们俩个会结婚
One day, you two are going to be married.

296
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,129
恶心...
I can't marry her. She's my friend.

297
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:20,545
我不能娶她耶

298
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,423
她是我的朋友
Yeah, it'd be so weird.

299
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:23,650
对，那实在太奇怪了

300
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,467
很抱歉，破坏你们的美梦
Sorry to bust your bubble...

301
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,136
但是你们俩个小朋友别无选择
but you two turtledoves have no choice.

302
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:30,722
这是流传了好几世代的传统
It's a tradition going back generations.

303
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,392
等我当国王 第一就是废除这件事
When I'm king, that'll be the first thing to go.

304
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,768
只要有我在就不准
Not so long as I'm around.

305
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,311
哦，那你被开除了
In that case, you're fired.

306
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,814
很聪明 但只有国王才能开除我
Nice try. But only the king can do that.

307
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,482
可是他是未来的国王啊
Well, he's the future king.

308
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,860
对！所以我说什么你都得听
Yeah, so you have to do what I tell you.

309
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,361
嘿嘿！现在还不必听
Not yet, I don't.

310
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:45,863
而且由你这种态度
And with an attitude like that...

311
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:47,489
恐怕你以后会变成 一个相当悲惨的国王
I'm afraid you're shaping up to be...

312
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:49,116
a pretty pathetic king indeed.

313
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,368
哼！我看才不会呢
Heh. Not the way I see it.

314
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:54,746
我将会是万兽之王
* I'm gonna be a mighty king *

315
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,707
瞧瞧我的模样
* So enemies beware *

316
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:59,376
从来没有一个狮子王 他的毛会那么少
* Well, I've never seen a king of beasts *

317
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:01,253
* With quite so little hair *

318
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:04,464
来看看我的威严 没有人比得过
* I'm gonna be the main event *

319
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,800
* Like no king was before *

320
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:09,344
没有人敢说“不要啦” 只要我说声“要”
* I'm brushin' up on lookin' down *

321
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,889
* I'm workin' on my roar *

322
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,892
从来没见过像你那么糟
Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing.

323
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:20,230
等不及成为狮子王
* Oh, I just can't wait to be king *

324
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:22,232
你还有很长的路要走呢 小主人
You've rather a long way to go, young master...

325
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,609
如果你以为...
if you think...

326
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,818
没有任何吩咐
* No one sayin' "Do this" *

327
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,069
我那么说的时候...
Now, when I said that...

328
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,362
没有任何束缚
* No one sayin', "Be there" *

329
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:28,572
我的意思是...
What I meant was...

330
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:29,907
没有任何坏处
* No one sayin' "Stop that" *

331
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,116
总会有你好处
But what you don't realize...

332
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,409
* No one sayin', "See here" *

333
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:33,911
听我说...
Now, see here!

334
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:36,705
自由自在到处跑
* Free to run around all day *

335
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,749
绝对不是那样的
Well, that's definitely out.

336
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,794
做错事情也没人吵
* Free to do it all my way *

337
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,091
找个时间该坐下来 来好好谈一谈
* I think it's time that you and I *

338
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,594
* Arranged a heart-to-heart *

339
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:52,346
别浪费唇舌 是建议一律都免谈
* Kings don't need advice *

340
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,765
* From little hornbills for a start *

341
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:58,393
如果你真的这样统治 我想那就惨
* If this is where the monarchy is headed *

342
00:16:58,435 --> 00:16:59,770
* Count me out *

343
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,397
干脆离开这块烂地方
* Out of service, out of Africa *

344
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:03,941
我再也不想管
* I wouldn't hang about *

345
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:09,404
这小孩已经开始嫌我烦
* This child is getting wildly out of wing *

346
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:14,409
等不及成为狮子王
* Oh, I just can't wait to be king *

347
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:27,923
所有人往左看
* Everybody, look left *

348
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:31,134
所有人往右看
* Everybody, look right *

349
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,720
所有人往这看
* Everywhere you look, I'm *

350
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,430
我在你们中间
* Standing in the spotlight *

351
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,099
还早呢！
Not yet!

352
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,061
让所有万物都一起歌唱
* Let every creature go for broke and sing *

353
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:46,441
让我们随他脚步到处闯
* Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing *

354
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:50,654
让所有万物都一起颂赞
* It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling *

355
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:55,659
等不及成为狮子王...
* Oh, I just can't wait to be king *

356
00:17:55,701 --> 00:18:00,581
* Oh, I just can't wait to be king *

357
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:05,502
* Oh, I just can't wait *

358
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:08,046
* To be king *

359
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,763
对不起，夫人
I beg your pardon, madam...

360
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,808
您坐在我的身上了
but... get off!

361
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,395
请让一让
Simba? Nala!

362
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:21,723
辛巴

363
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:24,891
娜娜...

364
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,649
好啦！成功了
All right! It worked!

365
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:30,235
摆脱他了吧
- We lost him. - I am a genius.

366
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,237
我...是个天才
Hey, genius, it was my idea.

367
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,448
嘿！天才 那是我的主意
Yeah, but I pulled it off.

368
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,753
没错啊 但是，是我执行的啊

369
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,575
还有我
- With me! - Oh, yeah?

370
00:18:35,797 --> 00:18:37,697
哦，是吗？

371
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,581
输了吧
- Pinned ya. - Hey, let me up.

372
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:43,163
让我起来

373
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:49,004
你又输了吧
- Uhh! - Pinned ya again.

374
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,852
就是这里 我们成功了
This is it. We made it.

375
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:11,295
哇...

376
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,696
这里阴森森的
It's really creepy

377
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:17,241
是啊，不是很棒吗？
Yeah. Isn't it great?

378
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:20,244
我们可能会有大麻烦
- We could get in big trouble. - I know. Ha!

379
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:23,497
我知道
I wonder if its brains are still in there.

380
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:23,771
不知道他的脑袋还在不在哪儿？

381
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,499
只有一个办法能知道
There's only one way to know.

382
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,376
走吧，我们去看看
Come on, let's go check it out.

383
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,920
不对
Wrong! The only checking out you will do...

384
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:31,213
你们唯一该做的事情 就是立刻离开这里
will be to check out of here.

385
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:32,381
烦耶！
Oh, man!

386
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:35,008
我们已经超出 荣耀石的范围太远了
We're way beyond the boundary of the pride lands.

387
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,677
你看 那个尖嘴老头害怕了
Look. Banana Beak is scared.

388
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:39,596
不管我是不是尖嘴小老头
It's Mr. Banana Beak to you, fuzzy...

389
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:43,016
小毛球
and right now we are all in very real danger.

390
00:19:40,394 --> 00:19:43,295
我告诉你 我们的处境真的是很危险

391
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,518
危险？哈哈...
Danger? Ha!

392
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,687
我在荒野中行走
I walk on the wide side.

393
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:49,022
我会当面嘲笑危险
I laugh in the face of danger.

394
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:58,172
哈哈哈哈...

395
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,118
哇哇哇...
Well, well, well, Banzai, what have we got here?

396
00:19:59,213 --> 00:20:00,373
斑仔

397
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,120
看看这是什么？
I don't know, Shenzi.

398
00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:04,830
桑琪，我不知道
What do you think, Ed?

399
00:20:03,885 --> 00:20:05,079
阿德，你觉得呢？

400
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:07,221
哈...

401
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:11,628
对！就如我刚刚在想
Just what I was thinkin'. A trio of trespassers!

402
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,006
三个违规的家伙
And quite by accident, let me assure you.

403
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:13,354
这完全是个意外！

404
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,924
我跟你们保证 这只是航行上的小小的错误
A simple navigational error.

405
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:17,926
等等...
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

406
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:21,930
我认识你 你是木法沙的小跟班
I know you. You're Mufasa's little stooge.

407
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:24,308
夫人 我是国王陛下的总管
I, madam, am the king's major-domo.

408
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:27,436
这么说你就是...
- And that would make you... - The future king.

409
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:31,064
未来的国王
Do you know what we do to kings who step out of their kingdom?

410
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:32,309
你知道我们是怎么对付 超出自己国界的国王吗？

411
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:33,483
你们也不能把我怎么样啊！
You can't do anything to me.

412
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:34,943
理论上可以 我们在他们的土地上
Technically, they can.

413
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:36,278
We are on their land.

414
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,197
可是沙祖你跟我说 他们只是爱流口水的傻瓜啊！
But, Zazu, you told me they're nothin'...

415
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,616
but slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers.

416
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,242
能不能不要再提 傻瓜这两个字？
Lx-nay on the upid-stay.

417
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,161
嘿！你叫谁是傻瓜？
Who are you callin' upid-stay?

418
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,413
停...你看那个太阳 我该走了
My, my, my. Look at the sun! It's time to go!

419
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:47,623
急什么？ 我们很乐意你留下来晚餐
What's the hurry?

420
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,625
We'd love you to stick around for dinner.

421
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:53,086
是呀...
Yeah, we could have whatever's... lion around!

422
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:53,532
我们可以吃... 狮子大餐呀！

423
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,130
哈...
Wait, wait, wait, I got one, I got one!

424
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:58,050
等等... 有了，有了，有了
Make mine a cub sandwich! What'd you think?

425
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,302
我要一份幼狮三明治 你觉得呢？

426
00:20:58,472 --> 00:21:00,372
哈...

427
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,554
什么？阿德？
What, Ed? What is it?

428
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,389
什么？
Hey, did we order this dinner to go?

429
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:05,599
我们订的晚餐要外带吗？
No, why?

430
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:07,893
没有啊！怎么啦？
'Cause there it goes!

431
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:09,675
因为他们跑了

432
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,234
我们甩掉他们了吗？
Did we lose 'em?

433
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:18,320
我想是的
I think so. Where's Zazu?

434
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:20,531
沙祖在哪？
The little major-domo bird hippety-hopped...

435
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:23,526
原来我们的小总管 一路赶着想做只白煮鸟

436
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:22,658
all the way to the birdie-boiler.

437
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:25,452
不！我不要做白煮鸟！
Oh, no! Not the birdie-boiler!

438
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:32,376
嘿！你们为什么不去找一个 跟你们差不多大的
Hey, why don't you pick on somebody your own size?

439
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,711
像...你吗？
- Like you? - Oops.

440
00:21:34,141 --> 00:21:36,132
哦哦！

441
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:52,729
辛巴
Simba!

442
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:14,293
快来呀！小宝贝
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

443
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:19,631
哈哈...就这样吗？
Heh! That was it?

444
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:22,634
再吼一次，来呀！
Do it again. Come on.

445
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:36,148
大...大哥
Oh, please, please! Uncle, uncle!

446
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,525
误会...误会
- Silence! - We're gonna shut up right now!

447
00:22:36,904 --> 00:22:37,598
闭嘴！

448
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,319
闭嘴！我们都闭嘴
Calm down. We're really sorry.

449
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,780
别激动
If you ever come near my son again...

450
00:22:39,607 --> 00:22:40,596
我们真的很抱歉

451
00:22:40,741 --> 00:22:44,040
如果你们敢再靠近我儿子

452
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,407
这位...这位是您的...
Oh, this is your son?

453
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:47,701
哦！是您的公子啊
- Oh, your son? - Did you know that?

454
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:50,204
你知道吗？
No. Me? I didn't know... No, did you?

455
00:22:48,215 --> 00:22:49,239
不，我不知道

456
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:52,122
这个... 你...你知道吗？
- No, of course not. - No.

457
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:53,373
不，当然不知道
- Ed? - Ed?

458
00:22:52,286 --> 00:22:55,187
不！阿德？

459
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:57,961
溜
Toodles.

460
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,303
爸，我...
Dad, I...

461
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:08,138
你故意违抗我的命令
You deliberately disobeyed me.

462
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:10,849
爸，我很抱歉
Dad, I'm sorry.

463
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,226
跟我回家去
Let's go home.

464
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:17,481
我认为你非常勇敢
I thought you were very brave.

465
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:35,707
沙祖
Zazu.

466
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:40,671
是的，陛下
- Yes, sire? - Take Nala home.

467
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:43,674
带娜娜回家
I've got to teach my son a lesson.

468
00:23:41,202 --> 00:23:44,797
我必须要给我儿子上一课

469
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:49,805
娜娜，走吧
Come, Nala.

470
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:51,223
辛巴，唉！
Simba...

471
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:53,267
祝你好运
Good luck.

472
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:00,649
辛巴
Simba!

473
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:30,762
辛巴，我对你非常失望
Simba, I'm very disappointed in you.

474
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:33,265
我知道
- I know. - You could've been killed.

475
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:35,100
你可能会死掉
You deliberately disobeyed me...

476
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:37,728
你故意违抗我的命令
and what's worse, you put Nala in danger.

477
00:24:35,556 --> 00:24:36,454
而且更糟的是

478
00:24:36,624 --> 00:24:39,491
你和娜娜有生命危险

479
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:41,773
我只是想要跟你一样勇敢
I was just trying to be brave, like you.

480
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:45,152
我只有在必要的时候才勇敢
I'm only brave when I have to be.

481
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:48,906
辛巴
Simba, being brave...

482
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:51,366
勇敢并不表示你要去找麻烦
doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.

483
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,368
可是你好像什么都不怕
But you're not scared of anything.

484
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:55,746
我今天就怕了
I was today.

485
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:57,998
真的？
- You were? - Yes.

486
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,209
是的
I thought I might lose you.

487
00:24:58,546 --> 00:25:00,514
我怕我会失去你

488
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:04,296
噢...原来国王也会害怕
Oh. I guess even kings get scared, huh?

489
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:07,883
但是你知道吗？
- But you know what? - What?

490
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:10,511
什么？
I think those hyenas were even scareder.

491
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:10,822
我认为那些土狼比你还害怕

492
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:15,265
哈...
'Cause nobody messes with your dad.

493
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:16,089
因为没有人有胆子敢惹你爸爸

494
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:17,768
过来
- Come here, you. - Oh, no! No!

495
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,156
不要，不要

496
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,733
放手啦！

497
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:21,396
来呀！
Aah! Come here!

498
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:25,025
Gotcha!

499
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,865
爸
Dad?

500
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:33,242
嗯
We're pals, right?

501
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:34,701
我们是不是伙伴
Right.

502
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:37,496
对
And we'll always be together, right?

503
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:38,582
那我们就永远在一起，对吧

504
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:41,667
辛巴
Simba, let me tell you something...

505
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:44,461
我告诉你一些 我爸爸以前跟我说的话
that my father told me.

506
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:46,505
你看那些星星
Look at the stars.

507
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:48,966
过去那些伟大的君王
The great kings of the past...

508
00:25:48,966 --> 00:25:51,593
从那些星星上看着我们
look down on us from those stars.

509
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,971
真的？
- Really? - Yes.

510
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:56,431
是呀
So, whenever you feel alone...

511
00:25:54,869 --> 00:25:57,133
所以每当你寂寞的时候

512
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:58,767
要记得那些君王 永远在那里指引着你
just remember that those kings...

513
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:02,688
will always be there to guide you...

514
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:04,147
还有我也是
and so will I.

515
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:12,781
木法沙真差劲
Man, that lousy Mufasa.

516
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:14,616
害我一个星期都不能坐
I won't be able to sit for a week.

517
00:26:18,162 --> 00:26:19,788
这个不好笑，阿德
It's not funny, Ed.

518
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:24,751
闭嘴！
Hey, shut up!

519
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:30,215
你们安静一点好不好？
Will you knock it off?

520
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:32,885
Well, he started it.

521
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:35,679
是他先开始的
Look at you guys. No wonder we're dangling...

522
00:26:33,741 --> 00:26:34,935
看看你们俩个

523
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:37,181
难怪我们会在 食物链最底部晃荡
at the bottom of the food chain.

524
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:38,765
我痛恨晃荡
Man, I hate dangling.

525
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:41,226
废话！
Yeah? You know, if it weren't for those lions...

526
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:42,728
如果不是那些狮子 这地方早就是我们的了
we'd be runnin' the joint.

527
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,229
我痛恨狮子！
Man, I hate lions.

528
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:45,856
那么顽固
- So pushy. - And hairy.

529
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:48,066
又毛茸茸的
- And stinky. - And, man, are they...

530
00:26:46,454 --> 00:26:47,148
而且又臭

531
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:50,152
还有老天他们...
U-u-u-ugly!

532
00:26:49,857 --> 00:26:51,757
丑死了

533
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:55,365
我们狮子当然 不全都是那么糟糕的
Oh, surely, we lions are not all that bad.

534
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:58,243
Oh, Scar. It's just you.

535
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:00,412
刀疤，原来是你
We were afraid it was somebody important.

536
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:01,914
我们还以为是什么大人物呢！
Yeah, you know, like Mufasa.

537
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:03,582
对呀，就像木法沙
- Yeah. - I see.

538
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:06,043
是呀
- Now, that's power. - Tell me about it.

539
00:27:03,104 --> 00:27:03,866
是吗？

540
00:27:04,005 --> 00:27:05,233
那才叫力量

541
00:27:06,043 --> 00:27:08,170
一点也没错 光听他的名字我就会发抖
I just hear that name and I shudder.

542
00:27:08,212 --> 00:27:10,380
木法沙
- Mufasa! - Ooh! Do it again.

543
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:11,882
再来一次
Mufasa!

544
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:13,050
木法沙
Mufasa! Mufasa! Mufasa!

545
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:14,772
木法沙...

546
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:16,345
真过瘾
Ooh, it tingles.

547
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:19,306
我身边全是一些白痴
I'm surrounded by idiots.

548
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:21,141
得了吧，刀疤
Now, you, Scar, I mean, you're one of us.

549
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:22,518
你是我们的一份子
You're our pal.

550
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,727
别忘了你是我们的伙伴
Charmed.

551
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:25,187
真感人...
Oh, I like that.

552
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:27,856
噢，我喜欢
He's not king, but he's still so proper.

553
00:27:25,726 --> 00:27:28,354
他不是国王 但他还是那么有威严

554
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:30,901
是呀，刀疤
Did you bring us anything to eat, Scar, old buddy?

555
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:32,110
你带什么给我们吃的
Did ya, did ya, did ya?

556
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:34,571
嘿，老伙伴，好兄弟
I don't think you really deserve this.

557
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:32,496
有没有，有没有

558
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,828
我认为你们实在不值得

559
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:37,699
我是特别把那些小狮子 送来给你们的
I practically gift-wrapped those cubs for you...

560
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:41,203
而你们却让他给跑掉了
and you couldn't even dispose of them.

561
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:44,915
可是你知道
Well, you know...

562
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:47,876
他们并不是 自己单独来的，刀疤
it wasn't exactly like they were alone, Scar.

563
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:50,170
对呀！我们该怎么做呢？
Yeah. What were we supposed to do...

564
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:52,047
杀了木法沙？
kill Mufasa?

565
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:55,717
一点也没错
Precisely.

566
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,052
Huh?

567
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:10,190
不要在我面前耍威风
* I know that your powers of retention *

568
00:28:10,232 --> 00:28:13,986
仔细看 像个饭桶不中用
* Are as wet as a warthog's backside *

569
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,071
你给我站好 仔细听着
* But thick as you are *

570
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:18,240
* Pay attention *

571
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:22,077
我的话已经够明白
* My words are a matter of pride *

572
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:25,873
那是所谓无言的表白
* It's clear from your vacant expressions *

573
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:29,877
这地方由我来主宰
* The lights are not all on upstairs *

574
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:33,380
难道你们都没有发现
* But we're talking kings and successions *

575
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:36,175
王位继承权在我手中
* Even you can't be caught unawares *

576
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:41,138
准备好你的心静静等候
* So prepare for the chance of a lifetime *

577
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:45,642
迎接这一个天大消息
* Be prepared for sensational news *

578
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:49,438
一个新的时代它悄悄要到来
* A shiny new era is tiptoeing nearer *

579
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:51,148
那我们又算什么？
* And where do we feature? *

580
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,442
不管我多恶毒
* Just listen to teacher *

581
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:55,402
只要听我吩咐 不要再犯错误
* I know it sounds sordid *

582
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:57,446
* But you'll be rewarded *

583
00:28:57,487 --> 00:29:00,949
以后总会有你的好处
* When at last I am given my dues *

584
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:04,786
我要大声地向你宣布
* And injustice deliciously squared *

585
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:08,081
快准备
* Be prepared *

586
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:09,416
不对！还有的呢！
Yeah, be prepared.

587
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:12,085
我们会准备的
We'll be prepared. For what?

588
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:13,462
准备什么？
For the death of the king.

589
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:14,880
准备木法沙王之死！
Why, is he sick?

590
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:16,173
怎么了？他病了？ 不
No, fool, we're going to kill him...

591
00:29:16,215 --> 00:29:17,674
笨蛋！我们要杀了他 还有辛巴
and Simba, too.

592
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:19,384
好主意 谁需要国王啊！
Great idea. Who needs a king?

593
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:22,262
不要王......
* No king, no king, la-la la-la la la *

594
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,431
啦......
Idiots! There will be a king!

595
00:29:22,676 --> 00:29:24,735
白痴！还会有另外一个王的

596
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:27,518
但是你自己说......
- Hey, but you said... - I will be king!

597
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,010
我将要做你们的王

598
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:33,273
只要跟着我
Stick with me, and you'll never go hungry again.

599
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:33,545
你们就再也不会饿肚子了

600
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:34,650
好耶！
- Yeah! - Yeah! All right!

601
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:36,193
国王万岁！
All right! Long live the king!

602
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:37,611
国王万岁！
Long live the king!

603
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:39,196
Long live the king!

604
00:29:39,238 --> 00:29:40,989
国王万岁！
* King, king, king, king, king, king, king *

605
00:29:41,031 --> 00:29:44,326
看来很快就会有依靠
* It's great that we'll soon be connected *

606
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:48,622
随时随地伺候你左右
* With a king who'll be all-time adored *

607
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:50,332
要投靠我 不要怀疑
* Of course, quid pro quo *

608
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:52,209
* You're expected *

609
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:56,296
保证大家都会好过
* To take certain duties on board *

610
00:29:56,338 --> 00:30:00,133
看来未来是充满着希望
* The future is littered with prizes *

611
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:04,638
保证过就不会泡汤
* And though I'm the main addressee *

612
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,016
让我再一次向你提醒
* The point that I must emphasize is *

613
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:10,435
我就是你唯一靠山

614
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,649
快准备！
* So prepare for the coup of the century *

615
00:30:13,527 --> 00:30:15,995
这计划前所未有

616
00:30:15,691 --> 00:30:18,569
这计划只要你帮一帮
* Be prepared for the murkiest scam *

617
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,028
* La la la *

618
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,864
这周详的计划 是万无一失的
* Meticulous planning *

619
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:23,866
* Tenacity spanning *

620
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:25,993
是难得一见的 是不能否认的
* Decades of denial *

621
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:29,705
* Is simply why I'll be king undisputed *

622
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:31,748
不能抵抗 又雄壮威严受尊敬的我
* Respected, saluted *

623
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:35,210
就是森林之王
* And seen for the wonder I am *

624
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:39,047
因为我要的理想更高
* Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared *

625
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:43,427
快准备
* Be prepared *

626
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:46,847
因为我要的理想更高
* Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared *

627
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:50,893
快准备
* Be prepared *

628
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:04,281
好，你在这等着
Now, you wait here.

629
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:07,659
你爸爸为你准备了一个大惊喜
Your father has a marvelous surprise for you.

630
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:09,036
什么惊喜？
Ooh, what is it?

631
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:12,247
如果我告诉你的话 那就不叫惊喜了，对不对
If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise.

632
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:14,291
如果你告诉我 我会装得很惊讶
If you tell me, I'll still act surprised.

633
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:18,295
You are such a naughty boy.

634
00:31:16,156 --> 00:31:18,886
你实在是非常的调皮

635
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:19,713
说嘛！刀疤叔叔
Come on, Uncle Scar.

636
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:21,548
不......
No, no, no, no, no.

637
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,926
这是你爸爸跟你之间的事情
This is just for you and your daddy.

638
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:28,722
是那种父子之间的...关系
You know, a sort of father-son... thing.

639
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:31,600
好了，我最好去找他去
Well, I better go get him.

640
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:34,895
我跟你一起去
- I'll go with you. - No!

641
00:31:33,073 --> 00:31:34,665
不！

642
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:38,690
不...你只管待在这个石块上
No. Just stay on this rock.

643
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:40,859
你不会想像上次那样 再遇到土狼吧？
You wouldn't want to end up in another mess...

644
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:42,611
like you did with the hyenas.

645
00:31:42,653 --> 00:31:43,987
你知道那件事呀？
You know about that?

646
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:46,490
辛巴，每个人都知道那件事
Simba, everybody knows about that.

647
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,117
真的吗？
- Really? - Oh, yes.

648
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:52,955
是啊，算你幸运
Lucky Daddy was there to save you, eh?

649
00:31:51,391 --> 00:31:54,258
爸爸赶去救你了，对不对啊？

650
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:55,749
Oh, and just between us...

651
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:59,211
这是我们的小秘密
you might want to work on that little roar of yours.

652
00:31:56,763 --> 00:31:59,857
你是不是该练习练习 你的吼叫声了呢？

653
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:01,880
哦，好吧
Oh, OK.

654
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:07,469
嘿！刀疤叔叔
Hey, Uncle Scar, will I like this surprise?

655
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:11,807
我会喜欢那个惊喜吗？
Simba, it's to die for.

656
00:32:08,508 --> 00:32:13,275
辛巴，你会喜欢死的

657
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:35,622
闭嘴！
- Shut up. - I can't help it.

658
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:38,083
我也没办法 我肚子好饿
I'm so hungry. I got to have a wildebeest.

659
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,626
我可以吃下一头野牛
Stay put.

660
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:41,920
不要乱动
Can't I just pick off one of the little sick ones?

661
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,034
拜托！

662
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:45,924
我可不可以 吃一头生病的就好了
No. We wait for the signal from Scar.

663
00:32:42,776 --> 00:32:47,270
不行！我们要等待刀疤的讯号

664
00:32:47,593 --> 00:32:51,346
他在那边
There he is. Let's go.

665
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,914
我们走

666
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:54,391
吼叫声
Little roar. Puhh.

667
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:58,330
陛下，你看！ 有东西在移动
Oh, look, sire, the herd is on the move.

668
00:33:58,372 --> 00:34:00,332
奇怪？
- Odd. - Mufasa, quick!

669
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:02,543
木法沙！快点 动物逃窜
Stampede in the gorge.

670
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:05,254
在峡谷那儿 而辛巴也在
- Simba's down there. - Simba?

671
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:06,482
辛巴？

672
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:28,944
沙祖！救我
Zazu, help me!

673
00:34:28,986 --> 00:34:31,029
你爸爸已经来了
Your father is on the way! Hold on!

674
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:32,281
撑着点
Hurry!

675
00:34:32,052 --> 00:34:33,952
快呀...

676
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:38,453
那边，在那儿
There, on that tree.

677
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:39,788
在那树上
Hold on, Simba!

678
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:41,960
捉好，辛巴

679
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:50,465
刀疤，这太可怕了
Oh, Scar, this is awful! What'll we do?

680
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:52,301
我们该怎么办？
Ha! I'll go back to help, that's what I'll do.

681
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,794
我该做些什么？

682
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:53,635
我回去搬救兵
I'll go back... Oof!

683
00:34:52,806 --> 00:34:55,400
我就这么做 我去搬救...

684
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:30,547
爸...
Dad!

685
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:55,280
刀疤...
Scar!

686
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:58,784
Uhh! Brother! Help me!

687
00:35:57,404 --> 00:36:00,305
弟弟，救救我

688
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:10,420
愿国王万岁
Long live the king.

689
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:19,555
No!

690
00:36:17,657 --> 00:36:20,057
不...

691
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:32,901
爸...
Dad!

692
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:45,956
Dad?

693
00:36:45,618 --> 00:36:46,380
爸

694
00:37:23,452 --> 00:37:25,662
爸
Dad?

695
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:28,874
爸，起来
Dad, come on.

696
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:31,835
你一定要起来
You got to get up.

697
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:33,962
爸...
Dad?

698
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:35,881
跟我回家啦
We got to go home.

699
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:50,979
救命啊...
Help!

700
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:53,524
有没有人？
Somebody!

701
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:55,400
任何人...
Anybody.

702
00:37:56,819 --> 00:37:59,905
救命
Help.

703
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:30,894
辛巴
Simba.

704
00:38:30,936 --> 00:38:32,896
看你弄得...
What have you done?

705
00:38:34,106 --> 00:38:37,359
有好多动物 他想救我
There were wildebeests, and he tried to save me.

706
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:40,696
这真的是意外 我不是故意的
It was an accident. I didn't mean for it to happen.

707
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:44,950
当然，你当然不是故意的
Of course, of course you didn't.

708
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:49,955
没有人会故意 要让这种事发生的
No one ever means for these things to happen...

709
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:52,332
但是国王已经死了
but the king is dead.

710
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:56,962
而且，如果不是因为你 他现在还会活着的
And if it weren't for you, he'd still be alive.

711
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:04,344
你妈妈会怎么想呢？
What will your mother think?

712
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:06,889
What am I going to do?

713
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,265
那我该怎么办？
Run away, Simba.

714
00:39:07,426 --> 00:39:10,088
跑的远远的，辛巴

715
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:14,771
快跑
Run. Run away and never return.

716
00:39:10,963 --> 00:39:15,161
跑的远远的再也不要回来了

717
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:22,988
杀了他
Kill him.

718
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:17,793
Hey, there he goes. There he goes.

719
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:19,837
他在那边 往那边跑了
So, go get him.

720
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:21,463
那就快追呀
There ain't no way I'm going in there.

721
00:40:21,505 --> 00:40:25,300
我才不愿意到那边去呢！
You want me to come out looking like you, cactus butt?

722
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:22,861
怎么？

723
00:40:22,968 --> 00:40:26,927
你想要我跟你一样 变成个仙人掌啊？

724
00:40:26,552 --> 00:40:27,803
我们一定得完成任务
But we got to finish the job.

725
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:30,973
唉！反正他出去以后 就完蛋定了
Well, he's as good as dead out there anyway.

726
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:33,308
如果他回来的话 我们再杀他
And if he comes back, we'll kill him.

727
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,477
对！你听到没有？
Yeah! You hear that?

728
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:39,273
如果你敢回来 我们就杀了你
If you ever come back, we'll kill you!

729
00:40:48,073 --> 00:40:51,910
木法沙的死亡是个可怕的悲剧
Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy...

730
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:56,331
但是辛巴几乎才开始他的生命 竟然也...
but to lose Simba, who had barely begun to live...

731
00:40:56,373 --> 00:41:02,337
For me, it is a deep, personal loss.

732
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:02,719
对我来说 这是一个极大的个人损失

733
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:04,047
我在极悲恸的心情下登上王位
So, it is with a heavy heart...

734
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:06,341
that I assume the throne.

735
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:09,052
但是我们 必须振作起来忘掉悲痛
Yet out of the ashes of this tragedy...

736
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:13,682
we shall rise to greet the dawning of a new era...

737
00:41:11,167 --> 00:41:14,398
共同迎接一个崭新时代的来临

738
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:17,561
我们狮子将跟土狼 一起走向光明伟大的未来
in which lion and hyena come together...

739
00:41:17,603 --> 00:41:21,940
in a great and glorious future.

740
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:11,365
Get out! Get out! Get out of here!

741
00:42:09,775 --> 00:42:10,969
走开一走开

742
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:13,742
快走开
I love this! Bowling for buzzards.

743
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,741
我喜欢赶走秃鹰

744
00:42:13,784 --> 00:42:16,411
Gets 'em every time.

745
00:42:15,881 --> 00:42:18,543
每次都成功

746
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:21,583
Uh-oh. Hey, Timon, you better come look.

747
00:42:20,085 --> 00:42:21,985
丁满，你最好过来看看

748
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:23,669
我看他好像还活着
I think it's still alive.

749
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:28,340
哎哟！这什么东西呀？
All righty, what have we got here?

750
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:37,850
天啊！是只狮子
Jeez, it's a lion! Run, Pumbaa, move it!

751
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:41,186
彭彭，快跑
Hey, Timon, it's just a little lion.

752
00:42:38,837 --> 00:42:42,898
丁满，他只是只小狮子

753
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:45,774
Look at him. He's so cute and all alone.

754
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:44,599
你看他那么可爱

755
00:42:45,816 --> 00:42:48,318
而且是一个人 我们能留下他吗？
- Can we keep him? - Pumbaa, are you nuts?

756
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,613
彭彭，你疯了吗？
You're talking about a lion. Lions eat guys like us.

757
00:42:48,947 --> 00:42:50,244
躺在这儿的是只狮子

758
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:54,199
狮子就是专门吃我们的
- But he's so little. - He'll get bigger.

759
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:55,534
但是他还那么小
Maybe he'll be on our side.

760
00:42:53,619 --> 00:42:54,608
他以后会长大的

761
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:58,328
也许他会变得跟我们一国
Ha! That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.

762
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:01,498
这是我听过最蠢的话了
Maybe he'll... Hey, I got it.

763
00:42:58,957 --> 00:42:59,924
或许他会...

764
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,958
咦...我有点子了
What if he's on our side?

765
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,295
如果他跟我们一国
Having a lion around might not be such a bad idea.

766
00:43:03,762 --> 00:43:06,663
有只狮子在身边或许蛮不错的

767
00:43:06,336 --> 00:43:07,504
那我们就留下他罗
So, we're keeping him?

768
00:43:07,546 --> 00:43:09,840
当然，这里是谁做主啊？
Pbbt! Of course. Who's the brains of this outfit?

769
00:43:09,882 --> 00:43:11,550
我认为他应该留下
- Uh... - My point exactly.

770
00:43:11,592 --> 00:43:12,968
哎哟！天啊！我热死了
Jeez, I'm fried.

771
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,887
我们快离开这儿 找个阴凉的地方
Let's get out of here and find some shade.

772
00:43:23,437 --> 00:43:25,731
你还好吧？孩子
- You OK, kid? - I guess so.

773
00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:28,150
我想是吧
- You nearly died. - I saved you.

774
00:43:26,251 --> 00:43:27,377
你差点就死了

775
00:43:28,192 --> 00:43:30,986
我救了你
Well, Pumbaa helped... a little.

776
00:43:29,354 --> 00:43:31,345
彭彭也帮了...一滴滴忙

777
00:43:31,028 --> 00:43:32,905
谢谢你们帮忙
Thanks for your help.

778
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:37,659
你要去哪里？
- Hey, where you going? - Nowhere.

779
00:43:35,827 --> 00:43:38,022
不知道

780
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:39,203
他看起来很BLUE
Gee, he looks blue.

781
00:43:39,203 --> 00:43:41,205
我倒觉得是金黄色
I'd say brownish gold.

782
00:43:41,246 --> 00:43:42,789
不，我是说一沮丧
No, no, no. I mean he's depressed.

783
00:43:42,873 --> 00:43:44,333
Oh.

784
00:43:44,374 --> 00:43:46,168
孩子你在烦什么？
Kid, what's eating you?

785
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:48,170
烦？狮子可是万兽之王
Nothing. He's at the top of the food chain.

786
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:54,760
烦个屁呀！
The food chain!

787
00:43:56,887 --> 00:43:58,722
那你从哪儿来的？
So, where you from?

788
00:43:58,764 --> 00:44:00,849
谁在乎？我又不能回去
Who cares? I can't go back.

789
00:44:00,891 --> 00:44:03,018
你是被扫地出门的
Ah, you're an outcast.

790
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,394
好极了！我们也是
That's great. So are we.

791
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:05,604
你做了什么事？
What'd you do, kid?

792
00:44:05,646 --> 00:44:06,939
很可怕的事 但是我不想跟你们说
Something terrible...

793
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,440
but I don't want to talk about it.

794
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:10,025
很好，我们也不想听
Good. We don't want to hear about it.

795
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:12,277
拜托，丁满 我们能帮忙吗？
Come on, Timon. Anything we can do?

796
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,030
除非你们能够改变历史
Not unless you can change the past.

797
00:44:15,072 --> 00:44:18,367
孩子你要知道在这个时候 我这位伙伴丁满说
Kid, in times like this, my buddy Timon says...

798
00:44:18,408 --> 00:44:20,953
你必须把你的背后抛到过去
you got to put your behind in your past.

799
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:23,872
不...
No, no, no. Amateur.

800
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:26,708
我是说... 笨蛋
Lie down before you hurt yourself.

801
00:44:24,576 --> 00:44:27,010
能不能闭上你的乌鸦嘴呀

802
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,461
是...你必须把过去抛到脑后
You got to put your past behind you.

803
00:44:29,503 --> 00:44:31,421
孩子 你常会碰到一些倒霉的事
Look, kid, bad things happen...

804
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:33,382
而你却拿它没办法，对吧？
and you can't do anything about it, right?

805
00:44:33,423 --> 00:44:34,716
对 错
- Right. - Wrong!

806
00:44:34,758 --> 00:44:37,386
当这个世界遗弃你的时候
When the world turns its back on you...

807
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:40,222
你就去遗弃这个世界
you turn your back on the world.

808
00:44:40,264 --> 00:44:42,140
我以前学的不是这样
That's not what I was taught.

809
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:44,351
那么你或许应该学点新知识
Then maybe you need a new lesson.

810
00:44:44,393 --> 00:44:46,645
跟着我一起念
Repeat after me. Ahem.

811
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:48,814
HAKUNAMATATA
- Hakuna matata. - What?

812
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:52,901
什么？
Hakuna matata. It means "no worries."

813
00:44:49,384 --> 00:44:52,285
HAKUNAMATATA

814
00:44:52,943 --> 00:44:55,988
就别担心
* Hakuna matata *

815
00:44:53,488 --> 00:44:56,821

816
00:44:56,029 --> 00:44:59,241

* What a wonderful phrase *

817
00:44:59,283 --> 00:45:01,660
HAKUNAMATATA
* Hakuna matata *

818
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:05,080
简单又好记
* Ain't no passing craze *

819
00:45:05,122 --> 00:45:07,416
从现在开始
* It means no worries *

820
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:11,044
你不必再担心
* For the rest of your days *

821
00:45:11,086 --> 00:45:13,922
不必像从前
* It's our problem free *

822
00:45:13,964 --> 00:45:16,675
听天由命
* Philosophy *

823
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:19,219
HAKUNAMATATA
* Hakuna matata *

824
00:45:19,303 --> 00:45:22,723
HAKUNAMATATA？
- Hakuna matata? - Yeah. It's our motto.

825
00:45:22,806 --> 00:45:23,932
是我们的座右铭
What's a motto?

826
00:45:23,974 --> 00:45:25,392
什么是座右铭？
Nothing. What's a motto with you?

827
00:45:24,252 --> 00:45:26,743
管它呢？跟着念就行了

828
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:31,148
孩子你要知道
Kid, these two words will solve all your problems.

829
00:45:28,189 --> 00:45:31,647
这几个字能够解决 你所有的问题

830
00:45:31,148 --> 00:45:33,275
对了！拿彭彭举例来说
That's right. Take Pumbaa, for example.

831
00:45:33,317 --> 00:45:34,651
Why...

832
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:37,446
当他是只小山猪
* When he was a young warthog *

833
00:45:37,488 --> 00:45:41,325
当我是只小山猪
* When I was a young warthog *

834
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:43,285
很好
- Very nice. - Thanks.

835
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:44,536
谢啦
* He found his aroma *

836
00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:46,163
看他好像魅力十足风度翩翩
* Lacked a certain appeal *

837
00:45:46,205 --> 00:45:48,457
看来看去好像缺少一些东西
* He could clear the savannah after every meal *

838
00:45:48,499 --> 00:45:50,584
虽然我长得丑
* I'm a sensitive soul *

839
00:45:50,626 --> 00:45:53,170
可是很温柔
* Though I seem thick skinned *

840
00:45:54,546 --> 00:45:56,757
我终于发现我没办法出人头地
* And it hurt that my friends *

841
00:45:56,798 --> 00:45:59,760
* Never stood downwind *

842
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:01,929
真丢脸
* And, oh, the shame *

843
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,305
太丢脸罗
* He was ashamed *

844
00:46:03,347 --> 00:46:04,556
我想过改名字
* Thought of changing my name *

845
00:46:04,598 --> 00:46:05,974
改什么名字？
* Oh, what's in a name? *

846
00:46:06,016 --> 00:46:07,434
我终于放弃
* And I got downhearted *

847
00:46:07,476 --> 00:46:08,644
为什么？
* How did you feel? *

848
00:46:08,685 --> 00:46:10,145
每次我想...
* Every time that l... *

849
00:46:10,187 --> 00:46:13,232
彭彭，不要在小孩面前...
- Not in front of the kids. - Oh, sorry.

850
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:15,484
对不起

00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:29,915
好！唱下去
Yeah, sing it, kid.

00:46:39,049 --> 00:46:41,677
欢迎来到寒舍
Welcome to our humble home.

862
00:46:41,718 --> 00:46:42,970
你们住在这里呀？
You live here?

863
00:46:43,011 --> 00:46:44,346
没错
We live wherever we want.

864
00:46:44,388 --> 00:46:46,807
对！家就是休息的地方
Yep. Home is where your rump rests.

865
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:48,600
好漂亮
It's beautiful.

866
00:46:48,642 --> 00:46:50,811
I'm starved.

867
00:46:50,853 --> 00:46:53,146
好饿
I'm so hungry I could eat a whole zebra.

868
00:46:51,339 --> 00:46:54,797
我肚子饿得可以 吃下一匹斑马了

869
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:55,983
Ah, we're fresh out of zebra.

870
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:57,776
我们这里没有新鲜斑马肉
- Any antelope? - Nuh-uh.

871
00:46:57,818 --> 00:46:59,444
那有羚羊吗？
- Hippo? - Nope.

872
00:46:57,512 --> 00:46:58,171
没有

873
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:02,698
河马呢？
Kid, if you live with us, you have to eat like us.

874
00:46:59,013 --> 00:46:59,809
也没

875
00:46:59,981 --> 00:47:00,811
对了！孩子

876
00:47:00,982 --> 00:47:03,041
如果你跟我们住 就得跟我们吃的一样

877
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:05,367
这里像是可以弄到 昆虫的好地方
This looks like a good spot to rustle up some grub.

878
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:07,911
Ew, what's that?

879
00:47:07,953 --> 00:47:09,788
那是什么？
A grub. What's it look like?

880
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:11,790
昆虫，不然你以为是什么？
Ew, gross.

881
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:12,919
哦...好恶心

882
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:14,459
Mmm. Tastes like chicken.

883
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:18,213
吃起来像鸡肉
Slimy, yet satisfying.

884
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:18,525
粘粘的，但是还不错

885
00:47:18,255 --> 00:47:20,924
这真是少有的美味
These are rare delicacies. Mmm.

886
00:47:20,966 --> 00:47:24,970
咬起来脆脆的，口感十足
Piquant, with a very pleasant crunch.

887
00:47:25,012 --> 00:47:26,597
你会喜欢的啦
You'll learn to love them.

888
00:47:26,638 --> 00:47:28,807
你听我说，这种生活最棒了
I'm telling you, kid, this is the great life...

889
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:31,435
没有规则也没有责任
no rules, no responsibilities.

890
00:47:31,476 --> 00:47:34,229
这个虽小油水很多
Ooh, the little green-filled kind.

891
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:37,816
而且最棒的是...没有忧虑
And best of all, no worries. Well, kid?

892
00:47:37,385 --> 00:47:39,285
来一点吧

893
00:47:39,151 --> 00:47:41,904
HAKUNAMATATA
Oh, well. Hakuna matata.

894
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:49,244
粘粘的，但是还不错
Slimy, yet satisfying.

895
00:47:49,286 --> 00:47:50,829
这就对了
That's it.

896
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:04,426
* Hakuna matata *

897
00:48:04,468 --> 00:48:05,886
* Hakuna matata *

898
00:48:05,928 --> 00:48:07,763
* Hakuna matata, Hakuna *

899
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:10,182
从现在开始
* It means no worries *

900
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:13,435
你不必再担心
* For the rest of your days *

901
00:48:13,477 --> 00:48:16,605
不必像从前
* It's our problem free *

902
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:18,982
听天由命
* Philosophy *

903
00:48:19,024 --> 00:48:20,609
HAKUNAMATATA
* Hakuna matata *

904
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:22,444

905
00:48:22,486 --> 00:48:23,862
* Hakuna matata *

00:48:23,904 --> 00:48:25,280
HAKUNAMATATA
* Hakuna matata *

907
00:48:25,322 --> 00:48:27,324
* Hakuna matata *

00:48:30,452 --> 00:48:31,787

00:48:31,829 --> 00:48:33,163
* Ooh ooh ooh *

911
00:48:33,205 --> 00:48:34,915
HAKUNAMATATA
* Hakuna matata *

912
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:40,754
* Hakuna matata *

913
00:48:40,796 --> 00:48:44,466
HAKUNAMATATA
* Hakuna matata *

914
00:48:44,508 --> 00:48:46,134
* Yeah *

* Ta-ta *

916
00:48:55,561 --> 00:48:58,897
有谁知道我心中悲伤
* Nobody knows *

917
00:48:58,939 --> 00:49:02,442
* The trouble I've seen *

918
00:49:02,484 --> 00:49:06,363
有谁知道我痛苦
* Nobody knows *

919
00:49:06,405 --> 00:49:08,365
* My sorrow *

920
00:49:08,407 --> 00:49:10,534
沙祖，高兴一点
Oh, Zazu, do lighten up.

921
00:49:10,576 --> 00:49:13,829
Sing something with a little bounce in it.

922
00:49:12,263 --> 00:49:15,164
唱一首有点活力的曲子吧

923
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:17,708
世界真是小小小
* It's a small world after all *

924
00:49:17,749 --> 00:49:21,003
不...除了那首什么都可以
No, no! Anything but that.

925
00:49:21,044 --> 00:49:24,882
* I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts *

926
00:49:22,707 --> 00:49:25,369
蝴蝶小时候就是小毛虫

927
00:49:24,923 --> 00:49:26,341
爬来爬去钻来钻去长得真可爱
* Deedle dee dee *

928
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:28,093
* There they are a-standing in a row *

929
00:49:29,845 --> 00:49:31,221
爬呀！爬呀！总有一天会飞
* Big ones, small ones *

930
00:49:31,263 --> 00:49:33,015
* Some as big as your head *

931
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:36,059
以前木法沙都不会叫我这么做
I would never have had to do this with Mufasa.

932
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:38,187
什么？你刚才说什么？
What? What did you say?

933
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:40,439
没...
- Oh, nothing. - You know the law.

934
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:43,609
你知道规矩的
Never ever mention that name in my presence.

935
00:49:40,892 --> 00:49:43,952
在我面前绝对不准提那个名字

936
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:44,860
因为我是国王
I am the king!

937
00:49:44,902 --> 00:49:47,488
是的，陛下
Yes, sire, you are the king.

938
00:49:47,529 --> 00:49:50,574
你是国王
I only mentioned it to illustrate the differences...

939
00:49:48,299 --> 00:49:50,392
我会提起他只是在比较

940
00:49:50,616 --> 00:49:53,076
你们在经营管理方面的 差异之处
in your royal managerial approaches.

941
00:49:53,118 --> 00:49:54,328
老大
Hey, boss.

942
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:56,497
哎哟！又有什么事？
What is it this time?

943
00:49:56,538 --> 00:49:58,790
我们有一件事要跟你抱怨一下
- We got a bone to pick with you. - I'll handle this.

944
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:01,335
让我来说吧
Scar, there's no food, no water.

945
00:49:59,444 --> 00:50:00,206
刀疤

946
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:03,212
已经没有食物也没有水了
Yeah. It's dinnertime...

947
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:05,339
对呀
and we ain't got no stinking entrees.

948
00:50:02,714 --> 00:50:05,683
晚餐时间到了 我们连主菜都没有

949
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:09,801
狩猎的工作 不是由狮子来负责的吗？
It's the lioness's job to do the hunting.

950
00:50:09,843 --> 00:50:11,011
他们不肯去呀
Yeah, but they won't go hunt.

951
00:50:11,053 --> 00:50:12,846
那吃沙祖吧
Oh, eat Zazu.

952
00:50:12,888 --> 00:50:15,057
你们不会爱吃的
Oh, you wouldn't want me.

953
00:50:15,098 --> 00:50:17,893
我的肉又硬、味道又骚
I'd be so tough and gamy and...

954
00:50:17,935 --> 00:50:19,603
而且恶心
Oh, Zazu, don't be ridiculous.

955
00:50:19,645 --> 00:50:21,438
沙祖，不用说笑了
All you need is a little dung.

956
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,565
你只需要加点调味料
I thought things were bad under Mufasa.

957
00:50:22,033 --> 00:50:23,898
我以前以为木法沙实在不好过

958
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:25,234
你刚说什么？
- What did you say? - I said Muf...

959
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:27,861
我说木...我说蒙面纱
Unh! I said... Que pasa?

960
00:50:27,903 --> 00:50:30,322
很好，你们给我走吧
Good. Now get out.

961
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:34,493
可是我们还是很饿
- But we're still hungry. - Out!

962
00:50:34,412 --> 00:50:36,073
滚！

963
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:44,503
哇！辛巴 好大的嗝
Nice one, Simba.

964
00:50:44,545 --> 00:50:47,422
是呀
Thanks. Man, I'm stuffed.

965
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:51,051
天啊！我肚子好胀
Me, too. I ate like a pig.

966
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:49,758
我也是呀

967
00:50:51,093 --> 00:50:53,220
我吃得像只猪
Pumbaa, you are a pig.

968
00:50:53,262 --> 00:50:55,264
彭彭，你本来就是猪呀
Oh. Right.

969
00:50:54,131 --> 00:50:56,759
哦，对啊

970
00:51:06,275 --> 00:51:09,111
丁满
- Timon? - Yeah?

971
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:13,323
怎样？
Ever wonder what those sparkling dots are up there?

972
00:51:09,613 --> 00:51:14,482
你有没有想过 那些发亮的东西是什么？

973
00:51:13,365 --> 00:51:16,410
彭彭，我不用想
Pumbaa, I don't wonder, I know.

974
00:51:16,451 --> 00:51:19,496
我知道
Oh? What are they?

975
00:51:19,538 --> 00:51:21,206
那是什么？
They're fireflies...

976
00:51:21,248 --> 00:51:25,919
那些是萤火虫
fireflies that got stuck in that big blue-ish black thing.

977
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:26,359
那些萤火虫被一个 大大的黑黑的东西困住了

978
00:51:25,961 --> 00:51:28,088
哦...
Oh, gee.

979
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:31,049
我一直以为这是 几千万英里外的气体在燃烧
I always thought they were balls of gas...

980
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:34,928
burning billions of miles away.

981
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:38,473
彭彭，你什么东西都是气体
TIMON: Pumbaa, with you, everything's gas.

982
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:40,601
辛巴，你觉得呢？
Simba, what do you think?

983
00:51:40,642 --> 00:51:42,603
Well, I don't know.

984
00:51:42,644 --> 00:51:44,730
我不知道
Oh, come on. Give, give, give, give.

985
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:47,774
快说，说...辛巴
- Nah. - We told you ours. Please?

986
00:51:47,858 --> 00:51:52,029
我们都告诉你了，拜托
Well, somebody once told me...

987
00:51:48,619 --> 00:51:50,450
这个嘛... 怎样？

988
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:54,948
以前有人跟我说过
that the great kings of the past are up there...

989
00:51:52,823 --> 00:51:57,192
过去那些伟大的君王 会在那些星星上看着我们

990
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:56,700
watching over us.

991
00:51:56,742 --> 00:51:57,910
真的？
Really?

992
00:51:57,951 --> 00:52:02,706
你是指那些 死掉的君王在看着我们
A bunch of royal dead guys are watching us? Pbbt!

993
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:08,337
谁这么告诉你的
TIMON: Who told you something like that?

994
00:52:08,337 --> 00:52:09,546
是呀，是呀
Yeah, yeah.

995
00:52:09,588 --> 00:52:11,173
是哪个笨蛋编的？
What mook made that up?

996
00:52:11,215 --> 00:52:14,384
Yeah, pretty dumb, huh?

997
00:52:12,876 --> 00:52:15,106
是啊，挺傻的对吧

998
00:52:14,426 --> 00:52:17,429
笑死我了
- Aw, you're killing me. - Yeah.

999
00:52:27,064 --> 00:52:30,025
我说错了什么？
Was it something I said?

1000
00:53:20,242 --> 00:53:23,954
Simba?

1001
00:53:23,996 --> 00:53:25,414
辛巴？
He's alive?

1002
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:26,623
他还活着？
He's alive!

1003
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:43,599
是时候了
It is time.

1004
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:50,314
* A wee ma way, a wee ma way *

1005
00:53:50,355 --> 00:53:52,357
* A wee ma way, a wee ma way... *

1006
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:56,361
在这森林中、神奇森林中
* In the jungle, the mighty jungle *

1007
00:53:56,403 --> 00:54:00,616
狮子在睡梦中
* The lion sleeps tonight *

1008
00:54:00,616 --> 00:54:04,578
今夜月色a胧要赶快行动
* In the jungle, the mighty jungle *

1009
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,497
狮子在睡梦中
* The lion sleeps to... *

1010
00:54:06,538 --> 00:54:08,582
我听不见，彭彭
I can't hear you, buddy. Back me up.

1011
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:11,126
替我和音
* A wee *

1012
00:54:11,168 --> 00:54:12,461
* Eee-eee-eee *

1013
00:54:12,503 --> 00:54:16,256
* A pumbaa-bum-baa-way *

1014
00:54:16,298 --> 00:54:19,009
彭彭？彭彭？
Pumbaa? Pumbaa?

1015
00:54:32,648 --> 00:54:35,484
Timon?

1016
00:54:34,702 --> 00:54:36,431
丁满？

1017
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:00,843
彭彭？
Pumbaa?

1018
00:55:04,012 --> 00:55:06,974
彭彭
Pumbaa! Pumbaa!

1019
00:55:05,399 --> 00:55:07,367
彭彭...

1020
00:55:07,015 --> 00:55:09,351
彭彭，出了什么事？
Pumbaa, Pumbaa! Hey, what's going on?

1021
00:55:09,393 --> 00:55:11,061
他打算要吃我
She's going to eat me!

1022
00:55:12,896 --> 00:55:16,984
Whoa! Jeez, why do I always have to save your...

1023
00:55:14,742 --> 00:55:18,576
老天啊 为什么我每次都得救你

1024
00:55:23,365 --> 00:55:24,992
别担心，彭彭 我就在你身边
Don't worry, buddy. I'm here for you.

1025
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:27,494
一切都会没事的
Everything's going to be OK.

1026
00:55:27,536 --> 00:55:30,789
咬他...咬他的头
Get her! Bite her head!

1027
00:55:30,831 --> 00:55:33,709
看我的 咬他大动脉
Go for the jugular! The jugular!

1028
00:55:33,709 --> 00:55:35,878
你看吧，我早说过他会有用的
See, I told you he'd come in handy.

1029
00:55:40,299 --> 00:55:41,925
娜娜？
Nala?

1030
00:55:45,304 --> 00:55:47,222
真的是你吗？
Is it really you?

1031
00:55:47,264 --> 00:55:48,849
你是谁呀？
Who are you?

1032
00:55:48,891 --> 00:55:51,435
是我呀 辛巴
It's me... Simba.

1033
00:55:51,476 --> 00:55:53,395
辛巴？
Simba?

1034
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:58,400
- Whoa! - Aah!

1035
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,320
你怎么了？
- But how did you... - How did you... Wow!

1036
00:55:59,586 --> 00:56:01,850
是呀，是呀！ 你怎么会...

1037
00:56:01,361 --> 00:56:02,571
你是从哪里来的？
Where did you come from?

1038
00:56:02,613 --> 00:56:04,698
我真的好高兴见到你
It's great to see you!

1039
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,742
我见到你才高兴呢！ 这到底怎么回事？
Hey, what's goin' on here?

1040
00:56:06,783 --> 00:56:07,993
你到这儿来干什么？
What are you doing here?

1041
00:56:08,035 --> 00:56:09,995
你这话什么意思？
What are you doing here?

1042
00:56:10,037 --> 00:56:13,248
你怎么会在这里呢？
Hey! What's goin' on here?!

1043
00:56:11,331 --> 00:56:13,697
这到底怎么回事？

1044
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:16,376
丁满，这位是娜娜
Timon, this is Nala. She's my best friend.

1045
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:18,420
她是我最要好的朋友
- Friend? - Yeah.

1046
00:56:16,904 --> 00:56:17,768
朋友？

1047
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,172
是啊
Hey, Pumbaa, come over here.

1048
00:56:18,672 --> 00:56:19,639
喂！彭彭

1049
00:56:20,214 --> 00:56:21,590
快过来
Huh?

1050
00:56:21,632 --> 00:56:24,051
娜娜，这位是彭彭
Nala, this is Pumbaa. Pumbaa, Nala.

1051
00:56:24,092 --> 00:56:25,552
彭彭，她是娜娜
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

1052
00:56:25,594 --> 00:56:26,845
很高兴认识你
The pleasure's all mine.

1053
00:56:26,887 --> 00:56:29,515
这是我的荣幸 不客气
How do you do? Whoa, whoa! Time out!

1054
00:56:29,556 --> 00:56:32,976
暂停！我先把事情搞清楚
Let me get this straight. You know her, she knows you.

1055
00:56:33,018 --> 00:56:37,731
你认识他 他认识你
But she wants to eat him, and everybody's OK with this?

1056
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:35,383
但是她想要吃掉他

1057
00:56:35,489 --> 00:56:38,219
而大家好像都没什么意见

1058
00:56:37,773 --> 00:56:40,442
我说错了什么没有？
- Did I miss something?! - Relax, Timon.

1059
00:56:40,442 --> 00:56:43,445
丁满，别激动嘛！
Wait till everyone finds out you've been here all this time.

1060
00:56:41,361 --> 00:56:43,886
要是大家知道 你一直都在这里的话

1061
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:46,949
还有你妈妈...
And your mother... what will she think?

1062
00:56:46,949 --> 00:56:49,117
她会怎么想呢？
She doesn't have to know.

1063
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:50,494
她没有必要知道
Nobody has to know.

1064
00:56:50,536 --> 00:56:52,830
谁都没必要知道
Of course they do. Everyone thinks you're dead.

1065
00:56:51,038 --> 00:56:53,233
他们当然要知道 大家以为你死了

1066
00:56:52,871 --> 00:56:54,122
是吗？
They do?

1067
00:56:54,122 --> 00:56:57,417
是啊 刀疤告诉我们动物狂奔
Yeah. Scar told us about the stampede.

1068
00:56:57,459 --> 00:57:00,963
是吗？
He did? What else did he tell you?

1069
00:57:01,004 --> 00:57:04,591
他还跟你们说了什么？
What else matters? You're alive, and that means...

1070
00:57:01,548 --> 00:57:03,277
那些并不重要 你还活着呀

1071
00:57:04,633 --> 00:57:06,426
而这就表示...
you're the king.

1072
00:57:06,468 --> 00:57:08,136
你是国王
King?

1073
00:57:08,178 --> 00:57:11,765
国王？
Lady, have you got your lions crossed.

1074
00:57:08,789 --> 00:57:12,122
小姐 你有没有搞错对象啊？

1075
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:14,268
国王？
King? Your Majesty...

1076
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:17,146
哎哟！我的国王 我匍匐在你脚前
I gravel at your feet.

1077
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:18,397
不要闹了
Stop it.

1078
00:57:18,438 --> 00:57:20,190
少笨了，别傻了 搞什么？
It's not "gravel", it's "grovel".

1079
00:57:20,232 --> 00:57:22,693
他才不是国王呢！
And don't!  He's not the king.

1080
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:24,361
你是吗？ 不是
- Are you? - No!

1081
00:57:24,403 --> 00:57:26,947
辛巴
- Simba! - I'm not the king.

1082
00:57:26,989 --> 00:57:30,325
不是，我不是国王
Maybe I was gonna be, but that was a long time ago.

1083
00:57:27,441 --> 00:57:28,601
或许我以前可能会是国王

1084
00:57:28,775 --> 00:57:30,800
但是...那是很久以前的事了

1085
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:31,493
让我把事情搞清楚
Let me get this straight.

1086
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:34,204
你是国王
You're the king? And you never told us?

1087
00:57:34,246 --> 00:57:35,789
而你从没告诉我们
Look, I'm still the same guy.

1088
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:37,040
我还是原来的我呀
But with power.

1089
00:57:37,082 --> 00:57:40,043
但更有权势
Could you guys excuse us for a few minutes?

1090
00:57:37,618 --> 00:57:41,179
麻烦你们俩位 先回避一下好吗？

1091
00:57:40,085 --> 00:57:42,004
不管她说什么 都可以在我们面前说
Whatever she has to say...

1092
00:57:42,004 --> 00:57:44,173
she can say in front of us, right, Simba?

1093
00:57:44,214 --> 00:57:47,885
对不对？辛巴
Mmm... maybe you'd better go.

1094
00:57:46,894 --> 00:57:49,089
你们还是离开吧

1095
00:57:49,052 --> 00:57:52,347
开始了吧
It starts. You think you know a guy.

1096
00:57:51,198 --> 00:57:53,962
我还以为我了解他呢

1097
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:59,104
丁满跟彭彭
Timon and Pumbaa... you learn to love 'em.

1098
00:57:57,704 --> 00:58:00,264
你慢慢会喜欢他们的

1099
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,066
怎么了？
What?

1100
00:58:04,401 --> 00:58:05,694
你怎么了？
What is it?

1101
00:58:05,694 --> 00:58:09,156
这就像你从死里复活一样
It's like you're back from the dead.

1102
00:58:09,198 --> 00:58:13,202
你不知道 这对大家的意义有多大
You don't know how much this will mean to everyone...

1103
00:58:13,243 --> 00:58:15,204
还有对我...
what it means to me.

1104
00:58:15,245 --> 00:58:17,039
嘿！没事的
Hey, it's OK.

1105
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,041
我真的很想念你
I've really missed you.

1106
00:58:19,082 --> 00:58:21,835
我也想你呀
I've missed you, too.

1107
00:58:23,086 --> 00:58:27,049
I tell you, Pumbaa. This stinks.

1108
00:58:24,748 --> 00:58:26,511
彭彭，搞什么？

1109
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:28,884
恶不恶心
Oh, sorry.

1110
00:58:28,884 --> 00:58:31,094
对不起
Not you, them!

1111
00:58:29,553 --> 00:58:31,612
不是你，是他们

1112
00:58:31,136 --> 00:58:34,890
他、她...在一起
Him, her, alone.

1113
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:36,433
那有什么不对？
What's wrong with that?

1114
00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:37,726
事实放在眼前
* I can see what's happening *

1115
00:58:37,768 --> 00:58:38,977
什么？
What?!

1116
00:58:39,019 --> 00:58:40,521
你不必再犹豫
* And they don't have a clue *

1117
00:58:40,562 --> 00:58:41,772
谁呀？
Who?!

1118
00:58:41,814 --> 00:58:43,106
把眼睛闭起都会看出来
* They'll fall in love *

1119
00:58:43,148 --> 00:58:45,025
* And here's the bottom line *

1120
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:46,777
他们俩是一对
* Our trio's down to two *

1121
00:58:46,819 --> 00:58:48,237
哦
Oh.

1122
00:58:48,237 --> 00:58:49,780
美丽纯洁的爱情
* Ze sweet caress *

1123
00:58:49,822 --> 00:58:51,073
* Of twilight *

1124
00:58:51,114 --> 00:58:54,159
这夜晚多么美
* There's magic everywhere *

1125
00:58:54,201 --> 00:58:58,205
让浪漫温馨充满每一处
* And with all this romantic *

1126
00:58:58,247 --> 00:58:59,748
* Atmosphere *

1127
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:06,380
到处散发着爱
* Disaster's in the air *

1128
00:59:08,841 --> 00:59:11,218
这夜晚爱情到来
* Can you feel *

1129
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:15,097
* The love tonight? *

1130
00:59:15,097 --> 00:59:21,019
充满美丽温馨
* The peace the evening brings? *

1131
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:24,189
所有万物也同样感受到
* The world, for once *

1132
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:27,442
* In perfect harmony *

1133
00:59:27,442 --> 00:59:32,781
显得如此平静
* With all its living things *

1134
00:59:34,283 --> 00:59:36,869
我想要说声爱你
* So many things to tell her *

1135
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:40,080
不知该怎么说
* But how to make her see *

1136
00:59:40,122 --> 00:59:42,666
只有在心中告诉亲爱的
* The truth about my past? *

1137
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:46,378
* Impossible, she'd turn away from me *

1138
00:59:44,561 --> 00:59:47,121
你是我唯一所爱

1139
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:48,172
不要害怕说爱我
* He's holding back *

1140
00:59:48,213 --> 00:59:49,756
* He's hiding *

1141
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:52,968
我心正在等待
* But what, I can't decide *

1142
00:59:52,968 --> 00:59:56,346
从你的双眼我看出来 你是我唯一所爱
* Why won't he be the king I know he is *

1143
00:59:56,388 --> 01:00:01,101
* The king I see inside *

1144
01:00:01,143 --> 01:00:03,020
这夜晚爱情到来
* Can you feel *

1145
01:00:03,061 --> 01:00:06,982
* The love tonight *

1146
01:00:06,982 --> 01:00:13,447
充满美丽温馨
* The peace the evening brings? *

1147
01:00:13,489 --> 01:00:16,366
所有万物也同样感受到
* The world, for once *

1148
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:19,578
* In perfect harmony *

1149
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:25,417
显得如此平静
* With all its living things *

1150
01:00:26,752 --> 01:00:28,378
这夜晚爱情到来
* Can you feel *

1151
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:33,217
* The love tonight? *

1152
01:00:33,258 --> 01:00:38,096
充满美丽温馨
* You needn't look too far *

1153
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:41,850
这一刻快闭上眼睛
* Stealing through *

1154
01:00:41,892 --> 01:00:45,187
* The night's uncertainties *

1155
01:00:45,187 --> 01:00:50,108
享受着平静
* Love is where they are *

1156
01:00:51,485 --> 01:00:54,404
从今以后剩我们俩
* And if he falls *

1157
01:00:54,446 --> 01:00:57,324
* In love tonight *

1158
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:04,581
请你不要哭
* It can be assumed *

1159
01:01:04,623 --> 01:01:07,251
在我心底你是我朋友
* His carefree days *

1160
01:01:07,292 --> 01:01:10,712
* With us are history *

1161
01:01:10,712 --> 01:01:14,842
从今直到永远
* In short, our pal *

1162
01:01:14,883 --> 01:01:22,683
* Is doomed *

1163
01:01:28,939 --> 01:01:31,024
Isn't this a great place?

1164
01:01:31,066 --> 01:01:33,152
你觉得这里怎么样？
It is beautiful...

1165
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:36,113
这里好美哦
but I don't understand something.

1166
01:01:36,155 --> 01:01:38,574
但是有一件事我不了解
You've been alive all this time.

1167
01:01:38,615 --> 01:01:40,993
你既然一直都还活着
Why didn't you come back to Pride Rock?

1168
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:44,329
你为什么不回去呢？
Well, I just needed to get out on my own...

1169
01:01:41,911 --> 01:01:45,369
这...我只是想靠自己站起来

1170
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:45,914
过自己的生活
live my own life.

1171
01:01:45,956 --> 01:01:47,916
我这么做了 真的很棒
And I did, and it's great.

1172
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:50,043
可是那边真的很需要你
We've really needed you at home.

1173
01:01:50,085 --> 01:01:51,879
没有人需要我
No one needs me.

1174
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,381
不！我们需要
Yes, we do. You're the king.

1175
01:01:54,423 --> 01:01:55,591
你是国王
Nala, we've been through this.

1176
01:01:55,632 --> 01:01:57,551
能不能不要再提了 我不是国王
I'm not the king. Scar is.

1177
01:01:57,593 --> 01:02:01,430
刀疤才是
Simba, he let the hyenas take over the pride lands.

1178
01:01:59,028 --> 01:02:01,929
辛巴，他让那些土狼 接管了得意之地

1179
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,557
什么？
- What? - Everything's destroyed.

1180
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,267
所有的一切都毁了
There's no food, no water.

1181
01:02:05,309 --> 01:02:06,810
没有食物、没有水
Simba, if you don't do something soon...

1182
01:02:06,852 --> 01:02:08,061
辛巴，如果你不想办法 每个人都会挨饿
everyone will starve.

1183
01:02:08,103 --> 01:02:09,438
我不能回去
- I can't go back. - Why?

1184
01:02:09,438 --> 01:02:11,648
为什么？
- You wouldn't understand. - What?

1185
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:14,443
你不了解的
No, it doesn't matter. Hakuna matata.

1186
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,132
我不了解什么？

1187
01:02:12,308 --> 01:02:14,902
不...这些都不重要 HAKUNAMATATA

1188
01:02:14,443 --> 01:02:16,236
什么？
- What? - Hakuna matata.

1189
01:02:16,278 --> 01:02:18,030
HAKUNAMATATA
It's something I learned out here.

1190
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:19,781
是我在这儿学到的
Look, sometimes bad things happen...

1191
01:02:19,781 --> 01:02:20,949
有的时候 会发生一些不好的事情
Simba...

1192
01:02:20,991 --> 01:02:22,784
辛巴 而你根本就无能为力
And there's nothing you can do about it...

1193
01:02:22,784 --> 01:02:24,411
所以你干嘛担心呢？
so why worry?

1194
01:02:24,453 --> 01:02:26,246
你不认为那是你的责任吗？
Because it's your responsibility.

1195
01:02:26,288 --> 01:02:28,957
Well, what about you? You left.

1196
01:02:28,999 --> 01:02:31,960
那么你呢？你也离开了
I left to find help, and I found you.

1197
01:02:29,625 --> 01:02:31,252
我是为了要求救

1198
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:36,298
而我找到了你 你还不明白吗？
Don't you understand? You're our only hope.

1199
01:02:34,764 --> 01:02:37,198
你是我们唯一的希望

1200
01:02:36,298 --> 01:02:37,591
抱歉！
Sorry.

1201
01:02:37,633 --> 01:02:41,261
你到底是怎么了？
What's happened to you? You're not the Simba I remember.

1202
01:02:41,303 --> 01:02:44,848
你不再是我记忆中的辛巴了
You're right. I'm not. Are you satisfied?

1203
01:02:42,138 --> 01:02:42,797
你说的对

1204
01:02:42,938 --> 01:02:45,338
我不是 现在你满意了吗？

1205
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:46,975
不！我只是觉得失望
No, just disappointed.

1206
01:02:47,017 --> 01:02:49,937
你知道吗？ 你说话开始像我爸爸了
You're starting to sound like my father.

1207
01:02:49,978 --> 01:02:51,939
很好！至少我们有人像他
Good. At least one of us does.

1208
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:54,775
娜娜
Listen, you think you can just show up...

1209
01:02:54,817 --> 01:02:56,318
你以为你的出现 就能改变我现在的生活吗？
and tell me how to live my life?

1210
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,445
你根本不知道我经历了什么
You don't even know what I've been through.

1211
01:02:58,487 --> 01:03:00,197
如果你肯告诉我 我愿意...
I would, if you'd just tell me.

1212
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:02,074
算了
- Forget it! - Fine!

1213
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:03,255
好

1214
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,954
她错了 我不能回去
She's wrong.

1215
01:03:06,995 --> 01:03:08,413
I can't go back.

1216
01:03:08,455 --> 01:03:12,209
事情都已经发生了
What would it prove, anyway? It won't change anything.

1217
01:03:12,251 --> 01:03:14,586
回去又能证明什么呢？
You can't change the past.

1218
01:03:13,435 --> 01:03:16,302
这又改变不了任何事情

1219
01:03:17,422 --> 01:03:20,843
你说你会永远在我身边的
You said you'd always be there for me!

1220
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:22,553
可是你没有
But you're not.

1221
01:03:24,972 --> 01:03:27,641
都是因为我
And it's because of me.

1222
01:03:27,683 --> 01:03:30,727
是我的错
It's my fault.

1223
01:03:30,769 --> 01:03:33,272
是我的错
It's my fault.

1224
01:03:36,859 --> 01:03:38,902
* Asante sana, squash banana *

1225
01:03:38,944 --> 01:03:40,362
* We we nugu, mi mi apana *

1226
01:03:40,404 --> 01:03:42,239
* Asante sana, squash banana *

1227
01:03:42,281 --> 01:03:43,991
* We we nugu, mi mi apana *

1228
01:03:44,032 --> 01:03:45,993
* Asante sana, squash banana *

1229
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:47,327
* We we nugu, mi mi apana *

1230
01:03:47,369 --> 01:03:50,330
* A-do-de-do da-do-ba-de-do *

1231
01:04:12,227 --> 01:04:14,438
* Asante sana, squash banana *

1232
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,231
* We we nugu, mi mi apana *

1233
01:04:17,816 --> 01:04:19,485
拜托你停一下，好吗？
Come on, will you cut it out?

1234
01:04:19,526 --> 01:04:21,445
他停不下来 他会再回来的
Can't cut it out. It'll grow right back.

1235
01:04:21,487 --> 01:04:23,864
Creepy little monkey.

1236
01:04:23,906 --> 01:04:26,909
可恶的小猴子
Will you stop following me? Who are you?

1237
01:04:25,107 --> 01:04:26,734
你能不能不要再跟踪我了

1238
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:29,495
你是谁呀？
The question is, who are you?

1239
01:04:27,743 --> 01:04:31,702
问题是...你是谁呀？

1240
01:04:31,872 --> 01:04:34,124
我以为我知道
I thought I knew.

1241
01:04:34,166 --> 01:04:35,709
现在我不确定了
Now I'm not so sure.

1242
01:04:35,751 --> 01:04:37,336
我知道你是谁
Well, I know who you are.

1243
01:04:37,377 --> 01:04:39,755
来，这是秘密
Shh. Come here. It's a secret.

1244
01:04:39,796 --> 01:04:42,674
* Asante sana, squash banana *

1245
01:04:42,716 --> 01:04:44,176
Enough already!

1246
01:04:44,218 --> 01:04:45,677
够了 你说这些到底什么意思？
What is that supposed to mean, anyway?

1247
01:04:45,719 --> 01:04:49,056
这表示你是狒狒 我不是
It means you are a baboon, and I'm not.

1248
01:04:50,766 --> 01:04:53,101
我看你是有点老糊涂了
I think you're a little confused.

1249
01:04:53,101 --> 01:04:56,063
错了 老糊涂的人不是我
Wrong! I'm not the one who's confused.

1250
01:04:56,104 --> 01:04:57,940
你连你是谁都不知道
You don't even know who you are.

1251
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:59,608
这么说你知道罗
Oh, and I suppose you know.

1252
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:02,110
当然 你是木法沙的孩子
Sure do. You're Mufasa's boy.

1253
01:05:04,154 --> 01:05:06,824
拜拜
- Bye. - Hey, wait!

1254
01:05:06,615 --> 01:05:08,276
喂！等等...

1255
01:05:15,666 --> 01:05:16,959
你以前认识我爸爸？
You knew my father?

1256
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,170
修正一下
Correction... I know your father.

1257
01:05:18,827 --> 01:05:22,319
我现在认识他

1258
01:05:21,964 --> 01:05:24,258
我很不想这么说
I hate to tell you this...

1259
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:27,427
但是他死了
but he died a long time ago.

1260
01:05:27,469 --> 01:05:29,680
死了好久了
Nope. Wrong again!

1261
01:05:28,137 --> 01:05:31,163
不，又错了

1262
01:05:31,056 --> 01:05:33,934
他还活着 我可以带你去看他
He's alive, and I'll show him to you.

1263
01:05:33,976 --> 01:05:36,812
你跟着拉飞奇 他知道怎么走
You follow old Rafiki. He knows the way. Come on!

1264
01:05:36,678 --> 01:05:38,669
跟我来，乖

1265
01:05:46,446 --> 01:05:48,949
别拖拖拉拉的... 快点啦
Don't dawdle. Hurry up!

1266
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:50,576
等等...
Hey, whoa, wait, wait.

1267
01:05:50,617 --> 01:05:52,286
快点，快点
Come on. Come on!

1268
01:05:54,496 --> 01:05:56,331
慢一点好吗？
Would you slow down?

1269
01:06:07,134 --> 01:06:08,302
站住
Stop!

1270
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:13,239
嘘！

1271
01:06:14,183 --> 01:06:16,059
往下看
Look down there.

1272
01:06:40,709 --> 01:06:42,503
那不是我爸爸
That's not my father.

1273
01:06:42,544 --> 01:06:44,129
那只是我的倒影
That's just my reflection.

1274
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:49,551
不...
No. Look harder.

1275
01:06:47,883 --> 01:06:50,477
仔细看

1276
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:57,434
You see?

1277
01:06:56,959 --> 01:06:59,427
你看

1278
01:06:58,685 --> 01:07:01,188
他活在你心中
He lives in you.

1279
01:07:05,317 --> 01:07:08,028
辛巴
Simba.

1280
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:09,696
爸爸
Father?

1281
01:07:17,621 --> 01:07:20,457
辛巴，你已经忘了我
Simba, you have forgotten me.

1282
01:07:20,499 --> 01:07:22,668
不！我怎么忘得了
No. How could I?

1283
01:07:22,709 --> 01:07:25,003
你已经忘了你是谁 也忘了我
You have forgotten who you are...

1284
01:07:25,045 --> 01:07:27,464
and so have forgotten me.

1285
01:07:27,506 --> 01:07:29,800
看看你自己的内心
Look inside yourself, Simba.

1286
01:07:29,842 --> 01:07:33,971
你比你现在还要聪明
You are more than what you have become.

1287
01:07:34,012 --> 01:07:37,391
你一定要回到食物链的位置上
You must take your place in the circle of life.

1288
01:07:37,432 --> 01:07:39,268
我怎么能回去呢？
How can I go back?

1289
01:07:39,268 --> 01:07:41,395
我已经不是以前的我了
I'm not who I used to be.

1290
01:07:41,436 --> 01:07:45,274
要记住你是谁
Remember who you are.

1291
01:07:45,274 --> 01:07:49,361
你是我儿子
You are my son, and the one true king.

1292
01:07:48,176 --> 01:07:51,703
也是唯一的国王

1293
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:54,908
要记住你是谁
Remember who you are.

1294
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:57,703
不！求求你
No! Please, don't leave me!

1295
01:07:57,744 --> 01:07:58,912
不要离开我
Remember.

1296
01:07:58,954 --> 01:08:00,706
要记住
- Father! - Remember.

1297
01:08:00,747 --> 01:08:02,749
爸 记住...
Don't leave me.

1298
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:04,751
不要离开我
Remember.

1299
01:08:03,992 --> 01:08:07,155
记住...

1300
01:08:13,051 --> 01:08:15,387
那是什么？嘿嘿...
What was that?

1301
01:08:15,429 --> 01:08:17,181
那天气非常的特别
The weather... Pbbah!

1302
01:08:17,222 --> 01:08:19,766
Very peculiar, don't you think?

1303
01:08:19,808 --> 01:08:23,020
你觉得呢？
Yeah. Looks like the winds are changing.

1304
01:08:20,475 --> 01:08:21,942
是呀

1305
01:08:23,061 --> 01:08:25,647
看来风向好像要改变了
Ahh, change is good.

1306
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,375
哦一改变是好的

1307
01:08:25,689 --> 01:08:27,900
是呀！但是并不容易
Yeah, but it's not easy.

1308
01:08:27,941 --> 01:08:29,651
我知道我必须做些什么 但是...
I know what I have to do...

1309
01:08:29,693 --> 01:08:32,988
回去就表示 我必须面对我的过去
but going back means I'll have to face my past.

1310
01:08:32,988 --> 01:08:36,116
I've been running from it for so long.

1311
01:08:34,523 --> 01:08:37,424
我逃避过去已经逃了那么久了

1312
01:08:37,576 --> 01:08:39,411
哦！老天啊
Jeez! What was that for?

1313
01:08:39,453 --> 01:08:42,372
你这是干嘛？
It doesn't matter. It's in the past.

1314
01:08:40,162 --> 01:08:43,359
那并不重要，过去就别管了

1315
01:08:42,414 --> 01:08:44,374
是呀！但是我还是会心痛
Yeah, but it still hurts.

1316
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:46,793
过去是会让人心痛
Oh, yes, the past can hurt.

1317
01:08:46,835 --> 01:08:50,464
但是依我看
But the way I see it, you can either run from it...

1318
01:08:50,506 --> 01:08:52,883
你是可以逃避它 或者记取教训
or learn from it.

1319
01:08:54,176 --> 01:08:56,303
哈...你学会了 现在怎么办？
You see? So, what are you going to do?

1320
01:08:56,345 --> 01:08:58,931
首先我要拿走你的拐杖
First, I'm gonna take your stick.

1321
01:08:58,972 --> 01:09:01,225
不...你别拿我拐杖
No, no, no, no! Not the stick!

1322
01:09:01,266 --> 01:09:03,560
Hey! Where are you going?

1323
01:09:03,602 --> 01:09:04,895
你到哪儿去呀？
I'm going back!

1324
01:09:04,937 --> 01:09:07,856
我要回去了
Good! Go on! Get out of here!

1325
01:09:05,954 --> 01:09:10,220
好，去呀 离开这里

1326
01:09:23,205 --> 01:09:25,833
Grubs! Grubs!

1327
01:09:31,088 --> 01:09:33,423
喂，醒醒啊
Hey. Hey, wake up.

1328
01:09:37,427 --> 01:09:40,889
彭彭，丁满
It's OK! It's OK! It's me!

1329
01:09:39,288 --> 01:09:42,382
是我呀，没事啊

1330
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:44,393
Don't ever do that again.

1331
01:09:42,591 --> 01:09:44,991
以后不要再这样吓我们了

1332
01:09:44,434 --> 01:09:46,395
又是动物
Carnivores... Oy!

1333
01:09:46,436 --> 01:09:47,980
你们有没有看到辛巴？
Have you guys seen Simba?

1334
01:09:48,021 --> 01:09:49,189
我还以为他跟你在一起
I thought he was with you.

1335
01:09:49,231 --> 01:09:50,691
但是我现在找不到他 他在哪里啊？
He was, but now I can't find him.

1336
01:09:50,732 --> 01:09:51,984
- Where is he? - Ha ha ha!

1337
01:09:52,025 --> 01:09:54,153
你在这里找不到他的
You won't find him here!

1338
01:09:54,194 --> 01:09:57,406
哈哈...国王已经回去了
The king has returned.

1339
01:09:57,406 --> 01:10:00,659
我真不敢相信
I can't believe it. He's gone back.

1340
01:10:00,701 --> 01:10:02,578
他回去了
Gone back? What do you mean?

1341
01:10:02,578 --> 01:10:05,455
回去？你什么意思？
Hey, what's goin' on here?

1342
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:06,046
喂！这到底怎么回事？

1343
01:10:05,497 --> 01:10:06,748
那猴子是谁？
Who's the monkey?

1344
01:10:06,748 --> 01:10:08,083
辛巴要回去向刀疤挑战
Simba's gone back to challenge Scar.

1345
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:09,293
谁？ 刀疤
- Who? - Scar.

1346
01:10:09,334 --> 01:10:11,211
谁叫刀疤？
- Who's got a scar? - No. It's his uncle.

1347
01:10:11,253 --> 01:10:13,046
不...那是他叔叔
- The monkey's his uncle? - No!

1348
01:10:13,088 --> 01:10:14,673
那猴子是他叔叔？
Simba's gone back to challenge his uncle...

1349
01:10:12,788 --> 01:10:15,256
不，辛巴要回去向他叔叔挑战

1350
01:10:14,715 --> 01:10:16,592
并且取回王位
to take his place as king.

1351
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:19,259
哦...

1352
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:17,152
辛巴，等等
Simba, wait up!

1353
01:11:20,656 --> 01:11:22,115
很可怕，对不对？
It's awful, isn't it?

1354
01:11:22,157 --> 01:11:24,993
你跟我说的时候 我并不愿意相信
I didn't want to believe you.

1355
01:11:24,993 --> 01:11:27,120
是什么让你想回来的？
What made you come back?

1356
01:11:27,162 --> 01:11:30,123
因为我的理智终于被敲醒了
I finally got some sense knocked into me...

1357
01:11:30,165 --> 01:11:32,501
我头上还有包包可以证明呢！
and I've got the bump to prove it.

1358
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:34,962
话说回来这是我的国度
Besides, this is my kingdom.

1359
01:11:35,003 --> 01:11:38,382
如果我不为它而战 还有谁会？
If I don't fight for it, who will?

1360
01:11:38,423 --> 01:11:41,426
我会
- I will. - It's gonna be dangerous.

1361
01:11:41,468 --> 01:11:42,678
这是很危险的
Danger? Ha!

1362
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,973
危险？哼！
I laugh in the face of danger.

1363
01:11:43,312 --> 01:11:46,076
我会当面嘲笑危险 哈哈...

1364
01:11:46,014 --> 01:11:47,850
我觉得这件事一点也不好笑
I see nothing funny about this.

1365
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:50,936
丁满、彭彭 你们来这儿干嘛？
Timon, Pumbaa, what are you doing here?

1366
01:11:50,978 --> 01:11:53,147
我们随时为陛下服务
At your service, my liege.

1367
01:11:53,188 --> 01:11:56,900
哦，我们就为了这些...
We're gonna fight your uncle for this?

1368
01:11:56,942 --> 01:12:00,320
要向你叔叔挑战？
Yes, Timon. This is my home.

1369
01:11:57,860 --> 01:12:00,761
是的，丁满 这里是我的家

1370
01:12:00,362 --> 01:12:03,073
哦，这里是该大肆整顿了
Talk about your fixer-upper.

1371
01:12:03,115 --> 01:12:05,868
哦，辛巴
Well, Simba, if it's important to you...

1372
01:12:05,868 --> 01:12:07,578
如果这对你很重要 我们会永远支持你
we're with you to the end.

1373
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:30,184
土狼...我恨土狼
Hyenas. I hate hyenas.

1374
01:12:30,225 --> 01:12:32,853
要穿过那些家伙 你有什么好计划？
So, what's your plan for getting past those guys?

1375
01:12:32,895 --> 01:12:36,315
用活的饵
- Live bait. - Good idea. Hey!

1376
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:39,234
好主意
Come on, Timon. You guys have to create a diversion.

1377
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:39,827
来吧，丁满 你们去分散他们的注意力

1378
01:12:39,234 --> 01:12:41,862
你要我怎么做？ 穿上裙子跳草裙舞吗？
What do you want me to do, dress in drag and do the hula?

1379
01:12:41,904 --> 01:12:44,031
Luau!

1380
01:12:44,072 --> 01:12:45,782
假如你要尝尝美味多汁的鲜肉
* If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat *

1381
01:12:45,824 --> 01:12:47,618
远在天边近在眼前不必花心思
* Eat my buddy Pumbaa here because he is a treat *

1382
01:12:47,659 --> 01:12:49,661
这只猪很肥包你吃满意
* Come on down and dine on this tasty swine *

1383
01:12:49,703 --> 01:12:51,205
不必客气快来吃个饱
* All you have to do is get in line *

1384
01:12:51,246 --> 01:12:53,749
你会痛吗？ 砰砰砰
- * Are you achin' * - Yep, yep, yep.

1385
01:12:53,749 --> 01:12:55,751
来，先来一客 砰砰砰
- * For some bacon? * - Yep, yep, yep.

1386
01:12:55,792 --> 01:12:57,377
瞧瞧他有多棒 砰砰
- * He's a big pig * - Yep yep.

1387
01:12:57,419 --> 01:12:59,421
你可以向他一样酷
* You could be a big pig, too, oy! *

1388
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:07,763
娜娜
Nala, you find my mother and rally the lionesses.

1389
01:13:05,694 --> 01:13:08,128
你先去找我妈 然后集合所有的狮子

1390
01:13:07,805 --> 01:13:09,306
我去找刀疤
I'll look for Scar.

1391
01:13:13,227 --> 01:13:16,480
沙拉碧
Sarabi!

1392
01:13:29,576 --> 01:13:30,786
什么事？刀疤
Yes, Scar?

1393
01:13:30,828 --> 01:13:32,663
你们的狩猎队呢？
Where is your hunting party?

1394
01:13:32,704 --> 01:13:34,373
他们没有尽职地工作
They're not doing their job.

1395
01:13:34,414 --> 01:13:37,334
刀疤，已经没有食物了
Scar, there is no food. The herds have moved on.

1396
01:13:37,376 --> 01:13:40,087
动物都离开了
No, you're just not looking hard enough.

1397
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:40,578
不！他们只是没有认真找而已

1398
01:13:40,128 --> 01:13:44,091
结束了，这里什么都没有
It's over. There is nothing left.

1399
01:13:44,132 --> 01:13:46,260
我们只剩下一个选择
We have only once choice.

1400
01:13:46,301 --> 01:13:48,178
我们必须离开荣耀石
We must leave Pride Rock.

1401
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:49,721
我们什么地方都不去
We're not going anywhere.

1402
01:13:49,763 --> 01:13:51,723
那么你是在判我们死刑
Then you have sentenced us to death.

1403
01:13:51,765 --> 01:13:53,934
那么就死吧
- Then so be it. - You can't do that.

1404
01:13:53,976 --> 01:13:56,186
你不能那么做
I am the king. I can do whatever I want.

1405
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,994
我是国王我爱怎么做都可以

1406
01:13:56,228 --> 01:13:58,772
如果你有木法沙王的一半...
If you were half the king Mufasa was...

1407
01:13:58,814 --> 01:14:01,441
我比木法沙王要强上十倍
I'm ten times the king Mufasa was!

1408
01:14:04,403 --> 01:14:06,822
木法沙？
Mufasa? No, you're dead.

1409
01:14:05,904 --> 01:14:08,395
不！你死了

1410
01:14:13,787 --> 01:14:15,914
木法沙？
Mufasa?

1411
01:14:15,956 --> 01:14:19,251
No. It's me.

1412
01:14:17,649 --> 01:14:20,277
不，是我

1413
01:14:19,293 --> 01:14:23,297
辛巴？
Simba. You're alive?

1414
01:14:23,338 --> 01:14:24,923
你还活着？
How can that be?

1415
01:14:24,965 --> 01:14:26,341
怎么可能呢？
It doesn't matter.

1416
01:14:26,341 --> 01:14:28,844
这不重要
I'm home.

1417
01:14:27,259 --> 01:14:29,352
我回来了

1418
01:14:28,844 --> 01:14:30,220
辛巴？
Simba?

1419
01:14:30,262 --> 01:14:31,889
辛巴！
Simba.

1420
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:36,435
看到你还活着 真让我有一点...惊讶
Oh, I'm a little surprised to see you... alive.

1421
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:41,648
给我一个好理由 让我不致于撕烂你
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart.

1422
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:43,609
辛巴，你一定要了解
Simba, you must understand.

1423
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:46,153
统治一个国度的压力呀！
The pressures of ruling a kingdom...

1424
01:14:46,195 --> 01:14:47,779
这国度不再是你的了 退位吧，刀疤
Are no longer yours.

1425
01:14:47,821 --> 01:14:49,448
Step down, Scar.

1426
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:51,950
哈...是啊 我会的
Oh, well, I would, naturally.

1427
01:14:51,992 --> 01:14:54,953
当然会啦！
However, there is one little problem.

1428
01:14:53,485 --> 01:14:55,817
但是这里有个小问题

1429
01:14:54,995 --> 01:14:56,872
看到他们没有？
You see them?

1430
01:14:58,499 --> 01:15:00,834
他们认为我是国王
They think I'm king.

1431
01:15:00,876 --> 01:15:02,461
我们不认为
Well, we don't.

1432
01:15:02,503 --> 01:15:04,671
辛巴才是合法的国王
Simba's the rightful king.

1433
01:15:04,713 --> 01:15:06,673
选择权在你手上
The choice is yours, Scar.

1434
01:15:06,715 --> 01:15:09,176
退位不然就战斗
Either step down or fight.

1435
01:15:09,218 --> 01:15:11,720
难道非要用暴力解决吗？
Must this all end in violence?

1436
01:15:11,762 --> 01:15:16,099
我不喜欢为 家族成员的死亡来负责
I'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member.

1437
01:15:16,141 --> 01:15:17,684
你同意吗？辛巴
Wouldn't you agree, Simba?

1438
01:15:17,726 --> 01:15:19,478
你说这些都没有用，刀疤
That's not gonna work, Scar.

1439
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,021
我已经把它遗忘了
I've put it behind me.

1440
01:15:21,063 --> 01:15:22,898
但是你那些忠实的臣民呢？
But what about your faithful subjects?

1441
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:24,983
他们也忘掉了吗？
Have they put it behind them?

1442
01:15:25,025 --> 01:15:27,152
辛巴，他到底在说什么？
Simba, what is he talking about?

1443
01:15:28,403 --> 01:15:31,448
哦！你还没有告诉她们 你那些小秘密？
so you haven't told them your little secret.

1444
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:34,910
辛巴，现在你有机会告诉他们
Well, Simba, now's your chance to tell them.

1445
01:15:34,952 --> 01:15:39,915
告诉他们木法沙的死 到底该由谁来负责！
Tell them who is responsible for Mufasa's death.

1446
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:43,335
是我
I am.

1447
01:15:47,673 --> 01:15:50,259
这不是真的
It's not true.

1448
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:53,053
告诉我这不是真的
Tell me it's not true.

1449
01:15:54,304 --> 01:15:55,556
是真的
It's true.

1450
01:15:55,597 --> 01:15:59,351
看吧，他承认了
You see? He admits it! Murderer!

1451
01:15:59,393 --> 01:16:00,811
凶手...
No, it was an accident.

1452
01:16:00,853 --> 01:16:03,063
不！那只是个意外
If it weren't for you, Mufasa would still be alive.

1453
01:16:01,453 --> 01:16:03,250
如果不是为了你 木法沙还会活着

1454
01:16:03,105 --> 01:16:05,774
他的死是你的错 你能否认吗？
It's your fault he's dead! Do you deny it?

1455
01:16:05,816 --> 01:16:08,819
不能
- No. - Then you're guilty.

1456
01:16:06,959 --> 01:16:09,291
那么你是有罪的了

1457
01:16:08,861 --> 01:16:10,571
不！我不是凶手
No, I'm not a murderer.

1458
01:16:10,612 --> 01:16:12,948
辛巴，你又再度有麻烦了
Oh, Simba, you're in trouble again.

1459
01:16:12,948 --> 01:16:16,034
但是这一回爸爸 可没办法来救你了
But this time, Daddy isn't here to save you...

1460
01:16:16,076 --> 01:16:19,329
现在每个人都知道原因了
and now everyone knows why!

1461
01:16:19,371 --> 01:16:21,707
辛巴
Simba!

1462
01:16:26,295 --> 01:16:30,132
Now, this looks familiar.

1463
01:16:28,146 --> 01:16:32,048
这一幕看起来很眼熟

1464
01:16:30,132 --> 01:16:33,260
Where have I seen this before?

1465
01:16:33,302 --> 01:16:35,179
我以前在哪儿看过？ 我想想看哦！
Let me think. Hmm.

1466
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:38,640
哦！对了！我想到了
Oh, yes. I remember.

1467
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:43,020
这正是你爸爸 要死之前的那个情景
This is just the way your father looked before he died.

1468
01:16:44,605 --> 01:16:48,400
而这是我的小秘密
And here's my little secret...

1469
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:51,570
我杀了木法沙
I killed Mufasa.

1470
01:16:51,612 --> 01:16:54,114
No-o-o-o!

1471
01:16:54,156 --> 01:16:57,284
No! Murderer!

1472
01:16:55,774 --> 01:16:57,799
凶手

1473
01:16:57,326 --> 01:16:58,660
不！辛巴，求求你
No, Simba, please.

1474
01:16:58,660 --> 01:16:59,870
告诉他们真相
Tell them the truth.

1475
01:16:59,912 --> 01:17:03,582
真...相？
Truth? But truth is in the eye of the behold...

1476
01:17:01,547 --> 01:17:04,072
但是每个人对真相的看法都...

1477
01:17:03,624 --> 01:17:05,083
All right.

1478
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:08,337
好...是我干的
All right.

1479
01:17:08,378 --> 01:17:09,963
I did it.

1480
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:12,090
让大家都听得见
So they can hear you.

1481
01:17:12,132 --> 01:17:16,053
我杀了木法沙
I killed Mufasa!

1482
01:17:28,315 --> 01:17:30,067
我打、我踢、我踹 我砍、我砍、我咬
Excuse me. Pardon me. Comin' through.

1483
01:17:30,108 --> 01:17:31,318
Hot stuff. Whoo!

1484
01:18:00,889 --> 01:18:03,350
放我出去，放我出去
- Let me out! Let me out! - Let me in! Let me in!

1485
01:18:02,808 --> 01:18:04,275
让我进去，让我进去

1486
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:07,146
拜托不要吃我
Please, don't eat me.

1487
01:18:07,187 --> 01:18:08,689
放下他们
Drop 'em!

1488
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:10,065
那只猪是谁呀？
Hey, who's the pig?

1489
01:18:10,065 --> 01:18:12,234
你是在叫我吗？
- Are you talkin' to me? - He called him a pig.

1490
01:18:12,276 --> 01:18:13,861
他在叫他猪
- Are you talking to me? - Shouldn't have done that.

1491
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:16,238
你在叫我吗？ 怎么可以叫他猪
- Are you talking to me? - Now they're in for it.

1492
01:18:14,486 --> 01:18:16,579
你在叫我吗？ 你们糗大罗

1493
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:20,909
他们都管我叫猪大爷
They call me... Mister Pig!

1494
01:18:24,163 --> 01:18:26,874
Take that, you stupid...

1495
01:18:26,915 --> 01:18:28,208
Take that, and that!

1496
01:18:32,004 --> 01:18:34,548
Run, you yellow-bellied...

1497
01:18:54,568 --> 01:18:55,819
凶手
Murderer.

1498
01:18:55,861 --> 01:18:57,446
辛巴，辛巴
Simba, please.

1499
01:18:57,488 --> 01:18:59,156
求求你 求求你大发慈悲
Please, have mercy. I beg you.

1500
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:01,450
你根本不配活着
You don't deserve to live.

1501
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:06,914
但...是，辛巴...
But, Simba, I am... family.

1502
01:19:03,735 --> 01:19:07,728
我是...我是你的家人

1503
01:19:06,955 --> 01:19:10,250
那些土狼才是我们真正的敌人
It's the hyenas who are the real enemy.

1504
01:19:10,292 --> 01:19:13,045
都是他们的错 是他们的点子
It was their fault. It was their idea.

1505
01:19:13,086 --> 01:19:15,255
我为什么要相信你？
Why should I believe you?

1506
01:19:15,297 --> 01:19:18,425
你告诉我的每一件事都是谎言
Everything you ever told me was a lie.

1507
01:19:18,467 --> 01:19:20,469
你打算要怎么做呢？
What are you going to do?

1508
01:19:20,469 --> 01:19:24,097
你该不会杀了你的亲叔叔吧？
You wouldn't kill your own uncle.

1509
01:19:24,139 --> 01:19:28,560
不，刀疤
No, Scar. I'm not like you.

1510
01:19:28,602 --> 01:19:31,855
我可不像你
Oh, Simba, thank you. You are truly noble.

1511
01:19:29,862 --> 01:19:32,228
辛巴，谢谢你 太好了

1512
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:33,565
我保证会补偿你的
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

1513
01:19:33,607 --> 01:19:35,734
我该怎么做才能向你证明呢？
And how can I prove myself to you?

1514
01:19:35,776 --> 01:19:37,444
告诉我什么都行
Tell me. Anything.

1515
01:19:37,486 --> 01:19:39,112
好
Run.

1516
01:19:39,154 --> 01:19:44,034
离开这里，刀疤
Run away, Scar, and never return.

1517
01:19:42,274 --> 01:19:45,471
永远不要再回来

1518
01:19:44,076 --> 01:19:46,995
Yes.

1519
01:19:46,995 --> 01:19:49,122
是啊，当然啦
Of course.

1520
01:19:49,164 --> 01:19:54,002
如你所愿
As you wish... Your Majesty!

1521
01:19:52,384 --> 01:19:54,750
国王陛下

1522
01:20:46,388 --> 01:20:50,726
Ohh. My friends.

1523
01:20:48,807 --> 01:20:51,139
我的朋友们

1524
01:20:50,726 --> 01:20:54,313
朋友们？
Friends? I thought he said we were the enemy.

1525
01:20:52,811 --> 01:20:55,041
我好像听他说 我们是他的敌人

1526
01:20:54,354 --> 01:20:57,441
是啊！我也是这么听说的
Yeah. That's what I heard.

1527
01:20:57,483 --> 01:20:58,901
阿德？
- Ed? - Ed?

1528
01:21:03,071 --> 01:21:05,699
不，听着，我可以解释
No, no. Let me explain.

1529
01:21:05,741 --> 01:21:07,534
你们并不了解
No, you don't understand!

1530
01:21:07,576 --> 01:21:10,037
不...我不是故意的
No, I didn't mean... No! No!

1531
01:21:09,528 --> 01:21:12,986
不...听我解释

1532
01:22:16,353 --> 01:22:18,021
是时候了
It is time.

1533
01:22:42,838 --> 01:22:46,258
要记住
Remember.
