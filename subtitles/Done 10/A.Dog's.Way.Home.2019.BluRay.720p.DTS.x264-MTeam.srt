00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,010
刚开始的时候很简单
It's simple at first.

20
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,470
家是你唯一知道的地方
Home is the only place you know.

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,650
那里的每一个人都是你的家人
And everyone there is your family.

22
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,520
我的第一个家充满了猫咪
My first home was full of cats.

23
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,020
而我是一只小狗
And I'm a dog.

24
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,770
猫有很尖的爪子
Cats had sharp claws

25
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,870
当它们开心的时候  还会发出奇怪的声音
and made a funny tummy sound when they were happy.

26
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,780
这些小猫咪有一个猫咪妈妈
The kittens had a mother cat.

27
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,460
我也有一个小狗妈妈
And I had a mother dog.

28
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,220
现在的生活已经完美无瑕
I couldn't imagine that life could get any better.

29
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,810
随着我的成长  我们一起组成了一个家
As I grew, we made a home together.

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,560
我们都很快乐
We were happy

31
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,860
但这仅仅只持续了一小段时间
for a while.

32
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,240
哇  看看  有这么多呢
Oh, wow. Look at all of 'em.

33
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,550
你可没告诉我  这有这么多
You didn't tell me there were so many.

34
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,580
快去抓住它们
Just grab 'em!

35
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,350
嘿  我找到一个  我这里抓到了一个
Hey! Found one. I got one over here.

36
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,450
天  它们跑的真快
Geez, they're fast.

37
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,120
我抓到一个
I got one.

38
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,010
这里  看这里  快来这边
Over there. Over there. Come here.

39
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,420
嘿  看  这里也有小狗
Hey, hey. There's dogs here, too.

40
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,500
哥哥
Brother!

41
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,150
这边还有好多
A whole bunch of 'em back here.

42
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,210
- 又抓到一个  - 姐姐
- Got another one. - Sister!

43
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,040
抓到了
Got it.

44
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,920
这有个成年期的斗牛犬
There's a full-grown pit bull.

45
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,010
来我这
Here we go.

46
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,740
放松
Easy.

47
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,120
成功了
Got her.

48
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,780
妈妈
Mother!

49
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,250
我要出去了  让开
I'm going out. Come on.

50
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,380
拿个大点的笼子
Get a bigger crate.

51
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,880
出来了
Coming out.

52
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,800
妈妈
Mother?

53
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,470
我再也没见过她
I never saw her again.

54
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,760
我不知道我会怎么样  如果没有猫咪妈妈的话
I don't know what would have happened to me without mother cat.

55
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,440
日子一天天过去了
And day by day,

56
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,560
渐渐的
little by little,

57
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,690
猫咪妈妈也成了我的妈妈
mother cat became my mother.

58
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,240
- 嘿  - 你好
- Hey. - Hey.

59
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,750
就在这
It's just here.

60
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,670
好吧  我们早下班只是为了能够
Okay. We left work early so we could be basically,

61
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,550
做这个吗  搞破坏  随便乱闯
what, breaking and entering?

62
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,220
这不是搞破坏或随便乱闯  奥莉薇亚
It's not breaking and entering, Olivia.

63
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,340
这是非法入侵  两者是有区别的
It's criminal trespass. There's a difference.

64
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,420
对对对  也就是做2年牢  而不是6年  知道了
Okay, so, like, two years in prison instead of six. Got it.

65
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,290
- 我还好  可不想坐牢  - 不管怎样  跟上来吧
- I'm good, I'm good.  - Anyway, come on.

66
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,480
你可不能说  救小猫的男人不够迷人
Can't say that a guy rescuing kittens isn't hot.

67
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,350
噢  我可没这么说  我只是说你不够迷人
Oh, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying you're not hot.

68
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,190
那多谢了  看这
Oh, thanks. Here.

69
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,520
- 快来  它们就在这下面  相信我  - 真的吗
- Come on. They're under here. Okay.  - Seriously?

70
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,400
卢卡斯  我可不要进这破洞
Lucas, I'm not going in that hole.

71
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,140
快来吧  你可是拯救动物志愿者
Well, you're the animal rescue volunteer.

72
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,550
- 好吧  - 你可以不用爬进去
- Okay.  - You don't have to crawl in.

73
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,860
就看一眼
Just take a look.

74
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,530
- 哇哦  有好多只  - 对吧
- Wow. There's so many of 'em.  - Yeah.

75
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,370
很明显  动物管理来过了
Apparently, animal control came,

76
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,160
但没把它们所有都带走
but they didn't get 'em all.

77
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,500
现在  建筑工说要把这一整片全拆了
And now, the builder says he's gonna tear down the whole block,

78
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,960
不管有没有猫在
cats or no cats.

79
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,790
之前那些人掳走了我的家人  但这个叫卢卡斯的人不一样
Men took my dog family, but this man named Lucas was different.

80
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,130
他每天都来
He came every day

81
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,260
猫咪们也都信任他
And the cats trusted him.

82
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
走吧
Come on.

83
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,140
在我开始思考之前  我的脚已经开始动了
And before I could even think, my paws were moving.

84
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,860
等等我
Wait!

85
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,600
卢卡斯  快看  一只小狗
Lucas! Look, a puppy!

86
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,810
天呐
Oh, my god.

87
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,740
嘿  你跑来这干什么  小狗狗
Hey. What are you doing here, baby... girl?

88
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,410
你好啊
Hey.

89
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,410
他舔起来也很舒服
And he tasted good, too.

90
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,870
她好可爱啊
She is really cute.

91
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,460
给你找个家应该不会很难
it will not be hard finding you a home.

92
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,460
额  等等
Well, wait.

93
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,150
要我说  你看见她是直接跑向我的
I mean, you saw how she ran right to me.

94
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,780
也许  她应该跟着我
Maybe that's a sign that her home's supposed to be with me.

95
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,640
卢卡斯  你不能照顾小狗狗的  你知道的
Lucas, you cannot take care of a dog, okay?

96
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,090
你上学的时候或者去当志愿者的时候  怎么办
What do you do when you go to school or the va?

97
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,220
听着  我和我妈妈住在一起
Listen, I actually live with my mom.

98
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,440
听起来有点怪  她是一名退伍军人
It's not how it sounds. It... she's a veteran.

99
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,520
你在退伍军人事务所也许见过她
You might have seen her at the va.

100
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,150
- 特里 雷 认识吗  - 知道
- Terri Ray?  - Yeah.

101
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,400
嗯  她现在还没找到个长久的工作
Well, she isn't able to hold down a job just yet,

102
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,360
所以  当我不在家的时候  她会在家
so, she's at home even when I'm not.

103
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,040
我想  养个小狗狗对她来说也会是件好事
Listen, maybe a puppy would be good for her, too.

104
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,540
没有任何事情能够像被他抱住一样感觉这么好
Nothing had ever felt as good as being held by him.

105
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,540
她确实看起来很喜欢你
She does really seem to like you a lot.

106
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,620
你看上他哪一点了  狗狗
What do you see in him that I don't, puppy?

107
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,970
听着  你们两个  滚开这里
Hey, you! Get out of there!

108
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,160
快走  快跑  别停下
Go, go, go. Go, go. Keep going.

109
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,670
这里可是私人财产
Private property!

110
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,410
- 一会儿见你  好吗  - 好的
- I'll see you later, okay?  - All right.

111
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,800
- 一会儿见  拜拜  - 记得给我打电话
- See you. Bye. - Call me.

112
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,940
- 你好  妈妈  - 你好
- Hi, mom.  - Hi.

113
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,530
我打算就叫她贝拉了
I think I'm gonna call her Bella.

114
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,530
宝贝  你知道我们不能养小狗的
Honey, you know we can't have a puppy.

115
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,040
租约上写着  不允许养宠物
Our lease says no pets.

116
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,740
人们说养狗对抑郁症有帮助
They say a dog is good for depression.

117
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,210
- 谁说的  - 我确定某个人说过的
- Who says that?  - Oh, I'm pretty sure somebody says that.

118
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,780
这就是那种我觉得是坏点子
Is this gonna be one of those things

119
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,920
但你仍然会去做的事情吗
I say is a terrible idea and you do it, anyway?

120
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,720
对啊  再说了 你觉得我从谁身上学的
Yeah. And who do you suppose I learned that from?

121
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,850
卢卡斯和我玩着最有意思的游戏
Lucas and I played the best games.

122
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,980
贝拉  抓住那个球
Bella, get the ball.

123
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,560
我们一起玩  抓球游戏
We played get the ball.

124
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,950
停下吧
Stop.

125
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,320
我们还一起玩  停下游戏
We played stop.

126
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,070
停下  贝拉  我还要学习呢
Stop, Bella. I have to study.

127
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,710
来这
Here.

128
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,750
给你玩我的毯子吧
Have my blanket.

129
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,540
毯子闻起来很好  味道就像卢卡斯
It smelled amazing. Just like Lucas.

130
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,670
我们还一起玩  不咬鞋子游戏
We played don't chew shoes.

131
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,930
贝拉  别咬鞋子
Bella. Don't chew shoes.

132
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,110
还有我最喜欢的游戏
And there was my favorite game of all.

133
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,910
怎么了  你想要什么
What? What do you want?

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,830
我还需要
I'm trying to...

135
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,840
你想要一小片芝士吗
Do you want a tiny piece of cheese?

136
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,670
小小的一片芝士
Tiny piece of cheese filled me

137
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,670
- 充满了大大的一片爱意  - 给你
- with such a strong feeling.  - There you go.

138
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,500
一瞬间  我感受到了  安全  开心  还有温暖
Like I was safe and happy and warm, all at once.

139
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,090
这就是  爱
It was love.

140
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,600
我要走了  来不及了  快走
I've got to go, got to go, got to go, got to go!

141
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,390
要迟到了
I'm so late.

142
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,570
要去工作了  再见  贝拉
Gotta go to work. Bye, Bella.

143
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,940
我最不喜欢的游戏就是  要去工作游戏
The one game I didn't like was go to work.

144
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,070
做个好孩子
Be good.

145
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,020
卢卡斯的毯子让我有了归属感
My Lucas blanket kept me company,

146
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,660
但这种归属感和真正的卢卡斯给的不一样
But it wasn't as same as the real Lucas

147
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,120
- 我还惦记着我的猫咪家庭  - 慢点
- I still had my cat family.  - Slow down there.

148
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,860
卢卡斯也变成了这个家庭的一份子
And Lucas became part of that family, too.

149
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,130
不  这个不是给你的 贝拉 这是留给猫咪们的  来这里
No, this is not for you, Bella. This is for the cats. Come here.

150
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,370
看见他们了吗
See 'em?

151
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,300
猫咪妈妈
Mother cat!

152
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,590
我喜欢猫咪妈妈  我也喜欢当贝拉
I love mother cat, and I love being Bella.

153
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,970
走吧  要回家了
Come on. We're going home.

154
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,270
希望一切都好  猫咪们
As you were, cats.

155
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,580
明天见
See you tomorrow.

156
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,770
好了  该睡觉了  贝拉  别闹了
All right. Bedtime, Bella. Come on.

157
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,690
每天结束的时候  我们会玩
And at the end of every day, we played...

158
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,810
坐  你准备好迎来
Sit. You ready for your

159
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,570
- 你的一小片芝士了吗  - 小片芝士游戏
- tiny piece of cheese?  - Tiny piece of cheese.

160
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,540
好了  去躺着毯子上吧  快去
All right. On your blanket. Come on.

161
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,670
晚安  贝拉
Night, Bella.

162
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,750
卢卡斯就是我的人  我就是他的狗狗
Lucas was my person, and I was his dog.

163
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,840
我有一个家了
I was home.

164
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,720
当卢卡斯要玩  去工作游戏  的时候
Whenever Lucas was playing go to work...

165
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,930
听话的狗狗
Good girl.

166
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,350
我会带着妈妈出去散步
I would take mom for a walk.

167
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,930
- 怎么了  小可爱  - 又是那个松鼠
- What is it, honey?  - It's that squirrel again!

168
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,520
我一定要抓住那个松鼠
I have to have that squirrel.

169
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,350
它就要跑掉了
It's getting away!

170
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,360
- 贝拉  听话  贝拉  - 它就在眼前了
- Bella. No, Bella. - Oh, it's right there!

171
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,590
走了  小家伙  别追逐松鼠了
Come on, girl. No squirrel chasing.

172
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,070
走了  贝拉  快跟我走  小家伙
Come on, Bella. Come on, girl.

173
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,370
我喜欢妈妈  但是她就是不知道
I loved mom, but she just didn't understand

174
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,940
- 怎么去追捕松鼠  - 听话点
- how to hunt squirrels. - Good.

175
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,860
挺好的小狗
Nice dog.

176
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,000
抱歉  不是故意吓到你的
Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you.

177
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,080
我叫冈特  贝肯鲍尔
I'm Gunter Beckenbauer.

178
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,880
那边就是我的房子
Those are my houses there.

179
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,420
你想要什么   贝肯鲍尔先生
What do you want, Mr. Beckenbauer?

180
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,750
叫我冈特就好
Oh, please, call me "Gunter."

181
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,670
我认的出这个味道
I knew that smell.

182
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,960
- 我知道这个味道不好  - 听我说
- And I knew this wasn't good.  - Look.

183
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,670
我知道你的儿子一直在给
I know it's your son who's been calling

184
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,580
城市建筑管理局打电话  说关于那些烦人的猫咪
the county building authority about the stupid cats,

185
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
我早摆脱那些猫了
which I got rid of.

186
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,930
我已经错过了整个暑期去施工了
I've lost the whole summer now,

187
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,780
所以  能不能让你儿子别来烦我了
so, could you please just ask him to back off?

188
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,020
我儿子不会让步的  贝肯鲍尔先生
My son isn't gonna back off, Mr. Beckenbauer,

189
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,230
因为还有猫住在那里的
because there are still cats living there.

190
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,730
动物管理局说那里没有
Animal control says there's not.

191
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,060
动物管理局在说谎  你也一样
Animal control is lying, and so are you.

192
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,480
那是条什么狗  斗牛犬吗
What kind of dog is that? Pit bull?

193
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,440
我们还不知道
We don't know.

194
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,500
我们发现它和那些  你说不存在的猫咪们  一起生活着
We found her living with the cats you say aren't there.

195
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,290
我想说的是  女士
What I'm trying to say, lady,

196
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,300
你和你的儿子不会想和我就此而开战的
is that you and your boy do not want to go to war with me.

197
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,260
你说开战  你知道什么是战争吗
War? What do you know about war?

198
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,550
好吧
Okay.

199
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,450
但是记住  我尝试过
But let the record show that I tried

200
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,970
想友好的解决这件事  但是你逼我的
to settle this friendly, and you're the one pushing it.

201
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:36,180
不  我记住的是  你来到这里  说要和我开战
No, the record shows that you came here and said we were going to war.

202
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,400
走了  贝拉  放松
Come on, Bella, relax.

203
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:45,110
放松  我们去把你的问题解决了
Relax. Let's go do your business.

这是什么东东  冰凉的  湿湿的

冰淇淋从天上掉下来了
Ice cream is falling from the sky!

207
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,450
这是雪

它就贴在门上
It was taped to the door.

噢天
Oh, no.

233
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,910
是房东
It's the landlord.

234
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,990
他明天来检查水龙头
He's coming tomorrow to check the faucet.

235
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,660
但是我要去接受治疗  你也要去上班
But I have therapy and you have to work.

236
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,990
贝拉怎么办
What will we do with Bella?

237
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,950
房东来的时候  不能让她在家
She can't be in the house when he's here.

238
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,670
按计划行动

239
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,790

If they see her, you're gonna get fired.

240
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,920

243
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,130
贝拉  待在这儿
Bella. Okay, stay here. Stay.

244
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,170
我不喜欢待着
I didn't like stay.

245
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,710
不准叫  明白吗
No barks. Understand?

246
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,950
我一会儿再来看你
I'll come check on you in a little while.

247
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,160
贝拉  你不能被抓住的  好吗
You can't get caught, okay, Bella?

248
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,050
等等  你要去哪儿
Wait, hold on. Where are you going?

249
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,970
别叫哦
No barks.

250
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,400
我真是搞不懂这个游戏
I definitely do not get this game.

251
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,230
卢卡斯呢
Lucas?

252
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,620
疗程显示这对他没什么效果
PT reports he's not responding,

253
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,000
还是建议每天去两次
and recommends going to twice a day.

254
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,370
好的  我们可以试试  如果我们
Okay, well, we can try, but if he...

255
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,540
甘恩医生  抱歉失陪一下
Dr.Gann. Would you excuse me?

256
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,770
瓦莱丽  我去去就回
Hey, Valerie, I'll be right back. Yeah.

257
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,890
我的叫声起作用了
Yes, I was barking, but it worked.

258
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,980
- 你来啦  - 不
- Here you are.  - No.

259
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,560
把他叫过来  就是这个游戏吗
Is that the game?

260
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,400
是贝拉吗
Bella?

261
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,770
- 天呐  她都长这么大了  - 奥莉薇亚
- Oh, my gosh, she's gotten so big.  - Olivia

262
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,900
你知道有谁可以帮我照顾她吗
Hi. Do you know anybody here who could watch her,

263
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,510
我一个小时以后才有空
just for an hour or so, until my break?

264
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,400
只需要一个小时
Just an hour.

265
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,950
行吧  但是你从来没跟我提过
Okay, fine, but you know you only ever talk to me

266
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,700
你养动物出了点问题  对吗
when you have animal issues, right?

267
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,710
能打扰你们下吗
Am I interrupting something?

268
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,960
现在  这只狗不能违规待在这里
Now, this could not possibly be a dog in the va against all the regs.

269
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:35,890
我知道  特欧
I know, Teo.

270
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,260
但是今天没办法把贝拉单独留在家
We can't leave Bella home today.

271
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,020
如果房东发现我们养了条狗
If the landlord catches us with a dog,

272
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,730
我们会被赶出来的
we could get evicted.

273
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,010
好吧  我懂了
Now, I understand.

274
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,090
这个游戏就是大家挤在一个小房间里
The game is crowd in a small room.

275
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,640
贝拉  对吧
Bella, huh?

276
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,640
你知道吗
You know what?

277
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,720
我想到办法了
I've got this.

278
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,690
各位  都在吗
Everybody? Everybody?

279
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,700
今天的疗程  我带来了一位特别的嘉宾
Thought I'd bring a special guest to today's meeting.

280
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,570
希望你们见见这个可爱的狗狗贝拉
I'd like you to meet the lovely Bella.

281
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,340
- 嗨  贝拉  - 很好  非常好
- Hi, Bella.   - Great. That's great.

282
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,350
- 看看她  - 你戒酒多久了
- Look at that. - How long you been sober?

283
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,860
很久了吧
That long, huh?

284
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,240
老兄  这是个好主意
It was a good idea, man.

285
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,460
谢谢
Yeah. Thanks.

286
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,020
这偶尔会发生一次
It'll only happen once in a while. Yeah.

287
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,460
从那之后  我喜欢上了  去工作游戏
After that, I really liked go to work.

288
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,700
- 看起来她很喜欢呆在这儿  - 我也觉得
- Looks like she likes being here.  - I think she does, too.

289
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,210
我只是没动力
I just have no motivation.

290
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,430
就像  我知道这对我很好  但是
Like, I know it would be good for me, but...

291
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,430
我都快觉得妈妈的悲伤要烟消云散了
I could always feel mom's sadness going away

292
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,100
每当我安慰妈妈的时候
when I comforted her.

293
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,650
就像猫咪妈妈也会想起我一样
Like mother cat comforted me

294
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,720
迈克  你最近怎么样
Mack, what's it been like with you?

295
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,020
这  就像是
It's, uh... it's like...

296
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,900
就像是  一直都很痛苦
It's, like, pain all the time.

297
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,590
- 但妈妈不是唯一一个  - 每天早上
- But she wasn't the only one  - Every morning.

298
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,900
需要我安慰的人
Who needed me.

299
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,570
迈克是最难过的人
Mack was the most sad.

300
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,210
都是实话  发自肺腑的话
That's real. That's real talk.

301
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,120
- 你知道吗
- You know?

302
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,840
我想明天早上会再带她来
I'm gonna bring her again tomorrow.

303
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,540
看看谁来了
Look who's here!

304
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,750
现在  我有了很多新朋友

305
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,260
- 快来  贝拉  - 看这个

306
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,230
德鲁用他的小轮椅带我兜风
Drew took me on rides in his small car.

307
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,430
贝拉  张嘴
Bella, open.

308
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,560
史蒂夫用勺子喂我的东西超美味
Steve had really delicious spoons.

309
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,110
我的一些朋友们还有狗牌  和我一样
Some of my friends had tags, just like me.

310
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,490
好孩子
Aw, good girl.

311
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,240
贝拉
Bella

312
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,410
贝拉  趴着
Bella, get down.

313
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,330
我们去洗衣服  趴着
We're doing laundry. Down.

314
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,910
我很喜欢玩  洗衣服游戏
I really liked doing laundry.

315

00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,410
有什么问题吗
Everything all right?

330

拜拜  医生
Bye, doc.

331
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,260
好孩子  多听话的孩子
Good girl. What a good girl.

332
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,470
让我们再来玩一次吧
Let's do that again!

333
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,270
- 太聪明了  - 好孩子

334
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,520
我觉得昨晚上很有意思
I had fun last night.

335
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,320
对啊
Me, too.

336
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,940
现在  卢卡斯和我随时都在找那只松鼠
Now, whenever Lucas and I went looking for that squirrel,

337
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,630
- 奥莉薇亚也一起来了  - 下次  行吗
- Olivia came, too.  - Next time, all right?

338
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,580
所以  还有下次吗  知道了
So, there's gonna be a next time? Got it.

339
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,570
对的  就这样
All right, let's go.

340
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,960
- 帮忙牵着贝拉  - 好
Take Bella? Yeah.

341
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,940
- 我打电话叫人  - 好

342
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,000
嘿
Hey!

343
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,830
等下  停下
Wait! Stop!

344
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,030
你们在干什么
What the hell you doing?

345
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,210
这还住着很多猫  你们不能这样做
There are still cats living there. You can't do this.

346
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,040
- 我们有许可证  - 这不重要
- We've got a permit.  - That doesn't matter.

347
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,640
- 你逗我吗  - 嘿
-You kidding me?  - Hey!

348
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,310
- 我受够你了  你疯了吧  - 他们在路上了
- I have had enough of you, you crazy...  - They're on it.

349
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,020
过来我们谈谈
Can I talk to you for a minute?

350
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,570
你为什么要来搅和我的事
Why you screwing with my life?

351
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,110
你怎么拿到的许可证
How did you even get a permit?

352
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,110
私人财产认证  不包括猫
Property's certified. No cats.

353
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,570
- 喂  - 我在直播  摧猫辣手
Hey. - I'm live-streaming, cat killer.

354
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,990
这里没猫
There are no cats!

355
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,660
猫咪妈妈
Mother cat!

356
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,420
你们去哪儿
Where are you going?

357
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,590
没猫吗
No cats?

358
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,460
我工作的救援组织刚刚打电话给
The rescue organization that I work with just called the building

359
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,050
建筑委员会  要求吊销你的许可证
commission to have your permit yanked.

360
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,290
真希望他们能在拆完之前赶来
Like they move that fast.

361
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,300
我们一个董事会成员打过电话了  他们马上就来
They do when our board member calls.

362
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,600
她是城市委委员
She's a county commissioner.

363
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,890
冈特
Hey, Gunter.

364
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,890
啥事
yeah.

365
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,180
是关于你许可证的事情
It's about your permit.

366
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,060
那到底是谁在敲门
Who on earth could that be?

367
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,980
不知道  我去开门
I don't know. I'll get it.

368
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,490
抱歉打扰
Excuse me.

369
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:07,990
有人投诉你
There's been a complaint that

370
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,410
藏匿了一只危险动物
you may be harboring a dangerous animal.

371
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,320
投诉吗  是谁
A complaint? From who?

372
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,910
我想你知道  在丹佛养斗牛犬是违法的
As you may know, pit bulls are illegal in the city of Denver.

373
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,950
只要它在你家里面  我们是不会动它的
As long as it's on your property, we can't touch it.

374
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,000
- 我记得他  - 我现在告诉你
- I remember him.  - I am informing you

375
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,000
但如果你的狗在大街上被逮住
that if that dog gets picked up on the street,

376
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,180
它会被收押
it will be impounded.

377
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,210
晚安
Have a nice night.

378
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,770
好吧  贝拉  这很重要
Okay, Bella, this is very important.

379
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,100
我们要再试一次
We're gonna try this again.

380
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,350
行  准备好了吗
Okay. You ready?

381
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,020
现在  跑回家
And...go home

382
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,870
贝拉  就是这样  跑回去
That's it, Bella. Go home.

383
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,950
最棒的游戏
Best game ever!

384
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,340
回家游戏就是说  我要把我的头放在这里
Doing go home meant I should put my head right here.

385
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,590
太棒了  你成功了
Yes! You did it!

386
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,640
你回家了  非常棒
You did go home. Well done.

387
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,930
- 真难忘  -  贝拉  做得好
- That was impressive.- Good job, Bella.

388
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,730
好姑娘
Good girl. Wow.

389
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,510
所以  现在  一旦我们带离开贝拉了房子
So, now, if we take Bella off the property

390
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:24,480
管理动物的人想带走它  我们只需要说  回家
and animal control tries to take her, we just say, "go home."

391
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,810
我喜欢让卢卡斯高兴
I loved making Lucas happy.

392
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,660
是那只松鼠
That squirrel!

393
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,160
我必须捉住那只松鼠
I had to have that squirrel.

394
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,170
松鼠  松鼠  站住
Squirrel, squirrel, squirrel!

395
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,090
贝拉呢
Bella?

396
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,300
贝拉
Bella!

397
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,560
贝拉
Bella!

398
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,110
贝拉
Bella!

399
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,530
贝拉  我一直在到处找你
Bella, I've been looking all over for you.

400
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,410
坏狗狗
Bad dog.

401
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,410
贝拉  你不可以  再这样了
Bella, you can never, ever do that again.

402
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,960
我不在乎窗户怎么样了  但是你不能再乱跑了
I don't care about the window, but you cannot run away.

403
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,420
在那儿牵住它  伙计
Hold it right there, pal.

404
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,840
我要收押这只狗
I'm impounding that animal.

405
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:37,300
- 不  你不可以  - 我可以这么做  那是我帮手
No, you are not. Yes, I am, and that's my backup.

406
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,260
这是斗牛犬  而且这是法定扣押
This is a pit bull. And this is a legal impoundment.

407
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,470
如果它要跑  你逮着它
If he resists, you arrest him.

408
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,230
回家  贝拉
Go home, Bella.

409
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,680
贝拉  回家
Bella, go home.

410
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,440
- 贝拉  回家  - 但你需要我
- Go home, Bella.  - But you need me.

411
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,610
贝拉
Bella

412
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,190
贝拉  快  回家
Bella, please, go home.

413
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,900
贝拉  求你了  回家  贝拉
Bella, please. Go home, Bella.

414
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,030
没事
That's right.

415
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,160
- 这样很容易  - 贝拉  回家
- Easy does it. - Bella, go home.

416
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,610
放松  抓到了
Easy. There we go.

417
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,410
别这样做
Don't do that.

418
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,820
- 先生  - 够了
-  sir. - come on.

419
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,710
先生  松手  马上
Sir, let go, now.

420
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,750
你需要松手让他带走这只狗
You need to let him have the dog.

421
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,210
不能让她这样被绑着
Not with that on her.

422
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,760
放开
Let go.

423
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,340
查克  让他来
Chuck, let him do it.

424
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,690
没事的  贝拉
It's okay, Bella.

425
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,810
没事的 没事的 我陪着你呢
It's okay. It's okay. I got you.

426
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,900
跟着我
Follow me.

427
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,490
没事的  我抱着你  宝贝  没事的
It's okay. I got you, baby. It's okay.

428
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,200
没事的
It's okay.

429
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:42,580
贝拉  我搞砸了
Bella, I screwed up.

430
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,030
真的很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

431
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,230
- 好了好了  - 突然之间
- All right.  - All of a sudden,

432
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,610
- 我闻到很多其他狗的气味  - 好了好了  没事了
- I smelled so many other dogs. - You're okay. It's all right.

433
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,560
我会来接你的  贝拉  明白吗
I will come get you, Bella. Understand?

434
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,560
很抱歉我没有回家  卢卡斯
I'm sorry I didn't do go home, Lucas.

435
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,170
- 我不会让他们伤害你的  - 好了  可以了
- I will not let them hurt you. - Okay, that's enough.

436
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,690
请离开车辆
Step away, please.

437
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,070
请你走开
Step away.

438
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,820
别走
Please.

439
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,670
卢卡斯
Lucas?

440
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,980
这里面好吵  所有狗都好伤心
It was so loud, and all the dogs were so sad.

441
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,860
到了
Okay.

442
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,530
进去吧
In you go.

443
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,530
我想  如果我做一只很乖的狗  他们会让我回到卢卡斯身边
I thought if I did good dog, they'd let me go back to Lucas.

444
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,160
我坐下了
I did sit.

445
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,700
我坐了很久
I did sit some more.

446
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,580
我没有叫
I did no barks.

447
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,550
我叫了很多次
I did lots of barks.

448
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,300
我真的需要卢卡斯的毯子
I really needed my Lucas blanket.

449
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,640
我那个时候应该跑回家的
I should have done go home.

450
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,730
出来吧
Come on.

451
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,700
你好啊
Hello.

452
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,530
等等
Hang on.

453
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,620
我看你不像是
Aw, you don't seem like

454
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,490
一只危险的动物呀  可爱的姑娘
such a dangerous animal to me, sweet girl, hmm?

455
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,120
来吧  来吧
Come on. Come on.

456
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,880
- 嘿  - 卢卡斯
- Hey! - Lucas

457
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,250
- 嘿  嘿  - 我准备好玩跑回家游戏了
- Hi. Hi. - I'm ready to do go home.

458
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,750
嘿  看  我来啦
Hey. See, I'm here.

459
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,410
- 我来啦  - 不用问了
- I'm here. - Well, there's question one.

460
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,890
这显然是你的狗
She's obviously your dog.

461
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,590
好孩子  我知道  我知道  好孩子
Good girl. I know. I know. Good girl.

462
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,720
好啦  可以啦
All right. There you go.

463
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,800
你已经交了罚款
So, you've paid the fine.

464
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,510
我只需要给你释放材料就好了
I just need to give you the discharge information.

465
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,980
在丹佛  一条狗被定义为斗牛犬的条件是
In Denver, all that's required for a dog to be classified as a pit bull

466
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:21,310
让三名动物管理局的人员认证她
is for three animal control officers to certify that it is.

467
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,440
贝拉已经被认证为斗牛犬了
And Bella has been certified pit bull.

468
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,450
被认证为斗牛犬意味着什么呢
What does "certified pit" mean?

469
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,870
这意味着如果她再被抓到  她就会被安乐死
It means if they pick her up again, she'll be euthanized.

470
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,540
- 什么  - 这就是法律
-What?  - That's the law.

471
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,490
斗牛犬是一个很宽泛的描述  就像猎犬一样
Pit bull's a pretty loose description. It's like saying "hound dog."

472
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,590
因此  市议会最终投票决定
So, the city council essentially voted that

473
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,210
可以因为一条狗的长相而将其在全市禁止
a dog can be banned from the city because of how it looks.

474
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,130
这算是狗类的种族歧视
That's basically racism for dogs.

475
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,590
是的  这太蠢了
I know. It's stupid.

476
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,550
贝拉是世界上最温顺的狗
I mean, Bella is the most gentle dog in the world.

477
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,720
你应该看看她在医院与退伍军人的相处
You should see her at the hospital with the veterans.

478
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,310
他们很喜欢她
I mean, they love her.

479
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,060
如果我们搬家怎么样
What about if we move?

480
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,510
比如说搬到戈尔登或者城市以外的地方
Like, Golden or somewhere out of the city limits?

481
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,640
这样是可以的
That works.

482
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,460
或者  可有找其他人照顾她吗
Meanwhile, do you have someone who can look after her?

483
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,320
我叔叔一家人住在法明顿
My aunt and uncle, they live in Farmington.

484
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,000
- 或许他们能帮助我们  - 法明顿在新墨西哥州吧
- Maybe they could help us. - New Mexico?

485
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,150
好像有400英里远吧
It's like 400 miles.

486
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:09,280
我真的准备好回家了
I'm really ready to do go home now.

487
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:15,460
好啦  开始收拾吧  找到你的恐龙了
All right, here we go. Got your dinosaur.

488
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,250
还有什么呢
What else do we have?

489
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,930
你能这么做真的太好了
It's so good of you to do this.

490
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,250
我们很乐意帮忙
We're just happy to help.

491
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,180
奥莉薇亚真是个甜心
Olivia's such a sweetheart.

492
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,510
好吧  差不多了
Well, this is it.

493
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,050
我先去车里
I'll be in the car.

494
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,100
为什么每个人都这么悲伤呢
Why is everyone so sad?

495
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,100
我们都已经在家了
We're all home, now.

496
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,520
贝拉  真的很抱歉
Bella, I'm so sorry.

497
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,570
再见了
See you soon.

498
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,990
好了  我从后窗偷偷出去
Okay, I'll sneak out the back window.

499
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,570
至少没有帘子在挡着了
At least there's no screen on that one.

500
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,210
不要怕  我来给你系上
Here, I got ya, I got ya.

501
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,840
你好啊
Hello.

502
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,470
住手
Stop.

503
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,680
你的帮手不可能这么快就来帮你吧
Backup can't possibly get here fast enough to help you.

504
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,140
我们明白你在这里玩的小把戏
We understand the little game that you're playing here.

505
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,650
是冈特  对吧
It's Gunter, isn't it?

506
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,100
你在帮他做事吗
You work for him?

507
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,110
也许你们只是朋友
Maybe you're just buddies.

508
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,190
现在  你要让我儿子
Now, you're gonna let my son

509
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,360
走到那辆车前和他的狗狗说再见
walk to that car to say goodbye to his dog

510
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,740
但是你不能进行干涉
without any interference from you.

511
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,820
明白吗
Copy?

512
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,200
明白
Copy.

513
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,380
上车吧  贝拉  就是这样
Go on, Bella. That's it.

514
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,890
你真是个乖狗狗  贝拉
You're such a good girl, Bella.

515
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,590
我知道你理解不了  但是我不是在抛弃你
I know you won't understand, but I'm not abandoning you.

516
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,720
我只是不得不把你送到安全的地方
I just have to send you somewhere safe.

517
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,520
我们要去哪里
Where are we going?

518
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,390
为什么我不能和你一起坐在前面
Why can't I ride in the front with you?

519
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,440
给你
Here.

520
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,990
你得带着你的毯子
You got to have your blanket.

521
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,490
他为什么给了我卢卡斯的毯子
Why did he bring my Lucas blanket?

522
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,990
毯子应该在床上才对
It should be on my bed.

523
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,570
我保证  用不了太久  你就可以回家了
I promise, very soon, you'll get to go home.

524
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:30,880
卢卡斯说  回家吧  但是他关上门
Lucas said, "go home," but then he shut the door.

525
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,190
我需要卢卡斯
I need Lucas!

526
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,440
求你了 别走
Please! No!

527
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,420
他的气味正在消失
His scent was fading.

528
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,430
我离他越来越远了
I was getting farther and farther away.

529
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,770
我闻着卢卡斯毯子的味道  不是那么难过了
I smelled my Lucas blanket to feel better,

530
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,650
但是它不是卢卡斯
but it wasn't Lucas.

531
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,430
坐下
Sit.

532
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,010
贝拉  来这边
Bella, come here.

533
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,390
对
Yes.

534
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,560
你真乖  很好  真乖
Oh, you're so pretty. Yes, you are.

535
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,420
这些人很好
These people were nice.

536
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:16,160
他们照顾我  但他们不是我的家人
They took care of me, but they weren't my family.

537
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,530
这里不是我的家
This wasn't home.

538
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,110
喂
Hello?

539
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,620
一切都好吗
How is everything?

540
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,270
放心  她很好
Oh, she's fine. Yeah.

541
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,770
真的吗  可以啊
Really? Okay.

542
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:31,630
那好  明天见
All right. See you tomorrow, then.

543
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,800
你猜怎么着
Guess what?

544
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,180
他们在戈尔登找到了一个好地方
They found a nice place in Golden,

545
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:42,230
他们明天来接你
and they're coming to get you tomorrow.

546
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,600
我打赌你已经准备好回家了  贝拉  你是条好狗
I bet you're ready to go home. You're a good dog, Bella.

547
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,350
乔斯说  回家吧
José said, "go home."

548
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,590
- 你是一只好狗  - 但是怎么回去呢
- You're a good dog. - But how?

549
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,730
晚安
Good night.

550
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,070
那种感觉又来了
That feeling came again.

551
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,940
我本来应该和卢卡斯在一起的
I was supposed to be with Lucas.

552
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,870
我得想办法找到他
I had to find a way to get to him.

553
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,180
我不知道那很吵的东西是什么
I didn't know what that loud thing was,

554
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,630
但乔斯确实喜欢带着它在院子里散步
but José sure liked to take it for walks around the yard.

555
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,560
但我记得之前下雪的时候我见过这个
But I do remember that from snow do your business.

556
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,320
等等
Wait.

557
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,340
有了
Yes!

558
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,050
我下定决心了
I'm doing it!

559
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,800
我要玩回家游戏
I'm doing go home!

560
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:48,220
看起来回家的路真的很远
I could tell that go home was very far away.

561
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,320
但我知道我走的方向是对的
But I knew that I was going in the right direction.

562
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,790
现在的感觉像是一根无形的绳子  我被牵着
The feeling now was a pull, like I was on a leash

563
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,460
然后告诉我回家的路
and being told how to do go home.

564
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:19,340
如果我一直走下去  我坚信我会再见到卢卡斯
And if I kept going, I knew I would see Lucas again.

565
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,900
到了第一天晚上  我已经很累了
By that first night, I was so tired.

566
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,480
而且周围有很多奇怪的气味
And there were so many strange smells.

567
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,210
那是什么
What's that?

568
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:58,580
它长得像猫  但闻起来像一条狗
It looks like a cat, but it smells like a dog.

569
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,930
希望它不会回来了
I hope it doesn't come back.

570
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,820
早餐时间到了
It was breakfast time,

571
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,060
但是我到处都找不到吃的东西
but I couldn't find a bowl of food anywhere.

572
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,700
它没放在碗里
It's not in a bowl,

573
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,940
但我就吃它了
but I'll take it.

574
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,860
这顿早餐跑的真快呀
This breakfast is really fast!

575
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,830
我想吃早餐
I need breakfast!

576
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,470
这顿早餐比那只松鼠还难抓
This breakfast was harder to hunt than that squirrel.

577
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,810
我从来都没有这么饿过
I was hungrier than I'd ever been.

578
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,440
有人
People.

579
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,610
下面有人
There are people down there.

580
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,620
杜兰戈  科罗拉多州

581
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,420
一群狗狗
A pack.

582
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,680
或许我不该打扰他们
Maybe I shouldn't bother them.

583
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,170
但我太饿了
But I'm so hungry.

584
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,300
独牙仔的牙好大呀
One Tooth is big.

585
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,310
出于礼貌  我还是仔细嗅一下  看看他们有没有留下记号  占了这地方
To be polite, I'll carefully sniff where the other dogs have marked.

586
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,250
什么
What?

587
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,910
管事的竟然是疯发犬
Oh, crazy hair is in charge.

588
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,040
谢谢
Thanks.

589
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,170
这是一个很棒的狗群
This was a great pack.

590
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,710
他们知道去哪儿能吃到最好的鸡肉
They knew just where to go fo get the best chicken.

591
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,010
嘿  你们来了
Hey. There you are.

592
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,930
今天的特色菜  鸡肉
Yeah, today's special. Chicken.

593
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,050
你的最爱  是吧
You like that. You like...

594
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,550
我喜欢这个鸡肉男
I love this chicken guy.

595
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,380
好了  很好  就这些啦  没有啦
Okay, very good. That's it. That's it.

596
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,470
你们现在可以走啦  好吗  去吧
You can go now, okay? Go.

597
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,100
来了
Coming.

598
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,900
独牙仔是一个勇敢的猎食者
One Tooth was a brave hunter,

599
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,950
他无所畏惧
who wasn't afraid of anything.

600
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,320
向他学习猎食太令我兴奋了
It was exciting to learn to hunt from him.

601
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:37,010
这个狗群太好玩了
This pack was so much fun.

602
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:38,740
你们好呀  小宝贝们
Hello. sweethearts.

603
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,920
你是谁呀  新来的吗
Oh, and who are you? Are you new?

604
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,790
给你  小家伙  好的
There you go, sweethearts. Yeah.

605
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,460
该回家了  回家吧  快回家吧
Please go home, now. Go on home, now. Go on home.

606
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,420
她怎么知道我正在玩回家游戏
How did she know I was doing go home?

607
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,510
回家吧
Go home!

608
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,300
- 真是个美妙的一天  - 好孩子
- It was a wonderful day. - Good boy, sarge.

609
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,810
但是独牙仔这是去哪儿呢
But where's one tooth going?

610
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,430
好了  进来吧  快点
All right, in you go. Come on.

611
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,150
丑屁股也要走了吗
And shaggy butt, too?

612
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,700
看来只剩下你和我了 疯发犬
Guess that just leaves you and me, crazy hair.

613
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:18,990
等等
Oh, Wait.

614
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,200
狗群里的每个成员都有自己的家人
Everyone in this pack has their own people.

615
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,220
疯发犬想让我跟他进去
Crazy hair wanted me to go with him,

616
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,380
成为他家庭中的一员
to be part of his family.

617
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:32,790
里面看起来很不错  闻上去也很好
It seemed nice in there, with lots of good smells.

618
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,260
在这里我也可能会很开心
I could be happy here.

619
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,930
但他们并不需要我
But they didn't need me.

620
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,810
妈妈需要我
Mom needed me.

621
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,350
卢卡斯需要我
Lucas heeded me.

622
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,440
我也需要他们
And I needed them.

623
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:56,440
露西  你回来啦
Lucy! There you are.

624
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:00,160
所以  我要继续我的回家游戏
So, I had to keep doing go home.

625
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,590
现在我知道了  想要猎食的话
Now, I knew that to hunt,

626
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,480
我需要去有人的地方
I needed to go where there were people

627
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,230
然后按照独牙仔教我的来
and do what one tooth taught me.

628
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,420
有血的味道
I smelled blood.

629
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,560
它是我见过最大的动物
It was the largest animal I had ever seen.

630
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,020
她遇到了很恐怖的事情
And something very bad had happened to her.

631
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,400
快来  在这里
Come on! Whoo! Through here.

632
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,070
我看到它了
I see it.

633
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,720
它肯定值千把块
Thing's got to be worth a thousand bucks.

634
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,480
至少呀 太棒了
Oh, at least. Beautiful.

635
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,100
你觉得它有一百多斤吗
What do you figure? About 125 pounds?

636
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,120
太给力了
Oh, yeah.

637
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,520
- 来张自拍吧  - 好啊
- Hey, let's get a selfie.  - Yeah, you bet.

638
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,120
准备好了吗
Okay, ready?

639
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,460
- 好了  - 看镜头
- Yeah.  - Here.

640
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,150
她可真美
Wow. She's beautiful.

641
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,450
不错吧  这照片一定要挂墙上
Yeah, that one's going up on the wall.

642
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,260
那是什么
What is that?

643
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:44,140
看起来有点像猫
It kind of looks like a cat.

644
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,120
我希望它跟我走
I hoped the cat would leave with me

645
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,930
别被坏人抓住
and not get caught by those bad men.

646
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:54,070
她和我见过的猫闻起来不一样
That cat didn't smell like any cat I ever knew.

647
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,320
它在跟着我吗
Was it following me?

648
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,150
还好  跟着呢
Yep, it was following me.

649
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,990
我突然意识到它不是一只成年的猫
And suddenly, I realized it wasn't a full-grown cat.

650
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,040
还是一个猫宝宝
It was still just a kitten.

651
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,120
就是长的太大了
A really big kitten.

652
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,920
大猫咪  快来这边
Come on, big kitten. This way.

653
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,230
那只大动物肯定是它妈妈
That big animal must have been this kitten's mother.

654
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,690
大猫咪让我想起了我的狗狗妈妈
Big kitten made me think of mother dog

655
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,820
以及  她被抓走时  我有多难过
and how sad I was when she was taken away.

656
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,620
她需要人照顾她
She needed someone to take care of her.

657
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,440
大猫咪的妈妈再也不能喂养她了
Big kitten's mother couldn't feed her anymore,

658
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:16,360
那么  就由我来照顾她吧
so, I did.

659
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,530
我成了大猫咪的猫妈妈了
I was big kitten's mother cat now.

660
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,300
大猫咪需要进食  我也要吃饭
Big kitten needed to eat, and so did I.

661
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:47,720
所以我做了所有妈妈都会做的事
So, I did what any mother would do.

662
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,020
去觅食
I went hunting.

她似乎仍不理解我为什么要回家
she still didn't seem to understand how to go home.

686
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,030
所以  当她想把我带偏路线时
So, when she tried to take me away from it,

687
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,200
我总得把她带回来
I would always have to bring her back.

688
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:41,750
不管大猫多晚出去  都有人给她吃的
Whenever big kitten went out at night, someone gave her food.

689
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:47,220
猫都爱吃鱼
Cats love fish,

690
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,260
但我希望有人能给她鸡肉就好了
but I wish someone would give her chicken.

691
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,770
夜里我们互相取暖
We kept each other warm.

692
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:05,520
我们已经是彼此的家人了
We were family now.

693
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,490
一个早上  我闻到了些特别的气味
I had been smelling something all morning.

694
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,130
有点像狗
Something like dog.

695
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,040
之后  我先听到了它的声音
First, I heard them.

696
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:36,050
接着就看到它了
Then I saw them.

697
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,020
他们的眼神冷酷
Their eyes were cold.

698
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,110
他们是来找我们猎食的
They were hunting us.

699
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,620
我必须得保护好大猫咪
And I had to protect big kitten.

700
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,820
嘿  快走  离开这里
Hey! Get out! Get out of here!

701
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:42,290
滚开  快滚开
Scram! Get out!

702
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,500
哎 你看
Hey, check it out.

703
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:52,930
- 那是山猫吗  - 不  是一只美洲狮
- Is that a bobcat?  - No, no, it's a cougar.

704
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,380
这只还很小
It's a young cougar.

705
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,870
大猫害怕这些人
Big kitten was afraid of the men.

706
00:46:57,890 --> 00:46:59,160
哇  速度真快
Whoa. That's really fast.

707
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,970
但我决定看看他们会不会给我们吃的
But I decided to see if they would give us food.

708
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,650
今天吓到我了
Pretty scared to me.

709
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,460
我从没在野外见过美洲狮
I've never seen a cougar in the wild before.

710
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:10,350
这家伙超大  得有3米吧
I mean, this thing was huge. It was like 10 feet long.

711
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:11,980
别紧张  也就3.6米
Easy, 12. Yeah.

712
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:15,820
来  让我看看你狗牌上的名字
Hey. Let's see if your name is on your tag, huh?

713
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:17,790
狗狗很乖啊
Who's a good girl?

714
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,250
这只小狗挺可爱的
She's a cutie. She is.

715
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:23,790
想吃火腿吗
Want some ham?

716
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,420
来  给你火腿  坐  乖狗狗

Her name is Bella.

718
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,530

00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:45,500
想吃的时候就有东西吃
We had food whenever we needed it.

824
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,260
要来点零食吗
Want a snack?

825
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,970
房间里很暖和
We were inside and warm.

826
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,760
睡觉的地方也很软和
Dutch and I had a soft spot to sleep on.

827
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:01,390
我们还有彼此相伴
And each other.

828
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:07,400
有点像家一样了
It started fo feel like home.

829
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:24,290
这是什么
What's this?

830
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,170
为了庆祝你写完了小说
To celebrate you finishing your novel.

831
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:33,120
过来
Hey. Come here.

832
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:38,170
你把我们的电话号码写在狗牌上了吗
Did you put our phone number on their dog tags?

833
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,850
不然我要加上谁的号码
Well, whose number would I put on it?

834
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,690
这种味道很熟悉
This smell was familiar.

835
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,840
你要帮我吗
You helping me?

836
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,010
你喜欢叠衣服吗  贝拉
You like doing laundry, Bella?

837
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:57,770
- 喂  - 洗衣服游戏  我玩过这个游戏
- Hello. - Doing laundry? I knew that game.

838
00:56:57,870 --> 00:56:59,230
我猜你是喜欢的
Guess you do, huh?

839
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:00,530
好啦
Yeah.

840
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,860
谁的电话
What is it?

841
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,870
稍等我一会儿
Uh, can you excuse me, please?

842
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,340
是雪崩时候的那个人他妹妹
That guy from the avalanche... His sister.

843
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,160
他出院了
He's out of the hospital.

844
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:17,630
对不起  我
I'm sorry, I...

845
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,720
嗯 他没事就好
Yes, I'm sure he is.

846
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,820
达驰以前一定来过这里
Dutch had definitely been here before.

847
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:44,320
他把院子里所有东西都做了记号
He had marked just about everything in the yard.

848
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:46,660
听话  达驰  听话
Easy, Dutch. Easy.

849
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,910
在吗  库尔奇先生
Hello? Mr. Kurch?

850
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:55,340
过来  贝拉  库尔奇先生  在吗
Come on, Bella. Mr. Kurch? Hello?

851
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,430
我在后屋
Back here.

852
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:02,800
哦  达驰
Aw! Geez! Oh, Dutch.

853
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:04,560
下去
Get down!

854
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,120
达驰就是见到你太激动了
Well, Dutch is just happy to see you.

855
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:09,600
我身上11处骨折  这条狗直接跳到我身上了
I got 11 freaking fractures, and the dog's jumping all over me.

856
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,930
从我身上下去  蠢狗
Get off of me, stupid dog!

857
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,590
达驰见到这个人很兴奋
Dutch was happy to see this man,

858
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:16,400
但是竟然有人见到达驰会不开心
but what kind of a man wouldn't be happy to see Dutch?

859
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:18,600
我是泰勒  这是加文
I'm Taylor. This is Gavin.

860
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:19,800
是我们把你挖出来的
We're the ones who dug you out.

861
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,740
我一点都不记得了
I don't remember any of that.

862
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:25,450
我只知道我妹妹说  你们要把狗带过来
All I know is my sister says you're bringing the dog over,

863
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,900
真是可笑
which is ridiculous.

864
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:28,620
可笑吗
Ridiculous?

865
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:31,040
我不太明白
I don't understand you.

866
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:34,210
我看起来像是能照顾一条狗的人吗
Do I look like I can take care of a dog?

867
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,380
但是这是你的两条狗啊
But they're your dogs.

868
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,550
谁说两条狗了  我从来没见过另一条狗
Dogs? I never even seen that other one before.

869
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,260
贝拉不是你的狗吗
Bella's not yours?

870
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:43,750
但是她很努力的把你挖出来呀
But she was trying to dig you out.

871
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,470
我那条狗都不会养
I'm not taking either one.

872
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,970
但你至少要养达驰
But you have to take Dutch at least.

873
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:51,800
你们要怎么处理那条狗
Whatever you're doing with that other one,

874
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,260
就怎么处理达驰
do the same thing with Dutch.

875
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,320
走吧  狗狗们
Come on, dogs.

876
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,240
我们走  达驰  过来
Let's go, Dutch. Come on.

877
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:04,330
过来
Come on.

878
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,280
- 走吧  - 那个人活该孤单
- Come on.  - That man belongs alone.

879
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:17,620
过来
Come here.

880
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,860
过来  贝拉
Come here, Bella.

881
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,240
乖狗狗
Good girl. Hey.

882
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:25,420
所以我们有了两条傻乎乎的大狗
So, now, we have two big, slobbery dogs.

883
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,680
就像我一直以来的期盼一样
Just like I've always wanted.

884
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:30,560
他们很乖的
Oh, they're good dogs.

885
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,640
是的  过来
Yeah, they are. Hey, come here.

886
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:34,720
过来  贝拉  过来  抓到你了
Come here, Bella. Come here. There you are.

887
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,400
等下  等下  等下
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

888
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,780
雪化了  但是我知道我在哪
The snow was gone, but I knew where I was.

889
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:45,320
这是我最后见到大猫咪附近的地方
I was near the last place I saw big kitten.

890
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:48,110
然后  我感觉到了
And suddenly, I felt it.

891
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:53,200
那条无形绳子  我又感受到了
The pull of that invisible leash, stronger than ever.

892
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,110
你知道我们要做什么吗  去宠物店
You know what we should do? Go to the pet store.

893
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:58,290
我们要买点狗粮
We need to get dog food.

894
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,960
达驰想让我留下来
Dutch wanted me to stay.

895
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,810
- 加入这个新家庭  - 狗狗们  别跑
- To be part of this new family. - Hey, hey! Hey, dogs! No, no, no.

No, that's too far.

897

- 过来  - 来这边

我又饿了
I was hungry again.

918

920
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:40,140
我必须要到有人的地方  才有东西吃
I had to find people places, so I could eat,

921
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:43,150

我找遍了整个镇子

但是所有能找到东西吃的地方都关门了

01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,950
- 给你  - 再见
- Here you go.  - Bye.

963
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:02,290
谢谢
Thank you.

964
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,210
生意真好  贝拉
Good for business, Bella.

965
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,170
他身上有我熟悉的东西
Something about him was familiar.

966
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:22,980
阿克塞尔和迈克一样难过
Axel was sad the way Mack was sad.

967
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:25,480
和妈妈一样难过
The way mom was sad.

968
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,650
我想出去玩  就像之前和狗群一样
I wanted to go have fun like I did with the pack,

969
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:35,980
但是阿克塞尔不明白  狗狗是需要玩耍的
but Axel didn't understand that dogs need to play.

970
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,690
放松  乖狗狗
Shh. Easy, girl.

971
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:42,900
我们相互取暖
We kept each other warm.

972
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
乖狗狗
Good dog.

973
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,420
他让我不再饿肚子
He made sure I was never hungry.

974
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,580
真乖  贝拉
Good dog, Bella.

975
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,010
慢慢的  天气变暖了
Slowly, the air got warmer.

976
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:07,140
但是阿克塞尔越来越难过
But Axel got sadder and sadder.

977
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:19,900
我觉得阿克塞尔不会给我解开绳子了
I didn't think Axel would ever take me off the leash.

978
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:44,130
我不喜欢被拴着
I didn't like being chained.

979
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:47,220
那感觉很不好
It didn't feel right.

980
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:51,860
我不知道怎么帮助阿克塞尔  还能同时照顾自己
I didn't know how to help Axel and still take care of myself.

981
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,650
我要回家
I needed to do go home.

982
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:57,190
我爱你
I love you.

983
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,820
只有咱们俩
It's just me and you.

984
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:05,030
你是我唯一的朋友
You're the only friend I've got.

985
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,030
我爱你  贝拉
I love you, Bella.

986
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:08,830
我爱你
I love you.

987
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,790
只有咱们俩  贝拉
It's you and me, Bella.

988
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,500
你和我
You and me.

989
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:20,170
贝拉  我爱你
Bella, I love you.

990
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:22,550
我爱你  贝拉
I love you, Bella.

991
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:23,760
我爱你
I love you.

992
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:39,110
我躺在阿克塞尔身边直到他没了心跳
I laid with Axel while the heat slowly drained away from him,

993
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,690
直到世界上没有了阿克塞尔
until there was no more Axel

994
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:44,450
他再也不会难过了
and he was no longer sad.

995
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,550
我像乖狗狗一样坐好
I sat, being a good dog,

996
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,980
想着会有人来找我
thinking someone would come for me.

997
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,980
没人来
Nobody came.

998
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:23,020
做乖狗狗没有用
Being a good dog didn't work.

999
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:42,630
就好像全世界都忘了我
It was as if the whole world had forgotten me.

1000
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:47,010
但是我不能放弃
But I couldn't give up.

1001
01:07:56,730 --> 01:07:58,470
我很渴
I was so thirsty.

1002
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,690
我要喝水
I needed water.

1003
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,030
贝拉  这很重要
Okay, Bella, this is very important.

1004
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:50,610
准备好了吗  好啦
You ready? All right.

1005
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:51,580
跑回家
Go home.

1006
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:55,240
就是这样
That's it.

1007
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:57,830
跑回去  贝拉
Go home, Bella.

1008
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,040
回家
Go home.

1009
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:00,900
快来  这里有一条超棒的小路
Come on, there's a cool path down here.

1010
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,710
等我一下
Hey, wait! Wait for me!

1011
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,710
- 快点  你每次都很慢  - 才不是
- Hurry up. You're always slow.  - No, I'm not.

1012
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:12,510
快看  有条狗
Hey, look. A dog.

1013
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,220
有人来了
People.

1014
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,550
- 它怎么了  - 我不知道
- What's the matter with it?  - I don't know.

1015
01:09:21,570 --> 01:09:22,930
小心它有狂犬病
Careful it doesn't have rabies.

1016
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:24,990
不会有狂犬病的  你个傻子
Doesn't have rabies, you moron.

1017
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:27,560
他被绑住了  乖狗狗
It's stuck. Good dog.

1018
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:29,150
真乖
Good dog.

1019
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:31,070
它被绑在什么上面了
It's chained to something.

1020
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:41,860
那是什么  那里有具尸体
What... what is it? There's a body over there.

1021
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,170
不可能
No way.

1022
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:45,290
- 狗狗被绑在他身上了  - 他死了吗
- The dog's chained to it.  - Is he dead?

1023
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:46,390
我觉得他死了
I think so.

1024
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:49,840
你要干什么
What are you gonna do?

1025
01:09:50,810 --> 01:09:51,810
乖狗狗
Good dog.

1026
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:02,190
从来没觉得水会这么好喝
Water never tasted so good.

1027
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:16,590
我现在知道了  我的旅途比我想象中的
I knew now that my journey was much longer

1028
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:17,870
要长很多
than I'd ever imagined.

1029
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,620
两个冬天过去了
Two winters.

1030
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:23,000
还要多少个冬天呢
How many more winters would there be?

1031
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:25,250
我还能活几个冬天呢
And how many more could I take?

1032
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:42,510
到处都是他们的气味
Their smell was everywhere.

1033
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,690
他们又要猎杀我
They were hunting me again.

1034
01:10:58,250 --> 01:10:59,960
我就知道他们会来
I knew they would come.

1035
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:05,540
但我不会让他们认为我害怕了
But I wasn't gonna let them think I was afraid.

1036
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:09,830
那是

卢卡斯一定会需要一个更大的床

这可是个新味道

1059
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:30,770

I knew then that big kitten would not be coming home with me

1065
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,030
不会睡在一张床上的
to sleep on the bed.

1066
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:43,090
我会一直是你的猫咪妈妈的

1071

It hurts so much.

1081
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,580
但我要坚持继续走下去
I have to keep going.

1082
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:34,420
街道和房屋开始看起来熟悉一些了
The streets and the houses started to look familiar.

1083
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:42,440
我终于做到了卢卡斯说的
I finally did what Lucas told me.

1084
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:46,270
我完成了回家游戏
I did go home.

1085
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:00,910
卢卡斯  妈妈

是谁啊  卢卡斯
Who's there? Lucas!

1087
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:05,830
哦  天呐
Oh, oh.

1088
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,750
你不能进来  出来
Okay, you can't be in here. Come on.

1089
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:11,460
所有的东西都不一样了
Everything was different.

1090
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,800
出来  出来
Come on. Come on.

1091
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:14,320
你出来的话  我就给你拿好吃的
I'll give you a treat if you come outside.

1092
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:15,960
卢卡斯  妈妈
Lucas? Mom?

1093
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:19,590
他们去哪了
Where were they?

1094
01:20:20,810 --> 01:20:23,930
这里有只流浪狗跑到我家里来了
There's a stray dog that just pushed its way into my house.

1095
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:28,520
我能闻得出  他们已经离开了很久很久了
I could smell they had been gone for a long, long time.

1096
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:40,040
我那么努力   我走了那么远
I tried so hard, and I'd come so far.

1097
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:45,120
我实在是一步都走不动了
I just couldn't take another step.

1098
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:55,960
猫咪妈妈
Mother cat?

1099
01:20:56,430 --> 01:20:58,590
你怎么变得这么小了
How did you get so small?

1100
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:08,490
- 是你打电话说  这儿有只流浪狗的吗  - 是的
- Call about a stray dog?  - I did.

1101

开玩笑吧
You kidding?

没什么大事的
All right, everybody.

没什么大不了  没什么需要担心的
No big deal. Nothing to worry about.

1151
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:37,480
我是为了那个斗牛犬来的
I'm just here for that pit bull.

1152
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:39,690
如果你们任何人干涉的话
And if any of you interfere,

这些警官会逮捕你们

但我们必须要把狗带走
but we have to take that animal.

1156
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:50,620
我想知道  为什么半个部门的人
I thought I'd see why half the department

1157

都为了一个常规的动物管控电话跑出来了
is out here on a routine animal control call.

1158
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:55,420
谁能跟我说说
Anybody want to fill me in?

1159
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,250
队长  我到这来是因为正规公务  这些人
Captain, I'm here for a confiscation, and some of these people,

1160
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:01,880
他们想把正常公务变成特殊状况
they're trying to turn it into some kind of a situation.

1161
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:06,130
这是妨碍执法  收养危险动物
It's obstruction, harboring a dangerous animal,

1162
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:08,050
违背合法的规定

Well, which one of you is responsible for this crime spree?

1164
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:19,560
我就猜到会这样
I thought it might be something like that.

1165
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:23,070
是因为这个斗牛犬吗
That a pit bull?

1166
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:25,020
我看着可不太像斗牛犬
Doesn't look like a pit bull to me.

1167
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,530
她是我的狗  而且她受伤了
She's my dog, sir, and she's hurt.

1168
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:29,660
我要带她去看兽医
I'm taking her to the vet.

1169
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:31,690
很抱歉的告诉你  查克说的是对的
Well, I'm sorry to tell you that Chuck's right.

1170
01:25:31,790 --> 01:25:34,030

We have to take your dog in to the shelter.

1171
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:35,120
好吧
All right.

1172
01:25:36,290 --> 01:25:37,690
如果你要这么做  你需要过我这关
But to do so, you've got to go through

1173
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:40,500

1180
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:56,650
你呢
Do you?

1181
01:25:58,770 --> 01:26:02,020
女士  我的工作是执法
Ma'am, my job is to enforce the law,

1182
01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:04,900
法律规定我必须收押这条狗
and the law says I've got to impound this dog.

1183
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:07,350
这意味着  如果有必要用泰瑟枪和胡椒喷雾
Now, if that means tasers and pepper spray,

1184
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:09,110
那我会使用的
then that's what it means.

1185
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,070
根据丹佛市市规第八条例
Under Denver city ordinance 8-...

1186
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:12,370
等等
Wait.

1187

他说  丹佛市
He said "Denver."

1188
01:26:16,290 --> 01:26:17,290
对了
That's right.

1189
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:19,750
这里不是丹佛市
But this isn't Denver.

1190
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,330
- 这里是联邦财产  - 这是什么
- This is federal property.  - It's what?

1191
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:24,710
退伍军人医院是联邦政府财产
The va hospital is federal property.

1192
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,130
严格上来说  这里不属于丹佛市
It isn't technically a part of the city of Denver.

1193
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:29,930
所以  就是这样了  队长
So, that's it, captain.

1194
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:32,980
我们不会起任何争执  因为你在这没有执法权
There doesn't have to be a fight, 'cause you don't have jurisdiction.

1195

太好了
Yeah.

1200
01:26:51,450 --> 01:26:54,530
如果我看到这条狗离开应该在的范围  我会让你靠边停车的
If I see this dog leave the premises, I will pull your car over.

1201
01:26:54,620 --> 01:26:56,360
不  你不会的
No, you won't.

1202

查克  我接到了很多对你的投诉
Chuck, I get more complaints about you

1203
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:02,500
比其他所有人的加起来还多

1204

把公车交上去  我要把你从外勤队里调出去
Turn that vehicle in. I'm pulling you out of the field.

1205
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:12,380
没有人可以因为一条狗去让人靠边停车
And nobody is pulling anyone over for a dog.

1206
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:15,060

我不太明白刚刚发生了什么
I don't understand what just happened,

但我知道肯定是好事
