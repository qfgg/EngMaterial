谢谢你把马借给我

5
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:12,110
- 你喜欢它吗?  - 它好美
- You liked him? - Oh, it's beautiful.

6
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:16,114
不过我还以为今天是去玩帆船
But I thought we were going sailing today.

7
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:22,912
你答应过的
You promised.

8
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:32,505
那艘太旧了
Well, that one's too old.

9
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:41,681
看  那艘就可以了
See, now? That'll do.

10
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,600
过来呀
Come on.

11
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:47,228
过来嘛  艾华
Come on, Mr. E.

12
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:52,483
- 船是破的  - 谁说的?
- It's broken. - Who says?

13
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:54,861
莫基洛
Mokelock.

14
00:03:56,487 --> 00:04:00,074
艾华  你答应过不再提莫基洛的
Now, Edward, we agreed. No more Mokelock.

15
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,826
莫基洛就是那怪物
Mokelock is the bogeyman.

16
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:08,124
- 莫基洛想我留在这里  - 我们可以修好它的
- Mokelock wants me where I am. - We can fix it.

17
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:16,132
艾华
Edward.

18
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:01,719
唱"六便士歌"给我听听
Sing a song of sixpence.

19
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,557
唱"六便士歌"给我听听
Sing a song of sixpence.

20
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,936
一整袋的黑麦
CATHERINE: A pocket full of rye.

21
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:24,408
二十四只黑鸟
MIRIAM: Four and 20 blackbirds.

22
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,537
放在批里面烤
CATHERINE: Baked in a pie.

23
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:46,639
起床吧
MIRIAM: Rise and shine.

24
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,069
艾华看来不错
Mr. E is doing fine.

25
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,828
你俩有没有扬帆出海?
Did we go sailing?

26
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,331
几乎去了
Almost.

27
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:17,253
- 但莫基洛出现了  - 莫基洛是怪物
- Mokelock showed up. - Mokelock is the bogeyman.

28
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,088
他想我留在这里
Mokelock wants me where I am.

29
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:23,676
莫基洛真是烦死人
Mokelock is a pain in the ass.

30
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:27,680
- 他从哪里想出这个莫基洛?  - 鹅妈妈儿歌集
- HENRY: Where'd he get Mokelock again? - CATHERINE: Mother Goose.

31
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:30,933
- 亨利  - 贝里
- BARRY: Henry. - HENRY: Barry.

32
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,144
什么事  贝里?
What's the matter, Barry?

33
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:35,438
艾华的父母来了
Edward's, uh, parents are here.

34
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,650
(甘保中心)

35
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:50,369
他需要剪头发了
MRS. BAINES: He needs a haircut.

36
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:53,789
他很喜欢你来探他
CATHERINE: He loves it when you visit.

37
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:57,877
我丈夫怀疑这是不是真的
My husband wonders if that's true.

38
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,422
他想送艾华入医院
He wants to place Edward in a hospital.

39
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:04,675
对不起  嘉芙
I'm sorry, Catherine.

40
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:08,512
包先生
HENRY: Mr. Baines.

41
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:12,767
我已花了七年时间在这个计划上
I've been working on this project for seven years.

42
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:16,687
我知道  亨利  我知道
I know, Henry. I know.

43
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:21,317
请不要见怪
Please don't take offense, Dr. Kent.

44
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:25,780
- 你的工作很有价值  - 但你怀疑我
- Your work's invaluable to this company. - But you're not sure about me.

45
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:29,784
我们等进展等了十八个月
We've waited, uh, 18 months for signs of progress.

46
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:33,537
- 的确有进展啊  - 但没有证据
- There has been progress. - There's no proof, Catherine.

47
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,624
不怕得罪
With all due respect, Mr. Baines...

48
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,876
程序不是我设计的
...I'm not the one who designed the procedure.

49
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:43,297
我但愿这可以归功于我
I wish I could take credit for it, but I can't.

50
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:46,717
我只是被他们选中做一份工作
I was chosen to do a job. They picked me.

51
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,429
如果你认为有人会更合适
But if you think there's someone better...

52
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,226
或者有人对你儿子会更好
...or someone who's more devoted to your son, then--

53
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:56,852
没有人怀疑你的能力
No one's doubting your ability.

54
00:07:57,395 --> 00:08:00,356
- 那为什么  - 没有证据  嘉芙
- What is it, then? - MR. BAINES: There's no proof, Catherine.

55
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:03,442
没有证据显示这个程序有用
There's no proof the procedure works.

56
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,736
你只是告诉我
All you're giving me is the belief...

57
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:10,533
你相信跟我儿子的接触不是
...that your interaction with my son is not a...

58
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:12,868
幻觉
...hallucination.

59
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:27,169
我还是回去工作好了  再见  包太
I better get back to work. Goodbye, Mrs. Baines.

60
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:30,756
- 谢谢你  - 谢谢  谢谢你  包先生
- Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Baines.

61
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,175
MR. BAINES: Come, shall we? Lucien.
我们走吧

62
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:45,020
- 幸好她崇拜你  - 因为他恨我
- Lucky she worships you. - Why? Because he hates me?

63
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:50,609
我不会说是"恨"  是不信任  很不喜欢
I wouldn't say "hates." Distrusts, dislikes immensely...

64
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:52,403
不想见到
...can't bear the sight of.

65
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,242
裁决是什么?
What's the verdict?

66
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:01,036
我们还有六个月
Well, we've got another six months...

67
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:04,456
贝里花了很多唇舌说服他
...and Barry had to push for that.

68
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:11,255
我想艾华倒过来进入我的世界  比以往更想
I wanna reverse the feed, Miriam, now more than ever.

69
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:14,884
我们讨论过一百次了  那太危险
We've been through this a hundred times, Catherine. It's too risky.

70
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,969
为什么?  我们有什么可损失的?
Why not? What do we have to lose?

71
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,014
在我做社工时
When I did social work, it was always better...

72
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:22,892
把孩子带离他本身的环境会更好
...when we took the kids out of their environment.

73
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,061
孩子初入寄养家庭会很害怕
Foster homes can be scary at first...

74
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,564
但最后事情总会好转
...but eventually they see things can be different.

75
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:30,941
艾华现在就是那个情况
Edward is like that right now.

76
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:36,071
他处身在一个不健康的环境中
He's living in a world that is not healthy.

77
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:40,826
- 我们应该带他去别处  - 假设我们依照你的方法做
- Let's show him a different place. - All right. Let's say we do it your way.

78
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:44,788
把艾华带进你的内心世界
We reverse the feed and we bring Edward into your mind.

79
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,916
他发现被塞进别的世界
Can you imagine his shock when he finds...

80
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,001
肯定会被吓坏的
...he's been thrust into this whole other world?

81
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:52,796
- 我也经常这么做  - 但你是自愿的
- I do it all the time. - Yes, but you're a willing participant, Catherine.

82
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:56,634
你知道会发生什么事  但艾华是在昏迷中
You're aware of what's happening. Edward's in a coma.

83
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,137
而且我们还未知道这对你的影响
And besides, we don't know what effect it will have on you.

84
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:02,973
你已筋疲力竭了
I mean, you're already exhausted.

85
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,142
-  你有没有睡觉?  - 有
- Have you been sleeping? - Yes.

86
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,811
- 还有没有发噩梦?  - 没有
- Any more nightmares? - No.

87
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,316
- 没有  - 那就好了
- No. - Good.

88
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:15,778
把工作留在这里  别带回家
Leave work here. Don't take it home in this.

89
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,451
嘿  你好啊
Hey, you.

90
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:09,206
你在找什么?
What are you looking for? Hmm?

91
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:10,624
想喝牛奶吗?
Want some milk?

92
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:50,933
艾华
CATHERINE: Edward.

93
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,006
艾华  是你吗?
CATHERINE [THINKING]: Edward, is that you?

94
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,997
你出海时  有没有见到
Edward, were there seals being killed on the beach...

95
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,166
海豹被杀?
...while you were sailing?

96
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,878
别躲  甜心  艾华  是你吗?
Don't hide, sweetie, please? Edward, is that you?

97
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:47,132
别怕  没有人会伤害你
Don't be afraid. No one will hurt you.

98
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,676
艾华  是你吗?
Edward, is that you?

99
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:56,141
睡吧
Go to sleep.

100
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,870
爸爸
WOMAN: Daddy!

101
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:20,415
救命呀
Help"

102
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:25,879
救命呀
Somebody, help me!

103
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,395
救命呀
WOMAN: Help me!

104
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:55,093
- 谢谢你等我  高尔  - 别客气
- Thanks for waiting, Cole. - Teddy Lee, no problem.

105
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,803
联邦密探林西
Special Agent Ramsey.

106
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,139
- 我是高尔  - 早安
- Cole. - Morning.

107
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,684
谁发现她的?
Who found her?

108
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:05,437
铁路的测量员  今早六时左右
COLE: The surveyor for the railroad, about 6 this morning.

109
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:08,940
刹车痕跟雷诺裸尸案的一样
Skid marks appear to match the tire tracks from Reno.

110
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:12,402
似乎撞到栏杆  刮下了一点车漆
And it looks like he scraped the rail, lost some paint too.

111
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,821
车漆已送去化验
It's on its way to the lab already.

112
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,991
尸体被弃置在这边
Dumped the body over there.

113
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:35,926
漂白水
Bleach.

114
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:39,846
卫安妮  第七名受害人
RAMSEY: Anne Marie Vicksey. She makes seven.

115
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,349
我的天
Jeez, this stinks.

116
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:46,645
- 她们全都看来像洋娃娃?  - 是的
- Do they all look like dolls? - TEDDY: Every unfortunate soul.

117
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,982
- 那是什么?  - 颈圈之类
- COLE: What's that? - Some kind of a collar.

118
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:55,028
- 那是他的手法之一  - 他戴上去的?
- Part of his methodology. - The way he puts it there?

119
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,573
他为她们造的
He makes it for them.

120
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:01,618
这令他觉得她们属于他
It makes him feel they belong to him.

121
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,872
水位通常都这么低吗?
NOVAK: ls the water always this low?

122
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,882
是的  每年这个时候都是
Yeah, this time of year.

123
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:20,303
立刻给我验尸报告  还有初步化验报告
Give me a coroner's report right away. Preliminary forensics too.

124
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,265
任何人都不得拖延这宗案件
I don't want anyone dragging their ass on this.

125
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,780
- 工作怎么样?  - 精疲力竭
- So how was work? - Ugh. Exhausting.

126
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:20,781
我也没主意  珍妮
RAMSEY: I have no idea, Jeannie. For God's sake.

127
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,241

刚出炉的报告
Hot off the presses.

130
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,714
各位  没有新的消息可报告了
TEDDY: Oh. There's nothing new to report, gentlemen.

131
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:40,801
精液吻合
A match on his semen.

132
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,011
她肺中的水
Water in her lungs...

133
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:47,182
含有大量氯气和铁锈
...show high levels of chlorine and rust.

134
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,897
请问这是什么?
What pray tell is this?

135
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:56,233
他们说发现了狗毛?
They say they found some dog hair?

136
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,947
- 是警犬吗?  - 不  不是警犬
- From a K-9 unit? - No. There was no K-9 unit.

137
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:04,324
而且卫安妮没有养狗
And Anne Vicksey doesn't own a dog, Teddy.

138
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,453
我想看清楚这根狗毛
I wanna see this.

139
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,417
你想找什么?
What you got, Teddy?

140
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:19,172
哼
TEDDY: Hmm.

141
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,809
白蚀
Hypomelanosis.

142
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,312
那是什么意思?
And that means?

143
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,861
完全没有黑色素
A complete absence of melanin.

144
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:45,740
那只狗有白化病
The dog is an albino.

145
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,412
他喜欢那样的动物
He'd love an animal like that.

146
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:52,163
各位
TEDDY: Gentlemen...

147
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:57,752
我相信白蚀的狗是很罕见的
...I believe an albino dog is a rare animal indeed.

148
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,442
我的天
Oh, my God.

149
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,113
你不会有事的
You're gonna be okay.

150
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,282
乖乖  对不起
Baby, I'm so sorry.

151
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:43,358
老天爷  彼得
Jesus Christ, Peter.

152
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,153
我以为你会睡一会  清洁一下吧
Thought you were gonna get some sleep, clean yourself up.

153
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:49,489
清洁好了
I did.

154
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:53,326
- 他们在等  - 我预备好了
- They're waiting, you know. - I'm ready.

155
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:58,164
那么我们走吧
Let's go. Ahem.

156
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,711
我们分两头进行
NOVAK: We're gonna do this two ways.

157
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:05,839
联络狼狗养殖场
Breeders of German shepherds.

158
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:08,550
福特代理商
Ford dealers.

159
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:14,180
调查要彻底  行动要快
I want you to be thorough, and I also want you to be fast.

160
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:18,268
这个人出动得越来越频密了  今次他只等了六天
This guy's accelerating. He only waited six days this time.

161
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:24,024
他开始时隔几个月才犯一次案  这有两个可能
When he first started, months could pass. And that means one of two different things.

162
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,194
一  他以为我们蠢得抓不到他
One, he thinks we're stupid and we can't catch him.

163
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:33,867
二  我相信是这个  他想被捕
Two, which is the one that I believe, he wants to be caught.

164
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:36,786
留下狗毛太大意了
The dog hair thing is sloppy.

165
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:40,206
他把卫安妮弃置在水深三寸之处
He leaves Anne Marie Vicksey in three inches of water.

166
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,459
明知我们会发现她
He knew that we'd find her.

167
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:45,128
有一件事是肯定的
Now, there's one thing I know for certain.

168
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:48,798
如果我们制止不到他
If we can't stop him...

169
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:52,510
他自己无法制止自己
...he ain't gonna stop himself.

170
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,154
这张照片可以吗?
Will this be all right?

171
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:14,574
可以了  谢谢你
Yes, ma'am, that's great. Thank you very much.

172
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:16,743
她仍然住在家里吗?
She was still, uh, living at home, ma'am?

173
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,580
我们正在找房子
We were looking for apartments.

174
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:24,584
但他们在结婚前不会搬进去
But they're not moving in together until after the wedding.

175
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,419
茱莉想结婚
Julia wants to be married.

176
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:29,089
她有没有提及过不寻常的事?
Did she ever mention anything out of the ordinary?

177
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,257
例如最近认识的人
For instance, somebody she recently met...

178
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:34,344
或是否有人跟踪她?
...or somebody perhaps watching her, following her?

179
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:35,512
没提过
No.

180
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,598
不好意思
Pardon me.

181
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,601
林西
Ramsey.

182
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:45,522
如果是你弄错了呢?
WOMAN: What if you made a mistake?

183
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:49,400
也许不是那个人  也许她很安全
Maybe this isn't the man. Maybe Julia's safe.

184
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:53,571
他的某些行径
There's certain things that he does...

185
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:58,076
令我们颇为肯定是他做的
...that, uh, make us pretty positive that this is the man.

186
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:02,497
去年我丈夫癌症过身了
WOMAN: Last year, I lost my husband to cancer.

187
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:07,460
他痛得要命  但茱莉总在他身旁
I went through such terrible pain. But Julia, she was always there for me.

188
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:16,719
什么事  林西?
What's going on, Gordon?

189
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:19,764
河滨区警方在林峰找到一个狗场
Riverside sheriff found a dog breeder in Woodcrest.

190
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:23,476
三年前卖出过一只白蚀小狼狗
Three years ago, she had a buyer for an albino shepherd pup.

00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:28,356
据运输署纪录  买主开一辆福特
Sheriff checks DMV. Son of a bitch drives a '92 Ford pickup.

192
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:31,192
- 猜那是什么颜色的  - 水绿色
- Guess what color. - Aqua green.

193
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:43,454
林西
Ramsey!

194
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:45,290

爱迪信街

Got a license for his dog, though. Named him Valentine.

199
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:00,388
哈
Ha!

200
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:26,331
你就是凶手吧  是吗  卡莱?
You're the bad man. Aren't you, Carl?

201
00:28:47,443 --> 00:28:51,004
你会吗?
Would you?

202
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:59,989
我的天
[GRUNTING AND GASPING]

203
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:36,359
我的天
[DISTORTED VOICE SPEAKING]

204
00:29:43,566 --> 00:29:46,626

205
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:51,916
林西探员  彼得探员
Brock, Agent Ramsey, Agent Novak.

206
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,836
我们已尽快赶来  他们已知情况
We got here as fast as we could. I briefed them on the way over.

207
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:56,963
现况如何?
Where do we stand?

208
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,506
现在的情况是
Here's the situation.

209
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:02,302
我在屋顶上派驻了一队人员
We got a high-ground team on the roof...

210
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:04,178
东面有四名武装队员
...a four-man element to the east.

211
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:06,639
货车上有破门部队
We got an entry team in the van across from the house...

212
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:08,725
南面有两人
...a two-man element to the south.

213
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:11,853
- 你们见到他没有?  - 还没有
- Have you seen him yet? - No.

214
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,148
厨房里有些动静  但看不出是谁
There's been some movement in the kitchen. Can't tell what it is.

215
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:18,515
- 你认为她在里面吗?  - 当她在吧
- RAMSEY: You think the girl's in there? - NOVAK: We'll proceed assuming that she is.

216
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:42,133
- 联邦密探  联邦密探  - 快
- AGENT 1: FBI! FBI! - AGENT 2: Go!

217
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:44,761
别动  杂种
Freeze, motherfucker!

218
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:49,015
联邦密探
MAN 3: FBI! FBI!

219
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:02,236
我找到那只狗了
I got the dog!

220
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:04,822
- 没有人  - 没有人
- Clear. - Clear.

221
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,820
送他去县医院  李德已经在那里
They'll take him to County General. Reid's already there.

222
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:47,657
一定要用手铐  两个人看守
Make sure he stays cuffed. I want two men on him at all times.

223
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,742
不准李德以外的任何人治理他
I don't want anyone to treat him but Reid.

224
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,953
塞一支探热针入他屁股都不行
Not so much as a thermometer up his ass, understand?

225
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,579
是
Mm.

226
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:59,460
- 彼得  她不在这里  - 是的
- Peter, she's not here. - Yeah.

227
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:03,506
你该下来看看
You should, uh, come downstairs.

228
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,304
(漂白水)

229
00:32:20,322 --> 00:32:22,119
(你有病吗?)

230
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:48,247
(雕刻家)

231
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:15,620
妈咪
WOMAN: Mommy!

232
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:18,915
帮我照顾孩子
Please take care of my little baby!

233
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:35,806
喂?  喂?
Hello? Hello?

234
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:40,895
求求你  你在吗?  喂?
Please, is there anybody there? Hello?

235
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:44,857
你听到我说话吗?
Can you hear me?

236
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:47,068
你听到我说话吗?
Can you hear me?

237
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:51,864
喂?
Hello?

238
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:54,575
我没看见你的脸
I didn't see your face.

239
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:57,119
我没看见
I didn't see...

240
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:59,497
你的任何一面
...any part of you.

241
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:05,169
这不是真的
This is not happening to me.

242
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:09,632
难以置信
I can't believe this is happening.

243
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,942
你们有没有听过惠伦氏症?
Have you ever heard of Whelan's infraction?

244
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:33,864
是一种精神分裂  很罕见  也很严重
It's a form of schizophrenia. It's very rare, and it's very severe.

245
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,619
精神分裂的人  这些部分会受侵袭
In any schizophrenic, these areas would be affected...

246
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:42,582
但惠伦氏症的人特别严重和快速
...but in someone with Whelan's, they're hit hard and they're hit fast.

247
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:45,084
不能给他大量镇静剂或精神药吗?
Can't you load him up with Thorazine or Desoxyn?

248
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:47,753
普通治疗精神病的药没有用
REID: Normal psychotropics don't work.

249
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:53,301
病因是病毒在子宫感染神经系统
This thing is caused by a virus that infects the neurological system in utero.

250
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:57,597
它一直蛰伏  直至有创伤引发
It lays dormant until it's triggered by some kind of trauma.

251
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:00,266
他的病症可能已出现了一段时间
Most likely, he's exhibited symptoms for some time...

252
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:04,228
但到今天才真正病发
...but the infraction, or the breach, didn't occur till today.

253
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:06,647
引发的因素有很多
The triggers can vary.

254
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:10,735
通常都与水有关  但结果都一样
Uh, usually water-related, but the results don't vary.

255
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:14,447
他不只是患上紧张症
He's not just catatonic.

256
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:19,744
他是消失了  就像做梦  而且永远醒不过来一样
He's disappeared. Like having a dream and never waking up.

257
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:24,248
- 这会维持多久?  - 永远
- For how long? - Oh, forever.

258
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:32,298
我想我们没提到最重要那点
Lee, I think we might be missing the bigger picture here.

259
00:35:32,465 --> 00:35:34,675
无论他是在何种状态
Now, whatever state that he happens to be in...

260
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:39,305
仍有一名女子失踪  她叫贺茱莉
...there is a girl that is missing and her name is Julia Hickson...

261
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:43,351
而他是唯一知道她在哪里的人
...and he is the only one that knows where she is.

262
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:48,439
他把她们藏在密室里约四十小时
He keeps them in this thing for about 40 hours.

263
00:35:48,606 --> 00:35:51,984
他是在昨晚七时半掳走贺茱莉的
Now, he took Julia Hickson at 7:30 last night.

264
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:58,783
彼得  你知道我的为人  如果有任何事  任何事
Peter, you know me. If there were anything, anything...

265
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:06,916
什么?
What?

266
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:44,286
他给她们食物  水  还有厕所
He provides them with food, drinking water and a toilet.

267
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:50,543
她们以为只是绑架  不一定会死
Now, she thinks she's been kidnapped, that there's a chance of survival...

268
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:53,546
但这只是一种折磨
...but it's just a form of torture.

269
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:57,758
这对他来说是一个洁净仪式  之后再带她们回家
This is a kind of ritual for him, a cleansing before he takes them home...

270
00:36:57,925 --> 00:37:00,845
把受害者造成玩偶  变成玩具
...and turns them into a doll, a toy.

271
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:06,225
密室是完全自动化的
Now, this thing is fully automated...

272
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:09,437
除非我们今晚之前找到她
...and unless we find her by tonight...

273
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:11,772
否则她也会遭遇同一命运
...this will happen to her.

274
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:15,151
关于这次联合行动
At the request of Mr. Cooperman...


275
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:18,070
我们联络过你们的董事局
...we've contacted your board of directors.

276
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:20,531
他们已经批准
And they've given their approval.

277
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:24,493
艾华的父母也批准了
And so have Edward's parents.

278
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,537
不过决定权仍在你们
But the decision is yours.

279
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:28,664
亨利?
Henry?

280
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:34,503
好
Yes.

281
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,673
- 美琳?  - 由嘉芙决定吧
- Miriam? - It's up to Catherine.

282
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:41,886
她才是要面对真正危险的人
She's the one who'd have to face whatever risks there might be...

283
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:45,765
她作的任何决定我都会支持
...so I support whatever decision she makes.

284
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,977
- 我可以问你一个问题吗?  - 请便
- Can I ask you something? - Please.

285
00:37:50,144 --> 00:37:53,522
如果他不是昏迷不醒
If he wasn't like this, if he was conscious...

286
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:57,067
你认为他会说出茱莉的所在吗?
...do you think that he would tell you where she is?

287
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,780
罪犯总是有忏悔的可能的
There's always a chance of a confession. Yeah.

288
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:03,783
他的行为显示他需要让人知道
And there's things he's done that show a need for disclosure.

289
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:06,786
只是没有人愿意听
He hasn't had a sympathetic ear.

290
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:10,539
他想有人听他说话  明白他
He wants someone to listen, to, uh, try and understand him.

291
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:14,126
我很同情这位女士  这是真的
Look, I feel for this girl, I do...

292
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:17,630
可是史卡莱可能已不知道真相
...but Stargher may no longer know the truth.

293
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:19,089
因为
For severe schizophrenics...

294
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:21,759
严重精神分裂者分不开真假
...there's no discerning between fantasy and reality.

295
00:38:21,926 --> 00:38:25,763
- 他有可能说出真相吗?  - 如果他信任我  是有可能的
- Is it possible? - If he came to trust me, yes...

296
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:28,224
不过赢取这种信任需要几个月
...but it takes months to earn that kind of trust.

297
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,476
他有可能说出真相吗?
Is it possible?

298
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:39,693
爸爸?
WOMAN [ON VIDEO]: Daddy?

299
00:38:40,611 --> 00:38:45,366
我是爸爸的乖女
I'm your little baby. Baby...

300
00:38:46,951 --> 00:38:48,744
爸爸
Daddy.

301
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:51,497
爸爸
Daddy!

302
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:57,169
我是你女儿啊
I'm daddy's girl.

303
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:17,815
他的层级太深了
His levels are too flat.

304
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:29,118
- 这里怎么了?  - 我们除去了十四个钢环
- MIRIAM: What happened here? - We removed 14 steel rings.

305
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:36,417
应该让他保持原状的
Should have left him the way he was.

306
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:39,336
他喜欢吊起自己吧?
He used to suspend himself, didn't he?

307
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:40,754
是的
Yeah.

308
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:43,966
精神分裂的人喜欢无重的感觉
They're comforted by the feeling of weightlessness...

309
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:46,594
就像浮在水中似的
...like floating in water.

310
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:54,310
各位  这是催化剂
Now this, gentlemen, is the catalyst.

311
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:57,438
名为神经染色体结合转移系统
The neurological connectic transfer system...

312
00:39:57,605 --> 00:40:00,441
它不单止描绘出内心世界
...not only maps the mind...

313
00:40:00,608 --> 00:40:03,235
还将讯号传送到另一个个体
...it sends the signal to another party.

314
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:05,070
接收者只需调较到适当的频道
All you need to do is tune in...

315
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:08,282
调较之后
...but you do much more than tune in.

316
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:10,200
接收者便变成其内心世界一部分
You become part of the show.

317
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,207
他已经准备好了
MIRIAM: He's ready.

318
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:24,548
为什么有三个平台?
Why are there three stations?

319
00:40:24,715 --> 00:40:26,592
我们尝试进行联合疗法
We tried joint therapy sessions...

320
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:29,470
用两个心理学家  但艾华不喜欢
...two shrinks for the price of one, but Edward hated it...

321
00:40:29,637 --> 00:40:32,723
他只肯跟嘉芙说话  她有天份
...and only talked to Catherine. She has a gift.

322
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:50,366
你肯定要这样做吗?
Are you sure?

323
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:55,579
我肯定
I'm sure.

324
00:40:56,747 --> 00:40:58,248
好吧
Okay.

325
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,675
反应信号
Response signal.

326
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:10,177
正在操作
Functioning.

327
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:13,681
我们在她手中植入了微型晶片
We implanted a touch-sensitive microchip in her hand...

328
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:15,766
如果她想停止或受不了
...so if she wants to stop the session...

329
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:18,644
按动晶片  我们便会
...or if it gets too intense, she can give the signal...

330
00:41:18,811 --> 00:41:20,104
将过程中止
...and we abort.

331
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:37,329
当初我们预备好要实际测试时
When we were ready for practical testing...

332
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:38,831
我们见过
...Miriam and I auditioned...

333
00:41:38,998 --> 00:41:41,038
很多优秀儿童心理学家
...some of the best child therapists in the country.

334
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:45,921
他们只是观察  然后汇报
And all they did was observe and report, nothing more.

335
00:41:47,548 --> 00:41:51,802
嘉芙经验最浅  但备受推崇
HENRY: Catherine was the least experienced, but she came so highly recommended...

336
00:41:51,969 --> 00:41:54,346
我们决定姑且让她一试
...that we decided, what the hell, we'll give her a shot...

337
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:56,765
我们立刻便发现她与众不同
...and immediately, we could tell she was different.

338
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:49,921
你不是人类  你不该待在我的房子里
MAN: You're not human. You don't lie in my house.

339
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:52,589
你是动物  这是我的房子
You're an animal! This is my house.

340
00:44:42,306 --> 00:44:44,266
嘿
Hey!

341
00:45:09,124 --> 00:45:10,918
嘿  你好啊
Hey, you.

342
00:45:20,636 --> 00:45:23,263
你喜欢人轻拍你吧  对吗?
Yeah, you like that, don't you?

343
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:26,975
你的名字是卡莱吗?
Is your name Carl?

344
00:45:28,644 --> 00:45:30,896
我认识一个男孩也有马
You know, I know another little boy with a horse.

345
00:45:31,063 --> 00:45:35,192
叫艾华  那孩子叫艾华  不是那只马
His name's Edward. I mean the boy, not the horse.

346
00:45:56,672 --> 00:45:57,923
有什么不妥?
What's wrong?

347
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:04,531
他杀死的人
His victims.

348
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:52,949
你从哪里来的?
Where do you come from?

349
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:09,508
- 喂  - 各位  她回来了
- Yeah. - HENRY [OVER PHONE]: Gentlemen, she's back.

350
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:11,301
我立刻过来
I'll be right there.

351
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,942
没事了  别怕  嘉芙
MIRIAM: All right. Come on, Catherine.

352
00:50:29,653 --> 00:50:32,030
她的旅程很特别
HENRY: She's had quite a journey.

353
00:50:32,197 --> 00:50:34,074
跟以往不同
Unlike anything we've ever seen before.

354
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:36,785
- 那么她接触到他了?  - 是的
- So she's made contact? - Oh, yes.

355
00:50:36,952 --> 00:50:40,330
她进入了他内心深处  太深了
She's gone very deep into his world. At times too far.

356
00:50:40,997 --> 00:50:44,209
- 很冷  - 那很危险
- It's cold. - HENRY: That can be dangerous.

357
00:50:44,376 --> 00:50:45,669
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

358
00:50:45,835 --> 00:50:49,589
她若相信史卡莱的世界是真的
Well, if she came to believe that Stargher's world is real...

359
00:50:49,756 --> 00:50:52,801
她的心便会说服她的身体
...then theoretically, her mind could convince her body...

360
00:50:52,968 --> 00:50:55,637
在那里  发生在她身上的事
...that anything that was done to it there...

361
00:50:55,804 --> 00:50:57,556
便是真的
...is actually done.

362
00:50:57,722 --> 00:51:00,600
就像坊间迷信  如果你在梦中梦见自己死去
It's like the old wives' tale where you die in your dream...

363
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,400
那你真的会在现实中死亡
...you die in real life.

364
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,854
提高这里的温度可以吗?
Henry, could you raise the temperature in here?

365
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:07,315
- 靳医生?  - 请你等一等
- Dr. Kent? - MIRIAM: Just a moment, please.

366
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:09,234
请问我可以和你谈谈吗?
Can I come in there and speak with her?

367
00:51:09,401 --> 00:51:11,069
你要有耐性
We have to be patient.

368
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:14,906
看看她  昏昏欲睡  让她醒过来
I mean, look at her. She's drowsy. Let her wake up.

369
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:18,410
我们没有很多时间  你明白吗?
We don't have a lot of time. Do you understand that?

370
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:08,501
我们在天上的父
Our Father, who art in heaven...

371
00:52:09,878 --> 00:52:11,838
愿人都尊你的名为圣
...hallowed be thy name.

372
00:52:12,672 --> 00:52:16,718
天国福音降临于世
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

373
00:52:22,849 --> 00:52:24,893
我有没有打扰你们?
NOVAK: Am I interrupting anything?

374
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:35,320
我可以坐下来吗?
Is it okay if I...?

375
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:50,210
他知道你来了  是吗?
He knows you're here, doesn't he?

376
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:56,925
我朋友李德医生说
My friend, uh, Dr. Reid, said...

377
00:52:58,301 --> 00:53:02,681
这么小的孩子  罹患精神分裂
...that it's very unusual, uh, schizophrenia that is...

378
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:08,603
- 是很罕见的  - 医生一般会以为是自闭症
- ...in a child that's this young. - They usually think it's autism.

379
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:11,856
你得明白他的身体没有问题
What you have to understand is there's nothing wrong with his body.

380
00:53:12,691 --> 00:53:15,026
瘫痪的是他一部分的心智
What's paralyzed is a part of his mind.

381
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:19,489
心智受病毒侵害  以致他不能动
It's so damaged by the virus he can't even will himself to move.

382
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,243
你认为你可以改变现状吗?
You think you can change that?

383
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:26,287
你相信你内心有一部分
Do you believe there's a part of yourself...

384
00:53:27,205 --> 00:53:28,748
是你永远不会示人的吗?
...that you don't show anybody?

385
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:31,626
我想人人都有那一部分
I think everybody has that side of themselves.

386
00:53:31,793 --> 00:53:33,920
在实验中  我进入别人的心灵时
During a session, when I'm inside...

387
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:37,716
我便见到这一部分
...I get to see those things.

388
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:40,343
我感觉到它们
I feel them.

389
00:53:42,095 --> 00:53:46,224
在卡莱的内心  我感觉到一种我不想再有的感觉
With Stargher, I felt things I never wanna feel again.

390
00:53:49,394 --> 00:53:52,188
他甚至不再是史卡莱
He's not even Carl Stargher anymore.

391
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:58,486
他是一个理想化了的自己  是一个变态王国的王帝
He's this idealized version of himself, a king in a very, very twisted kingdom.

392
00:53:59,237 --> 00:54:01,281
在那里他可以尽情堕落
It's the place for him to indulge every...

393
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:06,244
我不想在这儿谈这些事
You know, I don't wanna talk about this in here.

394
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,470
我永远做不到你所做的
I could never do what you do...

395
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:27,307
全心全意去了解这样的心灵
...devote myself to understanding a mind like that.

396
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:30,894
我不认为我终会了解他的内心
I don't think we'll ever be able to understand a mind like that.

397
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,396
可是你尝试  那是你的工作
But you try. That's your job.

398
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:35,607
我想是吧
I guess so.

399
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:40,820
- 你不喜欢你的工作吗?  - 比起上一份工作  我较喜欢这份
- You don't like what you do? - I like it better than my old job.

400
00:54:40,987 --> 00:54:43,865
我以前是律师  当检察官
Used to be an attorney. I was a prosecutor.

401
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:45,909
发生了什么事?
What happened?

402
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:53,208
我有宗案件  一个小女孩遭非礼
I had a case, uh, where this little girl was molested.

403
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:57,003
只因一件小证物被污染了
And because of this one tiny piece of evidence...

404
00:54:57,170 --> 00:55:00,507
他获无罪释放
...that was tainted, he walked.

405
00:55:01,174 --> 00:55:04,302
贾卓士  他无罪释放
Charles Gish walked away.

406
00:55:05,303 --> 00:55:07,472
我却无能为力
Nothing I could do about it.

407
00:55:08,807 --> 00:55:11,518
他获释的那天晚上
The night after he was released...

408
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:14,687
玛姬的父母回到家
...Margaret's parents came home.

409
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:18,358
这是那小女孩的名字  单玛姬
That was the little girl's name, Margaret Sims.

410
00:55:19,484 --> 00:55:22,946
他们发现贾卓士坐在客厅中
And they found Charles Gish sitting in their living room.

411
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:24,697
他在看电视
He was watching television...

412
00:55:24,864 --> 00:55:27,033
玛姬坐在他身旁
...and Margaret was sitting next to him...

413
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,412
他把她从中切开两半
...and he had cut her open right down the middle.

414
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:35,959
父母还在冰箱中发现玛姬的心脏
And the parents found Margaret's heart in the freezer.

415
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,963
卓士觉得他们可能想保存它留念
Charles figured they'd probably wanna keep it.

416
00:55:42,507 --> 00:55:47,554
之后我便辞了职  加入联邦密探
After that, I left the DA and joined the FBI.

417
00:55:48,513 --> 00:55:50,807
我想尝试捉拿他们
Figured I'd just try to catch them.

418
00:55:52,517 --> 00:55:54,060
直到如今
Till now.

419
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:57,355
是的
Yeah.

420
00:55:58,106 --> 00:56:02,485
我告诉你  史卡莱不再是史卡莱了
You know, I started to tell you that Stargher really isn't Stargher anymore.

421
00:56:02,652 --> 00:56:04,529
那是真的  也是假的
Well, that's true, and it's not.

422
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:08,449
主要的部分仍是那恐怖的东西
The dominant side is still this horrible thing...

423
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:11,953
- 但也有正面的部分  - 正面的部分?
- ...but there's a positive side that-- - Positive side?

424
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,247
他视自己为儿童的那部分
Well, the way he sees himself as a child.

425
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:18,334
- 但那个是他吗?  - 儿童史卡莱接触我
- But isn't that him? - The boy Stargher made contact.

426
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:20,169
他对我好奇
He's curious about me.

427
00:56:20,336 --> 00:56:24,883
我接近那孩子  或可知道茱莉下落
If I could reach the boy, then maybe he'd tell me about Julia.

428
00:56:30,096 --> 00:56:31,931
贾卓士后来怎样?
What ever happened to Charles Gish?

429
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:38,271
他因为精神病而逃过谋杀罪
Old Charlie beat the murder rap because, uh, he was insane when he killed Margaret.

430
00:56:39,272 --> 00:56:43,234
他的律师把陪审团说得帖帖服服
His attorney, uh, milked the jury for all they were worth.

431
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:49,782
他说贾卓士自小遭到性侵犯  才令他走上这条路
Said that a life of sexual abuse drove him to do these things...

432
00:56:49,949 --> 00:56:53,828
他妈的  什么鬼话连篇
...and, you know, what ever the fuck. All that same old bullshit. Heh.

433
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:57,248
那为什么是鬼话?
Why is that bullshit?

434
00:56:57,415 --> 00:56:58,917
我相信一个孩子可以经历
I believe a child can experience...

435
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:02,503
比贾卓士糟一百倍的性侵犯
...a hundred times worse the abuse than what Gish went through...

436
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:07,133
但仍然会长大  成为一个
...and still grow up to be somebody that would never, ever...

437
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,886
永远永远不会伤害别人的人
...ever hurt another living being.

438
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,971
你肯定吗?
And you're sure of that?

439
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:15,808
是的
Yes, I am.

440
00:57:17,644 --> 00:57:19,187
我肯定
I'm sure of that.

441
00:57:22,774 --> 00:57:24,150
你去了哪里?
Hey, where the hell you been?

442
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,028
我一直在这里
I've been right here.

443
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:29,447
下次先告诉我好吗?
Well, next time tell me, okay?

444
00:57:29,614 --> 00:57:31,658
我不想打扰你
I didn't wanna disturb you. You looked so cute.

445
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:34,327
你睡相那么可爱
You're all sleeping when you get that look on you.

446
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:40,249
你的同事想知道拿史卡莱怎么办
Your colleagues wanna know what to do with, uh, Stargher.

447
00:57:46,297 --> 00:57:49,258
叫他们帮他准备好吧  我立刻到
Tell them to prep him. I'll be right there.

448
00:57:53,096 --> 00:57:54,973
谢谢你  嘉芙
Thank you, Catherine.

449
00:58:00,186 --> 00:58:03,856
史卡莱有没有宠物?  猫狗之类?
Stargher have any pets? You know, cats, dogs...

450
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:13,533
你真乖啊  对吗  华伦泰?
Yeah, you're a good boy, aren't you, Valentine?

451
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:17,328
- 那会有帮助吗?  - 对  在潜意识的层面
- That's supposed to help? - On a subconscious level, yes.

452
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:21,374
任何对卡莱有意义  令他开心的事物
Anything that was special to Stargher, gave him pleasure...

453
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:24,002
都应该会令他较易接近
...should make him more accessible...

454
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:27,046
- 平静的状态  - 平静?
...more peaceful. - Peaceful?

455
00:58:30,049 --> 00:58:31,968
那样就可以了
MIRIAM: That's enough, then.

456
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:43,062
- 警探  - 医生
- MIRIAM: Mr. Novak. - Doctor.

457
00:58:43,229 --> 00:58:45,565
- 谢谢  - 开始吧
- Thank you. - You got it.

458
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:49,902
第二回合
Round two.

459
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:07,211
亨利  这不好笑
CATHERINE: Henry, not funny.

460
00:59:07,378 --> 00:59:09,756
- 怎么啦?  - 一点也不好笑  亨利
- What's happening? - CATHERINE: Not funny, Henry.

461
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:14,635
- 嘉芙  - 别这样  不要再玩了
- HENRY: Catherine. - Come on, stop playing around.

462
00:59:14,802 --> 00:59:17,638
我没开玩笑  这是电力故障
HENRY: I'm not. It's a power problem.

463
00:59:17,805 --> 00:59:19,390
我们被锁在外面了
We're locked out, Catherine.

464
00:59:19,557 --> 00:59:21,976
你得检查一下断路器
I need you to check the circuit breaker.

465
00:59:22,143 --> 00:59:25,897
你去检查电路六至十二
I want you to check circuits six through 12.

466
00:59:28,316 --> 00:59:31,277
- 快呀  起来  - 嗯哼
- Come on. Get up. - CATHERINE: Mm-hm.

467
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:35,406
六至十二
HENRY: Six through 12.

468
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:28,793
我已经进去了
I'm already in.

469
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:32,213
她说什么?
What did she say?

470
01:01:32,395 --> 01:01:34,158
华伦泰
Valentine.

471
01:01:36,736 --> 01:01:38,738
华伦泰
CATHERINE: Valentine.

472
01:01:46,913 --> 01:01:48,414
过来  乖
Come here, boy.

473
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:51,459
华伦泰
Valentine.

474
01:02:02,553 --> 01:02:03,971
你可以带我去见卡莱吗?
Can you take me to Carl?

475
01:02:44,178 --> 01:02:46,097
需要帮忙吗?
Need some help?

476
01:02:50,184 --> 01:02:52,520
我有份礼物给你
I've got a present for you.

477
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:57,566
如果你需要我
If you need me...

478
01:02:58,025 --> 01:03:02,029
或者你觉得我在附近  却找不到我
...or if you feel like I'm around, but you can't find me, just...

479
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:05,116
只要用这个反射光线就行
Shine it like this.

480
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:11,289
拿去吧
Go ahead, take it.

481
01:03:13,749 --> 01:03:15,334
喜欢吗?
You like it?

482
01:03:15,918 --> 01:03:19,005
- 卡莱?  - 什么事?
- CARL'S FATHER: Carl? - What's the matter?

483
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:22,383
有什么不妥?
What? What's wrong?

484
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:29,056
这里发生什么事?  那碟子是自己破的吗?
CARL'S FATHER: What happened over here? Just broke all by itself.

485
01:03:30,725 --> 01:03:33,185
- 是不是你打破的?  - 是我打破的
- Did you break that plate? - CATHERINE: I broke the plate.

486
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:37,064
- 碟子是不是你打破的?  以为我很多钱吗? - 是我打破的
- Did you break that plate? - I broke the plate.

487
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:40,568
我们把它们全打破吧  怎么样?
Well, hey. Let's break them all, how about that?

488
01:03:40,735 --> 01:03:43,112
他妈的  你这个大话精!
You little fucking liar!

489
01:03:43,279 --> 01:03:45,698
该把你像发育不全的畜牲般淹死
I should've drowned you like the runt of the litter.

490
01:03:45,865 --> 01:03:49,702
在我家不准说谎  这是我的家
You don't lie in my house. This is my house!

491
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:51,245
不是我给他的
[WOMAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY]

492
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:54,081
洋娃娃是女孩的  不能给男孩玩
CARL'S FATHER: A doll? Those are for girls, you dumb whore.

493
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:57,298
- 只是玩具而已  - 闭嘴  八婆
- WOMAN: It's just a toy. - CARL'S FATHER: Shut up!

494
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:02,006
你不是他亲生妈妈  她不是你妈妈
You're not his mother! She's not your mother.

495
01:04:02,173 --> 01:04:05,134
你妈妈抛弃了我们  你要记住
She left us, Carl. Remember that.

496
01:04:07,428 --> 01:04:09,638
看到了吗?  看到了吗?
See that? See that?

497
01:04:10,389 --> 01:04:11,390
这里是
That is...

498
01:04:12,892 --> 01:04:14,977
邪恶之地
...a place of evil.

499
01:04:19,815 --> 01:04:22,526
混蛋
What the fucking cripes?

500
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:25,237
老天爷
Jesus Christ.

501
01:04:25,404 --> 01:04:28,741
这他妈的是什么?  过来
What the fuck is this? Get back, get over here!

502
01:04:28,908 --> 01:04:31,911
玩洋娃娃?  你这个小基佬
Playing with dolls? You little faggot!

503
01:04:33,496 --> 01:04:35,331
你是什么?  女人吗?
What are you, some kind of a woman? Get up!

504
01:04:35,498 --> 01:04:37,258
- 可是  爸  啊  - 他妈的
- CARL: But, Dad-- Aah! - CARL'S FATHER: Damn it.

505
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:38,793
你想哭吗?
You want something to cry about?

506
01:04:38,959 --> 01:04:41,629
给你一个哭的理由吧  女人
I'll give you something to cry about, woman!

507
01:04:41,796 --> 01:04:43,089
- 啊  - 女人型
- CARL: Aah! - Mama's boy!

508
01:04:44,215 --> 01:04:45,508
我养的不是基佬!
I didn't raise no faggot!

509
01:04:52,848 --> 01:04:54,183
天啦
Christ.

510
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:57,436
不准再哭  你想像女人般熨衣服吗?
Stop your crying. You wanna iron like a woman?

511
01:04:57,770 --> 01:04:59,530
- 让我教你怎样像女人般熨衣服吧  - 不
- Let me show you how to iron. - CATHERINE: No!

512
01:05:04,151 --> 01:05:05,528
救命
WOMAN: Help me.

513
01:05:35,641 --> 01:05:37,059
她
CARL: She...

514
01:05:38,394 --> 01:05:40,688
她是我的第一个
She was my first.

515
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:46,235
我弄得一塌糊涂
And I made such a mess.

516
01:05:47,528 --> 01:05:49,864
不知道自己在干什么
Didn't know what I was doing.

517
01:06:05,171 --> 01:06:06,964
你为什么会在这里?
Why are you here?

518
01:06:08,466 --> 01:06:09,717
不要说谎
Don't lie.

519
01:06:12,887 --> 01:06:15,639
- 我来帮你的  - 你撒谎
- I came to help you. - You're lying.

520
01:06:16,557 --> 01:06:19,643
婊子  贱人
Bitch. Whore.

521
01:06:21,687 --> 01:06:23,230
烂屄
Cunt!

522
01:06:25,941 --> 01:06:27,276
你说话就像你爸爸
You sound like your father.

523
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:37,286
他一文不值  他一文不值
[DISTORTED VOICE] He was nothing. He is nothing.

524
01:06:37,745 --> 01:06:39,788
谁叫你那么说的?
Who told you to say that?

525
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:43,501
你记得他第一次跟你说话吗?
Do you remember the first time he talked to you?

526
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:46,045
你当时在水中吗?  也许你在游泳
Were you in water? Maybe you went swimming.

527
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:52,092
那是我的浸礼
It was my baptism.

528
01:06:54,887 --> 01:06:58,557
我爸爸  他把我按入水底
My father, he pushed me under.

529
01:07:02,603 --> 01:07:04,939
我当时几乎心脏病发
I think I had some kind of seizure.

530
01:07:06,982 --> 01:07:12,404
我以为我要淹死了  大家只是袖手旁观
I think I was drowning, and everybody just looked at me.

531
01:07:15,783 --> 01:07:18,577
没有人救我  没有人
Nobody helped me. Nobody.

532
01:07:20,204 --> 01:07:22,373
除了他
Except him.

533
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,544
我爸爸
My father...

534
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:33,801
那晚带我回家  打断了我三条肋骨
...he took me home that night and he broke three of my ribs...

535
01:07:33,968 --> 01:07:37,429
打裂了我的下颚
...and fractured my jaw.

536
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,101
当时我只有六岁
I was 6 years old.

537

- Is she okay? - Yeah, I think she is.

676
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,344
他妈的  你能帮我脱掉这个吗?
Can you get me out of this fucking suit?

677
01:24:32,944 --> 01:24:34,487
我接个电话
Let me get this.

678
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:40,326
- 我是高尔  - 高尔  我是彼得
- Yeah, Cole here. - Cole, it's Novak.

679
01:24:40,493 --> 01:24:41,536
情况怎么样?
Yeah, what's up?

680
01:24:41,703 --> 01:24:43,538
下去地窖  史卡莱的工作室
I want you to go down to the basement...

681
01:24:43,705 --> 01:24:46,583
你在那里打给我
...at Stargher's workplace and call me when you get down there.

682
01:24:46,749 --> 01:24:48,709
- 他们还在调查  - 别理他妈的调查
- They haven't finished the grid. - Fuck the grid.

683
01:24:48,751 --> 01:24:50,591
- 去那里打给我  - 你没事吧?
- Call me when you get there. - RAMSEY: You okay?

684
01:24:50,712 --> 01:24:52,171
- 没事  - 想告诉我发生什么事吗?
- I'm fine. - What happened in there?

685
01:24:52,338 --> 01:24:55,383
- 妈的  - 你痛吗?
- Oh, fuck. - You in pain?

686
01:24:56,509 --> 01:24:58,803
- 发生什么事?  - 他妈的  我见到她了
- What happened, Peter? - Fuck. I saw her.

01:24:58,970 --> 01:25:00,346
- 你见到谁?  - 我知道去哪里找她
- Who? - I know where to find her.

688
01:25:00,513 --> 01:25:02,682
- 谁?  - 茱莉  我知道她在哪里  我见到她
- Who? - Julia. I know where to find her.

689
01:25:02,849 --> 01:25:05,852
你为什么不让靳医生看你一下?
Okay. Why don't you come and, uh, let Dr. Kent have a look at you?

690
01:25:06,019 --> 01:25:07,020
彼得?
Pete?

691
01:25:08,354 --> 01:25:10,481
- 高尔?  - 我是高尔
- Cole? - Yeah, this is Cole. Uh...

692
01:25:10,648 --> 01:25:12,191
我下来这里干嘛?
Now, what am I doing down here?

693
01:25:12,358 --> 01:25:14,485
那张他用的铁床  上面有座吊车
That machine that he uses, there's a hoist.

694
01:25:14,652 --> 01:25:16,321
我想让你
I want you to look for a, uh, plaque...

695
01:25:16,487 --> 01:25:18,823
找一块金属板  上面有商标的
...or a metal plate with some sort of logo on it.

696
01:25:21,701 --> 01:25:22,869
我找到了
Yeah, I got it.

697
01:25:23,036 --> 01:25:26,581
写着雕刻家工业用品
Uh, it's Carver industrial equipment...

698
01:25:26,748 --> 01:25:29,584
地址是加洲贝加士菲市
...in, uh, Bakersfield, California.

699
01:25:29,751 --> 01:25:32,420
我要你尽量找出
Okay. I want you to find out every goddamn thing...

700
01:25:32,587 --> 01:25:34,005
那机器的资料
...that you can about that machine.

701
01:25:34,172 --> 01:25:35,882
用家  卖家  买家
Who used it, who sold it, who bought it.

702
01:25:36,049 --> 01:25:37,550
尽量找
Just find out everything you can.

703
01:25:37,717 --> 01:25:40,178
我待会在直升机打给你
I'm gonna call you from the chopper in about 20 minutes.

704
01:25:41,054 --> 01:25:43,181
让我看看  很好
MIRIAM: All right, let me have a look. Good.

705
01:25:44,223 --> 01:25:45,475
很好
That's good.

706
01:25:46,434 --> 01:25:49,103
- 那联邦密探走了  - 什么?
- HENRY: The FBI has left the building. - What?

707
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:51,356
我还没检查彼得啊
I haven't had a chance to clear Novak!

708
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:53,066
你想我怎样?
HENRY: What did you expect me to do?

709
01:25:54,776 --> 01:25:58,655
- 我无法阻止他  - 行了
- HENRY: There's no way I could stop him. - CATHERINE: Go.

710
01:25:58,821 --> 01:26:01,115
- 去检查他吧  我没事  - 你肯定?  让我看看
- I'm okay. Mm-hm. - Are you sure? Let me have a look.

711
01:26:01,282 --> 01:26:02,909
拜托
Come on.

712
01:26:03,076 --> 01:26:04,619
好吧
Okay.

713
01:26:04,786 --> 01:26:05,870
- 好啦  - 好的
- All right. - Okay.

714
01:26:06,037 --> 01:26:07,497
很好
Okay.

715
01:26:15,213 --> 01:26:16,547
说话啊
RAMSEY: Peter, just talk to me.

716
01:26:16,714 --> 01:26:19,384
若那是你的幻觉怎么办?
What if your mind is playing tricks on you?

717
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:23,721
注射了那么多药  那可能是幻觉
They shot you full of drugs, Peter. Who knows if what you saw is real?

718
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:32,605
嘉芙?
Catherine?

719
01:26:33,856 --> 01:26:36,484
嘉芙  开门
Catherine, open this door.

720
01:26:38,361 --> 01:26:39,737
嘉芙
Catherine.

721
01:26:40,613 --> 01:26:42,657
- 我发誓  - 你在干什么?
- CATHERINE: I promise... - HENRY: What are you doing?

722
01:26:42,824 --> 01:26:44,784
- 我要帮你  - 不
- ...I'm gonna help you. HENRY: No.

723
01:26:44,951 --> 01:26:47,495
别摧毁你的事业
Do not jeopardize your career.

724
01:26:47,662 --> 01:26:49,747
这是未经批准的程序  你知道的
You're not authorized to be here, you know that.

725
01:26:50,665 --> 01:26:53,000
这很危险  你为什么要这样做?
It's dangerous. What are you doing?

726
01:27:19,102 --> 01:27:20,000
(不准进入)

727
01:27:23,239 --> 01:27:25,199
- 美琳  - 她在干什么?
- HENRY: Miriam. - What's she doing?

728
01:27:25,366 --> 01:27:28,661
- 你知道她在干什么的  - 我的天
- You know what she's doing. - MIRIAM: For Christ's sake.

729
01:27:29,203 --> 01:27:31,956
嘉芙  天呀
Catherine! Jesus.

730
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:34,460
她更改了密码  你进不去的
HENRY: She's changed the codes. You can't get in.

731
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:35,626
怎么回事
What happened?

732
01:27:35,793 --> 01:27:38,004
- 她逆转了输送器  - 什么意思?
- She reversed the feeds. - RAMSEY: What does that mean?

733
01:27:38,171 --> 01:27:41,340
那程序本来是让她进入他内心的
The process is intended for her to go into his mind.

734
01:27:41,507 --> 01:27:43,968
但现在她要将他带进她的内心
But instead, she's bringing him into hers.

735
01:27:44,552 --> 01:27:46,429
不会吧
Come on!

736
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:21,983
我答应过会回来帮你的
I promised I'd come back and help you.

737
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:27,405
看  我一定会遵守诺言
See, I always keep my promises.

738
01:29:28,906 --> 01:29:32,535
我可以留在这里吗?  跟你一起?
Can I stay here with you?

739
01:29:34,787 --> 01:29:38,916
不  不  甜心  对不起  那样做是不行的
No, honey, I'm sorry. It doesn't work that way.

740
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:42,336
我没有办法
There's nothing I can do about that.

741
01:29:45,006 --> 01:29:46,465
有的
CARL [IN ADULT VOICE]: Yes, there is.

742
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:55,808
在我还是孩子的时候
When I was a little boy...

743
01:29:57,643 --> 01:29:59,896
我发现了一只小鸟
...I found this bird.

744
01:30:01,898 --> 01:30:04,275
它受伤了
And he was injured...

745
01:30:05,443 --> 01:30:08,321
断了一条腿或什么的
...had a broken leg or something.

746
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:14,577
我爸爸知道了这件事
Well, my father found out that I had it.

747
01:30:15,995 --> 01:30:19,373
我知他一定会对它做出可怕的事
And I knew that he would do something horrible to it.

748
01:30:21,417 --> 01:30:22,919
那只是时间问题而已
It was just a matter of time.

749
01:30:24,545 --> 01:30:28,966
所以我在洗碗盆中淹死了它
So I took it to the sink and I held it under.

750
01:30:33,012 --> 01:30:35,264
那对它来说还好一点
It was better for the bird.

751
01:30:37,892 --> 01:30:39,560
我救了它
I saved him.

752
01:30:41,896 --> 01:30:44,398
我不能那样做  卡莱
I can't do that, Carl.

753
01:30:46,609 --> 01:30:47,860
我不会那样做
I won't.

754
01:30:52,031 --> 01:30:53,282
不要紧的
It doesn't matter.

755
01:31:01,582 --> 01:31:02,833
他找到我了
He found me.

756
01:31:06,837 --> 01:31:09,173
他总会找到我的
He always finds me.

757
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:06,105
洛探员  请通话
Agent Novak? Go ahead.

758
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:08,315
- 高尔?  - 我是高尔  听着
- Cole? - COLE: Yeah, Novak, listen to this.

759
01:32:08,482 --> 01:32:10,776
吊车卖了给一个姓斑的人
The hoist was sold to a guy named Bainbridge...

760
01:32:10,943 --> 01:32:13,195
他想在迪兰卢附近开一间机器厂
...who tried to build a machine works out near Delano.

761
01:32:13,362 --> 01:32:17,158
他后来破产  州政府接管了厂房
Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land.

762
01:32:17,324 --> 01:32:19,660
猜猜州政府雇了谁去封闭厂房
And guess who they hire to seal the place up.

763
01:32:19,827 --> 01:32:22,872
- 你在开玩笑  - 不  我不喜欢开玩笑
- Oh, you're fucking kidding me. - No. I'm not the kidding type.

764
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:25,041
是史卡莱
Carl Rudolph Stargher.

765
01:32:25,207 --> 01:32:27,293
- 那在哪里?  - 九十九号公路十号出口
- Where's the land? - Exit 10, off Highway 99.

766
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:29,879
- 我们立即出发  - 我知道在哪里
- We're on our way now. - Got it. I know where that is.

767
01:33:00,034 --> 01:33:02,161
救命
Help! Help me!

768
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:08,793
是这儿了
PILOT: This is the area.

769
01:33:21,305 --> 01:33:24,517
我的世界  我的规则
CATHERINE [THINKING]: My world, my rules.

770
01:34:25,119 --> 01:34:26,412
下手吧
Do it.

771
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:43,429
这不是真实的
It's not real.

772
01:34:56,859 --> 01:35:00,070
我的天  天呀
Me-god boy-

773
01:35:03,449 --> 01:35:07,912
天呀  我的天
Boy me-god.

774
01:35:10,247 --> 01:35:13,000
你无法杀死我的
You cannot kill me.

775
01:36:31,412 --> 01:36:33,205
宝贝  没事的
It's okay.

776
01:36:34,498 --> 01:36:36,125
救我
Save me.

777
01:36:48,721 --> 01:36:50,973
留在这里跟我一起吧
You can stay here with me.

778
01:37:11,118 --> 01:37:13,746
嘿
Hey. Hey!

779
01:37:14,288 --> 01:37:17,166

Hey! It's okay.

780
01:37:17,833 --> 01:37:20,419
没事了  你要离玻璃远一点
It's okay. It's okay. You've gotta back away.

781
01:37:20,878 --> 01:37:25,799
游去后面  去后面  去后面  茱莉
Swim to the back. Back away! Back up from here. Back up!

782
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:54,828
亨利
Henry.

783
01:38:32,616 --> 01:38:33,867
没事的
It's okay.

784
01:38:34,284 --> 01:38:37,121
没事了
Are you okay? You okay?

785
01:38:44,044 --> 01:38:48,006
你没有事了  你安全了  没事了
You're okay. You're okay. Hey. Hey. You're okay.

786
01:40:46,625 --> 01:40:50,003
- 林西探员?  - 我是林西
- MAN [OVER RADIO]: Agent Ramsey? - Yeah, Ramsey.

787
01:40:50,170 --> 01:40:51,421
她来了
MAN: She's here.

788
01:40:52,631 --> 01:40:54,508
好  让她进来
RAMSEY: Okay, let her through.

789
01:41:04,351 --> 01:41:06,228
外面有人找你
Somebody outside for you.

790
01:41:16,029 --> 01:41:17,281
她来干嘛?
What is she doing here?

791
01:41:18,407 --> 01:41:19,950
她想看看他的家
Said she wanted to see his home.

792
01:41:22,744 --> 01:41:23,996
那真奇怪
NOVAK: It's pretty strange.

793
01:41:24,788 --> 01:41:26,081
她还养着他的狗
She's keeping his dog.

794
01:41:26,248 --> 01:41:28,417
真他妈的奇怪
Pretty fucking strange is par for the course.

795
01:41:40,095 --> 01:41:42,556
我几乎认不出你
I almost didn't recognize you.

796
01:41:42,723 --> 01:41:44,891
你何时恢复平民身份?
How long do you get to be a civilian?

797
01:41:45,058 --> 01:41:46,518
几星期
A couple weeks...

798
01:41:46,685 --> 01:41:50,564
待案件结束后  再看看怎样
...until after the inquiry and see what happens.

799
01:41:53,525 --> 01:41:56,111
林西告诉我  你想...
Ramsey told me you were thinking of, uh...

800
01:41:56,278 --> 01:41:57,988
那个叫什么?
What do you call that thing?

801
01:41:58,530 --> 01:42:00,032
- 逆转  - 逆转
- Reversal? - Reversal.

802
01:42:00,198 --> 01:42:02,826
- 跟那个在协助的孩子吗?  - 是的  他叫艾华
- With the, uh, kid you were working with? - Yeah. Edward.

803
01:42:02,993 --> 01:42:04,286
艾华
Edward.

804
01:42:04,953 --> 01:42:06,913
你肯定你想这么做吗?
Are you sure you wanna do that?

805
01:42:08,457 --> 01:42:09,875
绝对肯定
Absolutely.

806
01:42:11,752 --> 01:42:15,672
你不担心会发生什么事吗?
You're not worried about what might happen?

807
01:42:16,923 --> 01:42:19,760
我永远不会做伤害艾华的事
I would never do anything to hurt Edward.

808
01:42:21,845 --> 01:42:24,473
我不是担心他
It wasn't him I was worried about.

809
01:42:26,642 --> 01:42:28,644
你呢?  你好吗?
What about you? How are you?

810
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:30,562
我不大肯定
