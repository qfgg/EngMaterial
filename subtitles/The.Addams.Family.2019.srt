00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,450
帕格斯利来了
Here's Pugsley!

154
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,260
好了  儿子  够了
All right, son. That's enough.

155
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,600
最近他们爆炸的速度真快
They blow up so fast these days.

156
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,820
别逼我上去抓你
Don't make me come up there!

157
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,750
最后警告你一次
This is your last warning!

158
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,010
我的头
My head.

159
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,900
帕格斯利  我们本该练剑术的
Pugsley, we're supposed to be working on your swordplay.

160
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,030
你的马刀玛祖卡舞仪式就在两周后
Your Sabre Mazurka is two weeks away,

161
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,240
而你几乎没有练习过
and you've barely practiced at all.

162
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,450
我少练了一次而已  有什么大不了
So I missed one practice. What's the big deal?

163
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,160
大不了
The big deal?

164
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,960
马刀玛祖卡舞仪式是年轻人生命中
The Sabre Mazurka is the most important day

165
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,080
最重要的一天
in a young man's life.

166
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,710
是成为亚当斯族人的标志
It's what makes you an Addams.

167
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,670
那一天  你的整个家族将围绕着你
It's the day your entire family gathers around you

168
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,910
判定你身为人的价值
and passes judgment on your worth as a human being.

169
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,720
听说和感恩节很像
I hear it's like Thanksgiving.

170
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,640
但舞剑太过时了
But swords are so old-fashioned.

171
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,390
我喜欢爆破
I'm more of a demolitions man.

172
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,970
玛祖卡舞中没有炸药的位置
Explosives have no place in a Mazurka.

173
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,250
交出来
Hand them over.

174
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,920
全部
All of them.

175
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,260
还有三硝基甲苯
And the TNT.

176
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,140
还有M-80炸药
And the M-80s.

177
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,140
烟火筒  摔炮  手榴弹
Roman candles. Bang snaps. Holy Hand Grenades.

178
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,740
儿子
Son,

179
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,910
我们家族已经有十三年没有齐聚一堂了
our family hasn't been all together in 13 years.

180
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,910
他们从世界各地到这里
They are coming from all over the world

181
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,250
见证你的大日子
to see you on your special day.

182
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,360
我只是希望一切顺利
I just want it to go perfectly.

183
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,300
好吧  老爸  我练剑
All right, Pop. I'll practice.

184
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,700
这才是我儿子
That's my boy.

185
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,960
腐败
Putrid.

186
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,180
令人震惊
Horrifying.

187
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,420
脾是我的
I call spleen.

188
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,650
星期三
Wednesday.

189
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,320
请不要把墨点留在桌子上
Please, no ink stains on the table.

190
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,630
好的  母亲
Yes, Mother.

191
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,530
戈麦斯  收到玛祖卡舞仪式邀请函的人
Gomez, everyone we've invited

192
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,320
都威胁我们要来出席
to the Mazurka has threatened to come.

193
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,390
我就知道  是不是很棒
I know. Isn't it wonderful?

194
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:29,080
亚当斯家族成员齐聚一堂
All Addamses under one roof again.

195
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,330
是的  但是他们睡在哪里
Yes, but where will everyone sleep?

196
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,710
我们让勒奇修整墓地了
We'll have Lurch fix up the mausoleum.

197
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,740
可以把那里当成露营地
It'll be like sleepaway camp.

198
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,950
很好  亲爱的
Very well, darling.

199
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,640
费斯特叔叔
Uncle Fester!

200
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,370
兄弟
Brother!

201
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,560
别担心  我没事
Don't worry, I'm okay.

202
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,920
平板玻璃阻碍了我的坠落路线
The plate glass window broke my fall.

203
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,900
堆起来  折磨  冲他们吼
Rick'em, rack'em, roar'em, buzz

204
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,970
亚当斯就做亚当斯的事
Addams is as Addams does

205
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,970
你能来我好激动
I am thrilled you're here!

206
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,410
我没有迟到吧
I'm not late, am I?

207
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,270
其实  仪式两周后才会举行
Actually, we weren't expecting you for another two weeks.

208
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,750
所以我没有迟到
So, not late.

209
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,580
我向你道歉  亲爱的
I apologize, darling.

210
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,460
是我请费斯特早点来
You see, I asked Fester to come early

211
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,400
帮助帕格斯利练习玛祖卡舞的
to help Pugsley with his Mazurka practice.

212
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,880
不  不
No! No!

213
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,180
坏猫咪  坏猫咪
Bad Kitty! That's a bad Kitty!

214
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,470
要是我知道你会提前到达
If I'd known you were coming,

215
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,970
就为你准备好地牢了
I would have prepared the dungeon.

216
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,100
请别担心  我可以睡阁楼
Please, don't worry. I'll sleep in the attic.

217
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,920
你甚至感觉不到我在这里
You won't even know I'm here.

218
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:33,420
我练这个很多次了  住过不少人家
I've practiced that move in a lot of people's homes.

219
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,760
叔叔  你可以给我们讲讲门外的世界吗
Uncle, can you tell us what's beyond the gate?

220
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,410
你怎么想问这个问题  宝贝
Why ever would you ask that, dear?

221
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,030
今天早上雾中传来奇怪的声音
I heard a strange noise in the fog earlier,

222
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,580
我想去调查一下
and I should like to investigate.

223
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,830
外面什么都没有  只有无聊的沼泽
There's nothing out there but boring marshland.

224
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,980
一定有什么的  我们从不出门
There must be something. We never go anywhere.

225
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,710
谁知道我们错过了多少未知的恐怖
Who knows the untold horrors we're missing out on.

226
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,800
亲爱的  我们需要的恐怖都在这里了
Darling, we have all the horror we need, right here.

227
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,590
费斯特叔叔想去哪都可以
Uncle Fester can go wherever he likes.

228
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,550
不  不  还是有些限制的
Now, now, there are some restrictions.

229
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,760
我不能去商场
You know, I can't go to the mall,

230
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,060
动物园  或者是...
or a zoo, or a building...

231
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,890
等你长大了
When you're older,

232
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,770
就可以随心所欲去旅行了
you can travel to your heart's content.

233
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,590
但现在  你待在这里更安全
But for now, it's safer for you here.

234
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,970
苏格拉底  走
Socrates, come.

235
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,190
...南美洲  欧洲  中国
...South America, Europe, China,

236
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,030
亚洲  非洲的大部分地方
Asia, most parts of Africa.

237
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,020
我可以去南极洲
I'm allowed in Antarctica!

238
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,780
您正在收看的是《家  艺术与园艺》节目
You're watching Home, Art and Garden television.

239
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,140
世界如此之大  无数可怜人
The world's a big place, full of poor souls

240
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,220
不懂搭接接头是什么东西
who don't know the difference between shiplap and Shinola.

241
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,000
让我来帮助你们
Well, I'm here to help.

242
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,230
我会将你们毫无创意的家
I take your uninspired living space

243
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,630
变成你们梦想中的完美宫殿
and turn it into the perfect palace of your dreams.

244
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:03,760
无论你家的设计有多老土  我都能帮你
No matter how outdated your design sense, I can help you.

245
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,820
我唯一的缺点
My only flaw?

246
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,180
就是过分关心
Sometimes I care too much.

247
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,740
我是玛尔戈·尼德勒
I'm Margaux Needler,

248
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,610
为您带来《设计干预》

253
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,760
同化镇
Assimilation.

254
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,920
我们不仅是改造一所房子
We didn't just make over a house.

255
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,390
{\an8}欢迎来到同化镇

256

264
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,060
心动吗  我看是的

准备彩排
Let's set up for the walk-through.

272
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,210
玛尔戈  你感觉可以吗
Margaux, did that feel good to you?

273
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,260
不可以  格伦
No, Glenn.

274
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,880
还需要更多气球和五彩纸屑
We need more balloons, more confetti.

275
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,720
-收到  -我们卖的是什么

美梦  知道美梦是怎么产生的吗

279
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,180
我还要一场五彩纸屑暴风雪
And I want a blizzard of confetti.

280
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,810
暴风雪要足够大
I want so much confetti that we need

281
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,810
大到需要出动雪警去找孩子
snow patrols to find lost children.

282
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,190
我把我的家庭改造帝国都赌在这个小镇上了
I bet my home improvement empire on this town.

283
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,260
所有房子都要卖出去  否则我们就要失业了
Every house must sell or we're out of business!

You're never gonna believe this.

286
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,130
什么  派克
What is it, Parker?

287
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,650
我在山上发现了一所诡异的豪宅
I found a creepy mansion up on the hill!

288
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,370
我很欣慰你出去探险了  派克
I'm so glad you're exploring, Parker,

289
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,590
但我现在没时间闲聊  亲爱的
but I don't have time to talk right now, sweetheart.

290
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,160
妈妈需要去帮助他人
Mama needs to help people.

291
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,930
我需要帮助  我就不是他人吗
I need help. Aren't I people?

292
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,130
你真可爱
Oh, you're cute.

293
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,270
你下午不是要去薯条店打工吗
Don't you have Chipper 'N' Cheer practice this afternoon?

294
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,450
去吧  宝贝
Run along, honey.

295
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,450
格伦  收视率预期是多少
Now, Glenn, what are the numbers we're expecting?

296
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,910
-你看这里...  -妈妈
- Well, if you look here... - Mom!

297
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,240
左边一点  上去一点
Left a bit. Up a bit.

298
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,670
下去一点
Now, down a bit.

299
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,860
完美
Perfect.

300
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:14,060
三  二  一
And three, two, one...

301
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,690
你害我没射中
You made me miss!

302
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,490
你知道我蓄力了多久吗
Do you know how long it took for me to set this up?

303
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,450
听我说  帕格斯利
Look, Pugsley...

304
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:30,080
你就要表演玛祖卡舞了  而你还没准备好
Your Mazurka's coming up, and, well, you're not ready.

305
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,880
即使只有我注意到了这一点
Even if I am the only one who sees it.

306
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,140
注意听
So, pay attention,

307
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,850
说不定你可以蒙混过关
and you might actually get through this.

308
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,940
等等
Wait.

309
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,750
你要帮我
You're going to help me?

310
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,500
为什么
Why?

311
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,530
因为你是我弟弟
Because you are my brother.

312
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:49,520
我爱你
And... I love you.

313
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,740
好吧  你打算怎么帮我
All right. How are you gonna help me?

314
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,430
看到那边那个洞了吗
You see that hole over there?

315
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,170
站到它旁边去
Go stand beside it.

316
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,080
那个洞吗
That hole?

317
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,240
那个洞
That hole.

318
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,330
我不明白
I don't get it.

319
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,920
亲爱的  不是我挑剔
Darling, not to criticize,

320
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,680
但你已经尽力压紧了吗
but is that really as tight as you can make it?

321
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,180
抱歉  戈麦斯
I'm sorry, Gomez.

322
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,480
我只是因为准备玛祖卡舞有点分心
I'm just a bit preoccupied with the Mazurka preparations.

323
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
我也是
Oh, I am as well!

324
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,480
我怕帕格斯利过于自信
I fear Pugsley is overconfident

325
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,370
不能真正明白
and doesn't truly understand

326
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,050
这项传统的重要性
the importance of this tradition.

327
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,060
好消息  帕格斯利不见了
Good news, everybody. Pugsley's gone.

328
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,620
星期三  我知道你的把戏
Wednesday, I know that tone of voice.

329
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,760
把你弟弟挖出来  马上去
Dig up your brother. At once.

330
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,570
基因库都被你们削弱了
You're weakening the gene pool.

331
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,510
等等
Hold on.

332
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,750
你手里拿着什么
What do you have there?

333
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,010
我不确定  我喜欢这个
I'm not sure. I like it.

334
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:00,240
非常...怎么说  伤心的反义词
It's so... What's the word? The opposite of sad?

335
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,610
亲爱的  把它给我
Darling, bring that to me.

336
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,360
奇怪  通常这东西的另一端
Strange, there's usually a murderous clown

337
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,890
应该系着一个凶残的小丑
attached to the other end of these.

338
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,690
星期三  别动
Wednesday, don't move!

339
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,770
我的天  这到底是什么
What, in the name of all that is unholy, is that?

340
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,850
味道像棉花糖
It tastes like cotton candy.

341
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,740
你怎么知道棉花糖的味道
How do you know what cotton candy tastes like?

342
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,230
蒂西  那是我年轻时犯的错
Tish, it was my youth. I made mistakes.

343
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,120
星期三  这粉色的东西是哪来的
Wednesday, wherever did this pink thing come from?

344
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,050
外面
Outside.

345
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,710
到处都是
They're everywhere.

346
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,910
我从没见过这么奇怪的天气
Strangest weather system I've ever seen.

347
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:52,170
这是什么  哪来的
What is that? Where's it coming from?

348
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,140
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait.

349
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,870
雾升起来了
The fog, it's lifting.

350
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,550
这种情况只可能是因为...
Well, that would only happen if...

351
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:01,900
有人把沼泽排空了  是谁呢
Someone drained the marsh. But who?

352
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,620
一座小镇  这可不妙
A town. This is not good.

353
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,820
我们必须马上下去
We must go down there

354
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,980
介绍我们自己
and introduce ourselves at once.

355
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:14,160
今天真是混乱得令人高兴
This day is becoming most wonderfully disruptive.

356
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,070
我们继续彩排  好吗
Let's keep going with the run-through, okay?

357
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,050
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

358
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,130
我非常高兴带你们参观我家
I'm so delighted to show you my house.

359
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,360
你们也可以拥有这样的家  只是没这么大
You can own one just like it, just less large.

360
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,140
之类之类的  灯台  吊顶
Blah, blah, blah. Sconces, crown molding.

361
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,350
接着我们就来到了重要的客厅
Which leads us to what I call the Salon de Grandé.

362
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,180
穿过这里  转弯  然后说
Cross here, turn, and then say something like,

363
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,150
"在我向你们展示风景之前
"Now, before I show you this view,

364
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,900
先去古董商店
go to an antique store,

365
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,320
买一把椅子  重装椅面
buy a chair, and reupholster it.

366
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,650
因为这美景需要坐下来欣赏"
'Cause you're gonna wanna sit down for this."

367
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,900
怎么了  怎么回事
What? What's the matter?

368
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,370
拜托  到底怎么了
For heaven's sake, what's going on?

369
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,710
我的牙上有东西吗  到底怎么了
Do I have something in my teeth? What is it?

370
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,220
都没有带滴水兽的房子
Not a single gargoyle.

371
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,110
或许这也不算是坏事
Maybe this isn't such a bad thing.

372
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,280
我们已经与世隔绝了好久
We have been isolated here for a while.

373
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,200
我可以预料到自己死于这里
I could really see myself dying here.

374
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,110
乖点  基蒂
Play nice, Kitty.

375
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,370
没人拿着火把和叉子
Well, no one is running at us

376
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,300
追我们  这是一个加分点
with torches and pitchforks, so that's a plus.

377
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,480
亲爱的  我们应该不用
You know, darling, I don't think we'll need

378
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,470
安排家人去陵墓了
to put the family in the mausoleum.

379
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,050
他们可以住在这里
They can stay here!

380
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,430
那他们绝对会不自在
The family would never be comfortable.

381
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,310
这里要过好多年
It will be years

382
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,360
才会腐败和衰落
before rust and decay set in.

383
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,290
你好
How you doing?

384
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,390
一切都...不一样
It's all so... different.

385
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,310
帕格斯利  别都喝光了
Pugsley, don't drink it all.

386
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,080
这位先生也想喝点
This gentleman wants some, too.

387
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,910
先生  没关系的
Sir, it's all right.

388
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,920
他已经喝完了
He's had all his shots!

389
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,370
这人真是神经兮兮
What a nervous man.

390
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,300
走吧  蒂西  我们去附近转转
Come on, Tish, let's explore the neighborhood.

391
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,000
我去逛两分钟
I'm gonna pop in here for two minutes

392
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,480
我们镇广场再见  好吗
and I'll meet you in the town square. Agreed?

393
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,210
很好  亲爱的
Very well, darling.

394
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,670
大家好啊
Good day, all.

395
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,490
我可不想打扰你们喝咖啡
Don't let me interrupt your cup of joe

396
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,520
或者什么别的
or whoever you have in there.

397
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,060
有什么像我一样黑暗苦涩的选择吗
So, what's dark and bitter here other than yours truly?

398
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,970
我们有马达加斯加翡翠圆豆
We have the Madagascar Emerald Peaberry,

399
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,550
夏季广藿烘焙
in a summer patchouli roast.

400
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:26,790
有橡木  樱桃与瑜伽风味
It has notes of oak, cherry, and yoga.

401
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,240
我想要点风味浓烈的
Hmm. You know, I'm looking for something a bit stronger.

402
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,800
给我试试那个吧
Ah! Let me try that.

403
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,610
莫蒂西亚  来尝尝这些咖啡渣
Mmm! Morticia, you have to try these coffee grounds.

404
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,090
颗粒感真的很棒
They have a wonderful grit!

405
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,590
等等  什么声音

418
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,270
这应该是音乐
I believe that is supposed to be music.

419
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,130
他们在唱一首传统歌曲
They're greeting us with

420

来欢迎我们
one of their traditional songs.

那我们也应该回敬一首
Well, then, we ought to do the same.

434
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,900
怎么  我做了什么
What? What'd I do?

435
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,240
真无礼
How rude.

436
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,360
戈麦斯  我们应该回家
Gomez, we should return home.

437
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,430
莫蒂西亚  这里不是原来那个乡下
Morticia, this is not the old country.

438
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,940
没错  这些人有点不一样
True, these people are a little different.

439
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,370
但内心深处我们都一样
But deep down, we're all the same.

440
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,680
我们必须给他们机会  了解他们
We have to give them a chance. Get to know them.

441
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,160
我们得赢得他们的欢迎
We have to win them over.

442
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,640
"赢得他们的欢迎"
"Win them over"?

443
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,000
早上好  邻居
Well, good morning, neighbor!

444
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,580
玛尔戈·尼德勒
Margaux Needler.

445
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,000
戈麦斯·亚当斯  为你效劳
Gomez Addams. At your service.

446
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,520
这是我妻子莫蒂西亚
My wife, Morticia.

447
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,430
很荣幸
Charmed.

448
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:39,590
我们的孩子星期三和帕格斯利
Our children, Wednesday, Pugsley.

449
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,340
还有我兄弟费斯特
And my brother, Fester.

450
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,180
邻居好
Hey, neighbor!

451
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,670
知道吗  我们可以看到你的房间
You know, we can see right into your windows?

452
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,670
很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you.

453
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,550
作为你们的邻居  我想给你们
As your neighbor, I'd like to offer you

454
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,820
一个千载难逢的机会
the opportunity of a lifetime.

455
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,860
你们想要世界知名室内设计师
How'd you like a free home makeover

456
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,740
给你们的家免费大改造吗
from a world-renowned interior designer?

457
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,810
这确实有点难度
It will be a challenge,

458
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,410
但我能快速翻新你们的旧房子
but I can beautify that old house of yours so fast,

459
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,710
快得让你们晕头转向
it'll make your head spin.

460
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,520
不想吹牛
I don't wanna brag,

461
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,560
但我的头已经会转了  瞧
but mine already does that. Look.

462
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:11,350
我想看看这个整容女能提供什么
I should like to see what this plastic woman has to offer.

463
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,260
好吧  什么时候方便拜访
Yes, well... When is a good time to stop by?

464
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,160
事实上  尼德勒女士
Actually, Ms. Needler...

465
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,410
亲爱的
Darling...

466
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,910
随时欢迎
Stop by anytime you'd like.

467
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,920
好极了  那就这么定了
Wonderful! Then it's settled.

468
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,680
我明天一大早就去拜访你们
I'll see you at your house, first thing tomorrow.

469
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,090
提前说声不用谢  回见
You're welcome in advance! Ta!

470
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,050
那女人似乎精神错乱
That woman seems deranged.

471
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,140
她的脸让我想到一张死亡面具
Her face reminds me of a death mask.

472
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,530
"精神错乱"  "死亡面具"
"Deranged"? "Death mask"?

473
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,730
你告诉我她有口臭
You tell me she's got halitosis,

474
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,720
我就娶定她了
and I'm hearing wedding bells!

475
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:59,370
帕格斯利  这是亚当斯家族的马刀
Pugsley, this is the Addams family saber.

476
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,080
三百年来亚当斯族人
300 years of Addams

477
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,860
都手持这把马刀跳玛祖卡舞
have danced the Mazurka with this blade.

478
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,750
你要先做好准备
Only when you've shown me you're ready.

479
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:14,920
你父亲是亚当斯家族最伟大的武士
Your father was the greatest swordsman in Addams history.

480
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,710
他的玛祖卡舞堪称传奇
His Mazurka was the stuff of legends.

481
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,000
所以别有压力
So no pressure!

482
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,370
都在这里  这本玛祖卡舞手册中
It's all right here, in the Mazurka handbook.

483
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,590
每个亚当斯都通过这个仪式
Every Addams performs this rite of passage

484
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:32,070
证明自己做好了捍卫家庭的准备
to show that you're prepared to defend your family.

485
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,360
听起来简单  但相信我  其实特别难
It sounds easy, but believe me, it's insane!

486
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,670
费斯特  给他那把咕咕嘎嘎婴儿训练用刀
Fester, hand him the goo-goo-ga-ga baby training sword.

487
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,000
爸爸
Pop?

488
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,730
有人没学会玛祖卡舞吗
Has anyone ever failed the Mazurka?

489
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,940
有一次  你三代堂兄山德
Once. Your third cousin, Xander.

490
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,960
从没听过他
Never heard of him.

491
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,300
那就对了
Exactly.

492
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,750
音乐
Music!

493
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,410
门口有人
There's someone at the door.

494
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,020
大家好  我要进这座诡异的房子
Hi, guys. I'm going up to this creepy mansion.

495
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:58,770
{\an8}直播

496
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,150
如果三十分钟后没有消息  派人来支援
If you don't hear from me in 30 minutes, send backup.

497
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:14,070
你按了门铃吗
You rang?

498
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,810
好吧  不行
Yeah, no.

499
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,820
生命太短暂  再见
Life's too short. See ya!

500
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,630
早上好  基蒂
Good morning, Kitty.

501
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,100
你好  尼德勒女士
Greetings, Ms. Needler.

502
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:38,180
早上好  希望我没有打扰你们
Good morning! I hope this isn't a bad time.

503
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,190
打扰到了  请进
The worst. Do come in.

504
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,190
格伦
Glenn?

505
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,690
欢迎来到这里
Welcome to the neighborhood.

506
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:47,800
谢谢
Thank you.

507
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,190
老天
Oh, my!

508
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:54,430
准备好迎接玛尔戈大改装了吗
Are you ready for your Margaux makeover?

509
00:32:51,860 --> 00:33:01,010
{\an8}录制

510
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,250
相当
Quite.

511
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,900
帕格斯利期待得一直爬墙
Pugsley's been climbing the walls in anticipation.

512
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,160
不错不错
Well, well, well!

513
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,180
我们四处看看吧
Let's take a look around, shall we?

514
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:10,080
你们什么也别说  不客气
And before you say anything, you're welcome.

515
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,240
如果想让这里更加现代
Now, if we're trying for a more contemporary look,

516
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,150
这些壁式烛台必须去掉
well, these sconces have to go.

517
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,430
壁式烛台是死去亲人送的礼物
The sconces were a gift from dead relatives.

518
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,490
如果去掉它们
If we get rid of them,

519
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:26,570
他们下次来会很伤心的
they'll be terribly hurt the next time they visit.

520
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,960
这是我们的牢骚窖
And this is our whine cellar.

521
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,960
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}和"酒窖"谐音

522
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,580
我们收藏的牢骚特别棒
We have a lovely collection of whines.

523
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,450
-还没到吗  -我要冰淇淋
- Are we there yet? - I want ice cream!

524
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,000
你说牛油果吐司没了是什么意思
What do you mean you're out of avocado toast?

525
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,150
这桶让我显得肥
This barrel makes me look fat.

526
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,090
这是我们的无底洞
And here's our bottomless pit.

527
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,810
我们怎么穿过去
How do we get across?

528
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:46,920
等一下
One moment.

529
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,840
我们称这为"网上冲浪"
We call this surfing the web.

530
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,480
好吧
Well!

531
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:09,920
我害怕
I'm scared.

532
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,860
我好害怕
I'm so scared.

533
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,870
天啊
Oh, my gosh.

534
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,750
我害怕闭上眼
I'm scared to close my eyes.

535
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,060
我害怕睁开眼
I'm scared to open them.

536
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,440
那么多人是怎么塞进这个小装置的
How do all those people fit in that little contraption?

537
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:45,650
我的化妆镜一次只能囚禁十四个灵魂
My vanity mirror only imprisons 14 souls at a time.

538
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,620
你没有手机吗
You don't have a cell phone?

539
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,130
真奇怪
That's weird.

540
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,360
我或许没有手机
I may not have a cell phone...

541
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,560
你也没有弩
Well, you don't have a crossbow,

542
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,980
我还以为大家都有呢
and I thought everybody had one of those.

543
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,890
我叫星期三
My name is Wednesday.

544
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:02,780
好吧
Okay.

545
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,890
我是派克  你在这里住多久了
I'm Parker. How long have you lived here?

546
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,250
我这一生  感觉十分漫长
My whole life. Which seems endless.

547
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,210
我在学校从没见过你
I've never seen you at school.

548
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,490
我在笼子里上学
I'm cage-schooled.

549
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,700
-什么  -超级无趣
- Excuse me? - It's terribly dull,

550
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,610
但我妈妈坚持那样
but my mother insists.

551
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,530
其实我现在要脱笼了
I'm actually cutting cage right now.

552
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,230
好吧
Okay.

553
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,540
你的学校都有什么
So, what happens at your school?

554
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,830
没什么  就朋友反目
Not much, just friends turning on each other.

555
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,720
一些女孩让另一些女孩感到自卑
Girls making other girls feel bad about themselves.

556
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,230
典型的初中生活
Typical junior high stuff.

557
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,260
有趣
Intriguing.

558
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,750
人人都能去你们学校吗
Can anyone go to your school?

559
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,720
我想是的  但谁会想去
I guess so. But who'd want to?

560
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,750
星期三
Wednesday!

561
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,780
准头不错
Great shot!

562
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,180
亚当斯先生和太太
Mr. and Mrs. Addams,

563
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,790
把这里变得完美要做的并不多
there's really not much to do to make this place perfect.

564
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:16,050
我们只需拆掉侧墙
All we have to do is pull down the side walls,

565
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,380
还要拆除其他两面墙
and then also break down the other two walls.

566
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:24,300
不可逆地拆除天花板
Open up the ceiling by breaking it irreversibly.

567
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,390
把这讨厌的地板弄走
Just get this nasty little floor out of the way,

568
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,700
就好了
and there you go.

569
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,020
只需这些变动...
With just those little touches...

570
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,800
停下  不许动
Stop! Right there!

571
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,130
什么也不要碰
Don't touch another thing!

572
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:39,430
真是完美  尼德勒女士  你真有天赋
It's perfect. Ms. Needler, you have a gift.

573
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:42,040
好消息是我能叫装修队
The good news is I can have a makeover crew up here

574
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,560
明天一早就来这里动工
and swinging hammers first thing in the morning.

575
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,780
你们觉得呢
What do you say?

576
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,820
我们以为你改完了
We thought you were finished.

577
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,900
我们整个家族两周后要来
Our whole family is coming in two weeks.

578
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,890
我们的大结局
Our finale!

579
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,680
我们的大结局也在两周后
Our finale is in two weeks.

580
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,040
谢谢你  格伦
Thank you, Glenn.

581
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,010
尼德勒女士  你的好意我们心领了
It's a gracious offer, Ms. Needler,

582
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,650
但你做的已经够多了
but you really have done enough.

583
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,080
我们儿子要跳玛祖卡舞  你应该理解
It's our son's Mazurka. You understand.

584
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,940
谢谢
Thank you.

585
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:09,580
米奇不见了
We're missing Mitch.

586
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,540
他在哪
Where's Mitch?

587
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:15,680
出去
Get out!

588
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,290
米奇是谁
Mitch who?

589
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,550
戈麦斯  我直说了
Gomez, I'll be blunt.

590
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,730
下面那小区我有五十栋房子要卖
I have 50 houses to sell down there,

591
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:29,650
从那里看到你的房子
and their view of your property is, well,

592
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,470
有点掉价
off-brand.

593
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:34,460
-五十栋房子  -是的
- Fifty houses? - Yes.

594
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:35,970
自从我的家族
You know, ever since my family

595
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,150
从故乡被赶出来
was chased out from the old country,

596
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,530
我唯一的梦想就是
my one dream has been

597
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:43,100
找到一个能称为家的地方
to find a place we could call home.

598
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,010
一旦他们看到同化镇
Once they see Assimilation,

599
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,310
他们应该会想要永远留下
I think they'll want to stay for good.

600
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:53,880
非常感谢你前来  玛目布伦
Thank you so much for coming by, Membrane.

601
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,270
我叫玛尔戈
It's Margaux!

602
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,510
那好  逃吧  玛尔戈
Well then, run, Margaux!

603
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,580
跑  跑  跑
Run, run, run!

604
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,320
那个叫星期三的女孩是怪胎
That Wednesday girl is a freak.

605
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,520
我们即将被一大群怪胎入侵
We're about to be invaded by a whole army of freaks.

606
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,800
总有人接受不了自己急需帮助  真是可悲
It's tragic when people can't accept the help they so badly need.

607
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,390
出现这种情况
And when that happens,

608
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:21,690
就需要另一种介入了
well, another kind of intervention is called for.

609
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,150
我同意  戈麦斯
I agree, Gomez.

610
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:28,190
整个家族搬来这里会是美梦成真
The whole family moving here would be a dream come true.

611
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,260
但我不相信那个叫玛尔戈的
But I don't trust that Margaux woman.

612
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,570
她是个怪人  亲爱的  给她个机会
She's an eccentric, darling, give her a chance.

613
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:37,350
"覆盆子果酱"
"Rasp-berry preserves."

614
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,750
肯定是某种芳香防腐剂
Must be some kind of scented embalming fluid.

615
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,780
星期三  别找你父亲练习潜伏了
Wednesday, practice your lurking on someone other than your father.

616
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,980
一点挑战都没有
He's too easy.

617
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,270
好多了
Much better.

618
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,090
母亲  父亲  我想和你们谈谈
Mother, Father, I'd like to speak with you.

619
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:57,670
你想说什么  我的小夜行者
What's on your mind, my little nightcrawler?

620
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,470
我下午和派克聊天了
I spoke with Parker this afternoon.

621
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:03,400
她是今天来的那个活体模型的女儿
She's the daughter of that talking mannequin who came by.

622
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,100
她跟我说了一个公立学校
She told me about a communal school

623
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,980
附近所有小孩都去那里上学
all the neighborhood children attend.

624
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,670
叫什么"初中"
It's called "Junior high."

625
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,270
"初中"
"Junior high"...

626
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,770
对了  我在异常心理学期刊上
Yes, yes, I have read about those

627
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,060
读到过
in my abnormal psycholog journals.

628
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,000
任何适龄的小孩都能入学
Anyone of age can enroll.

629
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,830
我觉得这对我有好处
I think it would be good for me.

630
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,480
我认为这是个很好的主意
Well, I think it's a capital idea.

631
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,900
那你在家里的学习怎么办
What of your studies here?

632
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,790
你的标本剥制术进步非常大
Your taxidermy is coming along so well.

633
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,090
母亲  你真的要剥夺我
Mother, would you really deprive me

634
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:35,720
折磨同龄人的机会吗
of the opportunity to torment children my own age?

635
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,410
她说得有道理
Ah, she makes a point.

636
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,770
而且  星期三去上学了
What's more, with Wednesday in school,

637
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:42,670
我们就能更好地了解这里的人
we'd get to know the people here even better.

638
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,340
怎么样  母亲
Well, Mother?

639
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:54,180
{\an8}同化中学

640
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,820
祝你上学愉快  宝贝
Have a good day at school, dear.

641
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,250
好好搞破坏
Do your worst!

642
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:13,960
我明白了  这是间少年监狱
Ah. Now I understand. This is a children's prison.

643
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,530
那是谁
Who's that?

644
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,520
真"棒"
Great.

645
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,260
这位是星期三
This is Wednesday.

646
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:25,170
你们好
Hello.

647
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,470
派克
Hey, Parker.

648
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,610
有好东西给你
I got something for ya.

649
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,470
一个发霉的三明治
A moldy sandwich?

650
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,400
你退步了  贝瑟妮
You're slipping, Bethany.

651
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,410
你知道吗  你说对了
You know what? You're right.

652
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,990
我们再加点料
Let's kick it up a notch.

653
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,250
你真是一点幽默感都没有
You have no sense of humor!

654
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:54,490
-你看她那张脸  -就是
- Did you see her face? - I know.

655
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,890
你叫贝瑟妮是吗
Bethany, is it?

656
00:40:56,510 --> 00:41:00,240
除非你想和我结梁子  否则别惹我的人
Don't cut your eyes on my crew unless you're ready to dance.

657
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,730
你说什么  小僵尸
What did you say, little ghoul?

658
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:15,170
{\an8}不要忘记给候选人投票

659
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,130
我想你没搞明白
I don't think you understand.

660
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:11,200
并非是我被困在你这里  贝瑟妮
I'm not locked up in here with you, Bethany.

661
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,240
而是你被困在我这里了
You're locked up in here with me.

662
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,310
随便吧
Whatever.

663
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,250
你做了什么
What did you do?

664
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,480
你不该和她那么说的
You shouldn't have said that.

665
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,960
你什么都做不了  贝瑟妮比你受欢迎多了
There's nothing you can do. Bethany's way too popular.

666
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,590
热度都是转瞬即逝的
Popularity is fleeting.

667
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,110
我更想把自己的目光
I prefer to set my sights

668
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:34,940
放在更有挑战性的事情上
on something a little more challenging.

669
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,140
比如什么
Like what?

670
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,360
确立威望
The establishment.

671
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:59,300
我想想  今天穿哪件"马甲"发帖呢
Let's see. Who shall I be today?

You know they're raising a garden of man-eating plants?

他们到底是从哪来的
Where are they from anyways?

687
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,300
那无关紧要
It doesn't matter!

688
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,970
反正他们不属于这
It's obvious they don't belong here.

689

亲爱的  那些住在山顶的坏人
Honey! Oh, those awful people up on the hill.

690
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,040
他们甚至都不上"邻居之窥"
They're not even on Neighborhood Peeps!

691
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,530
那太可疑了
Well, that's suspicious.

692
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,110
如果其他人害怕了  那我也害怕了

00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:04,230
我干过几千次了
I've done this thousands of times.

707
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,600
合闸
Flip the switch!

708
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:44,110
赐予这生灵生命吧
Give my creature life!

709
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,710
活过来  活过来  我命令你  复活
Live! Live, I tell you, live!

710
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,420
青蛙活了  它活过来了
It's alive! It's alive!

711
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:35,310
我的天  我的老天  把它们弄走
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Get them off me!

712
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,720
僵尸青蛙
Zombie frogs!

713
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,940
贝瑟妮换造型了
Bethany's changed her look.

714
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:49,540
这很适合她
It suits her.

715
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:52,100
太棒了  这简直太棒了
Awesome. Totally awesome.

716
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,490
能看到你
It is an honor...

717
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,570
大显身手
...and a privilege...

718
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:55,870
是我们的荣幸
...to watch you work.

719
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,490
你想去逛商场吗
Hey. Do you wanna go to the mall?

720
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:01,630
为什么不呢  我好久没见过像样的大扫荡了
Why not? I haven't seen a good mauling in ages.

721
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:26,210
很晚了  我很担心
It's late. I'm worried.

722
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,650
亲爱的  星期三不会有事的
Darling, Wednesday will be fine.

723
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:30,170
她能照顾好自己
She can take care of herself.

724
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:32,060
我担心的不是星期三
It's not Wednesday I'm worried about.

725
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:35,740
而是其他人  我们可能需要提供不在场证明
It's the rest of them. We may need to provide an alibi.

726
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,190
我的爱  今晚是游戏之夜
My love, it's game night.

727
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:39,290
星期三很快就会回来了
Wednesday will be home soon,

728
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:41,440
你何不来和我们一起玩
so why don't you come and join us?

729
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:45,330
好吧  F-6
Oh, very well. F-6.

730
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,740
帕格斯利  你听到你母亲的话了
Pugsley, you heard your mother.

731
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:49,740
炸掉F-6
Blow F-6!

732
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,620
开火
Fire in the hole!

733
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,350
我是世界之王
I'm king of the world!

734
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:59,190
♪ 无论远近  不管你身在... ♪
♪ Near, far, wherever... ♪

735
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:07,170
成功
Yes!

736
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:09,040
你把我的战船炸沉了
You sunk my battleship.

737
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:11,070
干得漂亮  帕格斯利
Ha-ha! Well done, Pugsley!

738
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:21,790
你们好  我的丑孩子们
Hello, my uglies!

739
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,590
母亲  怪不得刚才起鸡皮疙瘩了
Mother! I thought I felt my skin crawling!

740
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:29,400
孩子他奶奶  这太让人惊喜了
Grandma, what a surprise.

741
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,910
我以为你在布拉格
I thought you were in Prague.

742
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:32,410
我之前是在布拉格
I was!

743
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,680
他们抓到我从动物园偷鳄鱼
They caught me smuggling crocodiles out of the zoo.

744
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,740
不过我逃掉了
But I escaped and talked my way

745
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,130
然后靠耍嘴皮子上了索马里海盗船
onto a Somali pirate ship.

746
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:39,820
我们玩了一局激烈的扑克
We got into a heated poker game

747
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,740
我把的他们钱全赢回来了
and I cleaned them out.

748
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,250
-出老千还是抢劫  -二者兼有
- Cheating or robbery? - Both!

749
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:45,690
帕格斯利  永远记住
Always remember, Pugsley,

750
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:48,830
如果没人逮到你  就不算出千
it ain't cheating if no one catches you.

751
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,200
我都俩礼拜没洗澡了
I haven't bathed in two weeks. Ugh.

752
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:52,620
也许是两个月
Or is it months?

753
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,250
我想起来了
Ha! That reminds me.

754
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,410
猜猜我带了什么  帕格斯利
Guess what I've got, Pugsley?

755
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,640
-糖果  -太棒了
- Candy! - Oh, yes!

756
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,070
玛祖卡舞仪式还要一周才开始
But the Mazurka isn't for a week.

757
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,710
你怎么这么早来了
Why are you here so early?

758
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:05,470
戈麦斯说你需要人帮你准备派对
Gomez said you needed a little help with the party.

759
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:08,620
我想  我为我的儿子备战了玛祖卡舞
And I said, I got my son ready for his Mazurka,

760
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:12,010
那当然我也会为我的孙子出力
so of course, I'm going to do the same for my grandson.

761
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,380
我爱他
I love him!

762
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,370
确实如此  我让她来的
It's true! I sent for her!

763
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:17,240
我难以相信
I can't believe you bothered

764
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,050
你用这事麻烦你母亲  亲爱的
your mother with that, darling.

765
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:20,680
我也不太相信
Neither can I?

766
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,490
他说你脑袋都晕了
He said you were in over your head.

767
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:23,400
我谢谢您了  母亲
Thank you, Mother!

768
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,740
说他从未见过你这么紧张
Said you were more tense than he's ever seen you.

769
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:28,220
-我才没有那么说  -你说了
- I didn't say that exactly. - Yes, you did.

770
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,860
你原话就是那么说的
You said that exactly.

771
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,540
他说很担心你会极度不悦  然后
Said he was worried you'd have a massive facial expression and...

772
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:35,460
行了  我饿了  我们吃饭吧
You know, I'm starving! Let's eat!

773
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,030
星期三回来了才能吃
Not until Wednesday gets home.

774
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:40,640
我孙女呢
Where is that granddaughter of mine?

775
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:42,680
我给她带东西了
I got something for her!

776
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,910
我的小风暴回来了
Ah, there's my little storm cloud!

777
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:49,170
星期三  你去哪了
Wednesday, where have you been?

778
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,680
去外面了
Elsewhere.

779
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:02,510
你戴的是什么
What are you wearing?

780
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:05,140
派克把它叫做一点提亮的点缀
Parker calls it a pop of color.

781
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,670
我还挺喜欢这匹
While I certainly appreciate a horse

782
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:07,920
头上插着矛的马
with a spear through its head,

783
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,870
但这颜色...
the color is...

784
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:10,960
她说这和我的笑容很相称
She claims it brings out my smile.

785
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,430
星期三  你不会笑
Wednesday, you don't have a smile.

786
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:15,170
看起来有很多关于我的事情
Turns out I have a lot of things

787
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:16,330
你不知道
you don't know about.

788
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:22,230
看来我来得很及时
I see I got here just in time.

789
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,970
你给我打电话是对的  戈麦斯
You were right to call, Gomez.

790
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:26,320
我会和她谈谈  把那个猎熊陷阱递给我
I'll talk to her. Hand me that bear trap.

791
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,820
谢谢你  奶奶  不过我会处理这事的
Thank you, Grandma. But I will handle this.

792
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:31,530
随你便吧
Ah, suit yourself.

793
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:38,060
当你们不需要法比奥了  让他去我房间
When you're done with Fabio, send him up to my room.

794
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,120
我的天
Oh, boy!

795
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:44,030
星期三
Wednesday.

796
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:47,060
明天你放学之后要不要和我一起
How would you like to join me tomorrow

797
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:51,650
去墓地参加通灵茶话会呢
after the school for tea and séance in the cemetery?

798
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,390
是强制出席吗
Is attendance mandatory?

799
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:55,050
别这样  我的小乌鸦
Come now, my little raven.

800
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:57,600
你小时候特别喜欢的
You did so love it when you were younger.

801
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,030
你想去就去吧  母亲
If you like, Mother.

802
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,360
睡个好觉  宝贝
Sleep well, dear.

803
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:05,070
别忘了踢你父亲一脚道晚安
Don't forget to kick your father good night.

804
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,810
{\an8}少年粉红泡泡  赢得他的心

805
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,110
你最喜欢的滤镜是哪个
What's your favorite filter?

806
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:12,900
我不知道
I don't know.

807
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,880
不管用什么滤镜我看起来都是黑白的
I look black and white in all of them.

808
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,520
你知道吗  我刚认识你的时候
You know, when I met you,

809
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,310
我觉得你特别奇怪
I thought you were super weird.

810
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,370
而现在  我觉得你超级酷
But now, I think you're really cool.

811
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:21,340
我同意
I concur.

812
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,720
你也不是全无优点
You're not completely devoid of merit yourself.

813
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,010
我该说谢谢吗
I wanna say "Thank you"...

814
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,210
{\an8}派克·尼德勒

815
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,120
你昨天戴着哪个发夹回家
Oh, how'd that barrette

816
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,950
反响如何
you bought yesterday go over at home?

817
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,110
事实上  我母亲的反应有点反常
Actually, my mother's reaction was, well, unexpected.

818
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:38,700
她在试图接受  这让我很压抑
She was accepting. It depressed me.

819
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:41,600
没人想看见自己的母亲那样
One never wants to see one's mother that way.

820
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:43,030
但我不得不承认
But I must admit,

821
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:48,170
戴着那种鲜艳怪异的东西走来走去
walking around in something so garish, so grotesque...

822
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:50,040
没想到我还挺激动的
I was shocked how thrilling it felt.

823
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:52,620
我希望我也能那么做
I wish I could do that.

824
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:54,430
但我妈非要我穿这个
But my mom makes me wear this stuff,

825
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,570
这太...
and it's just so...

826
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:00,730
你想说的应该是"不幸"
I believe the word you're looking for is "Unfortunate."

827
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:04,180
我非常想疯狂一把
Ugh. I'd love to just go crazy

828
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:06,640
穿一些会让她震惊的服饰
and wear something that would shock her.

829
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:08,960
那么  派克
Well, Parker,

830
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:10,180
你很幸运
you're in luck.

831
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,940
你正巧在同惊悚女王说话
You happen to be talking to the queen of shock.

832
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:33,650
{\an8}是

833
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:35,900
你好  妈妈
Hello, Mother.

834
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,470
我的小幽灵在哪里
Where's my little wraith?

835
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:39,820
星期三还没到呢
Wednesday still hasn't arrived.

836
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,620
我们说好来这里进行通灵茶话会
We agreed to come up here for tea and séance,

837
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,970
但现在她放了我鸽子
and now it seems she stood me up.

838
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:47,110
莫蒂西亚  你听得到吗
Morticia! Can you hear me?

839
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,540
你的做法不对
You're not doing it right.

840
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,190
-按那个按钮  -我按了  按了
- Press that button there. - I did! I did!

841
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:50,850
你听到按键咔嗒的声音了吗
Did you hear it click?

842
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:51,550
莫蒂西亚
Morticia!

843
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:52,800
你听到咔嗒声
It's supposed to be on

844
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,360
-应该就打通了  -等等  我看到了
- when you hear the click. - Wait, I see something.

845
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,100
你成功了  你好  亲爱的
You did it! Hello, darling!

846
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,900
我的外孙女在哪里
Now, where's my granddaughter?

847
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:59,190
正如我刚刚所说
Just what I said.

848
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:01,660
我认为她正在有意疏远我
I think she's distancing herself from me.

849
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:03,040
她被充斥着空虚与渴望的
Oh, she's wrapped in a black hole

850
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,390
黑洞所包裹
of emptiness and longing,

851
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:05,930
我们弗朗普家的女人都这样
like all of us Frump women.

852
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:08,400
-星期三  -不是星期三
- Wednesday? - It's not Wednesday!

853
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,520
-那是谁  -是我  爸爸
- Who's this? - It's me, Father.

854
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,320
莫蒂西亚
Morticia?

855
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,560
你怎么了
What's wrong with you now?

856
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,760
世界如此残酷
The world can be so cruel.

857
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,640
而她却只想直奔其而去
And all she wants to do is run toward it.

858
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,280
她那方面很像你
She's a lot like you that way.

859
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,890
你也曾想见识外界
You wanted to see the world.

860
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:24,060
探寻自我  风水轮流转
Find yourself. Serve time!

861
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:26,830
莫蒂西亚  你还记得那次
Listen, Morticia, remember the time

862
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:29,530
你跑去参加女童子军吗
you ran away and joined the Girl Scouts?

863
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,990
我们当时特别担心你走上歪路
We were so worried you were on a bad path.

864
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:35,600
但等你发现篝火是用来烤棉花糖
But when you found out that campfires

865
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,010
而不是烤其他女童子军时
were for roasting marshmallows and not other Girl Scouts,

866
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,120
你感觉无聊  就回家了
well, you got bored and you came home.

867
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,460
我们大大松了一口气
We were so relieved.

868
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,830
相信星期三
Trust Wednesday.

869
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:48,170
她会像你一样做正确的事
Like you, she'll do the right thing.

870
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:51,650
谢谢你  爸爸  我很受安慰
Thank you, Father. That's most comforting.

871
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,710
好  等等
Good. Wait a second.

872
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,070
我什么时候死的
When did I die?

873
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,730
二十年前
20 years ago.

874
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:59,210
好  纪念日快乐  亲爱的
Oh, right. Happy anniversary, darling.

875
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,890
好了  帕格斯利  我们再演练一遍
All right, Pugsley, let's, uh, go through it again.

876
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:06,290
喝掉这个  帕格斯利  玛祖卡不值一提
You got this, Pugsley. This Mazurka's nothing.

877
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:09,910
你能把刀剑当早饭吃
You eat swords for breakfast.

878
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,310
你就是有一点临场紧张
You just got a case of pre-ball jitters.

879
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:15,620
很多人都会这样
It's way more common than you think.

880
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:18,260
如果玛祖卡持续时间超过四小时
If a Mazurka lasts for more than four hours,

881
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,730
联系你的医生
contact your doctor.

882
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:23,070
从头来  音乐
From the top. Music!

883
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:39,070
帕格斯利
Pugsley,

884
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,720
我可以坦白讲
I can honestly say

885
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:45,190
你刚刚跳得确实很有特色的
that was most definitely a thing you did.

886
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:48,280
有一个问题  那到底是什么舞
A question, what in heaven's name was it?

887
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,980
马刀玛祖卡舞
The Sabre Mazurka.

888
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,440
你练习得很刻苦
You know what? You've been practicing hard.

889
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,890
今天何不到此为止呢
Why don't we call it a day?

890
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,810
去洗澡  孩子
Hit the showers, kid.

891
00:52:58,650 --> 00:52:59,950
我们练完了
So, we're finished?

892
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,000
对
Ah, yes.

893
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:05,040
对  儿子  我们绝对练完了
Yes, son. We are most certainly finished.

894
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,110
好  谢谢  爸
Okay. Thanks, Pop.

895
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:08,190
谢谢  费斯特叔叔
Thanks, Uncle Fester.

896
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:17,180
简直是彻头彻尾的灾难  怎么会这样
This is a complete disaster! How did this happen?

897
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:18,430
他会自取其辱的
And he's going to make a fool of himself

898
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:19,420
当着所有人的面
in front of everyone!

899
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,770
戈麦斯  你得冷静
Gomez, you gotta calm down!

900
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:23,990
还有一天时间可以让他准备
There's still a day to get him ready!

901
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:27,510
费斯特  一年都不够他准备的
Fester, a year wouldn't be enough to get him ready.

902
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,650
我辜负了他  费斯特
I've failed him, Fester.

903
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:34,290
我努力把他培养成一亚当斯  但我失败了
I tried to raise him to be an Addams, but I failed.

904
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:36,970
他们会把他生吞活剥的
They're going to eat him alive.

905
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:42,820
♪ 我喜欢那样  宝贝 ♪
♪ I like it like that. Ooh, baby ♪

906
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,750
♪ 我说我喜欢那样 ♪
♪ I said I like it like that ♪

907
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:48,700
♪ 宝贝  我喜欢那样 ♪
♪ Ooh, baby, I like it like that ♪

908
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,650
好  谢谢
All right. Thank you.

909
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,240
奶奶  我们已经有一支乐队了
Grandma, we already have a band.

910
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,800
他们是太平间强烈推荐的
They came highly recommended from the mortuary.

911
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,650
他们当然不错
I'm sure they're good.

912
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,830
我姐姐思露会负责评判帕格斯利
My sister Sloom is going to be judging Pugsley.

913
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:03,730
如果不按照传统行事
And if things aren't done the traditional way,

914
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:05,100
她会不高兴
she won't be happy,

915
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:07,090
然后玛祖卡仪式会变成一场灾难
and the Mazurka could be a disaster!

916
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,990
但我又知道什么呢
But what do I know?

917
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:10,860
行
Fine.

918
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,480
我们拿下演唱会了
Yay, we got the gig!

919
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,370
我们拿下了
We got it!

920
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,600
还有一件事
Ah, one more thing...

921
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:17,440
有人敲门  我最好去看看是谁
Oh, someone's at the door. I'd better go see who it is.

922
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,960
♪ 当你可以泯然众人 ♪
♪ What's so great about being yourself ♪

923
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:33,140
♪ 又何必做你自己 ♪
♪ When you can be like everyone else? ♪

924
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:35,570
不许那么对你妈妈说话
Do not speak to your mother that way.

925
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:37,930
你怎么敢这样进家门
How dare you enter this house like that.

926
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,990
你的文身呢
Wait, where are your tattoos?

927
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:44,160
感谢星辰
Oh, thank the stars!

928
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,740
-你去哪了  -和派克一起玩
- Where were you? - Hanging out with Parker.

929
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,530
所以你才没来通灵茶话会吗
Is this why you skipped tea and séance?

930
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:51,630
你外祖父母想和你联系
Your grandparents were trying to contact you.

931
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:52,790
伟大的哈迪斯
Holy Hades!

932
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,410
无论这是谁对你做的  星期三
Whoever did that to you, Wednesday,

933
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:57,000
我希望他比你更难看
I hope the other guy looks worse.

934
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,480
没人对我这么做  这是我的新形象
Nobody did this to me. This is my new look.

935
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:00,820
你喜欢吗
Do you like it?

936
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,030
我不喜欢
I do not like it.

937
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:04,370
人人都知道粉色是入门色
Everyone knows pink is a gateway color.

938
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:07,160
你送她去公立学校时  我警告过你
I warned you about sending her to public school.

939
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,000
别担心
Don't worry.

940
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,080
星期三永远不会去那上学了
Wednesday is never going to that school again.

941
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:11,290
-什么  -事实上
- What? - In fact,

942
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:13,960
她再也不会离开这房子了
she's never leaving this house again.

943
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:19,940
她眼神真邪恶
Wow, that's some evil eye she's got there.

944
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:22,720
那种死亡凝视是新学的
No, that dead-eye stare is new.

945
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,110
我想我知道她从哪里学的
And I think I know where she got it.

946
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:27,860
大家好  是我
Hey, guys, this is me now.

947
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:29,580
如果你喜欢  请点击"喜欢"
If you like it, hit "Like,"

948
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,190
但谁在乎你喜不喜欢呢
but who cares if you like it.

949
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:32,050
我要活出真实的自我
I'm living my truth.

950
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:34,380
派克
Parker?

951
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:37,830
-这是谁干的  -我
- Who did this to you? - I did.

952
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,390
这是我的新形象  妈妈
This is my new look, Mother.

953
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:44,740
从现在起  我自己选衣服穿  你别管
I decided that from now on, I choose my clothes, not you.

954
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:48,610
都是那个古怪的星期三·亚当斯干的好事
This is that little creep Wednesday Addams' work!

955
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:51,580
她不古怪  她只是不像你一样
She's not a creep. She's just not like you.

956
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,640
你为什么不能容忍别人和你不一样
Why can't you ever let people be different?

957
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,970
因为让人人都一样是我的使命
Because it's my calling to make everyone the same.

958
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:01,150
太亮了  烧到我了
Too bright! It burns!

959
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:04,600
好  说不定能把你身上的古怪烧掉呢
Good! Maybe it'll burn away the weird!

960
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:05,860
我讨厌这里
I hate it here!

961
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,890
人人都虚假无趣而明亮
Everything's boring and fake and bright,

962
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:09,500
仿佛塑料花
like plastic flowers!

963
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,590
仿佛你
Like you!

964
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:14,260
派克  塑料花永远不会开败
Parker! Plastic flowers live forever.

965
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,530
你回房间去好好反省一下
Now, you go think about that in your room.

966
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:19,690
不许上社交软件
With no social media.

967
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,440
不  求你  不要  什么都行  就是别这样
No! Please, no. Anything but that!

968
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,030
快去把你脸上这阴沉玩意擦掉
Now go wipe that depressing goop off your face.

969
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:26,860
你先
You first!

970
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,570
姓亚当斯的这次太过分了
Those Addamses have gone too far this time.

971
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:34,130
他们需要一点小小的帮助
I think they're going to need a little more help.

972
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:34,810
{\an8}同化镇

973
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:36,480
{\an8}邻居之窥

974
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:54,000
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

975
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:55,790
一个朋友家
A friend's.

976
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,190
我囚禁其他人  而非他人囚禁我
I hold people prisoner, not the other way around.

977
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,670
祝你玛祖卡日好运
Good luck with your Mazurka.

978
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:04,960
等等  你要走了
Wait, you're leaving?

979
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:06,760
那谁来每天折磨我
Who's gonna torment me every day?

980
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,690
住在这屋檐下就够你受罪的了
Living under this roof is all the torment you'll need.

981
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,430
另外  我们的父母已经说得很明白
Besides, our parents have made it clear

982
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,990
只有和他们保持一致
that the only way to be accepted in this family

983
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:17,850
才能被这家庭接纳
is to be exactly like them.

984
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,120
我无法再遵守这些规则了
I can't play by those rules anymore.

985
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:22,900
再见  帕格斯利弟弟

明天  你会成为一个男人
Tomorrow, you become a man.

987
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,520
我则会成为一名逃犯
And I become a fugitive.

988
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:32,000
早就知道会变成这样
Always kinda knew it'd end up like this.

989
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:34,300
就是没想到会这么快
Just didn't think it'd be so soon.

990
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,000
我永远都不会忘记你的  帕格斯利
I'll never forget you, Pugsley!

991
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,610
但我会尝试忘记
But I'll try.

992
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:41,990
帕格斯利  看到你姐姐了吗
Pugsley, have you seen your sister?

993
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:43,430
她不在她房间
She's not in her room.

994
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,690
帕格斯利  星期三在哪里
Pugsley. Where's Wednesday?

995
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:55,390
滴答滴答  妈妈
Tick, tock, tick, tock, Mother.

996
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:58,070
你感觉很困
You're getting very sleepy.

997
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,290
帕格斯利
Pugsley...

998
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:03,380
她没去她朋友家
She did not go to her friend's house.

999
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,300
她去她朋友家了
She went to her friend's house?

1000
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:09,240
我重复  她没去她朋友...

我妈妈有暗室还有牢房

01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:52,390
渣滓在哪  我渴了
Now, where are the dregs? I'm thirsty.

1119
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:54,310
你们见过他们
You've seen them!

1120
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:57,850
也在邻居之窥上听说过他们的故事
You've heard the stories on Neighborhood Peeps!

1121
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:02,230
亚当斯一家不是人  他们是魔鬼
Those Addams aren't people, they're monsters!

1122
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:05,400
现在  他们入侵我们的生活
And now, there's an infestation of them!

1123
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,780
他们会摧毁我们美丽的家园
They're here to destroy our beautiful community

1124
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:12,410
把我们的家变成《设计干预》都法挽救的地方
and turn it into a place that no Design Intervention can save!

1125
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:14,790
这里不欢迎亚当斯一家
Addams aren't wanted here!

1126
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:16,620
他们是魔鬼  全都是魔鬼
They're monsters! They're all monsters!

1127
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:19,750
我们要先下手为强  消灭他们
We need to destroy them first!

1128
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,800
谁跟我一起
Who's with me?

1129
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,880
一个小时之后我们会将同化镇
We'll be revealing Assimilation

1130
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,960
和你们大家转播给观众
and all of you to our audience in just an hour.

1131
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:29,590
帮助他们的最后时机就是现在
Our last chance to help these people is now.

1132
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:33,140
比尔  约翰  你们那可爱的投石车还在吗
Bill, John, do you still have that lovely catapult?

1133
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:34,520
是的  还在
Yes, we do!

1134
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,390
你确定吗
Are you sure about this?

1135
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,640
我们不能让他们毁了我们的家园
We can't let them ruin our neighborhood!

1136
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,480
我们行动吧
Let's do it!

1137
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,310
我要赶走他们
I want them out!

1138
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:45,780
只有我能折磨我的家人
No one torments my family but me.

1139
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:47,530
请把发夹给我
Hair clip, please.

1140
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,160
好
Okay.

1141
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,200
{\an8}玛尔戈设计干预

1142
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:01,000
笼子学校入门
Cage school 101.

1143
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,460
最好他准备好了
He'd better be ready

1144
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,290
否则思露姨妈会要了他的脑袋
or Auntie Sloom will have his head!

1145
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:06,380
他看起来好小
He looks very small.

1146
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,010
那孩子有苦头吃了
That kid's got some big shoes to fill.

1147
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:10,090
真希望他准备好了
I certainly hope the boy's ready.

1148
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:12,350
我不会对他手下留情的
Well, I'm not going easy on him.

1149
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,320
头扔起来
Heads up.

1150
01:06:25,610 --> 01:06:26,820
女低音  你唱低了
Alto, you're flat.

1151
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:33,240
思露
Sloom.

1152
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:36,330
-姐姐  -亲爱的 我
- Sister. - Darling, I...

1153
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:37,910
我知道上一次见面
I know the last time we saw each other,

1154
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,620
我们吵得太凶了
we had that horrible fight.

1155
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:43,000
我就想告诉你  真心地告诉你
And I just wanted to tell you, from the bottom of my heart,

1156
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,880
那次我吵赢了  还好我是作弊赢的
I won that fight! And I was glad I cheated!

1157
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:49,920
你赢了  你还是输不起  永远都是
You won? Still a sore loser, as always!

1158
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,630
我们再比一次  就在这里  现在就比
I want a rematch! Right here! Right now!

1159
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:55,140
思露姨妈  你要不要吃点东西
Auntie Sloom? Can I get you anything?

1160
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:56,640
玛祖卡什么时候开始
When's the Mazurka?

1161
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,230
快了  快了
Soon, soon.

1162
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:00,140
我女儿星期三还没回来
Our daughter Wednesday isn't here yet.

1163
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:02,730
如果你女儿赶不上
If your daughter can't be on time,

1164
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:05,230
那我们就直接开始吧
then we will begin without her!

1165
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:07,940
非常好  思露姨妈
Very well, Auntie Sloom.

1166
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:14,660
请注意  请注意
Attention, please. Attention!

1167
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:20,580
时间到了
The hour is upon us.

1168
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:22,000
大家就位
Places!

1169
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:39,470
我们今天聚集在这里  一起见证我儿子
We gather today to witness my son,

1170
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:41,100
帕格斯利·亚当斯
Pugsley Addams,

1171
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,850
表演马刀玛祖卡舞
perform his Sabre Mazurka.

1172
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:10,290
他先读《恐怖》的一个章节
He will begin with a reading from the Terror,

1173
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:14,090
以纪念我们在战斗中的呐喊
which commemorates our cries in battle.

1174
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:20,850
{\an8}咆哮

1175
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:31,440
{\an8}尖叫

1176
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:39,870
现在是成年礼
And now, the transition into manhood.

1177
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:41,950
{\an8}胡须

1178
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:00,600
现在是马刀玛祖卡舞
And now, the Sabre Mazurka.

1179
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:09,810
别动
Hold still.

1180
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:14,440
这是亚当斯胡须
The Addams mustache.

1181
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:16,030
现在你准备好了
Now you're ready.

1182
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:27,270
帕格斯利
Pugsley?

1183
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:31,100
我放弃
I give up.

1184
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:33,230
我做不到  爸爸
I can't do it, Pop.

1185
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:39,820
对不起
I'm sorry.

1186
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,030
我让你失望了
I let you down.

1187
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:45,870
你没有让我失望  帕格斯利
You haven't let me down, Pugsley.

1188
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,500
是我让你失望了
I let you down.

1189
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:51,920
我如此沉迷于传统
I was so focused on doing things the traditional way,

1190
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:54,960
忘记了让你做自己
I forgot to let you be who you are.

1191
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:03,680
准备好迎接玛尔戈大改造了吗
Are ya ready for your Margaux makeover now?

1192
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:05,220
是玛尔戈
It's Margaux.

1193
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:06,430
她肯定把全镇的人
She must have turned the whole town

1194
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:08,180
都教唆成彻头彻尾的疯子了
into stark raving lunatics.

1195
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:10,640
不得不承认  她工作很出色
Well, I have to admit, I admire her work.

1196
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,900
动手吧
Let's do this thing!

1197
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:13,900
投石车装好了  玛尔戈
It's locked and loaded, Margaux.

1198
01:11:14,230 --> 01:11:16,570
干掉他们  我们受够了
Let's go get 'em! We've had enough!

1199
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:17,780
发射
Fire!

1200
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:26,700
滚出去
Get out!

1201
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,170
帕格斯利
Pugsley!

1202
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:37,380
玛祖卡的真正意义是什么
What is the true meaning of the Mazurka?

1203
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,710
是保护我们的家人
It's about protecting our family

1204
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:41,880
不受敌人的伤害
from those who would do us harm!

1205
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:45,470
去吧  让他们瞧瞧你的绝技
Go ahead. Show 'em what you're good at.

1206
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:54,650
我们要做的就是推倒四周的墙
All we have to do is pull down the side walls!

1207
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:58,700
{\an7}My Family - Migos, Karol G,

01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:14,500
大家好

沙卡拉卡爆炸  宝贝
Shakalaka bang, baby!

1217
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,800
快  这里出去
Quick! Out this way!

1218
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:11,220
爸爸  我没有弹药了
Pop, I'm out of ammo!

1219
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:14,060
我们被困住了
We're trapped!

1220
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,660
希望我没扫大家的兴
Hope I'm not crashing the party.

1221
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:39,710
星期三
Wednesday!

1222
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:40,840
太好了
Yeah!

1223
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,380
伊卡博德  快点  放下树枝
Ichabod, quick, lower your branches!

1224
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:46,970
大家抓住了
Everyone, grab on!

1225
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:12,870
项目没完成
Margaux Needler never stops

1226
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:15,790
玛尔戈·尼德勒是不会停手的
until the project is complete.

1227
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:20,500
小心手雷
Fire in the hole!

1228
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,130
玛祖卡
Mazurka!

1229
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,420
大家都还好吗
Is everyone all right?

1230
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:31,430
你们来之前没缺的胳膊腿儿都在吧
No limbs missing that weren't missing before you arrived?

1231
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:41,390
我的小乌鸦  很高兴你回来了
My little raven, I'm so happy you returned.

1232
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:42,810
我当然会回来
Of course I came back.

1233
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:43,730
我早知道
I knew there was no way

1234
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:45,520
你们救不了自己
you were going to save yourselves.

1235
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,110
你们就像虚弱的松鼠宝宝
You are like weak baby squirrels.

1236
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:02,460
苏格拉底
Socrates.

1237
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:07,210
八条腿  九条命
Eight legs, nine lives.

1238
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:11,680
你说的没错
You were right, cara mia.

1239
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:14,100
人们很残忍
People can be cruel.

1240
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:16,300
我们干了什么
What have we done?

1241
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:18,810
他们只是一家人
They're just a family.

1242
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:20,100
一家人
A family?

1243
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:22,020
别说笑了  他们就是一群怪物
Please! They're a bunch of monsters!

1244
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:24,360
别在这时候心软  各位
Don't go soft on me, people.

1245
01:15:24,690 --> 01:15:26,690
我会驱赶你到天涯海角
I will relish hounding you

1246
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:28,940
直到那座核废料场一般的房子
until that nuclear waste dump of a house is gone

1247
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:31,610
和你那变态的一家都消失
and your mutant family along with it!

1248
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:34,620
别轻易许愿  尼德勒女士
Be careful what you wish for, Ms. Needler.

1249
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:39,040
我的家人和我再也不会躲避你这样的人了
My family and I will never run from the likes of you again.

1250
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:46,290
深呼吸  玛尔戈
Deep breath, Margaux.

1251
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:48,420
好了  我还要去拍大结局
Okay, I have a finale to shoot.

1252
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:49,710
派克  我们走
Parker, let's go.

1253
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,590
我不会跟你走的
I'm not going anywhere with you.

1254
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:53,300
我要和朋友在一起
I'm staying with my friend.

1255
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:54,680
你的朋友
Your friend?

1256
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,510
派克  这些人是怪胎

等等  你怎么知道这些
