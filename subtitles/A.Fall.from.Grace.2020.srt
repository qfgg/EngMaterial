00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,860
把双手放在桌上
{\r原文字幕}Put your hands on the desk for me.

114
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,540
我是你的律师  我叫茉莉·布莱恩特
{\r原文字幕}I'm your attorney, Jasmine Bryant.

115
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,750
我是公设辩护人办公室的
{\r原文字幕}I'm from the public defender's office.

116
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,540
是法院指派我来的
{\r原文字幕}I was appointed by the court.

117
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,000
我告诉过他们我不要律师
{\r原文字幕}I told them I didn't want a lawyer.

118
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,550
就算不是我  也会有别的律师来
{\r原文字幕}Well, if not me, then some other lawyer will be here.

119
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,760
法官对此很清楚
{\r原文字幕}The judge was very clear on that.

120
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,220
我了解到你打算认罪  对吗
{\r原文字幕}So, I understand that you want to plead guilty?

121
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,600
你多大了
{\r原文字幕}How old are you?

122
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,400
二十六
{\r原文字幕}Twenty-six.

123
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,570
你是哪个学校毕业的
{\r原文字幕}What school did you go to?

124
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,190
鲁斯顿
{\r原文字幕}Ruston.

125
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,610
社区大学
{\r原文字幕}Community college.

10126
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,070
然后我去了班尼威尔法律大学
{\r原文字幕}And then I went on to Baniview Law.

127
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,290
你的资料
{\r原文字幕}Your file... um...

128
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,210
我在来这里的路上稍微看了一下
{\r原文字幕}I had a chance to glance at it on my way over here,

129
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,500
我有点不明白  你曾在银行工作
{\r原文字幕}and, um, I'm a little confused. You worked at a bank,

130
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,800
你连交通规则都没违反过  但你却杀人
{\r原文字幕}you've never even had a traffic violation, and now you're here.

131
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,590
我打算向地方检察官申请
{\r原文字幕}I'm gonna ask the DA for 15 years

132
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,050
十五年监禁并允许假释
{\r原文字幕}with the possibility of parole.

133
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,260
我也许可以说服他
{\r原文字幕}I may be able to sell that to him.

134
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,600
你信天主教
{\r原文字幕}You're Catholic.

135
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,810
-对  -我不是在问你
{\r原文字幕}- Yes. - That wasn't a question.

136
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,390
我看到念珠了
{\r原文字幕}I see the rosary.

137
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,440
你是天主教徒吗
{\r原文字幕}Are you Catholic?

138
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,360
以圣父
{\r原文字幕}In the name of the Father,

139
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,440
圣子
{\r原文字幕}and the Son,

140
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,440
圣灵的名义
{\r原文字幕}and the Holy Spirit...

141
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,150
那你会念《圣母圣咏》吗
{\r原文字幕}So, you pray the rosary?

142
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:57,910
会
{\r原文字幕}Yes.

143
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,580
我想转到这附近的监狱
{\r原文字幕}I want to move to a prison close to here.

144
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,630
我想有机会看一下我的儿子
{\r原文字幕}I want to be able to see my son and my grandbaby...

145
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,670
和小孙子
{\r原文字幕}at some point.

146
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,130
我想把这些
{\r原文字幕}And I want that

147
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,090
加进认罪协议
{\r原文字幕}in the plea deal.

148
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,510
好的  我想想办法
{\r原文字幕}Okay. I'll see what I can do.

149
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,470
警卫
{\r原文字幕}Guard!

150
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,690
好了  她是什么样的人
{\r原文字幕}Okay. So what was she like?

151
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,360
和我想的完全不一样
{\r原文字幕}Well, it was nothing like I expected.

152
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,820
她就像你和我的妈妈一样
{\r原文字幕}She was like my mom, and yours.

153
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,070
她很  温柔
{\r原文字幕}She was...gentle.

154
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,700
温柔
{\r原文字幕}Gentle.

155
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,860
但乍一看
{\r原文字幕}You know, but, at first glance...

156
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,330
她就是个完美的被告
{\r原文字幕}she appears to be a picture-perfect defendant.

157
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,040
她给孩子们烤饼干
{\r原文字幕}She baked cookies for kids,

158
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,330
在教堂唱诗班唱歌  在主日学校教书
{\r原文字幕}she sang in a church choir, she taught Sunday school.

159
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,000
好多材料你都可以用来帮她辩护
{\r原文字幕}There's a lot of good things here for you to build a solid defense.

160
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,670
有大量的证据指向她是杀人犯
{\r原文字幕}The evidence against her is overwhelming.

161
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,050
但能超越合理怀疑吗  这只是间接证据
{\r原文字幕}But beyond a reasonable doubt? It was circumstantial.

10162
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,050
{\fn方正兰亭中黑_GBK\fs16\an8}指判决被告有罪时陪审员不会对证据有合理怀疑

163
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,140
她承认是她干的  她想认罪
{\r原文字幕}She confessed she did it. She wants to plead guilty.

164
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,640
我是说
{\r原文字幕}I mean...

165
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,100
-这个  -唐尼  冷静
{\r原文字幕}- This - Donnie, just chill.

166
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,930
不  不  别拦着他
{\r原文字幕}No, no, no. No, no.

167
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,930
你想说什么  唐尼
{\r原文字幕}What, Donnie?

168
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,020
我不是看轻你作为公共辩护律师的
{\r原文字幕}I-I-I'm not trying to take away from your remarkable ability

169
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,110
出众才能
{\r原文字幕}as a public defender,

170
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,070
但他们给你这个案子是为了让你帮她认罪
{\r原文字幕}um, but they gave you this case because they want you to plead it,

171
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,030
把事情办妥
{\r原文字幕}be done with it,

172
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,990
以免让公设辩护人办公室难堪
{\r原文字幕}as to not embarrass the public defender's office.

173
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,610
但是这案子如此备受关注
{\r原文字幕}But how embarrassing would it be,

174
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,070
如果你遗漏了什么
{\r原文字幕}due to the high profile of this case,

175
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,410
那会有多尴尬
{\r原文字幕}if you were missing something?

176
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,990
我会遗漏什么  唐尼
{\r原文字幕}What could I be missing, Donnie?

177
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,620
对  正如她所说  她还能遗漏什么
{\r原文字幕}Okay, like she said, okay, what could she be missing?

178
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,000
那个女人认罪了  不是吗
{\r原文字幕}The woman confessed, right?

179
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,750
-没错  -请不要怂恿她
{\r原文字幕}- Exactly. - Please don't encourage her.

180
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,380
她向你认罪了吗
{\r原文字幕}Did she confess to you?

181
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,420
-没有  她告诉警官她  -明白了吗
{\r原文字幕}-No, she told the officers that she - Ah. You see?

182
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,510
明白了吗  这就是我说的
{\r原文字幕}You see? This is what I'm talkin' about.

183
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,300
你不能在不了解事实的情况下就定她的罪
{\r原文字幕}You can't just plea her down without knowing all of the facts.

184
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,350
我了解事实  好吗
{\r原文字幕}I know the facts, okay?

185
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,260
这个案子一目了然  唐尼
{\r原文字幕}This is an open-and-shut, Donnie.

186
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,390
以我们的工作量  我们没有足够的时间
{\r原文字幕}With our workload, we don't have enough time or money

187
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,390
或金钱来仔细了解这个案子
{\r原文字幕}to even deal with this.

188
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,770
该死  我们代理的那些毒贩都比我们有钱
{\r原文字幕}Hell, the drug dealers we represent make more money than us,

189
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,350
他们对我们也没有丝毫尊重
{\r原文字幕}and they have no respect for us.

190
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,270
听着  我不想和你吵
{\r原文字幕}Look, I'm not gonna go back and forth with you.

191
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,480
-对不起   -你总是这个样子
{\r原文字幕}- Sorry, - You always do this.

192
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,860
这和一个为邻居孩子烤饼干的
{\r原文字幕}but what does that have to do with the Sunday school teacher

193
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,690
主日学校的老师有什么关系呢
{\r原文字幕}who bakes cookies for kids in the neighborhood?

194
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,910
好吧  我觉得我们该走了
{\r原文字幕}Okay,so I think we should leave.

195
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,080
这是你这一整晚说的最明智的话
{\r原文字幕}You know, that is the most sensible thing you've said all night.

196
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,000
谢谢
{\r原文字幕}Thank you.

197
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,080
我永远不会习惯
{\r原文字幕}You know, I will never get used to seeing

198
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,250
看到人们进监狱
{\r原文字幕}people going to jail.

199
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,880
无论这是否是你的案子
{\r原文字幕}Either this is your cause, or it ain't.

200
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,590
好好想想  小茉
{\r原文字幕}Figure it out, Jas.

201
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,380
-再见乔丹  -晚安  姐妹
{\r原文字幕}- Jordan. - Night, girl.

202
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,890
那我们明天见
{\r原文字幕}So we'll see you tomorrow.

203
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,350
-好的  -好吗  祝你们今晚愉快
{\r原文字幕}- Yeah. - Okay, y'all have a nice night.

204
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,680
-感谢你请我们来  -你也是  提尔萨
{\r原文字幕}- Thanks for having us. - You, too, Tilsa.

205
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,680
家里很漂亮  我会跟他聊聊的  好吗
{\r原文字幕}Beautiful home. I'mma talk to him, okay?

206
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,770
-不用麻烦了  -就小聊一下
{\r原文字幕}- Don't worry about it. - Just a little chat.

207
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,730
唐尼  你给我过来
{\r原文字幕}Donnie, get your ass over here!

208
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,940
这就是他们不再邀请我们来的原因
{\r原文字幕}This is why they don't invite us no more.

209
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,360
你现在的行为
{\r原文字幕}How you actin' right now...

210
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,860
-懂我意思了吧  -是
{\r原文字幕}- See what I mean? - Yeah.

211
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,490
赢不了
{\r原文字幕}Can't win.

212
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,790
我看到一个老太太坠楼死了
{\r原文字幕}I saw an old woman fall to her death.

213
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,800
不过我没事
{\r原文字幕}But I'm all right.

214
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:03,970
到你说了
{\r原文字幕}Your turn.

215
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,940
我刚从法学院毕业的时候
{\r原文字幕}You know, when I graduated from law school...

216
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,060
我感觉像中了彩票一样
{\r原文字幕}I thought I had hit the lottery.

217
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,690
是啊
{\r原文字幕}Yeah.

218
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,940
但是现在我身处这个行业  我
{\r原文字幕}But now that I'm into it, I...

219
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:24,990
这些人
{\r原文字幕}These people

220
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,780
是杀人犯
{\r原文字幕}are murderers

221
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,700
骗子
{\r原文字幕}and liars.

222
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,330
还有小偷
{\r原文字幕}And they're thieves, babe.

223
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,710
为他们辩护  我
{\r原文字幕}And to defend them, I...

224
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,210
我只是在重新考虑这一切
{\r原文字幕}I'm just having second thoughts about all of this.

225
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,010
真的
{\r原文字幕}Really.

226
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,220
我只是想在那里待到
{\r原文字幕}I just wanna stay there long enough

227
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,060
还完学生贷款
{\r原文字幕}so I can get these student loans paid off.

228
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,810
我再也不想当律师了
{\r原文字幕}I don't want to be a lawyer anymore.

229
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,100
别这么说
{\r原文字幕}No, come on.

230
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,150
我不想
{\r原文字幕}I don't.

231
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,900
过来
{\r原文字幕}Oh, come on.

232
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,070
我不想
{\r原文字幕}I don't.

233
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,700
这是你注定要做的事
{\r原文字幕}This is what you're meant to do.

234
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,910
你知道的  宝贝  过来
{\r原文字幕}You know that, babe. Come on.

235
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,540
昨晚我可能喝多了点  我的错
{\r原文字幕}Last night I may have had one too many. My bad.

236
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,500
那个算道歉吗
{\r原文字幕}Was that an apology?

237
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,050
你说是就是

{\r原文字幕}I love my mother, and I know she's innocent. I know she is.

257
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,170
她不可能对任何人那么做  不会的
{\r原文字幕}She couldn't do that to anyone. No one.

258
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,130
我小时候她甚至不忍心杀蜘蛛
{\r原文字幕}She wouldn't even kill spiders when I was growing up.

259
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,930
她让我爸用杯子把它们放出去
{\r原文字幕}She'd make my dad take 'em outside in a cup.

260
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,180
你得帮帮她
{\r原文字幕}You have to help her.

261
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,600
她想认罪

262
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,560
不  不要让她这么做  求你了
{\r原文字幕}No, no, no, don't let her do that, please.

263
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,810
我要能跟她说上话就好了  她不肯见我
{\r原文字幕}If I could talk to her. She won't see me.

264
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,350
你得帮帮她  或者让我进去见见她
{\r原文字幕}You have to help her or get me in to see her.

265
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,060
你不能让她认罪
{\r原文字幕}You can't let her plead guilty.

266
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,980
很抱歉  我帮不了你
{\r原文字幕}I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.

267
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,650
她想认罪
{\r原文字幕}She wants to plead.

268
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
我很抱歉
{\r原文字幕}I'm sorry.

269
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,290
绝对不行
{\r原文字幕}Absolutely not.

270
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,930
我要她终生监禁  不得假释
{\r原文字幕}I want life without parole.

271
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,000
你认真的吗
{\r原文字幕}Look, are you serious?

272
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,540
她没有犯罪记录  是个模范公民
{\r原文字幕}She has no record. She's a model citizen.

273
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,960
她没有前科
{\r原文字幕}She has no priors.

274
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,920
拜托  我们要求判十五年
{\r原文字幕}Come on, we want 15 years.

275
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,130
想都别想
{\r原文字幕}No deal.

276
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,840
她想认罪  就得重判
{\r原文字幕}She wants a plea, she gets the max.

277
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,350
那让她去米尔斯通监狱如何
{\r原文字幕}Well, what about giving her Millstone Prison,

278
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,100
-这样她能离她儿子近点  -这个我会考虑
{\r原文字幕}- so she'll be closer to her son? - That I'll consider.

279
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,020
他们要求判最重刑
{\r原文字幕}They're offering the maximum,

280
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,650
终生监禁  不得假释
{\r原文字幕}life without the possibility of parole.

281
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,240
-那就是他们最好的条件了吗  -他很坚决
{\r原文字幕}- And that's the best they can do? - He's adamant about it.

282
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,910
如果我们上庭审判  他可能主张死刑
{\r原文字幕}If we went to trial, he could ask for the death penalty.

283
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,830
我觉得你该接受这个条件
{\r原文字幕}I think you should take this deal.

284
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,330

302
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,160
把这个拉到路边就好

{\r原文字幕}They said there would be sunshine today.

314
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,520
他们也就这水平了
{\r原文字幕}So much for what they know.

315
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,520
从来都不准  对吧  我就知道

那么
{\r原文字幕}So...

317
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,230
你来见我所为何事
{\r原文字幕}...what brings you to see me?

318
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,490
眼泪
{\r原文字幕}Tears.

319
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,120
我昨天看见葛蕾丝女士哭了
{\r原文字幕}I saw Miss Grace cry tears

320
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,370
我从来没见过罪犯哭成那样
{\r原文字幕}that I've never seen a guilty person cry yesterday.

321
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,630
我得承认  我觉得很难受
{\r原文字幕}You know, I have to tell you, I feel really bad.

322
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,590
这很大程度是我的错
{\r原文字幕}A lot of this is my fault.

323
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,550
你为什么这么说
{\r原文字幕}Why do you say that?

324
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,510
年纪是个贱人  亲爱的  它会悄悄靠近你
{\r原文字幕}Age is a bitch, darling. It'll sneak up on you.

325
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,810
头一天还貌美如花  就像你  青春可爱
{\r原文字幕}One day you all lovely-lookin', just like you, all young and lovely.

326
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,090
第二天就到了我这个年纪
{\r原文字幕}Seem like the next day you're my age,

327
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,770
思索着时间都去哪了
{\r原文字幕}wondering where all the time went.

328
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,850
我比她大一点
{\r原文字幕}I'm a little older than she is.

329
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,690
但我不想她像我一样
{\r原文字幕}But I didn't want her to be like me.

330
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,280
独自一人
{\r原文字幕}Lonely...

331
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,280
跟一群老太婆和她们的猫一起
{\r原文字幕}and livin' in a house

332
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,120
住一栋房子里
{\r原文字幕}with old ladies and their cats.

333
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,370
她心地那么善良
{\r原文字幕}She's such a good soul.

334
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,710
所以我鼓励她走出去
{\r原文字幕}So, I tried to encourage her to go out,

335
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,290
我总是鼓励她  但是
{\r原文字幕}you know, all the time, but...

336
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,090
她不肯
{\r原文字幕}she wouldn't do it.

337
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,750
谢谢
{\r原文字幕}Thank you.

338
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,720
不用谢  之后她儿子结婚了
{\r原文字幕}You're welcome. And then, when her, uh, son got married...

339
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,050
那时一切都发生了转变
{\r原文字幕}...that's when everything took a turn.

340
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,390
我亲眼看到她变了个人
{\r原文字幕}I mean, I literally watched as she changed before my very eyes.

341
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,560
那是在婚礼后
{\r原文字幕}It was after the wedding.

342
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,600
我们坐一起品酒聊天
{\r原文字幕}We were sitting and talking over a glass of wine, and...

343
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,780
她为自己的生活在想象和现实中的巨大差异
{\r原文字幕}Oh, she was so sad about what she thought her life would be,

344
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,900
而感到难过
{\r原文字幕}and... and what it was.

345
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,030
实际并没有很差
{\r原文字幕}And it wasn't bad.

346
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,160
因为她有一个漂亮的家
{\r原文字幕}No, 'cause she had a lovely home. Beautiful home.

347
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,160
还有一份好工作
{\r原文字幕}And a good job, too.

348
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,780
但她的前夫
{\r原文字幕}But her ex-husband,

349
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,000
过得比她更好
{\r原文字幕}he was living better than she was, and...

350
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,710
他的现在妻子过着葛蕾丝梦寐以求的生活
{\r原文字幕}seemed like his wife was living Grace's dream, and--

351
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,250
你要记下来吗
{\r原文字幕}You gonna take notes?

352
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,460
对啊  谢谢
{\r原文字幕}Oh. Yes. Uh, thank you.

353
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:45,890
好了
{\r原文字幕}Yes.

354
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,180
所以  婚礼过后
{\r原文字幕}So, it was after the wedding,

355
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,770
我们刚回来  还没来得及脱下礼服
{\r原文字幕}and we had come in. We hadn't even taken off our dresses,

356
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:56,320
她就  她就彻底崩溃了
{\r原文字幕}when she started to just-- just come apart at the seams.

357
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,480
婚礼在她前夫家举办的
{\r原文字幕}I mean, that wedding took place in her ex-husband's house,

358
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,200
那里曾经是葛蕾丝家
{\r原文字幕}and that used to be Grace's house.

359
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,820
我搞不懂  葛蕾丝
{\r原文字幕}I don't know, Grace,

360
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,950
他们为什么非得在那个房子里举办婚礼
{\r原文字幕}why'd they have to have a wedding in the house?

361
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,330
还有那些俗气的帘子
{\r原文字幕}And those tacky drapes.

{\r原文字幕}He didn't even change the drapes?

365

他甚至没换掉那些帘子
{\r原文字幕}He didn't even change the drapes.

很愤怒
{\r原文字幕}Angry.

369

不  我不是真的生气  我只是很受伤
{\r原文字幕}No, I'm not really angry. I'm just hurt.

370
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,260
还有很愤怒  承认吧
{\r原文字幕}And angry. Go on, say it.

371

{\r原文字幕}She is five years older than my son.

379
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,780
我们的儿子
{\r原文字幕}Our son.

380
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,990
就这么不公平
{\r原文字幕}Just so unfair.

381
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,870
他就这么继续过他的人生
{\r原文字幕}It's like he just went on with his life.

382
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,710
我就像是个会拖累他的包袱一样
{\r原文字幕}Like I was some kind of speed bump that just slowed him down.

383
00:20:59,090 --> 00:20:59,920
只是
{\r原文字幕}Just...

384
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,260
我是怎么沦落到这个地步的
{\r原文字幕}How did I even get here?

385
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,720
我想要回我的生活

我想要回我的青春
{\r原文字幕}I want my youth back.

387
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,690
我想开怀大笑
{\r原文字幕}I want to laugh.

388
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,150
我想爱上一个人  我想
{\r原文字幕}I wanna love somebody, I wanna...

389
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,770
被爱

390
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,190
你青春的事我帮不上忙
{\r原文字幕}I can't help you with your youth,

391
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,450
但是剩下的我倒能搭把手
{\r原文字幕}but I can help you with the rest of it.

392

你得从这房子里出去  去约会
{\r原文字幕}You need to get the hell out this house and meet somebody.

393
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,120

{\r原文字幕}Who?

394
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,660
我不知道
{\r原文字幕}I don't know.

395
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,460
但是我看到电视上的广告
{\r原文字幕}But I see these commercials on TV.

396
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:41,040
你可以上基督徒在线约会网
{\r原文字幕}You could go on ChristianDateOnline.Com.

397
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,050

{\r原文字幕}What?

398
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,130
-你可以试试  -我才不试
{\r原文字幕}- You could! - No, I could not.

399
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,840

{\r原文字幕}No. Come on, now, Sarah.

400
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,100
得了吧  如果我想和某人约会  我希望
{\r原文字幕}No, come on. If I wanted to meet someone, I want to do it...

401
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,470
我希望用传统的方式
{\r原文字幕}I want to do it the old-fashioned way.

402
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,020
以传统的方式来看现在可都是深夜了
{\r原文字幕}Might be a little late in the evening for the old-fashioned way.

403
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,730
那他们是怎么遇上的
{\r原文字幕}So how'd the two meet?

404
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,900
在一个美术馆
{\r原文字幕}At an art gallery.

405
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,570

{\r原文字幕}This is a flyer from when they repossessed her house.

409

{\r原文字幕}They put everything out on the street,

410
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,260
我尽可能地帮她收了一些东西
{\r原文字幕}and I gathered those things that I could, at least the things

411
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,890
一些至少我认为对她很珍贵的东西
{\r原文字幕}I thought that would be of value to her.

412
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,370

{\r原文字幕}This is a flyer from his show

413
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,810

这是他的相片

他遇到她第二天就把原片给了她
{\r原文字幕}He gave her the original the day after he met her.

416
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:47,780
他是名摄影师

417
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,610
你留着吧

488
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,730
就这么完了
{\r原文字幕}End it.

489
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,450
一切都是那么平常
{\r原文字幕}Everything felt so normal.

490
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,000
谢谢
{\r原文字幕}Thank you.

10491
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,450
{\fn方正兰亭中黑_GBK\fs16\pos(145,159)\fr37}去看吧

10492
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,450
{\fn方正兰亭中黑_GBK\fs14\pos(165,169)\fr37}-萨拉

493
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,430
那天下班后  我去了一家画廊的开幕式
{\r原文字幕}After work that day, I went to a... a gallery opening.

494
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,550
虽然有点累
{\r原文字幕}I was a little tired,

495
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,770
但我还是想去看看萨拉说的这个展览
{\r原文字幕}but I wanted to see this exhibit that Sarah had told me about.

496
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,440
她担心我在屋里待太久
{\r原文字幕}She was worried about me being in the house too much.

497
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,940
坚持要我去  所以
{\r原文字幕}But she was adamant that I go, so...

498
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,150
我去了
{\r原文字幕}I did.

499
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:42,200
-你好  -请原谅  不好意思
{\r原文字幕}- Hi. - Excuse me. I'm sorry.

500
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,160
我知道
{\r原文字幕}Ah... I get it,

501
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,530
你得在合适的灯光下看这些照片
{\r原文字幕}you have to see these in the right light.

502
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,370
而这里最好的灯光
{\r原文字幕}And the best lighting in the room is...

503
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,620
就在这里  所以
{\r原文字幕}right here, so...

504
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,250
这展览的主人是我的世交
{\r原文字幕}The owner's a family friend,

505
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,790
我没勇气告诉她这里的灯光很糟
{\r原文字幕}and I don't have the heart to tell her that the lighting sucks.

506
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,840
其实从这里看也没有那么糟
{\r原文字幕}Well, it's not really that bad from right here.

507
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,430
你对光和阴影很了解吗
{\r原文字幕}And what do you know about shadows and light?

508
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:06,890
我什么都不了解  包括这位摄影师
{\r原文字幕}I don't know anything as well as this photographer.

509
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:10,180
她很有才华
{\r原文字幕}She's... brilliant.

510
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,310
你为什么那么肯定她是名女性
{\r原文字幕}What makes you so sure that she's a she?

511
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,060
看名字
{\r原文字幕}The name.

512
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,690
香农
{\r原文字幕}Shannon.

513
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,610
再看那些阴影
{\r原文字幕}And look at the shadows,

514
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,700
还有她拍摄这些部落族人情感的方式
{\r原文字幕}the way she captures the emotions of these tribes.

515
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,700
只有在女人眼里才是这样  太美了
{\r原文字幕}Now, only a woman sees like that. It's beautiful.

516
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,870
我觉得她也是埃塞俄比亚人
{\r原文字幕}You know what? I think she's Ethiopian, too,

517
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,230
因为她得认识人才能进部落
{\r原文字幕}because she has to know somebody to get in

518
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,710
才能去了解这些人
{\r原文字幕}and get to know these people.

519
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:34,670
有些地区非常偏远
{\r原文字幕}Some of these places are extremely remote.

520
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:38,500
我觉得只有当地人才能如此地靠近
{\r原文字幕}I think only a native can navigate this closely.

521
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,800
看来你很了解埃塞俄比亚
{\r原文字幕}You seem to know a lot about Ethiopia.

522
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,800
都是从书上读到的
{\r原文字幕}Just what I've read.

523
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,510
我爱非洲
{\r原文字幕}I love Africa.

524
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:46,930
非洲的历史
{\r原文字幕}African history.

525
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,010
真想有天能去看看
{\r原文字幕}I wanna go one day.

526
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,140
你该去  那会改变你的一生
{\r原文字幕}You should. It'll change your life.

527
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,600
你去过吗
{\r原文字幕}Oh, you've been?

528
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,560
-去过  -你真幸运
{\r原文字幕}- I have. - Lucky you.

529
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,720
遇见你  也很幸运
{\r原文字幕}Lucky me, to meet you.

530
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,610
天啊  那是
{\r原文字幕}Ooh, wow, is that a...

531
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,820
-那是乌佐项链吗  -是的  好眼力
{\r原文字幕}- Is that an Uzo necklace? - Yeah, good eye.

532
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,990
在非洲买的  很特别吧
{\r原文字幕}Got this in Africa. One of a kind.

533
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:10,740
真漂亮
{\r原文字幕}Beautiful.

534
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,620
我们需要你
{\r原文字幕}We need you.

535
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,210
不好意思  我要带这位帅哥离开一下
{\r原文字幕}Excuse me while I take this handsome thing away.

536
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,920
-拜托了  -当然可以
{\r原文字幕}- Please. - Absolutely.

537
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,220
女士们  先生们
{\r原文字幕}Ladies and gentlemen,

538
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,180
非常感谢大家来这个展览
{\r原文字幕}thank you so much for coming to this exhibit.

539
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,720
令人激动的是这位杰出的艺术家就在这里
{\r原文字幕}We are so excited to have this amazing artist here.

540
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,270
我们都很喜爱他在霍洛威展出的这些作品
{\r原文字幕}We love his work here in Holloway.

541
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,850
女士们先生们  隆重介绍  香农·德隆
{\r原文字幕}Introducing Shannon Delong, ladies and gentlemen.

542
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,690
女士们先生们  非常感谢各位今晚的莅临
{\r原文字幕}Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for coming out tonight.

543
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,280
我衷心地感谢
{\r原文字幕}I really appreciate that.

544
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,240
我想和不太了解我的人说
{\r原文字幕}Um, for those of you that don't know me,

545
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,120
我是个内向的人
{\r原文字幕}I am an introvert,

546
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,750
所以我不擅长在很多人面前
{\r原文字幕}which means I have trouble speaking in front of...

547
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,250
发言
{\r原文字幕}semi-large crowds.

548
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,930
但我希望你们能喜欢这个展览
{\r原文字幕}But I hope you enjoy the exhibit.

549
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,920
它的名字叫"古佐"
{\r原文字幕}It's called "Guzo."

550
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,250
源自我的埃塞俄比亚之旅
{\r原文字幕}It is from my travels in Ethiopia.

551
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,630
记住
{\r原文字幕}And remember...

552
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,220
今晚的大部分收入都将捐给慈善机构
{\r原文字幕}a lot of the proceeds tonight go to charity, so...

553
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,510
所以请多多消费
{\r原文字幕}please spend a large amount of money.

554
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,060
-了解  了解  -好吗  谢谢
{\r原文字幕}- Hear, hear. - Okay? Thank you.

555
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,350
祝您愉快
{\r原文字幕}Enjoy.

556
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,490
第二天我去上班
{\r原文字幕}The next day, I got to work,

557
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,740
我都不知道他是怎么知道我在哪里工作的
{\r原文字幕}and I didn't even know how he found out where I worked,

558
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,080
但就是发生了
{\r原文字幕}but there it was.

559
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,830
他在和我调情
{\r原文字幕}He was flirting with me.

560
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:38,290
已经二十五年没有人和我调过情了
{\r原文字幕}Nobody had flirted with me in 25 years,

561
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,960
让我的心小鹿乱撞
{\r原文字幕}and I had butterflies.

562
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,090
一个小鹿乱撞的成熟女性
{\r原文字幕}Grown-ass woman with butterflies.

563
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,630
真是一个美丽的悲剧
{\r原文字幕}It was beautifully tragic.

564
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,800
在了解一切之前  我喜不自禁
{\r原文字幕}Before I knew it, I was smiling and giddy.

565
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,760
我就像个女学生
{\r原文字幕}I felt like a schoolgirl.

566
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,560
我在想  "为什么  这个人是谁"
{\r原文字幕}I wondered, "Why? Who was this man?

567
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,600
"他为什么要和我调情"
{\r原文字幕}Why was he flirting with me?"

10568
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,060
{\fn方正兰亭中黑_GBK\fs11\pos(283,149)}你的埃塞俄比亚女性朋友
邀你共进晚餐
电话434-555-0128

569
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,330
有一个声音在我脑海里高呼
{\r原文字幕}That voice in my head was screaming,

570
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,980
"他想得到什么  他想得到什么"
{\r原文字幕}"What does he want? What does he want?"

571
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,770
但我已经被他迷住了
{\r原文字幕}But I was intrigued.

572
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:06,480
所以我打给萨拉问我该不该和他约会
{\r原文字幕}So I called Sarah to see if I should go out with him.

573
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,150
你绝对不会相信你的摄影师做了什么
{\r原文字幕}You will not believe what your photographer did.

574
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,660
需要我开车送你去吗
{\r原文字幕}Do you need me to drive you?

575
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,120
-因为你要去  打给他  -什么
{\r原文字幕}- 'Cause you are going. Call him. - What?

576
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,700
打给他
{\r原文字幕}Call him.

577
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:20,290
好的  好的  我会打的
{\r原文字幕}Okay, okay. I will.

578
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,960
你这个疯狂的催命鬼
{\r原文字幕}You are crazy and pushy.

579
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,670
我等了一天才给他电话
{\r原文字幕}I did wait a day to call him.

580
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,300
我不能表现得很饥渴
{\r原文字幕}I couldn't seem desperate.

581
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,300
打给你
{\r原文字幕}Call you?

582
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,720
我可不这么想  伙计
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, I don't think so, buddy.

583
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,890
但我的好奇心占了上风
{\r原文字幕}But curiosity got the best of me.

584
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,060
第二天去上班时  我对自己说
{\r原文字幕}When I got to work the next day, I said,

585
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,640
"你在搞什么"
{\r原文字幕}"What the hell?"

586
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,820
-喂  -你好
{\r原文字幕}- Hi. - Hi.

587
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,400
你好吗
{\r原文字幕}How are you?

588
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,360
别好像你知道我是谁似的
{\r原文字幕}Oh, don't act like you know who this is.

589
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,780
你是葛蕾丝吧
{\r原文字幕}It's Grace, right?

590
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,910
-是的  -你收到我的照片了吗
{\r原文字幕}- Yeah. - You got my photo?

591
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,750
-是的  收到了  谢谢  -不
{\r原文字幕}- Yes, I did. Thank you. - No.

592
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,920
我可不接受你在电话里感谢
{\r原文字幕}I'm not accepting your thank-you over the phone.

593
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,830
好  好吧
{\r原文字幕}Oh. O-Okay.

594
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,790
-我只接受在晚餐时说的  -好吧
{\r原文字幕}- Only over dinner. - Mm. Okay.

595
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,730
我知道一个完美  小巧
{\r原文字幕}I know this perfect, little, quaint,

596
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,050
复古的小餐馆
{\r原文字幕}hole-in-the-wall diner.

597
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,930
我觉得不错
{\r原文字幕}Well, I-I'm fine with that.

598
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:15,970
谢谢
{\r原文字幕}Thank you.

599
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,810
跟我说实话
{\r原文字幕}So, tell me something,

600
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,520
你是怎么找到我的
{\r原文字幕}how did you find me?

601
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,140
你在我的来宾名册上签了名
{\r原文字幕}You signed my guestbook.

602
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:25,150
你也说实话  为什么过了那么久才打给我
{\r原文字幕}Tell me something. Why'd it take you so long to call me?

603
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,740
我在那里遇到了位美丽的女士
{\r原文字幕}I mean, there I was, I met this beautiful woman

604
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,650
我想更多地了解她
{\r原文字幕}that I wanted to know a lot more about,

605
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,160
但她只让我傻站在那里  所以
{\r原文字幕}and she just kinda left me standing there, so...

606
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:40,040
我知道你身边有很多年轻漂亮的女人
{\r原文字幕}I know you've had many young, beautiful women.

607
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,000
我是说
{\r原文字幕}I mean, um...

608
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,000
我只是想知道
{\r原文字幕}I was just wondering.

609
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,080
为什么是我
{\r原文字幕}Why me?

610
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,750
首先  确实
{\r原文字幕}First of all, yes.

611
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,460
我得到的比我给予的要多
{\r原文字幕}I have had more than my share.

612
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,230
但随着年龄的增长
{\r原文字幕}But as you get older,

613
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,510
那些东西已经不再吸引我
{\r原文字幕}that kind of thing no longer interests you,

614
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,680
而你说的话却让我很感兴趣
{\r原文字幕}and you said something kind of interesting to me.

615
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,140
你说"为什么是我"
{\r原文字幕}You said, "Why me?"

616
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,930
因为人们  我们  总是喜欢这样对自己
{\r原文字幕}As people, we-- we tend to do that to ourselves.

617
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,310
总是问自己"为什么是我  为什么是我"
{\r原文字幕}It's always like, "Why me? Why me? Why me?"

618
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,940
难道不应该问"为什么不是你"
{\r原文字幕}Shouldn't the question be, "Why not you?"

619
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,900
离过婚你就会这样了
{\r原文字幕}Divorce will do that to you.

620
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:13,950
让你
{\r原文字幕}Make you...

621
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,030
质疑自己是谁
{\r原文字幕}question who you are.

622
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,490
那么  为什么离婚呢
{\r原文字幕}So, why get divorced?

623
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,140
两人的心渐行渐远
{\r原文字幕}People grow apart.

624
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,660
你为什么不结婚
{\r原文字幕}Why aren't you married?

625
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,250
这个问题
{\r原文字幕}That question, yeah.

626
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,750
现在我觉得是因为我从小居无定所
{\r原文字幕}Now, I-I guess it's just 'cause I grew up everywhere,

627
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,170
我总是搬家  典型的军人家庭的孩子
{\r原文字幕}and I was always kind of a gypsy. Military kid.

628
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,970
我去过  纽约  波士顿
{\r原文字幕}Uh, name it, New York, Boston,

629
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,300
亚特兰大  华盛顿  西雅图
{\r原文字幕}Atlanta, DC, Seattle,

630
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:43,470
韩国  马德里  日本  西非  诸如此类
{\r原文字幕}Korea, Madrid, Japan, West Africa, in that order.

631
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,600
随便说一种文化  我都见过  经历过
{\r原文字幕}Name a culture, I saw it. I experienced it.

632
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,730
但作为一个年轻人
{\r原文字幕}But that was also hard to, you know,

633
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,520
很难定居下来
{\r原文字幕}put down roots as a young man.

634
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,990
我从没想过要结婚
{\r原文字幕}I never wanted to be married.

635
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,700
老实说  我也不想承担这份责任
{\r原文字幕}If I'm honest, I really didn't want the responsibility,

636
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,770
而很多女人都沉迷于此
{\r原文字幕}and a lot of women are into that.

637
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,370
你肯定会惊讶
{\r原文字幕}You'd be surprised, you know.

638
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,000
是  我懂
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, I know.

639
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,370
但对一个孩子来说
{\r原文字幕}Yeah. But that had to be hard as a kid,

640
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,210
居无定所肯定不好过
{\r原文字幕}I mean, living everywhere.

641
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,960
确实  但对一个男人来说却很有趣
{\r原文字幕}It was. But it was fun as a man.

642
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,750
不  不是  我不是说
{\r原文字幕}No, not... I don't...

643
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,390
不是所有事情都跟那个相关
{\r原文字幕}'Cause not everything's about that.

644
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,210
你想歪了
{\r原文字幕}Your mind's in the gutter.

645
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,260
好吗  是的
{\r原文字幕}Okay? Yeah.

646
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,220
没有什么比
{\r原文字幕}I mean, seeing the world...

647
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,970
通过相机镜头来看这个世界
{\r原文字幕}...through the eyes of a 35-millimeter, there's...

648
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,720
更棒的事了
{\r原文字幕}nothing like that.

649
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:27,730
-这听起来很棒  -是的  我见过很多人
{\r原文字幕}- That sounds like fun. - It was. Met a lot of people.

650
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,980
但我从未遇见过陌生人
{\r原文字幕}But I never met a stranger.

651
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,940
比如  我们
{\r原文字幕}I mean, take us, for example.

652
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,990
-什么  -你和我在一块不舒服吗
{\r原文字幕}- What? - Well, don't you feel comfortable with me?

653
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,820
说实话
{\r原文字幕}Honestly?

654
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,200
老实说  我才刚认识你
{\r原文字幕}Well, honestly, I just met you.

655
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,740
如果我们彼此坦诚  就要一直这样
{\r原文字幕}And if we're being honest, let's keep being honest.

656
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,080
你老这样  你老是
{\r原文字幕}You keep doing this one thing. You keep doing this one--

657
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,790
你有一种模式  你喜欢评头论足
{\r原文字幕}You have a pattern. You judge.

658
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,000
你否认不了  因为我现在正看你这样做
{\r原文字幕}You can't say you don't, because I'm watching you do it.

659
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,960
-好吧  -你喜欢评头论足
{\r原文字幕}- Okay. - You judge.

660
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,170
这只是...
{\r原文字幕}You know, it's just...

661
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,460
这很难接受
{\r原文字幕}It's kinda hard...

662
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,780
当你走进房间  却发现你的丈夫
{\r原文字幕}you know, when you walk in the room, and you...

663
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,600
正在和他的秘书偷情
{\r原文字幕}find your husband having sex with his secretary,

664
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,140
现在她还成了他的妻子
{\r原文字幕}who is now his wife.

665
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,860
对此  我很抱歉
{\r原文字幕}I'm sorry to hear that.

666
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:15,610
谢谢你
{\r原文字幕}Thank you.

667
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,200
要来点酒吗
{\r原文字幕}Wine?

668
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,740
要
{\r原文字幕}Yes.

669
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,040
我很快就信任了他
{\r原文字幕}I did start to trust him very quickly.

670
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,040
我甚至不明白是为什么
{\r原文字幕}I don't even know why.

671
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:32,170
他很贴心  而且知道该说什么
{\r原文字幕}He was so kind, and... and he knew what to say.

672
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,880
他很绅士
{\r原文字幕}He was gentle.

673
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,880
我甚至不知道一个男人
{\r原文字幕}I didn't even know that a man could be

674
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,090
可以那样完美  让人感觉那样好
{\r原文字幕}that perfect, feel that perfect.

675
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,680
我不想结束我们的第一次约会
{\r原文字幕}I didn't want our first date to end.

676
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,550
他也不想
{\r原文字幕}And neither did he.

677
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:48,890
谢谢  凯特琳
{\r原文字幕}Thank you, Kaitlyn.

678
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:56,400
你前夫有一家抵押贷款公司  是吗
{\r原文字幕}So your ex, he, uh... he owns a mortgage company?

679
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,070
你为什么还提这事
{\r原文字幕}Oh... Why are you still on that?

680
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,650
好吧
{\r原文字幕}Okay.

681
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:04,160
如果一个男人问起你的前夫
{\r原文字幕}Hint, if a... if a man is asking about your ex,

682
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,990
是因为他想看看自己够不够格
{\r原文字幕}it's because he's trying to see how he measures up.

683
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,080
我能肯定
{\r原文字幕}And from what I can ascertain,

684
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,870
不像我  他很有钱  你也是
{\r原文字幕}unlike me, he's rich, and so are you.

685
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,250
他确实有一家抵押贷款公司
{\r原文字幕}Well, he owns a mortgage company.

686
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,300
但没我的份  我没钱
{\r原文字幕}Mm. Not me. And I'm not rich.

687
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,550
我离婚了  什么都没有了
{\r原文字幕}I left the marriage and everything in it.

688
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,390
你没争财产吗
{\r原文字幕}You didn't fight for the money?

689
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:28,140
对  完全没有  我什么都不想要
{\r原文字幕}Yeah. Not a thing, you know. No, I didn't want anything.

690
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,390
我只想离婚  我受够欺骗了
{\r原文字幕}I just wanted out. I was... tired of the lies.

691
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,850
我明白
{\r原文字幕}I get that.

692
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,940
我不知道这是为什么
{\r原文字幕}I don't know why that is,

693
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,060
为什么男人很难做到诚实
{\r原文字幕}why men have so much trouble just being honest.

694
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,730
所以你总是说真话吗
{\r原文字幕}And so you always tell the truth?

695
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,650
当然  这有时甚至会给我惹麻烦
{\r原文字幕}Absolutely, 100%. It-- It gets me in trouble sometimes,

696
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,860
因为我总是想什么就说什么
{\r原文字幕}because I have this thing where I just always say what's on my mind.

697
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,370
好吧
{\r原文字幕}Okay.

698
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:51,870
天啊  已经凌晨两点了
{\r原文字幕}Oh, my God. It is 2:00 a.M.

699
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:56,170
我明早七点得上班
{\r原文字幕}I have to be at work at, uh, 7:00.

700
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,590
那就这样吧
{\r原文字幕}Quit.

701
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,170
我还能再见你吗
{\r原文字幕}Am I gonna see you again?

702
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,430
你还想再见我吗
{\r原文字幕}Do you wanna see me again?

703
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,010
我不想你现在就离开
{\r原文字幕}I don't want you to leave now.

704
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,310
晚安
{\r原文字幕}Good night.

705
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,560
我甚至不记得我有多久
{\r原文字幕}I didn't even realize how long it had been

706
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,480
没被感动过了
{\r原文字幕}since I had been touched,

707
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,110
多久没有男人向我示好
{\r原文字幕}since I had a man reach for my hand.

708
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:24,900
我感觉沉寂多年的心又萌动了
{\r原文字幕}I felt something in me that I hadn't felt in years.

709
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:29,280
我试着去分辨这种感受和情感
{\r原文字幕}I tried to identify the feeling, the emotions,

710
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,540
但我无法集中注意力
{\r原文字幕}but I couldn't bring it into focus

711
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:36,080
因为它在恐惧中变得温暖起来
{\r原文字幕}because it was warmed over in fear.

712
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,460
我很害怕
{\r原文字幕}I was so terrified.

713
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,540
我头脑中响起了警报
{\r原文字幕}The alarms going off in my head,

714
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,130
我告诉自己  我太老了  没法再谈恋爱
{\r原文字幕}telling myself that I was too old for this shit.

715
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:46,300
在我脑中我听到他说  他想让我喜欢他
{\r原文字幕}In my head, I'm hearing that he's leading me on,

716
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,800
他是认真的
{\r原文字幕}that he wanted something.

717
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:52,060
我脑海里一直重复着他说的话
{\r原文字幕}So I kept repeating to myself what he said.

718
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,390
"为什么不是你呢"
{\r原文字幕}"Why not you?"

719
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,520
为什么不是我
{\r原文字幕}Why not me?

720
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,350
我从离婚那天起就一直在祈祷
{\r原文字幕}Maybe God had answered a seven-year-old prayer

721
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,560
也许这是上帝对一个祈祷七年之人的回应
{\r原文字幕}that I had prayed since my divorce.

722
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,650
或许就是他
{\r原文字幕}Maybe this was him.

723
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,740
不知为什么  他甚至比我还了解我自己
{\r原文字幕}Somehow, he knew me almost better than I did myself.

724
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,780
我的脑海里  心里想的都是他
{\r原文字幕}Ooh, he was in my head and well on his way to my heart,

725
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,160
我认识这个男人还不到两天
{\r原文字幕}and I hadn't even known this man for two days.

726
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,040
我知道我很傻
{\r原文字幕}I know I'm a fool.

727
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,710
-你不傻  -那这叫什么
{\r原文字幕}- You're not a fool. - Then what would you call it?

728
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,710
人性
{\r原文字幕}Human.

729
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,720
我不想再谈这个了
{\r原文字幕}I don't wanna talk about this no more.

730
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,720
不行  葛蕾丝  请继续
{\r原文字幕}No. Grace, please.

731
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,430
接着说
{\r原文字幕}Go on.

732
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,640
告诉我
{\r原文字幕}So, tell me.

733
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,390
他是个优雅的绅士
{\r原文字幕}He was a perfect gentleman.

734
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,430
你的梦想是什么
{\r原文字幕}What do you dream about?

735
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,560
梦想常伴随着心痛  所以我没有
{\r原文字幕}Dreams come with heartaches, so no.

736
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,520
不  不  不是
{\r原文字幕}No, no, no, no.

737
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,440
我知道你内心深处还是有梦想的
{\r原文字幕}I know, somewhere in that big heart of yours, you still dream.

738
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,440
说吧
{\r原文字幕}Come on.

739
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:48,070
我的梦想是做一名好母亲
{\r原文字幕}Well, my dream was to be a great mother.

740
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,530
而且我成功做到了
{\r原文字幕}And I managed to do that.

741
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,290
我有个好儿子
{\r原文字幕}Ah, I got a great kid.

742
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:59,080
他还得再念两年研究生
{\r原文字幕}Got about two more years in graduate school.

743
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,420
那是我一生中最骄傲的时刻
{\r原文字幕}One of the proudest moments of my life.

744
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,290
好吧
{\r原文字幕}Okay.

745
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,380
一说起你儿子你就很开心
{\r原文字幕}You beam about him when you talk.

746
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,970
哦  那可是我的心头肉
{\r原文字幕}Oh, that's my heart. Ah.

747
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,970
我只是不喜欢她娶的那个贱人
{\r原文字幕}I just don't like the tramp he's married to.

748
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,430
等等  告诉我你真实的感受
{\r原文字幕}Whoa. T-tell me how you really feel.

749
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:15,970
对不起  上帝  我刚说脏话了
{\r原文字幕}I know. I'm sorry, God. I don't call women names.

750
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,480
你刚刚就说了
{\r原文字幕}You just did.

751
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,480
是啊
{\r原文字幕}Yeah.

752
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,850
只是...
{\r原文字幕}It's just, he...

753
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,150
他应该娶个更好的人
{\r原文字幕}He deserves better.

754
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,230
但我得尊重他的决定
{\r原文字幕}But I gotta let him be an adult, you know?

755
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,240
确实
{\r原文字幕}That you do.

756
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,740
孩子就是孩子  你必须让他们犯错
{\r原文字幕}Boys will be boys. You have to let them make their mistakes.

757
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,990
听起来好像有人犯过一些错
{\r原文字幕}Spoken like someone who's made a few.

758
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,740
何止一些  犯过很多错
{\r原文字幕}More than a few. A lot.

759
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:40,540
但像你的儿子一样  我也很爱我的母亲
{\r原文字幕}But, like your son, I adored my mother.

760
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,500
你怎么知道他爱我
{\r原文字幕}How do you know he adores me?

761
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,840
他怎么会不爱你
{\r原文字幕}How could he not?

762
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:51,260
自从她来了  我们就不怎么聊天了
{\r原文字幕}Well, we don't talk as much... since she came around.

763
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,930
这真遗憾
{\r原文字幕}That's a shame.

764
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,640
我以前经常和我母亲聊天
{\r原文字幕}I used to talk to my mother...

765
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,020
每天都聊  有时一天聊三次
{\r原文字幕}every day, three times a day sometimes.

766
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,480
-这太幸福了  -是啊
{\r原文字幕}-Oh, wow, that's beautiful. - Yeah.

767
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:06,440
我已经连续几个晚上送你回家了
{\r原文字幕}You know, I've been walking you home several nights in a row now.

768
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,860
-对  -这  这很好
{\r原文字幕}- Yeah. - Yeah, it's been-- it's been nice.

769
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,110
但我从来没进过你家
{\r原文字幕}But I've never seen the inside of the house.

770
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,570
我有点好奇是为什么
{\r原文字幕}I'm just kind of wondering why that is.

771
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,550
是因为你家里有个男人吗
{\r原文字幕}Is it because you got a man in there?

772
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,370
这个房子归是你前夫买的吗
{\r原文字幕}Did your ex-husband buy the house?

773
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,080
他正拿了把辛普森那样的刀躲在树丛里吗
{\r原文字幕}Is he hiding in the bushes with an OJ knife?

-等等  -他有辆白色野马牌汽车吗
{\r原文字幕}- Oh, wait. - Does he own a white Bronco?

776
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,660
-别说了  -那是怎么回事
{\r原文字幕}- Stop. - What's happening?

777
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,710
不要说了  你知道我现在单身
{\r原文字幕}Just stop. Now, you know I don't have nobody,

778
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,880
房子里没人
{\r原文字幕}and ain't nobody in that house.

779
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,300
而且房子是我买的  谢谢
{\r原文字幕}And I bought my own house, thank you.

780
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,170
对不起
{\r原文字幕}Excuse me.

781
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,970
你知道这栋房子建于十八世纪吗
{\r原文字幕}You know this house was built in the 1800s?

782
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,760
而且是我自己重新装修的  谢谢
{\r原文字幕}And I refurbished it all by myself, thank you.

783
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,890
里面我费尽了心力装修
{\r原文字幕}A lot of blood, sweat, and tears in there.

784
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,060
但我爱这栋房子

785
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,850
这是我买的第一栋房

谢谢
{\r原文字幕}Thank you.

但是...
{\r原文字幕}Mmm, but...

791
00:40:58,910 --> 00:40:59,950
还是不行吗
{\r原文字幕}That's still a no?

792
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,160
目前还不行
{\r原文字幕}For now.

{\r原文字幕}Okay.

{\r原文字幕}French, maybe?

799
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,720
-行啊  -你喜欢法国吗
{\r原文字幕}- Okay. - You like French?

800
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,010
是的
{\r原文字幕}Oui, oui.

801

再见
{\r原文字幕}Au revoir.

804
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:36,910
在我二十几岁时  我会每晚外出
{\r原文字幕}Now, when I was in my 20s, I could do that, out every night,

805
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,990
但到这个年纪不会了
{\r原文字幕}but not so at this time in my life.

806
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:42,620
虽然工作很累  但没有关系
{\r原文字幕}I was so damn tired at work, but it didn't matter.

807
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:46,480
我觉得自己又活了过来  我自由了
{\r原文字幕}I felt alive again. I felt free.

808
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,590
我夜夜笙歌
{\r原文字幕}I mean, I was burning the midnight oil

809
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,750
疲惫不堪
{\r原文字幕}and the candle at both ends.

810
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,960
我会在桌旁睡着
{\r原文字幕}I was falling asleep at my desk,

811
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,630
有时和老板一起开会时也会睡着
{\r原文字幕}some days, in meetings with my boss.

812
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,090
我太疯狂了
{\r原文字幕}I was so out of my head,

813
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,220
但我不在乎
{\r原文字幕}but I didn't care.

814
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,350
在那家银行呆了这么多年  我不在乎
{\r原文字幕}All those years at that bank, and I didn't even care.

新信息

816
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,810
我喜欢想起我们在一起的每一刻
{\r原文字幕}I was loving every moment of being thought about

817
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,400
喜欢接到他的电话和短信
{\r原文字幕}and called and texted.

818
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,940
我幸福得像在天堂
{\r原文字幕}I was just in heaven.

{\r原文字幕}♪ Oh! Ride on Jesus ♪

{\r原文字幕}Three months came and went like three days,

821
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,750
我让他慢慢来
{\r原文字幕}and... and I had held him off,

822
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,000
我知道那个时刻会来临  他在努力
{\r原文字幕}but I knew the time was comin', and, oh, he was trying.

823
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:32,840
这个男人和我一起去教堂
{\r原文字幕}I mean, the man was going to church with me,

824
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,630
他甚至根本就不信教
{\r原文字幕}and he wasn't even the type at all.

825
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:38,340
他不喜欢教堂活动
{\r原文字幕}He was not into the church scene.

826
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:43,010
尽管他不信教  但这仍然很神奇
{\r原文字幕}Despite him not being into the church, it was still magical.

827
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,350
我们有很多共同点
{\r原文字幕}We had so much in common.

828
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,850
我说一句  他就能接下一句
{\r原文字幕}I could start a sentence, and he would finish it.

829
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,190
这太不真实了
{\r原文字幕}It was just unreal.

830
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,730
他就是我的灵魂伴侣
{\r原文字幕}He was really my soulmate.

831
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:55,230
我找到了我一直寻找的人  这感觉很棒
{\r原文字幕}I had found what I was looking for, and it felt so good.

832
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:01,030
越来越难坚持住  不让他靠近
{\r原文字幕}It was becoming harder and harder to hold out and keep him at bay.

833
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:04,990
我在沉沦  弥足深陷
{\r原文字幕}I was falling, and falling hard.

834
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,790

{\r原文字幕}We'd talk on the phone until the sun came up.

835

有几次甚至聊睡着了
{\r原文字幕}We even fell asleep on the phone a few times.

836
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:14,090

{\r原文字幕}I didn't even recognize this new person that I had become,

837

{\r原文字幕}and when I would tell myself to slow down, slow down,

{\r原文字幕}Ooh, wait, wait, no no, no.

-是的  -你太喜欢评头论足
{\r原文字幕}- Yeah. - You're judging too much.

{\r原文字幕}Okay, open, open.

860
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,610
香农  这真漂亮
{\r原文字幕}Oh, Shannon, that's beautiful.

861
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,280
亲爱的  这太美了
{\r原文字幕}Oh, baby, those are beautiful.

862
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,950
天啊
{\r原文字幕}Oh, my God.

863
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,910
快看它们  快看
{\r原文字幕}Look at 'em, look at 'em!

864
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,290
我想找个罐子  你可以把它们抓了装进去
{\r原文字幕}I need a jar. And you can catch 'em and put 'em inside...

865
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,670
你在干什么
{\r原文字幕}What are you doin'?

866
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,960
-葛蕾丝·沃特斯  -你在干什么
{\r原文字幕}- Grace Waters... - What are you doin'?

867
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:36,290
你愿意嫁给我吗
{\r原文字幕}...will you marry me?

868
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,630
-愿意  -你同意了吗
{\r原文字幕}- Yes. - Is that a yes?

869
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,720
快点  把戒指给我
{\r原文字幕}So, come on, give it to me.

870
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:48,810
我想都没想就答应了
{\r原文字幕}I said yes before I knew it.

871
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,480
不知为何  我对他无法抗拒
{\r原文字幕}I couldn't resist him for some reason.

872
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,900
他活力四射
{\r原文字幕}He was electric...

873
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,070
总是让我感觉很好
{\r原文字幕}...and so good at making me feel good.

874
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:04,740
这太不可思议了
{\r原文字幕}It was incredible.

875
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,910
你为什么要拍照片
{\r原文字幕}Why are you takin' pictures?

876
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:09,870
-往这边挪一点  -我度了大半生
{\r原文字幕}- Move this way... - Most of my entire life lived,

877
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:11,250
终于遇到他
{\r原文字幕}and here I was.

878
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:15,370
维多利亚的秘密
{\r原文字幕}Victoria's Secret.

879
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,960
我以为我已经不会再爱了
{\r原文字幕}I thought love was over for me.

880
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,960
我真的这样以为
{\r原文字幕}I really did.

881
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,880
那是我一生中最快乐的时光
{\r原文字幕}Those were the happiest days of my life.

882
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:25,010
直到
{\r原文字幕}Until...

883
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,100
拜托  告诉我还发生了什么
{\r原文字幕}Please, tell me what else happened.

884
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,180
你认识丹妮尔·米切尔吧
{\r原文字幕}You know Danielle Mitchell.

885
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:37,440
她死在了这里
{\r原文字幕}She died here.

886
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,190
她曾是你的客户
{\r原文字幕}She was your client.

887
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,490
我知道关于你的一些事  茉莉
{\r原文字幕}Now, I know a little something about you, Jasmine.

888
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,320
你从未辩护过
{\r原文字幕}You've never tried a case.

889
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:53,450
当他们看到你进来时  都说
{\r原文字幕}And word around here, when they saw you come in...

890
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,500
他们派了个公设辩护人办公室里
{\r原文字幕}was that they had sent me the worst of the worst

891
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,000
最烂的人给我
{\r原文字幕}of the public defender's office.

892
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,300
你赢不了
{\r原文字幕}You don't win.

893
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,380
你只会认罪
{\r原文字幕}You plead.

894
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:10,470
你就会干这个
{\r原文字幕}That's what you do,

895
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,310
对我来说  也没问题
{\r原文字幕}which was, uh, fine with me.

896
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,600
现在  把笔给我
{\r原文字幕}Now give me the damn pen.

897
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,620
-什么  她这么说的  -对  但她没错
{\r原文字幕}- What, she said all that? - Yeah, but she's right.

898
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:33,240
我在做什么  我拿到了签字的认罪协议
{\r原文字幕}I mean, what am I doing? I have the signed plea agreement.

899
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,910
我要把它送到地方检察官办公室去
{\r原文字幕}I'm just gonna take it to the DA's office, you know?

900
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,210
我只想结束这一切
{\r原文字幕}I just want to be done with all this.

901
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,840
我只想搬到布鲁克海文
{\r原文字幕}I just want to move to Brookhaven,

902
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,590
生一堆孩子  靠你养家糊口
{\r原文字幕}have a bunch of babies, and have you support the family.

903
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:47,510
-好的  没问题  -说真的
{\r原文字幕}- Yeah, okay. - Come on.

904
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:49,550
不  你只可能这样两周
{\r原文字幕}No, that'll last maybe two weeks.

905
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,640
-一周  -对  可能是一周
{\r原文字幕}- One. One. Yeah, probably. Probably one.

906
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:58,480
我知道这案子还有很多隐情  亲爱的
{\r原文字幕}I just know there's so much more to this story, baby.

907
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,690
我知道有隐情
{\r原文字幕}I just know there is.

908
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:04,440
-肯定有  -好的
{\r原文字幕}- There is. - Okay. Well...

909
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:05,990
她已经告诉了你那么多
{\r原文字幕}She told you that much,

910
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,950
不妨让她再告诉你故事的其余部分
{\r原文字幕}just get her to tell you the rest of the story.

911
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:11,530
不  我不管了
{\r原文字幕}No. I'm done.

912
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,030
我不管了
{\r原文字幕}I'm done.

913
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,000
不  你还得管
{\r原文字幕}No, you're not.

914
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,420
认罪协议办完了吗
{\r原文字幕}Is the plea deal done?

915
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,210
在这一点上
{\r原文字幕}At this point...

916
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,590
如果你想在这里度过余生
{\r原文字幕}if you wanna be in here for the rest of your life,

917
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:28,970
那就这样吧
{\r原文字幕}so be it.

918
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:31,050
我手上有你签署的协议
{\r原文字幕}I have your signed agreement.

919
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:33,010
现在只是等着把它交给地方检察官
{\r原文字幕}I'm just waiting to take it to the DA.

920
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,510
你说的对  我没有赢过任何官司
{\r原文字幕}And you're right about me not winning any cases,

921
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:39,270
或者根本就没有努力尝试过
{\r原文字幕}or not even trying one for that matter, but...

922
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,360
但我经手的大多是轻罪案
{\r原文字幕}most of my cases were simple misdemeanors

923
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:46,070
少数几个重罪案我是让其认罪了
{\r原文字幕}or a few felonies that I pled out.

924
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,280
但  葛蕾丝  我从没遇到过像你这样的人
{\r原文字幕}But, Grace, I've never met anyone like you.

925
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,070
我从没遇到过一个
{\r原文字幕}I never met anyone

926
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:53,370
让我从内心深处感觉到
{\r原文字幕}that I felt, in my heart,

927
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,160
她是无辜的人
{\r原文字幕}was innocent,

928
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,790
即使你告诉我你有罪
{\r原文字幕}even though you're telling me you're guilty.

929
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:02,370
你知道吗  葛蕾丝  我不知道该怎么帮你
{\r原文字幕}You know, Grace, I don't know how I can help you.

930
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,920
但如果你告诉我发生了什么
{\r原文字幕}But if you tell me what happened...

931
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:08,920
我保证我会试着帮你的
{\r原文字幕}I promise you I will try.

932
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,630
葛蕾丝  请告诉我还发生了什么事
{\r原文字幕}Grace, please tell me what else happened.

933
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,310
你上次讲到他向你求婚了
{\r原文字幕}You stopped at him asking you to marry him.

934
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:22,140
我们结婚了
{\r原文字幕}We got married.

935
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:24,810
那就像一阵旋风
{\r原文字幕}And it was a whirlwind.

936
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,400
是我一生中最快乐的时光
{\r原文字幕}It was the happiest time of my life.

937
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:33,990
我恋爱了
{\r原文字幕}I was in love.

938
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:38,790
他就是我理想中的那个男人
{\r原文字幕}He was everything I imagined and wanted in a man.

939
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:42,540
他说话的方式  抚摸我的方式
{\r原文字幕}The way he spoke, the way he touched me,

940
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,670
和我做爱的方式
{\r原文字幕}and the way he made love to me.

941
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,540
当他抱着我时  我感到非常安全
{\r原文字幕}When he held me, I felt so safe.

942
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:49,590
我心想  "这怎么可能
{\r原文字幕}I thought, "How is this possible?

943
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,670
每个人都应该如此快乐才对"
{\r原文字幕}Everyone should be this happy."

944
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,050
小女孩
{\r原文字幕}Baby girl.

945
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,090
他很棒
{\r原文字幕}He was wonderful.

946
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,890
我的梦中情人
{\r原文字幕}The man of my dreams.

947
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:00,180
-来吧  -你做了什么
{\r原文字幕}- Come on. - What have you done?

948
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,480
你知道我做了什么
{\r原文字幕}Ah, you know what I've done.

949
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,560
等等  让我坐起来
{\r原文字幕}Wait, wait, wait, let me sit up.

950
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:05,520
他曾对我那么好
{\r原文字幕}He was so nice to me.

951
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:08,900
那么体贴
{\r原文字幕}So sweet.

952
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,320
-不客气  -谢谢你
{\r原文字幕}- You're welcome. - Thank you.

953
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,530
那么和善
{\r原文字幕}So kind.

954
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,860
我枯燥机械的生活
{\r原文字幕}My life went from black-and-white and routine...

955
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:18,370
变得无比幸福
{\r原文字幕}...to happy and over-the-top.

956
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:19,410
你好
{\r原文字幕}Hey.

957
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:22,450
等等  亲爱的
{\r原文字幕}Hold on, hon.

958
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,500
我听说你喜欢红色
{\r原文字幕}I heard you like red.

959
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,540
-是的  而且我喜欢玫瑰  -这是送你的
{\r原文字幕}- Yes, I do, and I love roses. - Those are for you.

960
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:30,420
这个  是给我的
{\r原文字幕}And... this is for me.

961
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,340
不是吧
{\r原文字幕}Oh, no.

962
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:32,510
-是的  -不要
{\r原文字幕}- Oh, yes. - No.

963
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:33,470
是的
{\r原文字幕}Oh, yes.

964
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,090
但这就像看魔术表演一样
{\r原文字幕}But like watching a magic show,

965
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,600
我是如此盲目地深陷爱河
{\r原文字幕}I was so in love and so blinded

966
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,510
眼里只有他想让我看到的东西
{\r原文字幕}by what he was showing me in his hands

967
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:44,060
我从没想过他背后藏着什么
{\r原文字幕}that I never looked at what he was hiding behind his back.

968
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,810
好了  好了  不要拍了
{\r原文字幕}Okay, okay. Stop.

969
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,480
这些花很漂亮
{\r原文字幕}These are beautiful.

970
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:50,900
你也是
{\r原文字幕}So are you.

971
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:53,360
谢谢你
{\r原文字幕}Thank you.

972
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:56,530
但因为那些快乐时光
{\r原文字幕}But for all those happy days,

973
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,030
我坠入了无边的地狱
{\r原文字幕}I was in for twice as much hell.

974
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:04,960
所有的一切迅速崩塌  和开始时一样快
{\r原文字幕}And it all started to fall apart as quickly as it began.

975
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,060
不
{\r原文字幕}No.

976
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:27,770
还没有
{\r原文字幕}Not yet.

977
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,360
你喜欢那些萤火虫吗
{\r原文字幕}Did you enjoy the fireflies?

978
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:34,190
-你在和谁通话  -我也等不及想见你
{\r原文字幕}- Who are you talking to? - No, I can't wait to see you, too.

979
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:38,660
好  我明天再打给你
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, I'll call you tomorrow.

980
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:42,120
再见
{\r原文字幕}Bye.

981
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:46,620
你在和谁打电话
{\r原文字幕}Who were you talking to?

982
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,250
葛蕾丝
{\r原文字幕}Grace.

983
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:55,920
怎么了
{\r原文字幕}Yeah?

984
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,720
有两件事我很讨厌
{\r原文字幕}There's two things I don't like.

985
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:06,980
说吧
{\r原文字幕}Okay.

986
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,060
一个是被查岗
{\r原文字幕}One is being checked up on...

987
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,150
另一个是被怀疑
{\r原文字幕}and the other's being questioned.

988
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:20,950
好吧
{\r原文字幕}Okay.

989
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:26,120
我只是  想你了
{\r原文字幕}I just... I just missed you.

990
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:33,750
我也很想你
{\r原文字幕}I miss you, too.

991
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,900
他为什么非要到楼下打电话
{\r原文字幕}Why did he have to go downstairs to have the conversation?

992
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,230
然后他变得处处提防
{\r原文字幕}And then he got so defensive.

993
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:59,570
男人有时候就这样  可能没什么
{\r原文字幕}That's just men sometimes. It's probably nothing.

994
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,110
或者  可能他有外遇了
{\r原文字幕}Or it could be another woman.

995
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,490
你知道吗  萨拉
{\r原文字幕}You know what, Sarah?

996
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,830
这一切发生得太快了
{\r原文字幕}This all happened so fast.

997
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:09,620
好了  葛蕾丝  别小题大做
{\r原文字幕}Okay, Grace, don't go making a mountain out of a molehill.

998
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,580
好吗  可能真没什么
{\r原文字幕}Okay? It's probably nothing.

999
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:14,040
沃特斯女士
{\r原文字幕}Miss Waters?

1000
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,840
等等  怎么了
{\r原文字幕}Hold on. Yes?

1001
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,480
克莱德先生在会议室
{\r原文字幕}Mr. Clyde would like to see you

1002
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,800
他想马上见您
{\r原文字幕}in the conference room right away, please.

1003
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,090
好的  谢谢
{\r原文字幕}Okay. Thank you.

1004
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,140
萨拉  我得挂了
{\r原文字幕}Hey, Sarah, I gotta go.

1005
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,470
为什么要挂  亲爱的
{\r原文字幕}Why you gotta go, baby?

1006
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:28,180
-我老板想见我  -知道了
{\r原文字幕}- My boss wants to see me. - Oh.

1007
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,100
好吧  待会儿再跟你说
{\r原文字幕}Okay, talk to you later.

1008
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,440
我还觉得奇怪
{\r原文字幕}I thought it was strange

1009
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,110
为什么我老板和公司的管理层
{\r原文字幕}that my boss and all the corporate officers

1010
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:39,030
想在中午的时候见我
{\r原文字幕}wanted to see me in the middle of the day.

1011
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:42,400
我对他将宣布的重大消息一无所知
{\r原文字幕}I had no idea of the bombshell he would drop.

1012
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:44,160
克莱德先生  您想见我吗
{\r原文字幕}Mr. Clyde, you wanted to see me?

1013
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:48,620
我们对你的部门做了内部审计
{\r原文字幕}We just completed an internal audit of your department.

1014
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:52,750
你的账上少了37.9万美元
{\r原文字幕}$379,000 is missing from your accounts.

1015
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:54,460
一定是哪里搞错了
{\r原文字幕}Well, there has to be some mistake.

1016
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,170
是用你的公司账号和密码登录的
{\r原文字幕}It was signed for with your company ID, your password,

1017
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,630
你电脑的地址  你的笔记本电脑
{\r原文字幕}your computer's IP, your laptop,

1018
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,630
你的名字  你的密码
{\r原文字幕}your name, your codes.

1019
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:05,140
你怎么回事  葛蕾丝
{\r原文字幕}What is wrong with you, Grace?

1020
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,720
你以为我们会注意不到
{\r原文字幕}You thought that we wouldn't notice

1021
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,510
那笔钱被划走了吗
{\r原文字幕}that kind of money being moved?

1022
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,430
不  克莱德先生  我  我从没
{\r原文字幕}No, Mr. Clyde, I-I never

1023
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:11,850
你被解雇了
{\r原文字幕}You're fired!

1024
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,560
你被解雇了
{\r原文字幕}You're fired.

1025
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,060
我找不到话来为自己辩解
{\r原文字幕}I couldn't find words to defend myself.

1026
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:18,690
把那笔钱还回来  否则你就去坐牢
{\r原文字幕}I want that money, or you're going to jail.

1027
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:21,990
在我叫保安赶你出去之前  你自己走吧
{\r原文字幕}Now please leave before I have security escort you out.

1028
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:25,570
我太震惊了  他竟然那样对待我
{\r原文字幕}I was just so shocked that he would treat me like that.

1029
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,820
他们了解我的
{\r原文字幕}They knew me!

1030
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,700
我真不敢相信
{\r原文字幕}I couldn't believe this.

1031
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,950
我为这家公司工作了多年
{\r原文字幕}I had worked for this company for years.

1032
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,120
它也帮助我过上了好日子
{\r原文字幕}It had helped me have a good life,

1033
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:37,130
现在他们却因为我没做过的事开除我
{\r原文字幕}and they were throwing me out for something I didn't do.

1034
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:39,750
那是一些我永远不会做的事
{\r原文字幕}Something I would never do.

1035
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:42,050
这太可怕了
{\r原文字幕}It was horrible.

1036
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,630
我感到很恶心
{\r原文字幕}I felt sick to my stomach.

1037
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,090
但我不知道  这还不是最糟的
{\r原文字幕}But little did I know the worst was yet to come.

1038
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:51,930
-他不接电话吗  -不接
{\r原文字幕}- He's not answering? - No.

1039
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:55,890
他可能和昨晚跟他通话的那个人在一起
{\r原文字幕}He's probably with whoever the hell he was talking to on the phone.

1040
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:58,310
我真不敢相信
{\r原文字幕}I can't believe this.

1041
00:53:58,810 --> 00:53:59,940
我们刚结婚
{\r原文字幕}We just got married,

1042
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,860
他就可能出轨了  而我却傻坐在这里
{\r原文字幕}and he probably with some other woman, and I'm sitting up here,

1043
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,820
想搞明白怎么处理这个烂摊子
{\r原文字幕}trying to figure out what to do about this mess!

1044
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,360
葛蕾丝  快过来
{\r原文字幕}Grace, Grace, come on now.

1045
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,990
冷静点  告诉我你觉得是怎么回事
{\r原文字幕}Calm down, and tell me how you think this happened.

1046
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:09,410
我不知道  萨拉
{\r原文字幕}I don't know, Sarah.

1047
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,620
我不知道
{\r原文字幕}I don't know.

1048
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,370
我是说
{\r原文字幕}I mean,

1049
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:15,910
也许有人试图
{\r原文字幕}maybe somebody's trying--

1050
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,750
有人偷了我的账号  我不知道
{\r原文字幕}Somebody stole my identity. I don't know.

1051
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:23,710
你好
{\r原文字幕}Hey.

1052
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,420
你去哪里了
{\r原文字幕}Where you been?

1053
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:27,930
-我给你打了好几个小时电话  -是吗
{\r原文字幕}- I've been calling you for hours. - Have you?

1054
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:29,340

{\r原文字幕}-I was, uh... - With your new woman?

1056
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:37,020
你也带她去看了  带我去看过的萤火虫吗
{\r原文字幕}You take her to the fireflies like you did me?

1057
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:43,480
萨拉  你能回避一下吗  拜托
{\r原文字幕}Sarah, would you excuse us for a second, please?

1058
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:47,280
不  我哪里也不去
{\r原文字幕}No, I'm not going anywhere.

1059
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,860
我想和我妻子谈谈
{\r原文字幕}I'd like to talk to my wife.

1060
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:53,870

1062
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,170
你想在你朋友面前跟我吵架吗

你说的是谁

1075
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,030
因为我听见你给她打电话了
{\r原文字幕}'Cause I heard you on the phone.

1076

{\r原文字幕}I figured you'd like the shoot because...

1082
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,410
因为那是我向你求婚的地方
{\r原文字幕}that's where I proposed to you.

1083
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,830

{\r原文字幕}You know what's not gonna happen?

1084

{\r原文字幕}Maybe I'll try to call the IRS. I don't know.

1110
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,990
-我们一起想办法  -好的
{\r原文字幕}- We'll figure it out together. - Okay.

1111
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:38,200
别着急  别着急
{\r原文字幕}This is... Just breathe, just breathe.

1112
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,540
-过来  别着急  -谢谢
{\r原文字幕}- Come here, breathe. - Thank you.

1113
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,170
他真的很
{\r原文字幕}He was so...

1114
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,410
很担心
{\r原文字幕}...concerned.

1115
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,830
-来吧  给他们打电话  -好吧
{\r原文字幕}- Come on. Let's call 'em. - Okay.

1116
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,750
我们得搞定这件事
{\r原文字幕}We gotta get this.

1117
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:49,300
我们几乎一夜没睡  试着搞清发生了什么
{\r原文字幕}We stayed up most of the night trying to figure out what happened.

1118
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:50,960
你想到谁了  想到谁了
{\r原文字幕}Who do you got? Who you got?

1119
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,260
还是税务局的  我再试试
{\r原文字幕}Uh, the IRS again. Let me try...

1120
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:55,720
第二天  我起得很早
{\r原文字幕}The next morning, I got up really early

1121
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,970
报了警
{\r原文字幕}and called the police.

1122
00:57:57,510 --> 00:58:00,140
他们根本帮不上忙  你们有什么办法吗
{\r原文字幕}They were no help at all, so... Is there anything you can do?

1123
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,390
我去了银行
{\r原文字幕}...I went to the bank.

1124
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:03,680
抱歉  请问这是你的签名吗
{\r原文字幕}I'm sorry, is this your signature?

1125
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:05,640
和你的印鉴卡一模一样
{\r原文字幕}It matches your signature card.

1126
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:08,350
看上去像是我的签名  但这是什么
{\r原文字幕}Well, it looks like mine, but, uh, what is that?

1127
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,360
因为我根本没签过
{\r原文字幕}'Cause I didn't sign it.

1128
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,350
我们想知道你什么时候
{\r原文字幕}We need to know when you can

1129
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,940
可以还抵押贷款
{\r原文字幕}make the payment on your mortgage.

1130
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,900
已经逾期三十天了
{\r原文字幕}It's 30 days behind.

1131
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:16,820
什么抵押贷款
{\r原文字幕}What mortgage?

1132
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,530
我的房款四年前就付清了
{\r原文字幕}My house has been paid for for over four years.

1133
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:20,830
没错
{\r原文字幕}Well, it was,

1134
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:26,040
然后你抵押了37.5万美元
{\r原文字幕}and then you took out a $375,000 mortgage

1135
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,870
确切的说  是四十二天前
{\r原文字幕}exactly 42 days ago.

1136
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,330
你在说什么
{\r原文字幕}What are you talking about?

1137
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,790
付款已被直接取走
{\r原文字幕}The payments were set up as direct withdrawal,

1138
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,880
现在你的帐户透支了
{\r原文字幕}and your account is now overdrawn by...

1139
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,010
四千六百美元
{\r原文字幕}$4,600.

1140
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:39,010
等等
{\r原文字幕}Wait a minute.

1141
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,180
这不对
{\r原文字幕}This can't be right.

1142
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:46,350
等等
{\r原文字幕}Wait a minute.

1143
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:49,440
这不是我做的
{\r原文字幕}I didn't do this.

1144
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,940
就像我跟你的一个出纳员所说的
{\r原文字幕}But as I was trying to tell one of your tellers,

1145
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:55,820
我认为是人盗取了我的身份信息
{\r原文字幕}I think that somebody has stolen my identity.

1146
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:59,240
明白吗  怎么会发生这种事
{\r原文字幕}See, because how is this kind of stuff even possible?

1147
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,870
因为我没签过这个  我从没来过这里
{\r原文字幕}'Cause I didn't sign this, and I never came in here.

1148
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:02,870
这不是我的签的
{\r原文字幕}This was not me.

1149
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:04,200
已经公证了
{\r原文字幕}It was notarized.

1150
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,540
谁公证的
{\r原文字幕}By whom?

1151
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,750
弗林奇公证处
{\r原文字幕}Uh... Flynch Notary.

1152
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:11,630
等等  我可以借用一下吗  抱歉
{\r原文字幕}Hold on, can I just borrow this for a minute? Excuse me.

1153
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,300
-弗林奇公证处  -弗林奇公证处
{\r原文字幕}- Flynch Notary. - Flynch Notary.

1154
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:21,550
地址是西卡摩街2989号
{\r原文字幕}the address is 2989 Sycamore Street.

1155
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,720
主啊  发发慈悲吧
{\r原文字幕}Lord, have mercy.

1156
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:25,770
然后呢
{\r原文字幕}What is going on?

1157
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:27,930
很抱歉  在调查这件事的过程中
{\r原文字幕}I'm sorry, but while we look into this,

1158
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,240
我们还是需要你还款
{\r原文字幕}we're gonna need a payment

1159
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,020
这样你的房子才不会被没收拍卖
{\r原文字幕}so your house doesn't go into foreclosure.

1160
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,980
明白了
{\r原文字幕}Okay.

1161
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:34,360
然后呢
{\r原文字幕}What is going on?

1162
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,990
我去了西卡摩街
{\r原文字幕}I went to Sycamore Street,

1163
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:39,780
那是一座废弃的老房子
{\r原文字幕}and it was an old, abandoned house.

1164
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,160
邮件堆积如山
{\r原文字幕}The mail was piling up. It was...

1165
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:45,580
都是寄给一个叫阿·麦卡西的人
{\r原文字幕}All of it was addressed to somebody named A. McKathy.

1166
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:50,460
我很生气  一个陌生人居然这样坑我
{\r原文字幕}I was just upset that some stranger would do this to me.

1167
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,080
这太可怕了
{\r原文字幕}It was horrible.

1168
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:53,330
我回到银行
{\r原文字幕}I went back to the bank

1169
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:55,670
调取监控录像  然后
{\r原文字幕}to get video surveillance, and... and, well...

1170
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:00,050
那时我所知道的一切都破灭了
{\r原文字幕}That's when everything I knew shattered.

1171
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:06,390
是你干的
{\r原文字幕}You did it.

1172
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:09,850
什么
{\r原文字幕}What?

1173
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:14,770
你还好吗
{\r原文字幕}You okay?

1174
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:16,610
是你干的
{\r原文字幕}You did it.

1175
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:18,990
干了什么
{\r原文字幕}Did what?

1176
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,610
你去了我的银行
{\r原文字幕}You went to my bank,

1177
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,620
拿我的房子做了抵押
{\r原文字幕}and you took out a mortgage on my house.

1178
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:28,700
葛蕾丝  我不知道你在说什么
{\r原文字幕}Grace... I don't know what you're talking about.

1179
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:30,540
看看你的手机
{\r原文字幕}Check your cell.

1180
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,360
葛蕾丝
{\r原文字幕}Grace...

1181
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,740
我需要那笔钱  葛蕾丝
{\r原文字幕}I needed the money, Grace.

1182
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:13,160
哪个男人想向女人要钱
{\r原文字幕}And what kind of man wants to ask his woman for money?

1183
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,080
别这样
{\r原文字幕}I mean, come on.

1184
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,670
我有些债必须还给别人
{\r原文字幕}I had debts that had to be paid by some people

1185
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,670
这些债必须还
{\r原文字幕}that are not to be messed with.

1186
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:24,720
我只是觉得我们是夫妻  已经结婚了
{\r原文字幕}And I just thought because we're partners, we're married,

1187
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,050
所以我认为
{\r原文字幕}so I just figured that...

1188
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,300
你会给我那些钱
{\r原文字幕}you'd want me to have it.

1189
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:30,310
-你为什么不给  -天啊
{\r原文字幕}- Why don't you - Oh, my God.

1190
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:34,640
-你还偷了我单位的公款  -我没有
{\r原文字幕}- You stole the money from my job, too. - I did not.

1191
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:36,480
-你有  -我会还给你的  我会的
{\r原文字幕}- Yes, you did! -I'll pay you back. I'm gonna--

1192
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,650
我的账户
{\r原文字幕}My accounts?

1193
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,020
我  我的密码
{\r原文字幕}My-- My-- My passwords?

1194
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:42,440
是你做的吧  香农
{\r原文字幕}You did that, Shannon?

1195
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,490
是你干的
{\r原文字幕}You did that.

1196
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,030
不
{\r原文字幕}No.

1197
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,240
不
{\r原文字幕}N-no.

1198
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,620
我希望你把所有的钱
{\r原文字幕}I want you to give me back...

1199
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:57,130
都还给我
{\r原文字幕}all that money.

1200
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,740
我会坐牢的
{\r原文字幕}I can go to jail.

1201
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:05,840
钱在哪里
{\r原文字幕}Where-- Where is it?

1202
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:09,100
你得把钱还给我
{\r原文字幕}I need you to give me back that money.

1203
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:12,970
-不可能  -你说什么
{\r原文字幕}- I can't. - What the hell?

1204
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:14,060
现在是我的钱了
{\r原文字幕}It's mine now.

1205
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:16,520
你他妈的说什么
{\r原文字幕}What the fuck are you talkin' about?

1206
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:18,770
你了解本州的法律吗
{\r原文字幕}Do you know the laws of this state?

1207
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,480
因为我了解
{\r原文字幕}Because I do.

1208
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,240
作为你的合法丈夫
{\r原文字幕}And as your lawfully wedded husband,

1209
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,690
我有权花这笔钱
{\r原文字幕}I have every fucking right to that money!

1210
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:33,370
你得庆幸我有两部手机
{\r原文字幕}You lucky I got two phones.

1211
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,500
他还在说  而我什么也听不到了
{\r原文字幕}He was talkin', and I didn't hear anything.

1212
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,540
我不敢相信
{\r原文字幕}I couldn't believe this.

1213
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,290
我被骗了
{\r原文字幕}I had been conned.

1214
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:43,380
所有的一切都是谎言
{\r原文字幕}All of it was a lie.

1215
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,220
我明白  但我的大脑接受不了他所做的事
{\r原文字幕}I knew it, but my brain couldn't process what he had done.

1216
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:50,760
我一无所有
{\r原文字幕}There I was with nothing.

1217
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:53,180
他拿走了我的一切
{\r原文字幕}He had taken every bit of it,

1218
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:55,850
我输得很彻底
{\r原文字幕}and I was so lost.

1219
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:59,440
当初这个甜蜜可人的男人
{\r原文字幕}How could this sweet, loving man

1220
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:03,570
一瞬间变成了冷酷又算计的魔鬼
{\r原文字幕}become this cold, calculating demon in no time?

1221
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:07,110
我受不了这种背叛
{\r原文字幕}I was beyond hurt by the betrayal.

1222
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,200
你给我滚出我的房子
{\r原文字幕}I want you out of my house.

1223
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:11,380
滚出这里
{\r原文字幕}I want you out of my house,

1224
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:13,120
立刻马上滚出去
{\r原文字幕}and I want you out of my house, now.

1225
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,540
把烟灰缸拿给我
{\r原文字幕}And I want an ashtray.

1226
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,410
你个狗娘养的
{\r原文字幕}You son of a bitch.

1227
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,920
他在嘲笑我
{\r原文字幕}He was laughing at me.

1228
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,880
你一直在说"你的房子"
{\r原文字幕}You keep saying "your house."

1229
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:31,470
结婚证证明这是我们的房子
{\r原文字幕}That marriage license says our house.

1230
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:33,600
他拿走我的钱就已经够坏了
{\r原文字幕}It was bad enough that he had taken all my money,

1231
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:34,970
但他还在那里嘲笑我
{\r原文字幕}but here he was laughin'.

1232
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:36,850
-等着瞧  -我等着
{\r原文字幕}- You watch. - I'm watchin'.

1233
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:38,890
烟灰缸
{\r原文字幕}Ashtray.

1234
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:42,520
烟灰缸  婊子
{\r原文字幕}Ashtray, bitch!

1235
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,150
他不愿意走
{\r原文字幕}And he wouldn't leave.

1236
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:46,530
我报了警  我告诉了他们所有的事
{\r原文字幕}I called the police. I told them everything.

1237
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:48,130
这座房子不属于他
{\r原文字幕}He does not own this house,

1238
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:49,950
我买下这座房子四年了
{\r原文字幕}I've owned this house for four years.

1239
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:52,070
但是他们说他们无能为力
{\r原文字幕}They told me that there was nothing they could do,

1240
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:55,410
他们说我需要一名律师  因为这是民事案件
{\r原文字幕}and that I needed a lawyer because this was a civil matter.

1241
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:57,830
萨拉认识一位律师  我们去见了他
{\r原文字幕}Sarah recommended a lawyer, and we went to see him.

1242
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:59,080
一万美元
{\r原文字幕}Ten thousand dollars?

1243
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:02,750
律师告诉我他的佣金是一万美元
{\r原文字幕}The attorney told me that his retainer was $10,000,

1244
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:05,750
而且可能要等两年才能上法庭
{\r原文字幕}and it could be as long as two years to get to court.

1245
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,050
他已经拿了我这么多  萨拉
{\r原文字幕}He's already taken so much-- Sarah.

1246
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:09,510
我无计可施
{\r原文字幕}My hands were tied.

1247
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:13,430
我不知道该怎么办  我真不甘心
{\r原文字幕}I didn't know what to do. I was just so outdone.

1248
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:14,930
我的天呐
{\r原文字幕}Oh, my God.

1249
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,260
别急嘛
{\r原文字幕}Not yet.

1250
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:11,610
香农  你他妈从我的房子里滚出去
{\r原文字幕}Shannon, get your black ass out of my motherfucking house!

1251
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,200
快滚
{\r原文字幕}I mean it!

1252
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,770
他妈的尊重一下我的隐私
{\r原文字幕}Respect my motherfucking privacy!

1253
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:16,370
狗娘养的  你个狗娘养的
{\r原文字幕}You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch!

1254
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:17,370
我得给这些门上装把锁
{\r原文字幕}Get some goddamn locks on these doors.

1255
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:19,370
你这个混蛋
{\r原文字幕}You black-ass bastard!

1256
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:20,790
狗杂种
{\r原文字幕}You son of a bitch!

1257
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:22,620
什么
{\r原文字幕}What?

1258
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,460
你带我来你妈家
{\r原文字幕}So, you brought me to your mom's house?

1259
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,800
我妈住得比这里好
{\r原文字幕}My momma live better than that.

1260
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,170
-我们进行到哪里  -拜托
{\r原文字幕}- Where were we? - Come on.

1261
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,510
别管这些
{\r原文字幕}Don't worry about it.

1262
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:38,720
我悲痛欲绝
{\r原文字幕}Then it washed over me.

1263
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,390
心灰意冷
{\r原文字幕}I went numb.

1264
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:48,060
你体会过那种心灰意冷的感觉吗
{\r原文字幕}You ever had that numb feeling?

1265
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,980
就像你所经历的都不是真的
{\r原文字幕}Like what's going on with you can't be real?

1266
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:55,240
这不可能是真的
{\r原文字幕}It just can't be.

1267
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:01,410
我不敢相信我这种年纪
{\r原文字幕}I couldn't believe that I was this age

1268
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,500
还会让这种事发生在自己身上
{\r原文字幕}and I let this happen to me.

1269
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:07,080
这真棒
{\r原文字幕}That was great.

1270
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:09,210
我们还会见面吗
{\r原文字幕}Will I see you again?

1271
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:12,710
行  只要你妈不再冲进来
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, if your mom don't break in on us again.

1272
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:15,010
她不会的
{\r原文字幕}She won't.

1273
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:20,700
我有蠢到让这种情况发生吗
{\r原文字幕}Was I that stupid that I would let this happen?

1274
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:24,270
那不是我
{\r原文字幕}Not me.

1275
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:27,980
我受过教育
{\r原文字幕}I'm educated

1276
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:29,980
很聪明
{\r原文字幕}and smart.

1277
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:36,200
我真的孤独到
{\r原文字幕}Was I that lonely...

1278
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:39,910
会让这个蠢货
{\r原文字幕}...that I would let this fool

1279
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:41,830
占我的便宜吗
{\r原文字幕}take advantage of me?

1280
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:44,290
我不明白
{\r原文字幕}I didn't understand it.

1281
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:48,250
你应该加入我们
{\r原文字幕}Should've joined us.

1282
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,400
你以前这副表情就吓到过我  亲爱的
{\r原文字幕}That look killed me, baby.

1283
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:05,350
现在的表情和那时候一个样
{\r原文字幕}It's kind of like the same one you got now.

1284
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:09,350
香农  请把我的钱还给我
{\r原文字幕}Shannon, please give me my money.

1285
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:12,570
什么
{\r原文字幕}What?

1286
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:19,700
我就快被公司起诉了
{\r原文字幕}I'm looking at being prosecuted by my job.

1287
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:22,910
-葛蕾丝  又来了吗  -把我的钱给我
{\r原文字幕}- Grace, again with that? - Give me my money.

1288
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:24,200
-求求你  -葛蕾丝  葛蕾丝  葛蕾丝
{\r原文字幕}- Please. - Grace, Grace, Grace,

1289
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,790
葛蕾丝  葛蕾丝  葛蕾丝  葛蕾丝
{\r原文字幕}Grace, Grace, Grace, Grace.

1290
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:31,750
在我来看
{\r原文字幕}Now, the way I look at it...

1291
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,380
那些钱是你欠我的
{\r原文字幕}you owe me that money.

1292
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,840
是的  你想想
{\r原文字幕}Yeah. I mean, think about it.

1293
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,280
所有你享受到的性爱
{\r原文字幕}All the sex...

1294
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:49,100
以及我给你悲惨生活带来的欢乐
{\r原文字幕}and the joy I brought to your miserable fucking life!

1295
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,230
对
{\r原文字幕}Yeah.

1296
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:55,110
你欠我的
{\r原文字幕}You owe me.

1297
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:03,100
我的意思是
{\r原文字幕}I mean... um...

1298
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:06,320
我不是故意要对你大喊大叫
{\r原文字幕}I don't mean to yell.

1299
01:08:09,330 --> 01:08:11,040
你是一个好人  葛蕾丝
{\r原文字幕}You're a nice lady, Grace.

1300
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:15,000
你是一个非常好的人
{\r原文字幕}You're a very nice lady.

1301
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:19,590
真的是我见过最好的人  真的
{\r原文字幕}One of the nicest I ever met, really.

1302
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:28,180
这就是为什么我一直很难下手
{\r原文字幕}That's why it's been so hard for me to do this.

1303
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,310
是啊
{\r原文字幕}Yeah.

1304
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:37,730
我想我能做的最好的事就是告诉你真相
{\r原文字幕}I guess the nicest thing I can do is tell you the truth.

1305
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,330
你看  我是爱你的
{\r原文字幕}You see, I love you.

1306
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:53,120
我真的爱你  我
{\r原文字幕}I really do love you. I...

1307
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:58,460
我只是不能像你爱我那样来爱你
{\r原文字幕}I'm just never gonna love you the same way that you love me.

1308
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:07,350
像你这个年纪的女人  你知道
{\r原文字幕}And women your age, you know...

1309
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:09,430
要怎么说
{\r原文字幕}How's the phrase go?

1310
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,640
特别容易上钩
{\r原文字幕}Low-hanging fruit.

1311
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,390
单身
{\r原文字幕}Single.

1312
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:16,400
脆弱
{\r原文字幕}Vulnerable.

1313
01:09:18,690 --> 01:09:19,530
孤独
{\r原文字幕}Lonely.

1314
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:22,400
特别软弱
{\r原文字幕}Fuckin' weak.

1315
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:27,450
如果你仔细想想
{\r原文字幕}I mean, if you think about it...

1316
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,380
这都是你的错
{\r原文字幕}it's your fuckin' fault.

1317
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:31,660
你让这一切太容易
{\r原文字幕}You made this too easy.

1318
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:37,590
但你不想想
{\r原文字幕}But you don't think.

1319
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:49,600
葛蕾丝  我
{\r原文字幕}Grace, I'm hun--

1320
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:35,980
我不敢相信我竟然杀了他
{\r原文字幕}I couldn't believe that I had killed him.

1321
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:59,960
我坐上我的车  然后就一直开
{\r原文字幕}I got in my car, and I just drove...

1322
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:02,960
一直开
{\r原文字幕}and drove.

1323
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:06,590
当我清醒过来  我在极偏僻的地方
{\r原文字幕}Before I knew it, I was in the middle of nowhere.

1324
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:07,630
萨拉
{\r原文字幕}Sarah.

1325
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:12,300
他在我家地下室
{\r原文字幕}He's in my basement.

1326
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:16,730
我杀了他
{\r原文字幕}I killed him.

1327
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:20,980
你告诉萨拉你杀了他
{\r原文字幕}You told Sarah you killed him?

1328
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:22,150
对
{\r原文字幕}Yes.

1329
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:24,440
-你没有把尸体移走  -没有
{\r原文字幕}- And you didn't remove the body? - No.

1330
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,030
我把他留在那里了
{\r原文字幕}I left him there.

1331
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:29,360
萨拉去了我家
{\r原文字幕}Sarah went to the house.

1332
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:31,280
然后她打电话告诉我
{\r原文字幕}Then she called me and told me

1333
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,200
那里没有尸体
{\r原文字幕}there wasn't a body.

1334
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:35,660
他不见了
{\r原文字幕}He was gone.

1335
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:39,000
等等  你是在说他没死吗
{\r原文字幕}Wait, are you telling me he's not dead?

1336
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,830
不  我知道他死了
{\r原文字幕}No, I know he's dead.

1337
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,290
但他就是不在那里
{\r原文字幕}But he wasn't there.

1338
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:45,420
时间到
{\r原文字幕}Time's up.

1339
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,430
葛蕾丝  尸体在哪里
{\r原文字幕}Grace, where was the body?

1340
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:51,930
他在哪里
{\r原文字幕}Where was he?

1341
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:54,510
我不知道
{\r原文字幕}I don't know.

1342
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,020
你没跟我说  她告诉过你她杀了他
{\r原文字幕}You didn't tell me she told you she killed him.

1343
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:02,600
这种事情你不能瞒着我  萨拉
{\r原文字幕}You can't keep this kind of thing from me, Sarah.

1344
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:03,810
我想帮她
{\r原文字幕}I'm trying to help her,

1345
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:06,650
这种信息我必须知道
{\r原文字幕}and this is the kind of information that I need to know.

1346
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,690
所以你去了她家
{\r原文字幕}So you went to her house?

1347
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:10,570
对
{\r原文字幕}Yes.

1348
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,680
那你到了之后发生了什么
{\r原文字幕}And what happened when you got there?

1349
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,750
不管你说什么我都不会用来对她不利
{\r原文字幕}There is nothing you can say that I can use against her.

1350
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:21,460
好吗
{\r原文字幕}Okay?

1351
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:24,790
我担心的不止是她
{\r原文字幕}It's not just her I'm worried about.

1352
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:27,340
那是谁
{\r原文字幕}Who?

1353
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:30,800
如果你知道一些事情  却没告诉警察
{\r原文字幕}If you knew something and you didn't tell the police,

1354
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:33,180
这是犯罪  对吗
{\r原文字幕}that's a crime, right?

1355
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,720
如果地方检察官知道了  是的
{\r原文字幕}If the DA knew this, then, yes.

1356
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:39,060
你会被指控
{\r原文字幕}You would be charged.

1357
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:41,640
不是我
{\r原文字幕}Not me.

1358
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,980
她的儿子  马尔科姆
{\r原文字幕}Her son, Malcolm.

1359
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:45,560
他在那里
{\r原文字幕}He was there.

1360
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:47,860
马尔科姆吗
{\r原文字幕}Malcolm?

1361
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:51,320
那么他说了什么吗
{\r原文字幕}Well, did he say anything?

1362
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:53,740
你看到什么异常了吗
{\r原文字幕}Did you see anything unusual?

1363
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:56,330
他只是有点激动
{\r原文字幕}He was just a little agitated, and...

1364
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:58,950
太快了  他开车走了
{\r原文字幕}it was quick, you know? He-- He just drove away.

1365
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:01,330
那你进了屋后发生了什么
{\r原文字幕}Well, what happened when you got in the house?

1366
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:05,040
我去了地下室  但那里没有尸体
{\r原文字幕}I went down to the basement, but there was no body there.

1367
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:08,880
到处都是血迹  地下室楼梯上都是血迹
{\r原文字幕}There was just blood everywhere, all over the basement stairs.

1368
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,380
你觉得发生了什么
{\r原文字幕}What do you think happened?

1369
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:12,800
我觉得马尔科姆
{\r原文字幕}I think Malcolm...

1370
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:15,930
在我到那里之前带走了尸体
{\r原文字幕}took the body before I got there...

1371
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:17,680
或者
{\r原文字幕}or...

1372
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:21,640
或者葛蕾丝在头脑不清醒的情况下
{\r原文字幕}Or if Grace was in a state of shock,

1373
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,310
可能把尸体拖上来
{\r原文字幕}she might have dragged that body up

1374
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:24,520
装进了她的汽车后备箱
{\r原文字幕}and put it in the back of her car,

1375
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,860
开车到郊外  然后把尸体扔在了某处
{\r原文字幕}drove out to the country, and dumped it somewhere.

1376
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:29,900
不  没有  她没那么做
{\r原文字幕}Mm-mm. No, no. No, no. She didn't do that.

1377
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,320
我相信她
{\r原文字幕}I believe her.

1378
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:35,780
我只是太爱她了
{\r原文字幕}I just love her so much.

1379
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:40,120
很抱歉  萨拉女士
{\r原文字幕}I'm sorry, Miss Sarah.

1380
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,000
我只是  我
{\r原文字幕}I just... I...

1381
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,160
你已经为她尽力了  萨拉女士
{\r原文字幕}You did all you could for her, Miss Sarah.

1382
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:49,920
-没关系的  -我抱歉  萨拉女士
{\r原文字幕}- It's all right. It's all right. - I'm so sorry, Miss Sarah.

1383
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,170
-我会处理好的  -好  好的
{\r原文字幕}- I'll fix it. - Okay, okay.

1384
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:56,510
现在我们知道了她为什么想认罪
{\r原文字幕}Now we know why she wants to plead guilty.

1385
01:13:57,220 --> 01:13:58,100
为什么
{\r原文字幕}Why?

1386
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:00,890
为了保护她儿子
{\r原文字幕}To protect her son.

1387
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:09,570
-亲爱的  你要睡觉了吗  -等一会儿
{\r原文字幕}- Baby, you coming to bed? - In a little bit.

1388
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:11,110
亲爱的  你明天上班时
{\r原文字幕}Oh, babe, when you get to work tomorrow,

1389
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:12,480
能查一下香农·德隆吗
{\r原文字幕}can you look up Shannon Delong,

1390
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,450
别让别人知道
{\r原文字幕}without anybody noticing?

1391
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:16,030
我真的不应该那么做
{\r原文字幕}Uh, I really shouldn't do that.

1392
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:17,410
求你了
{\r原文字幕}Please?

1393
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:21,830
好吧  我看看我能做什么
{\r原文字幕}Okay. I'll see what I can do.

1394
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:23,700
谢谢
{\r原文字幕}Thank you.

1395
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:31,170
所以  她在试图保护她儿子和萨拉
{\r原文字幕}So you see, she's trying to protect her son and Sarah.

1396
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:33,260
现在我需要你们的帮助
{\r原文字幕}Now I need your help.

1397
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:35,510
茉莉  到我办公室来
{\r原文字幕}Jasmine, my office.

1398
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,130
今天晚上七点我家见  你们两个都来
{\r原文字幕}Meet me at my house at 7:00, both of you,

1399
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:39,430
好吗
{\r原文字幕}okay?

1400
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:40,640
好吧
{\r原文字幕}All right.

1401
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:42,930
她真的打算为她辩护了
{\r原文字幕}She's really gonna defend her.

1402
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:43,300
是啊
{\r原文字幕}Yeah,

1403
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,980
除非主张认罪协议的罗里先生不让她那么做
{\r原文字幕}not if Mr. Rory Plea-Deal has anything to say about it.

1404
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:47,140
你说的对
{\r原文字幕}You right.

1405
01:14:47,230 --> 01:14:49,400
我明白了  多谢
{\r原文字幕}I got it. Thanks.

1406
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:51,110
是地方检察官办公室打来的
{\r原文字幕}That was the DA's office.

1407
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:51,940
你想解释一下为什么
{\r原文字幕}You wanna tell me why

1408
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:53,730
他们还没收到葛蕾丝·沃特斯的认罪协议吗
{\r原文字幕}they don't have the plea from Grace Waters yet?

1409
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:57,530
事情有变  她不想认罪了
{\r原文字幕}There's been a change of events. She doesn't want to plead guilty.

1410
01:14:57,610 --> 01:14:59,160
她想庭审此案
{\r原文字幕}She wants to try the case.

1411
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,120
她负担不起出庭的费用
{\r原文字幕}She can't afford to go to trial.

1412
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,700
我们也负担不起出庭的费用
{\r原文字幕}This office cannot afford to go to trial.

1413
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,470
你应该干什么  你应该让她认罪
{\r原文字幕}What are you gonna do? You gonna plead.

1414
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:06,210
已经三周过去了
{\r原文字幕}It's three weeks away.

1415
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:07,790
这就是你打算做的吗
{\r原文字幕}Is that what you're planning on doing?

1416
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:08,870
是的
{\r原文字幕}Yes.

1417
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:10,290
很好
{\r原文字幕}That's great.

1418
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,390
你现在突然想当英雄了
{\r原文字幕}Now all of a sudden you want to be this hero

1419
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:13,250
你想出庭辩护吗
{\r原文字幕}and you want to try a case?

1420
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:14,920
你还没准备好  我一直在观察你
{\r原文字幕}You're not ready. I've been watching you.

1421
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:16,550
我给你这个案子是有原因的
{\r原文字幕}I gave you this for a reason,

1422
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:16,880
你擅长做认罪
{\r原文字幕}you plea.

1423
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:18,120
你接下来该这么做
{\r原文字幕}Here's what you're gonna do.

1424
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,550
你去监狱
{\r原文字幕}You're gonna go down to that jailhouse,

1425
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,180
让她在认罪书上签字
{\r原文字幕}and you're gonna get her to sign that plea,

1426
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:22,390
顺利完成此事
{\r原文字幕}and you're gonna get it done.

1427
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:26,480
没关系  我来做  我来  谢谢
{\r原文字幕}Never mind, I'll do it. I'll do it. Thanks.

1428
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:31,900
葛蕾丝  我时间不多了  现在
{\r原文字幕}Grace, I don't have a lot of time. Now...

1429
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:34,030
我觉得我们有足够多的合理性怀疑
{\r原文字幕}I think we have enough reasonable doubt

1430
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,780
去让陪审团注意
{\r原文字幕}to get that into the jury's mind,

1431
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:37,190
这意味着你可能会被判无罪
{\r原文字幕}and that means an acquittal.

1432
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:39,400
地方检察官接受认罪协议了吗
{\r原文字幕}Did the DA take the deal?

1433
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:41,490
不  不  听我说
{\r原文字幕}No, no, no. No, listen to me.

1434
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:43,400
我知道他死的那天
{\r原文字幕}I know Sarah and your son

1435
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,450
萨拉和你儿子都去过那个房子
{\r原文字幕}were at the house the day he died.

1436
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:47,000
谁告诉你的
{\r原文字幕}Who told you that?

1437
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,410
这是我的事
{\r原文字幕}This is my mess.

1438
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,170
是我把他们卷进来的
{\r原文字幕}I dragged them into this,

1439
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:53,500
我不会让我儿子进监狱的
{\r原文字幕}and I will not let my son go to jail.

1440
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:55,420
是你儿子帮你处理的尸体吗
{\r原文字幕}Did your son help you get rid of the body?

1441
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,420
不  他没有  别再问我这个问题
{\r原文字幕}No, he did not, and don't you ever ask me that again.

1442
01:15:58,590 --> 01:16:01,640
好吧  你听着  我的上司随时可能进来
{\r原文字幕}Okay, look, my boss is gonna walk into that door any minute,

1443
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:04,430
我要你告诉他你改主意了
{\r原文字幕}and I need you to tell him that you have changed your mind,

1444
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:05,760
你不想认罪
{\r原文字幕}and you do not want a plea.

1445
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:07,750
我对地方检察官的唯一要求
{\r原文字幕}The only thing I asked the DA to do

1446
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:10,080
就是把我关在离我儿子近的监狱
{\r原文字幕}was to put me in a prison close to my son,

1447
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:12,020
你想让我毁掉这个协议吗  绝不
{\r原文字幕}and you want me to jeopardize that? No!

1448
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,480
-但如果你无罪释放了呢  -你做不到
{\r原文字幕}- But what if you go free? - You can't do that.

1449
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:14,830
对
{\r原文字幕}Yeah,

1450
01:16:14,830 --> 01:16:17,400
如果你不让我帮你辩护  我没办法做到
{\r原文字幕}I know I can't if you don't let me fight for you!

1451
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:19,900
求求你  让我帮你辩护吧
{\r原文字幕}Please, let me fight for you!

1452
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:22,530
我能做到
{\r原文字幕}I can do it.

1453
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,830
茉莉  我就知道你在这里
{\r原文字幕}Jasmine, I had a feeling you'd be here.

1454
01:16:28,910 --> 01:16:29,750
你好
{\r原文字幕}Hi.

1455
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,790
我是罗里·加罗  茉莉的上司
{\r原文字幕}My name is Rory Garraux. I'm Jasmine's boss.

1456
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:37,340
我认为她一直在向你传递错误的信息
{\r原文字幕}And I think that she's been giving you some misleading information.

1457
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:39,090
我希望你明白
{\r原文字幕}I'd like you to understand something.

1458
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:41,220
我们反复看过你的案子
{\r原文字幕}My office has looked at your case up and down,

1459
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,920
我们认为认罪协议是个好主意
{\r原文字幕}and we think a plea is a good idea.

1460
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,640
那样的话  你可以离你儿子近一点
{\r原文字幕}That way, you can be near your son.

1461
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,600
我知道那对你来说很重要  对吧
{\r原文字幕}I know that's important to you, yes?

1462
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:50,310
所以我今天来的目的是想知道
{\r原文字幕}So my purpose here today is to find out

1463
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:52,940
你是否依然想认罪
{\r原文字幕}if it's still your intention to plead guilty.

1464
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:59,780
沃特斯女士  你想认罪吗
{\r原文字幕}Miss Waters, is it your intention to plead guilty?

1465
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:04,070
我想要庭审
{\r原文字幕}I wanna go to court.

11466
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:27,100
{\fs15\pos(296.1,87)}会见室

1467
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:26,090
我知道是你说服她这么做的
{\r原文字幕}I know you talked her into this.

11468
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:32,020
{\fs15\pos(310,145)}在监狱内
从事任何
性活动
都是重罪

1469
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,640
这个案子你要是输了
{\r原文字幕}When you lose this case,

1470
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,570
我向你保证
{\r原文字幕}I promise you,

1471
01:17:30,570 --> 01:17:33,230
你会被解雇  你的职业生涯到此为止
{\r原文字幕}you're fired, and your career's over.

1472
01:17:39,730 --> 01:17:40,780
希望我不会因此丢掉我的工作
{\r原文字幕}Hope I don't lose my job,

1473
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:41,990
但是我查过了  他没有前科
{\r原文字幕}but I ran him, and he's clean.

1474
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:44,070
该死  他是个行骗高手
{\r原文字幕}Damn it. He's a con artist.

1475
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:45,820
他可能有好几个化名
{\r原文字幕}He probably has several different aliases.

1476
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:49,860
好吧  你知道他其他的名字吗
{\r原文字幕}Well, okay. Uh, do you know any of them,

1477
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:50,410
或者你有指纹之类的吗
{\r原文字幕}or do you have fingerprints or something?

1478
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,580
我的天啊
{\r原文字幕}Oh, my God. Um...

1479
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:55,040
试试这个  虽然是老照片了
{\r原文字幕}Try this. It's a long shot,

1480
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,380
但看看有没有什么发现
{\r原文字幕}but see what happens.

1481
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:57,690
好把  亲爱的  我在开玩笑
{\r原文字幕}Okay. Babe, I was kidding,

1482
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:59,500
很好  又多了一件让我被开除的事
{\r原文字幕}but great. Another thing to get me fired.

1483
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,130
谢谢  亲爱的  好的
{\r原文字幕}Thanks, babe. Okay.

1484
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,470
我要传唤萨拉出庭作证
{\r原文字幕}Um... I'm gonna call Sarah to the stand.

1485
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:05,720
我不知道  可能会很棘手
{\r原文字幕}I don't know, that could be tricky.

1486
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,390
地方检察官不知道她打过电话给她
{\r原文字幕}The DA doesn't know that she called her.

1487
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:08,120
但如果他够厉害
{\r原文字幕}But if he's good,

1488
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,470
他可能会从她嘴里套出话来
{\r原文字幕}he could potentially get it out of her.

1489
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:11,770
不  不会  她很坚强
{\r原文字幕}No, no, no. No. She's strong.

1490
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:13,270
-我不知道  茉莉  -她很坚强
{\r原文字幕}- I don't know, Jasmine. - She's strong.

1491
01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:14,770
这样真的很冒险
{\r原文字幕}That's, uh, really risky.

1492
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:16,810
我需要建立她是个好人的人设
{\r原文字幕}I need to establish that she's a good person,

1493
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,980
还有比她最好的朋友更好的人选吗
{\r原文字幕}and what better person to do that than her best friend?

1494
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:20,190
-对吗  -对的
{\r原文字幕}- Right? - Yeah.

1495
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,400
对  确实是
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, that's true.

1496
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,320
我不知道  我什么都不知道了
{\r原文字幕}I-I don't know. I don't know anymore.

1497
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:28,450
除了满地血迹和消失的尸体我们还有什么
{\r原文字幕}Well, what else do we have besides blood pooling and no body? Huh?

1498
01:18:30,490 --> 01:18:33,250
好吧  我们只需要合理性怀疑
{\r原文字幕}Okay. All we need is reasonable doubt.

1499
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:35,370
好吧  我们再来一遍
{\r原文字幕}Okay, let's just start again.

1500
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:37,670
我们都看了三遍了  这里什么都没有
{\r原文字幕}This is the third time we've started. Look, there's nothing here.

1501
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:38,880
好吗  没有确凿证据
{\r原文字幕}Okay? There's no smoking gun.

1502
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,970
我们需要找到足够的间接证据
{\r原文字幕}Well, we need to find enough circumstantial evidence

1503
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:41,750
来证明这一点
{\r原文字幕}to become one.

1504
01:18:45,970 --> 01:18:46,800
怎么了
{\r原文字幕}What?

1505
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,390
没什么  那股激情
{\r原文字幕}Nothing. The fire.

1506
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:51,890
我们喜欢
{\r原文字幕}We love it.

1507
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:54,430
-我再看一遍  -我来看这个  茉莉
{\r原文字幕}- I'll start again. - I'm gonna take this file, Jasmine.

1508
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:55,600
你负责电话记录
{\r原文字幕}You get the phone records.

1509
01:19:02,690 --> 01:19:04,150
开庭陈词
{\r原文字幕}Opening statements.

1510
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:11,490
陪审团的女士们先生们
{\r原文字幕}Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

1511
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:16,120
今天  我们会毫无疑问地证明
{\r原文字幕}Today, we are gonna prove, without a reasonable doubt,

1512
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:17,750
这个女人
{\r原文字幕}that this woman...

1513
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:21,290
葛蕾丝·安妮·沃特斯
{\r原文字幕}Grace Anne Waters,

1514
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:26,210
冷血地谋杀了香农·德肖恩·德隆
{\r原文字幕}murdered Shannon DeShawn Delong in cold blood.

1515
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:28,550
她怎么做的呢
{\r原文字幕}How'd she do it?

1516
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:31,970
她用一根棒球棍
{\r原文字幕}Well, she took a baseball bat,

1517
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:33,560
就像这根
{\r原文字幕}like this one...

1518
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:37,770
生生把他打死了
{\r原文字幕}and she beat him to death.

1519
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:42,440
不仅如此  证据将表明她是怎么做的
{\r原文字幕}Not only that, the evidence is gonna show how she did it.

1520
01:19:42,730 --> 01:19:44,860
她的动机能够解释  她为什么要这么做
{\r原文字幕}The motive will show why she did it.

1521
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:46,860
但告诉人们
{\r原文字幕}And it's up to you

1522
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:50,660
违背法律的后果是什么  这取决于你们
{\r原文字幕}to show what happens to people who break the law.

1523
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:55,040
像葛蕾丝·安妮·沃特斯这样的冷血杀手
{\r原文字幕}People like Grace Anne Waters who are cold-blooded killers.

1524
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,660
像她这样  对人的生命
{\r原文字幕}People with no regard...

1525
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,410
毫无敬意的人
{\r原文字幕}for human life.

1526
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:03,250
这次  你们有机会
{\r原文字幕}You have a chance, at this time,

1527
01:20:04,210 --> 01:20:07,170
把葛蕾丝·安妮·沃特斯  一个杀人犯
{\r原文字幕}to take Grace Anne Waters, a murderer...

1528
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:11,260
永远地从社会中驱逐出去
{\r原文字幕}off the streets forever.

1529
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:18,350
布莱恩特女士
{\r原文字幕}Mrs. Bryant?

1530
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:26,610
布莱恩特女士
{\r原文字幕}Mrs. Bryant.

1531
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:29,610
你的开庭陈词
{\r原文字幕}Opening statements?

1532
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:45,760
你们已经听过了控方陈述
{\r原文字幕}You've heard the prosecution assert

1533
01:20:46,210 --> 01:20:49,170
说有证据证明她是有罪的
{\r原文字幕}that there is evidence to prove that she is guilty.

1534
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:51,930
我想让你们知道的是
{\r原文字幕}Well, we want you to know...

1535
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:56,390
同样的这些证据
{\r原文字幕}that that same evidence will prove

1536
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:58,960
将证明她是无罪的
{\r原文字幕}that she is not guilty.

1537
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:02,640
葛蕾丝·沃特斯不是一名冷血的杀手
{\r原文字幕}Grace Waters is not a cold-blooded killer.

1538
01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:04,310
她是一个奶奶
{\r原文字幕}She's a grandmother.

1539
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:07,020
她给流浪汉食物
{\r原文字幕}She feeds the homeless.

1540
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,530
她在主日学校教书
{\r原文字幕}She teaches Sunday school.

1541
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,780
她烤饼干
{\r原文字幕}She bakes cookies.

1542
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:14,160
看看她吧
{\r原文字幕}Just look at her.

1543
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:15,570
看看她
{\r原文字幕}Look at her.

1544
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,960
对于她而言  这就像一场噩梦
{\r原文字幕}This is a nightmare for her,

1545
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:22,460
对于任何一个以谋杀罪受审的
{\r原文字幕}and as it can be for anyone who is on trial for murder

1546
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:23,980
无辜的人来说都是
{\r原文字幕}and is innocent.

1547
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:26,500
葛蕾丝爱他的丈夫
{\r原文字幕}Grace loved her husband,

1548
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:29,590
她没有导致她丈夫的失踪
{\r原文字幕}and she did not cause his disappearance.

1549
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:31,760
我之所以说  "失踪"
{\r原文字幕}And the reason I say "disappearance"

1550
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:34,800
是因为  从证据来看  一直以来
{\r原文字幕}is because the evidence will show that there is, not now,

1551
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:38,720
直至现在  都没有证据表明有谋杀发生
{\r原文字幕}nor has there ever been, any evidence that a murder happened.

1552
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,970
没有发现尸体
{\r原文字幕}No body found.

1553
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:44,770
这是因为她没有杀他
{\r原文字幕}That's because she did not murder him.

1554
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,270
超越合理怀疑
{\r原文字幕}Beyond reasonable doubt.

1555
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:52,510
你们得忽略之前的结论
{\r原文字幕}That's the conclusion you need to get past

1556
01:21:52,510 --> 01:21:54,180
才能做出裁决
{\r原文字幕}in order to reach a verdict.

1557
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:57,280
这个案子还有很多疑点
{\r原文字幕}There are a lot of doubts here.

1558
01:21:58,950 --> 01:22:00,740
它们都不合理
{\r原文字幕}And they're all beyond reasonable.

1559
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:05,780
你们会发现的
{\r原文字幕}You'll see. You'll see.

1560
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,170
说得真好
{\r原文字幕}Wow, that was good.

1561
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,840
不用怀疑她
{\r原文字幕}Mm. Don't doubt her.

1562
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,670
当她不再怀疑自己的时候会容易得多
{\r原文字幕}It'll be a lot easier when she stops doubting herself.

1563
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:16,090
传唤你的第一位证人
{\r原文字幕}Call your first witness.

1564
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:18,720
指控方传唤马歇尔·托马斯警探
{\r原文字幕}Prosecution calls Detective Marshall Thomas.

1565
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:21,320
以作伪证应负惩罚为后果
{\r原文字幕}Do you solemnly affirm that you will tell the truth,

1566
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,210
你庄严承诺  尽其所知
{\r原文字幕}the whole truth and nothing but the truth

1567
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:24,430
所述之言纯属实言并且无任何隐瞒
{\r原文字幕}under the pains and penalties of perjury?

1568
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:26,310
-我宣誓  -托马斯警探
{\r原文字幕}- I do. - Detective Thomas...

1569
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:30,820
你是被叫到布鲁本巷1828号的警察吗
{\r原文字幕}were you the officer that was called to 1828 Bruben Lane?

1570
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:31,730
是的
{\r原文字幕}Yes.

1571
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:33,230
你们找到尸体了吗
{\r原文字幕}Did you find a body?

1572
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:34,530
我们没有
{\r原文字幕}No, we didn't.

1573
01:22:34,610 --> 01:22:37,410
所以你们假设这是死者的血液
{\r原文字幕}So you assumed that this was blood loss.

1574
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:39,740
不是假设  我们检测过DNA
{\r原文字幕}No assumption, we have DNA testing.

1575
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:43,330
DNA检测能确定血是什么时候留下的吗
{\r原文字幕}Well, can your DNA test determine when that blood was left there?

1576
01:22:43,410 --> 01:22:45,210
不能  血迹已经被清理干净
{\r原文字幕}No, the stains were cleaned up.

1577
01:22:45,290 --> 01:22:46,920
所以现场血迹有可能
{\r原文字幕}So it's a possibility that the blood

1578
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,420
在那里存在了很长一段时间
{\r原文字幕}could have been left there over time?

1579
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:51,000
可能吧  但是这不
{\r原文字幕}I suppose, but that's not--

1580
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:53,460
比如不同时间多次累加到等量血迹
{\r原文字幕}Like over several different times to add up to that same amount?

1581
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:55,720
这几乎不可能
{\r原文字幕}That's highly unlikely.

1582
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:56,970
我没问你可能不可能
{\r原文字幕}I didn't ask if it was likely,

1583
01:22:57,050 --> 01:22:59,800
我问的是  理论上有没有可能发生
{\r原文字幕}I asked was it reasonably possible that that could happen?

1584
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:03,390
有  任何事都有可能
{\r原文字幕}Yes. Anything's possible.

1585
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:05,680
我没有其他问题了
{\r原文字幕}No further questions.

1586
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:07,440
这种血迹喷溅
{\r原文字幕}The blood spatter.

1587
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,100
钝器伤的喷溅在这个位置正常吗
{\r原文字幕}Is that normal in this position for blunt force trauma?

1588
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:12,270
是的
{\r原文字幕}Yes.

1589
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:15,360
我看到这个照片  我看到
{\r原文字幕}See, so when I looked at this, I saw--

1590
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,530
反对  法官阁下  这不是问题
{\r原文字幕}Objection, Your Honor. Is there a question here?

1591
01:23:17,610 --> 01:23:18,820
反对有效
{\r原文字幕}Sustained.

1592
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:24,220
现场血迹有可能是原始血迹已经存在时
{\r原文字幕}So the trajectory of the blood could have been from

1593
01:23:24,230 --> 01:23:26,580
又被其他东西击中  所形成的吗
{\r原文字幕}something hitting it after it was already there?

1594
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:28,420
是的
{\r原文字幕}Yes.

1595
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:30,420
我没有其他问题了
{\r原文字幕}No further questions.

1596
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:35,090
你记得你八月十七日晚上在哪里吗
{\r原文字幕}Do you remember where you were the night of August the 17th?

1597
01:23:35,170 --> 01:23:37,380
你吸毒吗
{\r原文字幕}Do you use illegal narcotics?

1598
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:39,430
你跟德隆先生一起工作吗
{\r原文字幕}So you worked with Mr. Delong?

1599
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:41,930
你觉得他是个有责任心的年轻人吗
{\r原文字幕}Did you find him to be a responsible young man?

1600
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:43,220
你跟他上过床吗  女士
{\r原文字幕}Have you slept with him, ma'am?

1601
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,970
-反对  -反对有效
{\r原文字幕}- Objection. - Sustained.

1602
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,230
当他要求给你拍照片时  他有调情吗
{\r原文字幕}When he asked to take your picture, was he flirty?

1603
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:49,020
你让他这么做了吗
{\r原文字幕}Did you let him?

1604
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:50,940
反对  法官阁下  不能作为证词
{\r原文字幕}Objection, Your Honor, move to strike.

1605
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:52,650
-反对理由  -法官阁下
{\r原文字幕}- On what grounds? - Your Honor

1606
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:54,320
别让我再警告你
{\r原文字幕}Don't make me warn you again.

1607
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,400
你在商店里见过他吗
{\r原文字幕}Did you meet him there in the store?

1608
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:58,400
你知道他已经结婚了吗
{\r原文字幕}Did you know he was married?

1609
01:23:58,490 --> 01:24:00,910
你见过她和几个男人一起来教堂
{\r原文字幕}How many men have you seen her in church with?

1610
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:02,820
她跟这些男人有感情关系吗
{\r原文字幕}Was she affectionate with these men?

1611
01:24:02,910 --> 01:24:03,910
反对  法官阁下
{\r原文字幕}Objection, Your Honor.

1612
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:05,120
反对无效
{\r原文字幕}Overruled.

1613
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:07,410
我们现在怎么样
{\r原文字幕}How we doing?

1614
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:10,420
控方正在推翻我们的证词
{\r原文字幕}Well, the prosecutor is blowing us out the water.

1615
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:13,460
现在  你知道我没给你儿子打电话
{\r原文字幕}Now, you know I did not call your son.

1616
01:24:14,210 --> 01:24:15,050
谢谢
{\r原文字幕}Thank you.

1617
01:24:15,210 --> 01:24:17,710
但是我可以叫萨拉出庭作证
{\r原文字幕}But Sarah I can call to the stand,

1618
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:20,610
然后  通过问是不是她杀了香农
{\r原文字幕}and, um, I can raise reasonable doubt

1619
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:22,390
我可以提出合理怀疑
{\r原文字幕}by simply asking if she killed Shannon.

1620
01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:23,470
-听我说  -不行
{\r原文字幕}-Listen. - No.

1621
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,770
你没听我说吗  她是我朋友
{\r原文字幕}Now, you don't listen, do you? That is my friend.

1622
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:30,140
葛蕾丝  我真的觉得我们有机会
{\r原文字幕}Grace, I really feel like we have an in there

1623
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:31,480
-只要我们  -茉莉
{\r原文字幕}- if we can just. - Jasmine.

1624
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,900
你敢做  我保证
{\r原文字幕}Do it, and I promise you,

1625
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:35,730
我当场就承认我有罪
{\r原文字幕}I will stand up and scream I did it, that I'm guilty.

1626
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:38,860
好吧
{\r原文字幕}Okay.

1627
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:41,110
知道了
{\r原文字幕}All right.

1628
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:57,550
控方的证人们太有力了
{\r原文字幕}Wow, the prosecution has some unbelievably strong witnesses.

1629
01:24:57,630 --> 01:24:59,460
-我知道  -那你准备怎么办呢
{\r原文字幕}- I know. - So what are you gonna do?

1630
01:24:59,550 --> 01:25:01,170
我必须叫萨拉出庭作证
{\r原文字幕}I have to call Sarah to the stand.

1631
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:03,250
茉莉  如果你不去盘问她
{\r原文字幕}Jasmine, if you don't go after her

1632
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:04,180
告诉陪审团一些东西
{\r原文字幕}and give the jury something...

1633
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:05,390
你认为我不知道吗
{\r原文字幕}Don't you think I know that?

1634
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:07,510
但你不能只让她当个品德证人
{\r原文字幕}Okay, but you need her to be more than just a character witness.

1635
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,640
这个我也知道  我不能突然问她其他问题
{\r原文字幕}I know that, too. And I can't go left on her,

1636
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:10,680
不然葛蕾丝就输了
{\r原文字幕}or Grace'll lose it.

1637
01:25:10,770 --> 01:25:13,650
我还不能问她香农和葛蕾丝的关系
{\r原文字幕}And I can't ask her about Shannon and Grace's relationship,

1638
01:25:13,730 --> 01:25:15,990
因为指控方会用这个当作新的动机
{\r原文字幕}because that'll give the prosecution another motive.

1639
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:17,650
我知道  唐尼  好吗
{\r原文字幕}I got it, Donnie. Okay?

1640
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:18,730
好
{\r原文字幕}Okay.

1641
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:20,650
我只是想帮忙  好吗
{\r原文字幕}You know I'm just trying to help, right?

1642
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:22,320
-谢谢  -不客气  女士
{\r原文字幕}- Thanks. - Yes, ma'am.

1643
01:25:26,450 --> 01:25:27,660
宝贝  睡觉吧
{\r原文字幕}Babe, sleep.

1644
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:29,540
睡不着
{\r原文字幕}I can't.

1645
01:25:30,330 --> 01:25:31,410
会没事的
{\r原文字幕}It's gonna be fine.

1646
01:25:31,830 --> 01:25:32,660
会的
{\r原文字幕}It will.

1647
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:35,290
我只希望萨拉别搞砸了
{\r原文字幕}I just hope Sarah doesn't blow it.

1648
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:38,800
你  唐尼和特利萨已经帮她准备好了吧
{\r原文字幕}Well, you, Donnie, and Tilsa prepped her, right?

1649
01:25:39,210 --> 01:25:40,050
对  但是
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, but...

1650
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,470
我只剩她了
{\r原文字幕}she's all I have.

1651
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:48,180
别紧张  我明天会早点下班
{\r原文字幕}Stop stressing. I'm gonna be off early tomorrow.

1652
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:49,730
我会尽快赶过去
{\r原文字幕}I'm gonna get there as soon as I can.

1653
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:51,220
我会看着你把它拿下的  好吗
{\r原文字幕}I'm gonna watch you knock it out, okay?

1654
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:53,890
现在  睡觉吧
{\r原文字幕}Now, go to sleep.

1655
01:25:57,190 --> 01:25:58,270
米勒女士
{\r原文字幕}Miss Miller,

1656
01:25:58,730 --> 01:26:02,320
你能告诉法庭你和葛蕾丝的关系吗
{\r原文字幕}can you tell the court about your relationship with Grace?

1657
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:06,700
我们是好的朋友
{\r原文字幕}We're best friends.

1658
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:10,330
你们的关系有多好
{\r原文字幕}And how close are you two?

1659
01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:14,370
她就像是我的妹妹
{\r原文字幕}She's like the sister I never had.

1660
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:19,840
你们认识多久了  米勒女士
{\r原文字幕}And how long have you known each other, Miss Miller?

1661
01:26:20,670 --> 01:26:21,670
六年了
{\r原文字幕}For six years.

1662
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,090
在认识她的这段时间里  米勒女士
{\r原文字幕}And in that time of knowing her, Miss Miller,

1663
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:29,760
你见过葛蕾丝很暴力或者很愤怒吗
{\r原文字幕}have you ever seen Grace violent or angry?

1664
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:32,720
没有
{\r原文字幕}Oh, no. Oh, no.

1665
01:26:33,270 --> 01:26:36,770
哪怕在该动粗的时候她也不是个暴力的人
{\r原文字幕}She's not a violent person, even when she should be.

1666
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:38,230
你这话什么意思
{\r原文字幕}What do you mean by that?

1667
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:42,650
我见过有人很刻薄地对待葛蕾丝
{\r原文字幕}I have seen people be very mean to Grace,

1668
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:44,570
但是她依然为他们祈祷
{\r原文字幕}and she just prayed for them.

1669
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:48,530
现在  米勒女士  控方想让我们相信
{\r原文字幕}Now, the prosecution wants us to believe, Miss Miller,

1670
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:52,080
葛蕾丝是一个冷血的杀手
{\r原文字幕}that Grace is a cold-blooded murderer.

{\r原文字幕}I'm not gonna warn you again, Mrs. Bryant.

1673
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:58,420
只问问题
{\r原文字幕}Ask a question.

1674
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:03,210
米勒女士
{\r原文字幕}Miss Miller,

1675
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:08,010
葛蕾丝有能力杀人吗

1676
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:13,140
葛蕾丝吗  不  不会的
{\r原文字幕}G-Grace? Oh, no. No, no.

1678
01:27:16,390 --> 01:27:19,520
她有能力用球棒打人吗
{\r原文字幕}Is she capable of beating someone with a bat?

米勒女士
{\r原文字幕}Miss Miller,

对

{\r原文字幕}the night in question, August 17th?

1695
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:06,030
八月十七日晚她给你打过电话吗

你们说了什么
{\r原文字幕}What did you talk about?

1698
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:16,330
商量怎么给流浪汉提供食物
{\r原文字幕}How we were gonna feed the homeless.

1699
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:18,710
她具体说了些什么
{\r原文字幕}What exactly did she say?

1700
01:28:18,910 --> 01:28:21,500
只是说她对此很兴奋  然后
{\r原文字幕}Just that she was excited about it, and...

1701
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,340
我们聊了一会儿她儿子  马尔科姆
{\r原文字幕}we talked about her son, Malcolm, for a while.

1702
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:28,670
你们聊了多久

1704
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:34,430
那好吧
{\r原文字幕}Okay. Well...

1705
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:38,140
电话记录显示
{\r原文字幕}the, uh, phone record shows that

1706
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:42,150

{\r原文字幕}the two of you talked for less than two minutes.

1707
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,440

反对
{\r原文字幕}Objection!

1709
01:28:45,730 --> 01:28:46,900
反对理由
{\r原文字幕}On what grounds?

1710
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:49,940
上述通话记录并未作为呈堂证供
{\r原文字幕}This particular phone record was not in discovery.

1711
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:51,190
请上前
{\r原文字幕}Approach.

1712
01:28:56,910 --> 01:28:59,820
法官大人  辩方并未被告知有此通话记录
{\r原文字幕}Your Honor, the defense was not given this phone record.

1713
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:01,750
法官大人  如果你详细查看文件清单
{\r原文字幕}Your Honor, if you look at the list of documents,

1714
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:03,080

1715
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,320
但是  法官大人  我们并不知道
{\r原文字幕}But, Your Honor, we did not get this in discovery,

1716
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:08,080
该通话记录的存在  也没有时间查证
{\r原文字幕}this particular phone record, nor have we had the time to.

1717
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:11,950
这上面说此记录数月前就已提供给你们
{\r原文字幕}It says here that they were given months ago.

1718
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:16,470
我三周前才接手此案件
{\r原文字幕}Well, I was just given this case three weeks ago, and there was--

1719
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:18,060

{\r原文字幕}Your Honor, we can't be held responsible

1720
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:19,460
布莱恩特女士的无能承担责任
{\r原文字幕}for Miss Bryant's incompetence here.

1721
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:20,390
她早已拿到记录
{\r原文字幕}She had them.

1722
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:21,930
你继续
{\r原文字幕}You may continue.

1723
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:23,270
谢谢  法官大人
{\r原文字幕}Thank you, Your Honor.

1724
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:26,150
但是  法官大人  如果我们能
{\r原文字幕}But, Your Honor, if we can...

1725
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:29,020
请遵守审判规则  布莱恩特女士
{\r原文字幕}Welcome to trial, Mrs. Bryant.

1726
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:30,770
请立即回到你的座位
{\r原文字幕}Now, step away.

1727
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:45,960
好的
{\r原文字幕}Okay.

1728
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:48,880
我说到哪里了
{\r原文字幕}Where was I?

1729
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:51,340
通话记录
{\r原文字幕}Phone records.

1730
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:53,670
根据记录显示
{\r原文字幕}Now, they show...

1731
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:56,980
你们的通话不到两分钟  对吗
{\r原文字幕}that you spoke for less than two minutes, right?

1732
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:00,430
我确实记不清了
{\r原文字幕}I-I really don't remember.

1733
01:30:00,430 --> 01:30:01,850
时间太久了
{\r原文字幕}It's been so long ago.

1734
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:04,390
或许你还记得通话之后你做了什么
{\r原文字幕}Well, maybe you remember what you did after the call.

1735
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:05,520
你做什么了吗
{\r原文字幕}What did you do?

1736
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:08,860
很晚了  我去睡了
{\r原文字幕}Well, it was late, so I went to bed.

1737
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,910
那么为什么在几分钟后
{\r原文字幕}Well, then why was your cell phone used

1738
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,980
葛蕾丝家附近的信号塔
{\r原文字幕}and pinged to a cell tower

1739
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,150
收到了你使用手机的数据信息
{\r原文字幕}near Grace's home a few moments later?

1740
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:20,220
我不记得了
{\r原文字幕}I-I... I don't recall.

1741
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:22,960
她的电话记录显示有你的来电
{\r原文字幕}Her phone records show an incoming call from you.

1742
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,510
你给她打过电话吗
{\r原文字幕}Did you call her?

1743
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:27,670
米勒女士  在先前的证词中你明确表示
{\r原文字幕}Miss Miller, you made it very clear earlier in your testimony

1744
01:30:27,670 --> 01:30:28,920
你们是好朋友
{\r原文字幕}that you two are friends.

1745
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,280
我明白你十分关心她
{\r原文字幕}I understand, you care for her deeply.

1746
01:30:31,820 --> 01:30:34,200
-你是不是在包庇她  -我没有
{\r原文字幕}- Are you covering for her now? - No.

1747
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,430
那你能解释这些通话记录吗
{\r原文字幕}Then can you please clear up these phone records?

1748
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:38,890
她住在罗特维尔县  这地方很偏远
{\r原文字幕}She lives in Rotwell County. It's very rural.

1749
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:41,580
她给你打了一个电话  你打给她两次
{\r原文字幕}She called you once, you called her twice.

1750
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:42,220
为什么
{\r原文字幕}Why?

1751
01:30:42,590 --> 01:30:44,560
-我记不清了  -通话记录上都有
{\r原文字幕}- I don't remember. - It's on the phone records.

1752
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,890
她打给你  你们说了不到两分钟
{\r原文字幕}She called you, you spoke for less than two minutes.

1753
01:30:47,230 --> 01:30:49,730
然后你去了她家  又打给她
{\r原文字幕}Then you went to her house, you called her,

1754
01:30:49,730 --> 01:30:51,070
然后你回到了你家
{\r原文字幕}then you were at your house.

1755
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:53,470
你四十五分钟后再次打给她  这是怎么回事
{\r原文字幕}You called her again 45 minutes later. Why?

1756
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:54,980
我记不清了
{\r原文字幕}I don't remember.

1757
01:30:54,990 --> 01:30:56,540
米勒女士  你可知道
{\r原文字幕}Miss Miller, do you understand

1758
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:58,740
你会因伪证罪被判入狱吗
{\r原文字幕}that you can be put in jail for perjury?

1759
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:00,620
你知道什么是伪证罪吧
{\r原文字幕}You do know what perjury is, right?

11760
01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:05,380
{\pos(358,78)\fs10}非公勿入

1761
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:07,500
法官大人
{\r原文字幕}Your Honor...

1762
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,340
证人请回答
{\r原文字幕}The witness will answer.

1763
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:17,680
她告诉我她杀死了他
{\r原文字幕}She told me that she killed him.

1764
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:22,850
葛蕾丝  我很抱歉
{\r原文字幕}I'm sorry, Grace.

1765
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:28,230
我没有其他问题了
{\r原文字幕}No further questions.

1766
01:31:32,860 --> 01:31:34,840
布莱恩特女士  你还要问的吗
{\r原文字幕}Mrs. Bryant, your witness.

1767
01:31:36,530 --> 01:31:38,070
没有其他问题  法官大人
{\r原文字幕}No further questions, Your Honor.

1768
01:31:38,150 --> 01:31:39,110
好的
{\r原文字幕}Okay.

1769
01:31:39,950 --> 01:31:40,910
你可以下去了
{\r原文字幕}You may step down.

1770
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:47,870
布莱恩特女士  辩方是否终止辩诉
{\r原文字幕}Is the defense resting, Mrs. Bryant?

1771
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:49,790
辩方请求终止
{\r原文字幕}The defense rests.

1772
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:52,960
控辩于上午九点终止
{\r原文字幕}Closing arguments in the morning at 9:00 a.M.

1773
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,130
现在休庭
{\r原文字幕}We're adjourned.

1774
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,550
全体起立
{\r原文字幕}All rise.

1775
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:03,350
你尽力了
{\r原文字幕}You tried.

1776
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:24,080
你怎么能忽视通话记录呢
{\r原文字幕}How could you miss the phone records?

1777
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:26,950
我
{\r原文字幕}I,

1778
01:32:27,950 --> 01:32:29,330
我没看到  先生
{\r原文字幕}I didn't see them, sir.

1779
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:30,250
我
{\r原文字幕}I,

1780
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:33,980
我以为我看到了  但其实没有
{\r原文字幕}I thought I saw them, but I didn't-- I didn't see them,

1781
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:36,000
我完全乱了阵脚
{\r原文字幕}and I was just completely overwhelmed.

1782
01:32:36,090 --> 01:32:37,000
-我  -自乱阵脚
{\r原文字幕}- I... - Overwhelmed.

1783
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:38,480
你没看见吗  我可看见了
{\r原文字幕}You didn't see 'em? I saw 'em.

1784
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:41,510
因为我一直在跟进此事  我一直在观察
{\r原文字幕}'Cause I was shadowing you. I was watching it all along.

1785
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:48,120
我不明白  我从业二十五年了
{\r原文字幕}I don't get it. I... ...I just sit in that office for 25 years,

1786
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:50,910
看着你种小年轻入行  又跳槽去私人律所
{\r原文字幕}watching people like you come in, then go out to private practice,

1787
01:32:50,910 --> 01:32:52,230
去别的大公司  挣大钱
{\r原文字幕}go to other firms, make more money,

1788
01:32:52,230 --> 01:32:55,230
但我都尊重  我受不了的是你高冷的姿态
{\r原文字幕}but I respect it. I'm insulted by your callous demeanor.

1789
01:32:56,150 --> 01:32:57,360
你知道你刚刚做了什么吗
{\r原文字幕}You know what you just did?

1790
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,940
这是最起码的  你竟让证人在离开证人席时
{\r原文字幕}This is 101. You let a witness leave the stand

1791
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:01,610
说你的当事人是杀人犯
{\r原文字幕}saying that your client was a murderer.

1792
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:04,160
瞧瞧你干的好事
{\r原文字幕}That's what you did.

1793
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:07,030
他们整晚都会想这个
{\r原文字幕}That's what they're gonna think about all night long.

1794
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:11,230
我真不明白
{\r原文字幕}I don't get it.

1795
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,920
这种失误难得一见  我真是想不通
{\r原文字幕}I guess it's a millennial thing. I'll never understand it.

1796
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:46,320
亲爱的  来吧  吃一点
{\r原文字幕}Baby, come on, just eat a little bit.

1797
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:49,410
吃点吧  求你
{\r原文字幕}Please, come on.

1798
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:52,860
我不想吃  你是我爸吗  我不想吃
{\r原文字幕}I don't want it! Who are you, my father? I don't want it!

1799
01:34:03,050 --> 01:34:03,970
对不起
{\r原文字幕}I'm sorry.

1800
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:06,340
行了吧
{\r原文字幕}Okay?

1801
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:11,350
我现在压力太大了
{\r原文字幕}I'm just really stressed right now,

1802
01:34:11,930 --> 01:34:13,390
我知道你很生气
{\r原文字幕}and I know you're upset,

1803
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:16,060
但你听到他是怎么对我说话的了
{\r原文字幕}but you heard the way he talked to me.

1804
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:18,000
你为什么不帮我说话呢
{\r原文字幕}Why didn't you say something?

1805
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,420
因为我觉得他说的很有道理
{\r原文字幕}'Cause he made a lot of good points.

1806
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:21,260
虽然我不喜欢他的说话方式
{\r原文字幕}I don't like the way he said it,

1807
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:22,640
但他说的都是真话  茉莉
{\r原文字幕}but he was telling you the truth, Jasmine.

1808
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:23,780
忠言往往逆耳
{\r原文字幕}The truth hurts sometimes.

1809
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:29,120
真不敢相信你站在他那边
{\r原文字幕}I can't believe you're taking his side.

1810
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,620
亲爱的  我不是他那边的
{\r原文字幕}I'm not on his side, baby.

1811
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:32,120
我是你这边的  我是我们这边的
{\r原文字幕}I'm on your side, I'm on our side.

1812
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:33,980
我是会让你变得更好的那一边的
{\r原文字幕}I'm on whatever's going to make you better.

1813
01:34:34,290 --> 01:34:35,120
忠言很难入耳
{\r原文字幕}Truth is hard to get,

1814
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:37,280
但如果你能入耳  它会让你变强大
{\r原文字幕}but it can make you strong if you just let it.

1815
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:39,040
-你就是个混蛋  -我不是
{\r原文字幕}- You are such an ass. - I'm not the ass.

1816
01:34:39,130 --> 01:34:40,660
-你真混蛋  -我不是
{\r原文字幕}- You are such an ass! - I'm not the ass.

1817
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:42,880
-我绝不会弃你于危难而不顾  -真的吗
{\r原文字幕}- I don't walk away when things get hard. - Are you serious?

1818
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,920
-我非常认真  -真的吗
{\r原文字幕}- Yeah, I'm dead serious. - Really?

1819
01:34:45,010 --> 01:34:47,470
茉莉  你不能永远躲在协议认罪的
{\r原文字幕}You can't keep running away your whole life

1820
01:34:47,470 --> 01:34:49,010
案子后面逃避一辈子
{\r原文字幕}hiding behind plea deals, Jasmine.

1821
01:34:49,010 --> 01:34:52,350
我在努力  这就是我为这个案子辩护的原因
{\r原文字幕}I was trying! That's the reason why I'm trying this case.

1822
01:34:52,430 --> 01:34:54,350
好吧  有人说了几句打击你的话
{\r原文字幕}Okay, so somebody says something that sets you back,

1823
01:34:54,430 --> 01:34:55,600
你就放弃了  宝贝
{\r原文字幕}and you just walk away, babe.

1824
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:57,300
-这案子输了  -不  还没有
{\r原文字幕}- The case is lost! - No, it's not.

1825
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:58,680
你看到陪审团的态度了
{\r原文字幕}You saw the jury!

1826
01:34:58,680 --> 01:34:59,840
我该怎么办
{\r原文字幕}What am I supposed to do?

1827
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,560
你要做好你的本职工作  亲爱的
{\r原文字幕}You're supposed to do your job, babe!

1828
01:35:02,020 --> 01:35:03,030
坚持到底
{\r原文字幕}Till the end!

1829
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:05,700
真的  你天生就该干这一行
{\r原文字幕}I'm serious, the job you were born to do. That's...

1830
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:06,610
亲爱的
{\r原文字幕}Baby.

1831
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:10,320
审判之初我看到了你眼中的激情
{\r原文字幕}I saw the fire in your eyes when you started this case,

1832
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:12,620
出现失误后  你的激情一下就没了
{\r原文字幕}and I saw it just go away as soon as this moment happened.

1833
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:13,910
把激情找回来
{\r原文字幕}Just find it again.

1834
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:17,120
结束了
{\r原文字幕}It's done.

1835
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:19,080
案子已经结束了
{\r原文字幕}The case is closed.

1836
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:21,170
剩下的就只是结案陈词了
{\r原文字幕}All that's left is the closing argument.

1837
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:22,800
我无能为力了
{\r原文字幕}There's nothing I can do.

1838
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,260
那你最好准备一篇精彩的结案陈词
{\r原文字幕}Well, you better write one hell of a closing argument.

1839
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:31,930
我好累
{\r原文字幕}I'm tired.

1840
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:33,430
宝贝
{\r原文字幕}Babe.

1841
01:35:39,710 --> 01:35:42,620
你们已经听过不下四十五名证人的证词
{\r原文字幕}You've heard the testimony of over 45 witnesses

1842
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:44,360
所有证词都证明她有罪
{\r原文字幕}that have attested to her guilt.

1843
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:47,980
她最好的朋友指证她亲口承认了谋杀了他
{\r原文字幕}Her own best friend said she told her that she killed him.

1844
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:50,200
她比谁都了解她
{\r原文字幕}She knew her better than anyone.

1845
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:53,240
沃特斯女士杀害了香农·德隆
{\r原文字幕}Miss Waters killed Shannon Delong,

1846
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:56,500
并把他的尸体拖到乡下的沼泽地里
{\r原文字幕}and she dragged his body out to a swamp in the country,

1847
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,160
尸体因此失踪
{\r原文字幕}never to be found again.

1848
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:00,170
犯案手法十分残忍
{\r原文字幕}That's cold-blooded.

1849
01:36:00,830 --> 01:36:02,130
犯案过程精心设计
{\r原文字幕}That is calculated.

1850
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:04,550
这是一起有预谋的谋杀
{\r原文字幕}That is premeditated murder.

1851
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:07,630
请将她绳之以法
{\r原文字幕}And it's your job to bring her to justice.

1852
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:10,220
你们有责任判她有罪
{\r原文字幕}It is your job to find her guilty,

1853
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:12,010
我们完全信任你们
{\r原文字幕}and we have the utmost faith in you,

1854
01:36:12,090 --> 01:36:14,160
信任司法体制  你们会做出正确判断
{\r原文字幕}and our legal system, that you will.

1855
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:16,100
谢谢你们
{\r原文字幕}Thank you.

1856
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:21,100
布莱恩特女士
{\r原文字幕}Mrs. Bryant?

1857
01:36:24,270 --> 01:36:25,730
布莱恩特女士
{\r原文字幕}Mrs. Bryant.

1858
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:28,320
你还好吗
{\r原文字幕}Are you okay?

1859
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:33,690
辩方传唤萨拉·米勒出庭
{\r原文字幕}The defense calls Sarah Miller.

1860
01:36:33,950 --> 01:36:36,290
法官大人  控辩双方均于昨日同意终止
{\r原文字幕}Your Honor, both sides rested yesterday.

1861
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:37,910
请上前来
{\r原文字幕}Approach the bench.

1862
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:45,960
法官大人  双方均终止了控辩
{\r原文字幕}Your Honor, both sides rested.

1863
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:48,840
我知道这律师是个新手  但这太荒唐了
{\r原文字幕}I understand the counsel is a novice here. This is ridiculous.

1864
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:51,550
等等  检察官  布莱恩特女士
{\r原文字幕}Hold on, Counsel. Mrs. Bryant,

1865
01:36:51,630 --> 01:36:55,220
你清楚双方都终止控辩了吧
{\r原文字幕}you do understand that both sides have rested?

1866
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:56,430
我清楚  法官大人
{\r原文字幕}Yes, I do, Your Honor,

1867
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:59,560
但我想请米勒女士重新上证人席
{\r原文字幕}but I would like to recall Miss Miller to the stand.

1868
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:01,980
有何缘由
{\r原文字幕}On what grounds?

1869
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,940
她陈述后  我本应对她进行提问
{\r原文字幕}I should have questioned her after she said what she said,

1870
01:37:06,230 --> 01:37:08,230
我不应终止辩论
{\r原文字幕}and I should not have rested,

1871
01:37:08,230 --> 01:37:10,360
我想重新提问她  因为
{\r原文字幕}and I would like to question her again because--

1872
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:13,320
这不符合规矩
{\r原文字幕}That's not how this works.

1873
01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:17,370
终止控辩后  你就不能再传唤证人了
{\r原文字幕}Once you rest, you cannot call a witness.

1874
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,040
如有异议  可提起上诉
{\r原文字幕}Just take it up in appeal.

1875
01:37:19,390 --> 01:37:21,120
现在请做结案陈词
{\r原文字幕}Closing arguments right now.

1876
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:22,520
但是  法官大人  如果我能
{\r原文字幕}But, Your Honor, if I could just...

1877
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,800
退回去  陈词吧
{\r原文字幕}Step back and argue.

1878
01:37:27,460 --> 01:37:29,170
现在就去  律师
{\r原文字幕}Now, Counselor.

1879
01:37:40,390 --> 01:37:42,730
-辩方传唤萨拉·米勒  -法官大人
{\r原文字幕}- The defense calls Sarah Miller. - Your Honor...

1880
01:37:42,730 --> 01:37:45,350
布莱恩特女士  对此我已作出裁决了
{\r原文字幕}Mrs. Bryant, I have already ruled on that,

1881
01:37:45,350 --> 01:37:46,980
我不能再容忍
{\r原文字幕}and I will not tolerate any more--

1882
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:48,150
米勒女士  到证人席上去
{\r原文字幕}Take the stand, Miss Miller.

1883
01:37:48,610 --> 01:37:50,780
-去证人席  -布莱恩特女士
{\r原文字幕}- Take the stand. - Mrs. Bryant!

1884
01:37:51,530 --> 01:37:53,200
米勒女士  坐回去
{\r原文字幕}Miss Miller, sit back down.

1885
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:54,950
你不许上证人席
{\r原文字幕}You are not taking the stand.

1886
01:37:55,030 --> 01:37:57,410
两位律师  请去我的办公室
{\r原文字幕}Counselors, in my chambers now.

1887
01:37:57,410 --> 01:38:00,290
我不会去您的办公室  除非米勒女士
{\r原文字幕}I will not be going to Your Honor's chambers until Miss Miller

1888
01:38:00,290 --> 01:38:02,060
-上证人席  -对此我已有裁决
{\r原文字幕}- takes the stand. - I have ruled on the matter,

1889
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:04,750
你必须到我的办公室来
{\r原文字幕}and you will come to my chambers.

1890
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:06,800
米勒女士不上证人席
{\r原文字幕}I'm not going into Your Honor's chambers

1891
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,380
我就不去您的办公室
{\r原文字幕}until Miss Miller takes the stand.

1892
01:38:08,790 --> 01:38:10,550
米勒女士  请上证人席
{\r原文字幕}Miss Miller, take the stand, please.

1893
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:14,800
布莱恩特女士  如果你现在不来我的办公室
{\r原文字幕}Mrs. Bryant, if you do not come into my chambers right now,

1894
01:38:15,630 --> 01:38:19,460
我将以藐视法庭罪拘捕你
{\r原文字幕}I will hold you in contempt.

1895
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:23,680
辩方请萨拉·米勒上证人席
{\r原文字幕}The defense calls Sarah Miller to the stand.

1896
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:26,140
法警
{\r原文字幕}Bailiff.

1897
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:30,900
你能相信吗
{\r原文字幕}Can you believe this?

1898
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:39,070
你究竟在搞什么名堂
{\r原文字幕}So what the hell was that?

1899
01:38:39,340 --> 01:38:40,630
你在乎吗
{\r原文字幕}The hell do you care?

1900
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:42,100
反正我被炒了
{\r原文字幕}I'm fired anyway.

1901
01:38:43,410 --> 01:38:47,180
那倒是  所以你自暴自弃了吗
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, that's true. So you throw your life away anyway?

1902
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:50,640
这不正是你想要的吗
{\r原文字幕}That's what you wanted, isn't it?

1903
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,010
我想要什么了
{\r原文字幕}What I wanted?

1904
01:38:54,210 --> 01:38:56,550
-不是的  -如果这就是代价的话
{\r原文字幕}- No. - And if that's what it takes.

1905
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:58,640
她不该进监狱
{\r原文字幕}She shouldn't go to jail.

1906
01:38:59,010 --> 01:38:59,970
这不公平
{\r原文字幕}This is unfair.

1907
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:02,460
不公平  不公平  就是这个词
{\r原文字幕}Unfair, unfair. That's the word.

1908
01:39:03,820 --> 01:39:04,900
现在你懂了吧
{\r原文字幕}Now you get it.

1909
01:39:04,990 --> 01:39:07,100
一切都是不公平的  法律也不可能公平
{\r原文字幕}All of this is unfair. The law can be unfair,

1910
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:10,270
而你的职责就是走进法庭  让它公平
{\r原文字幕}but it was your job to walk into that courtroom and make it fair.

1911
01:39:11,420 --> 01:39:12,520
但恰恰相反  你做了什么
{\r原文字幕}But instead, what'd you do?

1912
01:39:12,610 --> 01:39:14,990
你在说服这个女人不接受认罪协议后
{\r原文字幕}Go to court half-assed after you convinced this woman

1913
01:39:15,070 --> 01:39:16,820
就半途而废了吗
{\r原文字幕}to not take a great plea deal?

1914
01:39:17,450 --> 01:39:19,990
瞧瞧吧  就是这么不公平
{\r原文字幕}Now look, it's all unfair.

1915
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:22,420
听着  我很喜欢你现在的这种个人信念
{\r原文字幕}Listen, I love this personal conviction that you got going on

1916
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:24,200
但现在时机不对
{\r原文字幕}right now, but it's on the wrong side of time.

1917
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:27,750
你不道歉  法官是不会放你出来的
{\r原文字幕}The judge is gonna make you sit here until you apologize.

1918
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,940
你觉得这很了不起  他让我们休庭
{\r原文字幕}You think that's something, he gave us a recess

1919
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:31,820
好让我们替你做结案陈词
{\r原文字幕}so that we can do your closing arguments.

1920
01:39:31,820 --> 01:39:33,420
唐尼激动坏了
{\r原文字幕}Donnie is thrilled.

1921
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:36,220
你不会被判无效辩护  你到底在想什么
{\r原文字幕}You weren't gonna get a mistrial. What the hell were you thinking?

1922
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:39,470
在这里好好享受吧
{\r原文字幕}Enjoy your time here.

1923
01:39:40,590 --> 01:39:41,470
喂  罗里
{\r原文字幕}Hey, Rory.

1924
01:39:43,010 --> 01:39:43,850
怎么
{\r原文字幕}Yeah?

1925
01:39:44,930 --> 01:39:45,980
去你妈的
{\r原文字幕}Fuck you.

1926
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:52,230
狱中激情
{\r原文字幕}Passion behind bars.

1927
01:39:53,150 --> 01:39:53,980
真不错
{\r原文字幕}Nice.

1928
01:39:58,610 --> 01:39:59,950
陪审团一致认为

1931
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:21,890
我没事  亲爱的
{\r原文字幕}I'm all right, baby.

1932
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,680

{\r原文字幕}It's all right.

1936
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:36,400
这是一个乌佐吗
{\r原文字幕}Is that an Uzo?

1937
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,940
在非洲买的  很特别吧
{\r原文字幕}Got this in Africa. One of a kind.

1938
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:44,030
我照顾他  没事的
{\r原文字幕}I got him. It's okay.

1939
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,790
你绝对不会相信你的摄影师做了什么
{\r原文字幕}You will not believe what your photographer did.

1940
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,710
需要我开车送你去吗
{\r原文字幕}Do you need me to drive you?

1941
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:56,880
因为你要去
{\r原文字幕}'Cause you are going.

我要给我的律师打电话
{\r原文字幕}I need to call my lawyer.

1947
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:15,270
陪审团裁决葛蕾丝·沃特斯有罪
{\r原文字幕}The verdict in the Grace Waters case is guilty.

{\r原文字幕}This turn of events is no shock to anybody

1950
01:41:20,870 --> 01:41:22,860
事态的转变并不令人意外
{\r原文字幕}who was in the courtroom today or the jurors.

1951

这是意料之中的
{\r原文字幕}This was what was expected.

1952
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:26,580
葛蕾丝被定罪是预料之中的事
{\r原文字幕}Grace was expected to be convicted,

1953
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:28,080
并没有什么变化

预计正在准备认罪协议
