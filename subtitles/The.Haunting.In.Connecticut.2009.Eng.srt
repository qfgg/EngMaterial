1
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,060
B mark.

2
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:04,436
- Frame.
- Action.

3
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:09,011
Why do you think
this happened to you?

4
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,512
You mean why do bad things
happen to good people?

5
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:15,319
That's the real question, right?

6
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:17,348
Why us?

7
00:02:17,653 --> 00:02:20,713
I mean, that's really
what everybody wants to know.

8
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:25,001
I moved into the house because
it's what we needed at that time.

9
00:02:25,197 --> 00:02:29,857
We didn't ask for this
and we didn't deserve it.

10
00:02:30,336 --> 00:02:33,396
The fact is, I don't know
why this happened to us.

11
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:37,342
We were just a regular family
like anybody else.

12
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,541
The doctors didn't believe that...

13
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:49,175
...he would survive,
and anyone who's had a sick child...

14
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:52,906
...would understand the feeling
that you're losing your grasp on them...

15
00:02:53,124 --> 00:02:58,264
...and something's pulling them
from the other side...

16
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,160
...which is really what was happening
in that house.

17
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:05,174
Please, God, don't make him suffer.

18
00:03:07,237 --> 00:03:09,497
Please make it work, or I'll never-

19
00:03:09,705 --> 00:03:14,335
You know, I hear that talking to yourself
is the first sign of losing it.

20
00:03:15,811 --> 00:03:19,251
I was not talking to myself.
I was talking to God.

21
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:24,119
Well, threatening the creator
of the universe is, like, step two.

22
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:26,023
That can't be good.

23
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:28,625
I was not threatening him.

24
00:03:28,828 --> 00:03:32,388
I was simply letting him know
how precious you are to me.

25
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:35,426
You gotta pull over, Mom.
I'm gonna be sick.

26
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:37,033
Very funny.

27
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:40,065
No, I'm serious.
I'm really gonna be sick.

28
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:44,669
It's whatever. Just don't look,
Mom, okay? I'm all right.

29
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:54,581
Come and get me,
wiener head.

30
00:03:54,787 --> 00:03:55,847
Hey, Mom.

31
00:03:56,055 --> 00:03:57,715
- Who you calling a wiener head?
- No.

32
00:03:57,923 --> 00:04:00,483
- Morning.
- Morning.

33
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:04,162
Didn't hear you come in.
What time did you get home?

34
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:06,061
Around 4.

35
00:04:06,263 --> 00:04:11,063
Jesus. I know it's a long way,
but how did it take you eight hours?

36
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:14,798
You really wanna know how many times
we stopped so he could vomit?

37
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,373
God.

38
00:04:18,111 --> 00:04:20,011
How is he now?

39
00:04:20,313 --> 00:04:23,253
He's all right.
I think he's still sleeping.

40
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:25,941
- Let me get breakfast. You go to bed.
- It's okay.

41
00:04:26,152 --> 00:04:29,322
Wendy's helping
and I'm kind of wired from driving.

42
00:04:29,523 --> 00:04:31,783
- Good morning, Aunt Sara.
- Morning, honey.

43
00:04:31,989 --> 00:04:34,579
- Sorry about the chaos.
- It's better than my house.

44
00:04:34,793 --> 00:04:38,063
- Take this in to the hungry hordes.
- Yes.

45
00:04:39,465 --> 00:04:40,585
Okay, guys. Here you go.

46
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:42,359
This is not good. One of these nights...

47
00:04:42,568 --> 00:04:44,698
...you'll drive off the road,
you'll be so tired.

48
00:04:44,903 --> 00:04:47,403
- I wish we could just move there.
- And in the meantime?

49
00:04:47,606 --> 00:04:48,896
Pay mortgage and a rent?

50
00:04:49,109 --> 00:04:51,079
And now we've taken in Wendy
and Mary and-

51
00:04:51,276 --> 00:04:53,706
One a built-in babysitter,
the other a little angel.

52
00:04:53,913 --> 00:04:55,313
I know, but...

53
00:04:55,515 --> 00:04:58,775
...every penny we have is sunken in
the business. We didn't plan on-

54
00:04:58,983 --> 00:05:02,183
Nobody plans on having a child
with cancer.

55
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:05,051
You know that's not what I meant.

56
00:05:06,157 --> 00:05:07,987
I know.

57
00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:25,326
Look, you're right. Let's just do it.

58
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:29,184
Let's get a rental house in Connecticut
near the hospital.

59
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:33,239
But what are you gonna do?
And how are we gonna afford it?

60
00:05:33,452 --> 00:05:35,582
I can come up on the weekends...

61
00:05:35,788 --> 00:05:38,308
...get a second mortgage
on our second mortgage.

62
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:40,985
We're gonna make it through this,
right?

63
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:42,791
Definitely.

64
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:49,657
See you.

65
00:05:50,036 --> 00:05:51,936
His skin may well get burned and red.

66
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,759
It'll blister like a bad sunburn.

67
00:05:54,572 --> 00:05:55,672
He threw up twice today.

68
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,871
Well, that's his cells dying
and being reborn.

69
00:05:59,077 --> 00:06:01,307
Basically, we're waging war
inside Matt's body...

70
00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:03,783
...and the battle's just begun.

71
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:05,382
That's what I'm afraid of.

72
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:08,894
But he qualified for the study, Sara.
That's good.

73
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:11,119
You did the right thing
by bringing him here.

74
00:06:11,326 --> 00:06:12,686
I know.

75
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,710
I don't wanna waste your time,
but how much you asking?

76
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:46,362
I'll give you the first month free if I don't
have to finish hammering in this sign.

77
00:06:52,498 --> 00:06:55,898
Just needs some love and care and
a good family to bring it back to life.

78
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:59,041
- So you don't mind children?
- Where would we be without them?

79
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:01,409
It's perfect.

80
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,370
I mean, it's everything we need.

81
00:07:03,578 --> 00:07:08,978
It's spacious and affordable and I'm
just wondering, where's the catch?

82
00:07:09,184 --> 00:07:10,744
Well...

83
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:12,392
It does have a bit of a history.

84
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:16,849
I saw one
that was almost perfect, but...

85
00:07:18,492 --> 00:07:19,962
It just...

86
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:23,185
It just wasn't right.

87
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:43,675
They said you'd have body aches,
but no nausea.

88
00:07:45,285 --> 00:07:49,545
Doctor says to patient,
"I've got bad news.

89
00:07:50,423 --> 00:07:54,723
You've got cancer
and you've got Alzheimer's."

90
00:07:55,095 --> 00:07:57,285
Patient says:

91
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:02,731
"Oh, man. At least I don't have cancer."

92
00:08:03,973 --> 00:08:06,073
At least you won't lose your hair again.

93
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,170
Well, that's something.

94
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:28,457
- I brought a mattress.
- I can't thank you enough.

95
00:08:28,663 --> 00:08:30,763
Oh, really, don't worry.

96
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:32,895
- Here's the keys.
- Thanks. Is the heat on?

97
00:08:33,101 --> 00:08:34,801
- Oh, it's really warm in there.
- Okay.

98
00:08:35,004 --> 00:08:38,504
All right. Now you get in and settle.
I'll take this.

99
00:08:40,774 --> 00:08:42,644
I don't know. You know, he was so sick.

100
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:46,301
And I like this place. It's what we need.

101
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:50,213
Well, I made an executive decision.
You weren't here.

102
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:54,459
And he was in so much pain. I just
couldn't put him through another mile.

103
00:09:32,728 --> 00:09:34,858
Oh, great.

104
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:34,679
Hey.

105
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:37,252
You okay?

106
00:11:39,288 --> 00:11:41,228
Yeah, it was just a bad dream.

107
00:11:43,094 --> 00:11:44,124
Okay.

108
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,233
Pick of the house, okay?
Any bedroom you want.

109
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,200
Drink this.

110
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,784
They're not that bad.

111
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:11,146
- All right. Cheers.
- Keep telling yourself that.

112
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,945
Great. Have you ever had one?

113
00:12:16,395 --> 00:12:17,945
Yeah.

114
00:14:13,012 --> 00:14:14,672
Matt?

115
00:14:16,414 --> 00:14:18,784
Matt, did you find a bedroom?

116
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:21,208
Yeah, I did.

117
00:14:33,901 --> 00:14:36,341
Or it kind of picked me.

118
00:14:37,137 --> 00:14:40,007
- What do you mean, it picked you?
- I don't know. It's the meds.

119
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,068
I don't know what I'm talking about.

120
00:14:42,274 --> 00:14:45,074
Well, which bedroom?

121
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:48,703
Down here?

122
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:50,675
- No.
- Why? Come on.

123
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:54,683
Look, it's nice and it's cool, and best,
it's got its own private bathroom.

124
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:56,907
Nobody has to hear me.

125
00:14:57,123 --> 00:14:58,593
You don't have to hide from us.

126
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,491
The fact that everybody can
hear me puking...

127
00:15:00,694 --> 00:15:02,424
...it just makes me feel worse, okay?

128
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:21,743
- What do you think's back there?
- I don't know.

129
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:24,914
- Hello. Anybody home?
- You okay?

130
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:26,139
Scared me.

131
00:15:26,354 --> 00:15:28,914
- Hello?
- We're down here.

132
00:15:29,123 --> 00:15:31,183
First one upstairs
gets first choice of rooms.

133
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:32,362
Mary.

134
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,160
Mary, wait until Aunt Sara and Uncle
Peter tell us where our rooms are.

135
00:15:36,364 --> 00:15:37,594
- Mary.
- No.

136
00:15:37,797 --> 00:15:40,287
- No, it's not fair. I want that room.
- Little monsters.

137
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,540
- No, watch it.
- I got it. I got it.

138
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:52,176
I'm not gonna croak from carrying
a lamp and an empty suitcase.

139
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:54,509
That's not what I meant.

140
00:15:54,715 --> 00:15:57,375
I was worried about you
scratching the truck.

141
00:15:57,618 --> 00:16:00,108
- Carry on.
- Okay.

142
00:16:03,857 --> 00:16:06,947
Well, it's a little dark, but,
hey, I was a teenager once.

143
00:16:09,862 --> 00:16:11,492
What's in here?

144
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:14,662
I don't know. I couldn't open it.

145
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:21,598
Well...

146
00:16:22,178 --> 00:16:24,838
The doorknob turns, but...

147
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:31,748
Maybe they sealed it for storage.

148
00:16:32,188 --> 00:16:34,778
Got a great room for Billy...

149
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:37,388
...and Mary.

150
00:16:38,058 --> 00:16:39,918
And this...

151
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:42,687
...I thought was a perfect room for you.

152
00:16:42,897 --> 00:16:44,327
And why do you say that?

153
00:16:44,531 --> 00:16:47,001
Well, because it's got a beautiful view...

154
00:16:47,201 --> 00:16:49,691
...and lots of space...

155
00:16:49,904 --> 00:16:53,604
...and a huge closet.

156
00:16:55,643 --> 00:16:57,913
- You like? Okay.
- Yeah.

157
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:09,024
Hey. I still don't know why
you wanna stay down here.

158
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,469
- Whoa, Mom.
- What?

159
00:17:36,651 --> 00:17:38,551
Are you okay?

160
00:17:41,055 --> 00:17:43,545
Yeah, just thanks for cleaning my room.

161
00:17:43,758 --> 00:17:44,918
No problem.

162
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:21,232
- Why'd you put the plates back?
- What?

163
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:25,062
Well, I put the plates out,
and now they're back.

164
00:18:25,768 --> 00:18:27,958
I didn't touch them, sweetie.

165
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:32,199
Are you all right?

166
00:18:39,048 --> 00:18:41,068
Oh, that's-
Know what, that was my fault.

167
00:18:41,283 --> 00:18:43,773
- They're too heavy.
- No, it's okay. I didn't drop them.

168
00:18:43,986 --> 00:18:45,776
- Well, how did they-
- I don't know. I-

169
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:48,149
I just saw them up there
and I just- I don't-

170
00:18:48,357 --> 00:18:51,257
- You know, Dr. Brooks said-
- I know what Dr. Brooks said, okay?

171
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:55,261
He said that if I'm seeing things,
then he'll drop me from the trial.

172
00:18:55,495 --> 00:18:57,785
- But if you-
- I'm not seeing things.

173
00:18:58,566 --> 00:19:03,326
I'm just- I'm tired. And I remember I put
the dishes too close to the edge, so...

174
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:05,938
You know, you tell me
if something like that happens.

175
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,395
- Promise?
- Yeah, I promise.

176
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:15,841
I'm so sorry I broke the dishes.

177
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:18,121
It's okay, sweetie.

178
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,990
Come on, come on.

179
00:19:28,698 --> 00:19:30,958
Got you. It. You're so-

180
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:34,326
Oh, the burgers. The burgers.
Wait, wait, wait.

181
00:19:34,704 --> 00:19:37,144
- Come and get me.
- All right.

182
00:19:48,085 --> 00:19:51,535
Remember when we used to go
camping when you were young?

183
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,120
Every night you would...

184
00:19:54,757 --> 00:19:58,157
...fall asleep counting the stars,
and you could never finish.

185
00:19:58,627 --> 00:20:00,747
Used to drive you nuts.

186
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:06,201
You know, most of the stars
that we see are already dead.

187
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,895
They look pretty alive to me.

188
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,973
That's because they haven't gotten
the news yet.

189
00:20:31,928 --> 00:20:33,448
Hey.

190
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:35,889
You all right?

191
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:38,868
Yeah. Everything's cool.

192
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:42,168
- You sure?
- Yeah.

193
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:44,457
All right.

194
00:20:45,174 --> 00:20:46,844
Give me five.

195
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:51,042
Up high. Down low. Too slow.

196
00:20:52,514 --> 00:20:54,144
I love you.

197
00:20:54,784 --> 00:20:58,154
You know, it's sort of like a vacation.

198
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:00,293
Yeah, if Matt wasn't sick-

199
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:03,292
And you get your own room,
like a big girl.

200
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,725
Sure you're not gonna be scared
in here all alone?

201
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,461
I've got my toys.

202
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,996
Okay.

203
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,691
You go.

204
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:14,797
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

205
00:21:15,005 --> 00:21:20,305
If I shall die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take. Amen.

206
00:22:10,294 --> 00:22:13,164
To bind the spirits.

207
00:23:31,475 --> 00:23:33,095
Noncontact dermatitis.

208
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:36,041
A trauma in one place manifests
on another part of the body.

209
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:37,767
It's not uncommon.

210
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:42,182
No fever. Excellent. Less nausea.
Good. Even a bit of an appetite.

211
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:45,047
Outstanding. And no visual
or auditory hallucinations...

212
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:47,229
...or other behavioral abnormalities?

213
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:51,286
Anything?

214
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:54,293
No.

215
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:56,702
Then we can continue to stage two.

216
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,394
Careful.

217
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,138
Watch your step.

218
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:07,373
Okay, you're almost there.

219
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,280
- Thank you.
- Okay.

220
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,715
I forgot my purse.
I'll be right back. Wait here.

221
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:17,251
- Okay.
- All right?

222
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,632
Mom?

223
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:38,095
The blue one that he takes for nausea?
Twenty-five bucks a pill.

224
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,510
I know. I tried.
But, Peter, I was on hold for an hour.

225
00:25:40,842 --> 00:25:42,542
Matt?

226
00:25:42,878 --> 00:25:44,468
Matt.

227
00:25:44,813 --> 00:25:46,513
Where are you?

228
00:25:46,715 --> 00:25:48,615
I'm in here.

229
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:07,993
How'd you get in here?

230
00:26:10,037 --> 00:26:12,557
What is this place?

231
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:30,979
Hop on.

232
00:26:35,497 --> 00:26:37,357
Take you for a ride.

233
00:26:44,307 --> 00:26:45,667
Slow down.

234
00:26:56,317 --> 00:26:58,147
Matt. Matt.

235
00:27:02,523 --> 00:27:04,223
Stop.

236
00:27:04,426 --> 00:27:06,546
Let me off!

237
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:09,619
Stop.

238
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:12,093
Matt. Matt.

239
00:27:17,337 --> 00:27:19,897
- What's going on down here?
- What's the matter with you?

240
00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:22,567
I guess I must've loosened it.

241
00:27:47,803 --> 00:27:49,673
Good Lord.

242
00:28:01,718 --> 00:28:04,208
Now we know
why the rent was so cheap.

243
00:28:10,457 --> 00:28:13,187
What did you know, and when the hell
did you know it? Jesus.

244
00:28:13,394 --> 00:28:14,954
Know what?

245
00:28:15,162 --> 00:28:16,392
What this place was.

246
00:28:17,732 --> 00:28:19,962
Aren't you the one
who says we can't live on lies?

247
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:22,637
Well, that's before,
when you were a drunk and a liar.

248
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,840
Right, but I'm not now.

249
00:28:28,746 --> 00:28:30,366
I know.

250
00:28:31,415 --> 00:28:32,905
I'm sorry, Peter.

251
00:28:33,117 --> 00:28:37,177
And you're right, I should've told you.
It just...

252
00:28:38,287 --> 00:28:43,247
We needed a place,
and it just seemed perfect.

253
00:28:48,064 --> 00:28:53,204
Okay, so we all know now
that this was a funeral home.

254
00:28:53,403 --> 00:28:55,203
Big deal.

255
00:28:56,639 --> 00:28:59,299
It's not now and it hasn't been
for years and years.

256
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:01,879
It's just a house.

257
00:29:02,713 --> 00:29:05,703
Bricks and nails and wood.

258
00:29:07,282 --> 00:29:11,222
It's our house until Matt finishes
at the hospital.

259
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,390
And we're all under a lot of stress...

260
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:16,019
...so we need to pull together
like a team, okay?

261
00:29:19,196 --> 00:29:22,996
Okay. So who wants to say grace?

262
00:29:23,735 --> 00:29:25,325
Matt?

263
00:29:33,543 --> 00:29:35,073
Matt?

264
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:58,687
- Matt.
- Jonah. Jonah.

265
00:30:27,565 --> 00:30:28,995
Honey?

266
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,958
Are you all right?

267
00:30:33,337 --> 00:30:34,297
Matt?

268
00:30:42,346 --> 00:30:44,136
- What's wrong?
- It's the medicine.

269
00:30:52,691 --> 00:30:54,621
Didn't you see it?

270
00:30:58,695 --> 00:31:00,315
Come on.

271
00:31:07,738 --> 00:31:08,798
So, what happened?

272
00:31:14,246 --> 00:31:17,266
Do you remember that book we
used to read when we were little kids?

273
00:31:17,483 --> 00:31:18,973
The one with all...

274
00:31:19,185 --> 00:31:20,375
...the weird pictures?

275
00:31:20,586 --> 00:31:22,446
The Man Who Wasn't There.

276
00:31:22,655 --> 00:31:24,415
Used to love that book.

277
00:31:24,621 --> 00:31:26,021
Yeah, I remember.

278
00:31:26,224 --> 00:31:31,864
As I was walking up the stair
I saw a man who wasn't there

279
00:31:32,063 --> 00:31:34,223
He wasn't there again today

280
00:31:34,432 --> 00:31:37,032
- Oh, how I wish he'd go away
- Oh, how I wish he'd go away

281
00:31:37,235 --> 00:31:38,755
Yeah.

282
00:31:41,974 --> 00:31:43,374
Do you remember the other one?

283
00:31:44,075 --> 00:31:45,865
Maybe. Which one?

284
00:31:48,414 --> 00:31:50,684
It was one bright day
In the middle of the night

285
00:31:52,182 --> 00:31:54,052
Two dead boys got up to fight

286
00:31:55,085 --> 00:31:56,945
Back-to-back they faced one another

287
00:31:57,154 --> 00:31:59,854
They drew their swords
And they shot each other

288
00:32:00,457 --> 00:32:02,117
A deaf policeman, he heard the noise

289
00:32:02,327 --> 00:32:05,787
And he came
And he killed those two dead boys

290
00:32:07,501 --> 00:32:08,871
Matt, you're scaring me.

291
00:32:14,107 --> 00:32:16,297
Well, join the club.

292
00:32:54,212 --> 00:32:57,812
Oh, now, that didn't hurt.

293
00:33:01,555 --> 00:33:03,045
You were dreaming.

294
00:33:03,256 --> 00:33:05,616
Been breathing heavy,
and so, of course...

295
00:33:05,826 --> 00:33:10,626
...it can either mean it was
a very bad dream or a very good one.

296
00:33:12,132 --> 00:33:13,962
Well, I've had better.

297
00:33:20,706 --> 00:33:24,336
I don't know, it's just, like,
that sometimes lately it's been tough.

298
00:33:24,911 --> 00:33:26,101
What?

299
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:30,779
I don't know, like, do you ever,
like, see things?

300
00:33:30,984 --> 00:33:33,954
Like, hear things that just-
They can't be there?

301
00:33:36,523 --> 00:33:41,693
You don't ever wanna tell them
you can see things, okay?

302
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,155
They're not gonna understand.

303
00:33:48,066 --> 00:33:49,756
I remember when my wife was dying...

304
00:33:49,969 --> 00:33:54,169
...that whole last day
I sat there praying, crying.

305
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,840
And she never once looked up at me.

306
00:33:58,546 --> 00:34:01,606
She just looked all around her.

307
00:34:02,316 --> 00:34:04,906
At all the others in the room.

308
00:34:05,954 --> 00:34:07,684
But we were alone.

309
00:34:09,123 --> 00:34:11,063
Or so I thought.

310
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,999
See, she was where we are.

311
00:34:17,163 --> 00:34:19,063
In the valley...

312
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,930
...of the shadow of death.

313
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:31,444
Hey, you know what to do
when you find yourself in the valley?

314
00:34:32,413 --> 00:34:33,383
No.

315
00:34:34,748 --> 00:34:36,738
Fear no evil.

316
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,110
If you wanna talk or...

317
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,980
Just call. Any time.

318
00:34:49,194 --> 00:34:51,194
Are you sure
you have to go home tonight?

319
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:54,128
If I'm not there at the site
first thing in the morning...

320
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:57,896
...they will hire another contractor
and then, you know...

321
00:35:01,243 --> 00:35:02,513
I'm proud of you.

322
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:03,971
What, me?

323
00:35:04,179 --> 00:35:05,769
- Yeah.
- For what?

324
00:35:06,948 --> 00:35:09,278
For working so hard.

325
00:35:10,617 --> 00:35:13,177
And for keeping your promises.

326
00:35:14,188 --> 00:35:15,418
All of them.

327
00:35:20,962 --> 00:35:24,362
You're naughty.
You can't play with that.

328
00:35:24,565 --> 00:35:26,255
It's mine.

329
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:29,767
You know, you're a bad doll.
You said you would make Matt better.

330
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:34,295
You said you would, but you lied.
"No, I didn't."

331
00:35:34,509 --> 00:35:36,409
Oh, yes, you did. You said you would.

332
00:35:36,608 --> 00:35:38,598
You're gonna have to have
a timeout and...

333
00:35:38,812 --> 00:35:40,942
I'm gonna put you in the timeout corner.

334
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:43,671
"That's really mean."

335
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:52,359
Turn the lights on, please.

336
00:35:54,464 --> 00:35:55,454
Thank you.

337
00:36:14,349 --> 00:36:16,039
Matt?

338
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:26,048
Come on, honey. Come on.

339
00:36:56,794 --> 00:36:59,264
Hey, hey, hey, watch it.
Watch the milk.

340
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,860
Billy, I'm serious.

341
00:37:02,064 --> 00:37:04,194
- Is Mary a total goon?
- No.

342
00:37:04,399 --> 00:37:05,889
"Oh, yeah."

343
00:37:07,202 --> 00:37:09,402
Is Billy a poop head?

344
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:10,904
"But of course, my dear."

345
00:37:11,107 --> 00:37:13,007
Language, language.
Here. Eat, eat, eat.

346
00:37:13,575 --> 00:37:16,265
Come on. Stop.
I gotta go to work, okay?

347
00:37:16,712 --> 00:37:18,342
Wendy is in charge.

348
00:37:18,647 --> 00:37:19,607
Okay?

349
00:37:19,815 --> 00:37:22,105
I'm sorry, honey.

350
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,410
See you, Mom.

351
00:37:26,387 --> 00:37:29,687
You be good or else you guys
have to deal with me.

352
00:37:30,191 --> 00:37:31,661
Okay?

353
00:37:32,493 --> 00:37:35,053
I'm just kidding. It's okay.

354
00:37:35,597 --> 00:37:38,187
Fifty-one, 52...

355
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,470
...53, 54, 55...

356
00:37:43,674 --> 00:37:50,214
...56, 57, 58, 59, 60.

357
00:37:51,616 --> 00:37:53,546
Here I come.

358
00:38:26,882 --> 00:38:27,912
Jonah.

359
00:38:32,255 --> 00:38:33,975
Jonah!

360
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:43,529
Jonah!

361
00:38:44,269 --> 00:38:46,429
Where are you, son?

362
00:38:49,174 --> 00:38:50,664
Come here.

363
00:38:51,007 --> 00:38:52,437
- Don't.
- You're not leaving.

364
00:38:52,643 --> 00:38:54,773
I'm sorry.

365
00:39:56,673 --> 00:39:58,573
Wendy?

366
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:01,440
Wendy! Help! Wendy!

367
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,590
Oh, for God's sakes.

368
00:40:16,493 --> 00:40:17,623
Just leave me alone.

369
00:40:20,864 --> 00:40:23,234
It's okay, it's okay.

370
00:40:23,433 --> 00:40:25,263
Come on, guys. Let's go.

371
00:40:25,469 --> 00:40:28,369
Billy. Come on.

372
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:41,809
It's okay, son. It's okay.

373
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:46,420
- I just- I don't know who else to talk to.
- No, no, no. I'm glad you called.

374
00:40:46,624 --> 00:40:50,194
It's all around us, all the time.

375
00:40:50,796 --> 00:40:53,126
The living and the dead.

376
00:40:53,331 --> 00:40:55,731
Invisible to everyone.

377
00:40:56,168 --> 00:40:58,068
Almost everyone.

378
00:40:58,269 --> 00:40:59,259
Yeah.

379
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,500
Because we're not like
other people anymore.

380
00:41:01,707 --> 00:41:04,867
You see, most people spend
their life firmly planted in this world...

381
00:41:05,076 --> 00:41:09,376
...then one day, they go straight
to the other side, but we...

382
00:41:10,047 --> 00:41:11,837
We take a much more roundabout path.

383
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:15,919
We spend quite a lot of time
in the borderland.

384
00:41:16,454 --> 00:41:20,794
But either way, only one thing matters.

385
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:23,559
Yeah, what's that?

386
00:41:26,065 --> 00:41:28,925
Well, find out what he wants from you.

387
00:42:09,507 --> 00:42:11,067
Okay.

388
00:42:21,821 --> 00:42:23,691
What do you want from me?

389
00:42:51,384 --> 00:42:54,884
You know,
that was actually my favorite movie.

390
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,680
- Mom?
- Aunt Sara?

391
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,089
Mom.

392
00:43:28,254 --> 00:43:31,224
You should've told me about this.
These symptoms can be a sign...

393
00:43:31,424 --> 00:43:34,294
...that it's moved to the brain.
But Matt's MRIs are all clear.

394
00:43:34,494 --> 00:43:35,834
He has no tumors.

395
00:43:36,029 --> 00:43:38,999
Whatever was causing the behaviors,
it wasn't that.

396
00:43:39,432 --> 00:43:42,462
I'm just afraid he's gonna lose
his mind before he can get better.

397
00:43:42,669 --> 00:43:46,999
This is a crucial time, but he is still an
excellent candidate for this treatment.

398
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,568
Age counts enormously, and attitude.

399
00:43:49,776 --> 00:43:51,396
Attitude?

400
00:43:51,612 --> 00:43:53,812
His own family is afraid of him.

401
00:44:01,321 --> 00:44:02,291
Where's your truck?

402
00:44:03,522 --> 00:44:05,082
I sold it.

403
00:44:06,793 --> 00:44:07,823
Why didn't you tell me?

404
00:44:09,529 --> 00:44:11,289
I just did.

405
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,440
Paid the last round of bills,
this month's mortgage. Today.

406
00:44:15,637 --> 00:44:18,267
Like doc says, attitude.

407
00:44:34,054 --> 00:44:35,494
Oh, honey.

408
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:40,358
I'm so sorry.
I just love you so much.

409
00:44:40,995 --> 00:44:42,395
Mom, love hurts.

410
00:44:46,467 --> 00:44:48,267
Mom, just-

411
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:52,399
Look, I want you to know that if-

412
00:44:52,605 --> 00:44:54,435
If what?

413
00:44:54,774 --> 00:44:56,904
- That if I die-
- You won't.

414
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:05,523
- it's not your fault.

415
00:45:43,926 --> 00:45:45,446
No.

416
00:45:46,361 --> 00:45:50,631
No. You can't have him.

417
00:45:54,969 --> 00:45:57,699
Can't have my son.

418
00:47:12,815 --> 00:47:14,645
Hey.

419
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:16,539
We're bored.

420
00:47:16,752 --> 00:47:18,342
Please play with us.

421
00:47:18,554 --> 00:47:20,724
Why don't you ask Matt?

422
00:47:23,926 --> 00:47:25,516
Yeah, why don't you ask Matt?

423
00:47:28,998 --> 00:47:30,758
You okay?

424
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,690
I'm outstanding.

425
00:47:34,771 --> 00:47:36,571
Okay, come on, guys.
I'll count to 30...

426
00:47:36,773 --> 00:47:40,003
...and let's see if we can find some
new hiding places this time.

427
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,010
Matt.

428
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:52,512
Go on.

429
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:07,999
One, two, three, four, five.

430
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:35,390
There's room for me too.

431
00:48:35,598 --> 00:48:36,788
Find your own spot.

432
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,260
Twenty-nine, 30.

433
00:48:40,469 --> 00:48:42,369
Ready or not, here I come.

434
00:50:07,992 --> 00:50:10,222
Let me out of here!

435
00:50:10,428 --> 00:50:11,448
Help!

436
00:50:12,598 --> 00:50:14,458
Get me out of here!

437
00:50:15,868 --> 00:50:16,838
Get me out!

438
00:50:19,605 --> 00:50:21,155
Get me out of here!

439
00:50:22,941 --> 00:50:25,601
What happened? What? Come here.

440
00:50:25,809 --> 00:50:28,179
What? What is it? What?

441
00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:32,839
Okay.

442
00:50:35,285 --> 00:50:36,975
- Mary?
- I'm over here.

443
00:50:37,188 --> 00:50:39,488
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

444
00:50:39,692 --> 00:50:42,822
Wait. Be careful.
Hey, the floor must be rotten.

445
00:50:43,029 --> 00:50:44,859
- Rotten? Where?
- Well, here for sure...

446
00:50:45,064 --> 00:50:46,554
...where Mary's leg fell through.

447
00:50:46,767 --> 00:50:48,427
Just stand back, okay?

448
00:50:48,635 --> 00:50:50,065
Hey.

449
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:52,600
- You're okay.
- Bugs.

450
00:50:52,806 --> 00:50:55,596
Okay. Come here. You okay? Yeah?

451
00:51:02,948 --> 00:51:04,138
What is that?

452
00:51:10,923 --> 00:51:14,263
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my.

453
00:51:30,608 --> 00:51:32,298
What is it?

454
00:51:34,046 --> 00:51:36,166
Okay. Come on.

455
00:51:36,382 --> 00:51:37,372
Playtime's over.

456
00:51:38,385 --> 00:51:40,285
God, they're all...

457
00:51:41,188 --> 00:51:42,148
...dead.

458
00:51:43,524 --> 00:51:46,794
So sad. It's probably the only time
they ever had their photo taken.

459
00:52:00,673 --> 00:52:02,643
What are those?

460
00:52:03,376 --> 00:52:05,066
I don't know.

461
00:52:11,584 --> 00:52:12,554
You all right?

462
00:52:12,752 --> 00:52:14,352
Yeah.

463
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:18,920
These are really weird.
It has to be fake.

464
00:52:21,093 --> 00:52:22,323
Let me see those.

465
00:52:32,806 --> 00:52:34,426
What?

466
00:52:36,578 --> 00:52:38,668
- Nothing.
- Matt, come on.

467
00:52:38,879 --> 00:52:40,439
Just give me a chance.

468
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:50,117
- I've seen him.
- Shut up.

469
00:52:50,324 --> 00:52:52,154
Gave you a chance.

470
00:52:52,492 --> 00:52:54,762
I'm sorry, okay? Just...

471
00:52:55,496 --> 00:52:56,476
Go on.

472
00:52:57,531 --> 00:52:59,231
Please?

473
00:53:01,402 --> 00:53:04,272
I thought that I was hallucinating,
but I have seen this kid...

474
00:53:04,471 --> 00:53:07,201
...almost every day
since we've been here.

475
00:53:09,343 --> 00:53:11,073
Okay, I wake up in the middle
of the night...

476
00:53:11,279 --> 00:53:13,539
...and it feels like he's been inside me...

477
00:53:13,745 --> 00:53:16,405
...looking out through my eyes.

478
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:19,740
One bright day
In the middle of the night

479
00:53:19,951 --> 00:53:23,221
Two dead boys got up to fight

480
00:53:23,556 --> 00:53:25,716
Okay, me and him,
we're just two dead boys.

481
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:34,931
Maybe the place is haunted.

482
00:53:35,804 --> 00:53:39,434
Either way,
I mean, we need to find out...

483
00:53:39,641 --> 00:53:43,601
...who put these things
under the floorboards and why.

484
00:53:43,811 --> 00:53:45,711
Yeah, but how?

485
00:53:46,246 --> 00:53:49,706
Okay, well, don't tell anyone,
but there are these buildings...

486
00:53:49,917 --> 00:53:55,047
...all over the country where
secret knowledge is kept, known only...

487
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:58,051
...as libraries.

488
00:54:11,537 --> 00:54:14,937
Okay, so check it out:
"A Case of Materialization."

489
00:54:15,141 --> 00:54:18,511
That is Ramsey Aickman,
and this was his mortuary.

490
00:54:19,213 --> 00:54:23,743
Now, he had a very interesting hobby:
psychical research.

491
00:54:23,953 --> 00:54:27,013
And your guy, dead kid,
his name was Jonah...

492
00:54:27,289 --> 00:54:29,919
...and he was Aickman's assistant
and a medium.

493
00:54:30,659 --> 00:54:33,029
Supposedly, they contacted
the dead through Jonah...

494
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:36,200
...and people came to have chats
with their dead hubby or wife...

495
00:54:36,396 --> 00:54:38,886
...or find out where Auntie Mame
hid the family jewels.

496
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:43,470
Now, he claims that he discovered
how to amplify the seances.

497
00:54:43,671 --> 00:54:47,471
So he not only contacted the dead,
but he made things appear.

498
00:54:47,675 --> 00:54:49,265
What things?

499
00:54:49,477 --> 00:54:51,377
Ectoplasm.

500
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,569
And what is ectoplasm?

501
00:54:54,282 --> 00:54:58,622
A mysterious protoplasmic substance
streaming out of the body of mediums.

502
00:54:59,155 --> 00:55:02,175
So it's just like in those pictures
in the box.

503
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:06,190
Photographs of ectoplasm often
show a gelatinous material oozing...

504
00:55:06,393 --> 00:55:08,493
...from all the natural orifices
of the medium.

505
00:55:08,695 --> 00:55:13,655
From mouth, ears, nose, eyes
and even the lower orifices.

506
00:55:13,868 --> 00:55:18,598
So Aickman held all those seances
in this house...

507
00:55:18,808 --> 00:55:21,168
...and people came
from all over and were convinced.

508
00:55:21,378 --> 00:55:24,278
Harvard professors,
all kinds of big shots.

509
00:55:24,848 --> 00:55:28,278
I mean, Aickman and Jonah's
seances were famous.

510
00:55:29,186 --> 00:55:30,946
Well, do we know
what happened to him?

511
00:55:31,154 --> 00:55:32,854
Well, here's where it gets
a little weirder.

512
00:55:33,021 --> 00:55:34,991
So there was a seance
led by Aickman...

513
00:55:35,191 --> 00:55:36,681
...with Jonah as the medium.

514
00:55:36,891 --> 00:55:39,331
All four sitters and Aickman
were found dead.

515
00:55:40,429 --> 00:55:43,359
- Cause of death not clear.
- So Jonah killed them.

516
00:55:43,565 --> 00:55:45,185
Nobody knows. No sign of him.

517
00:55:45,401 --> 00:55:48,161
He was missing, vanished,
never seen again.

518
00:55:49,004 --> 00:55:49,974
Well, until now.

519
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,210
Well, here's the weirdest part of all.
Okay, so 30 years later...

520
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:56,240
...when they expanded the highway...

521
00:55:56,445 --> 00:55:57,995
...they did the detour through
the cemetery-

522
00:55:58,214 --> 00:56:00,274
Wait, we've been on that road
a million times.

523
00:56:00,481 --> 00:56:03,751
This is the thing: When they tried
to relocate some of the old plots...

524
00:56:03,951 --> 00:56:06,281
...they found something weird,
or didn't find.

525
00:56:06,487 --> 00:56:08,387
- What?
- Over a hundred bodies...

526
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:11,420
...that were supposed to be there
weren't, just empty...

527
00:56:11,626 --> 00:56:13,056
...coffins filled with sandbags.

528
00:56:14,631 --> 00:56:16,261
Someone stole the bodies.

529
00:56:16,467 --> 00:56:18,397
Aickman.

530
00:56:18,602 --> 00:56:20,592
Or Jonah. Aickman or Jonah.

531
00:56:20,805 --> 00:56:22,525
Maybe, but why?

532
00:56:25,743 --> 00:56:30,683
I don't know,
but I might know somebody who does.

533
00:56:35,919 --> 00:56:38,349
- Remarkable.
- Do you think it's real?

534
00:56:38,821 --> 00:56:43,691
Well, I've seen plenty of fakes,
but I've seen the real thing once.

535
00:56:44,627 --> 00:56:46,357
Paris. It...

536
00:56:46,563 --> 00:56:51,403
It was the most horrible thing
I've ever seen, but not this.

537
00:56:51,601 --> 00:56:53,261
Must've been a very powerful medium.

538
00:57:31,541 --> 00:57:32,571
What are they?

539
00:57:32,776 --> 00:57:34,106
Eyelids.

540
00:57:35,478 --> 00:57:36,608
Human eyelids.

541
00:57:37,882 --> 00:57:38,972
Well, what are they for?

542
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:42,080
Necromancy.

543
00:57:42,285 --> 00:57:43,805
Corpse-bothering.

544
00:57:45,256 --> 00:57:47,616
It's a loathsome form of magic.

545
00:57:47,825 --> 00:57:53,515
It's seeking power through control
of the dead via relics of their bodies.

546
00:57:53,729 --> 00:57:54,919
Well, why eyelids?

547
00:57:55,698 --> 00:57:57,498
That's a good question.

548
00:57:58,435 --> 00:58:01,525
I mean, traditionally we'd close the eyes
of the dead so they may...

549
00:58:01,737 --> 00:58:03,297
...rest in darkness.

550
00:58:03,506 --> 00:58:08,496
Now, removing their eyelids keeps
their eyes open, makes them see.

551
00:58:10,415 --> 00:58:13,245
Perhaps he intended them
to be watchmen...

552
00:58:14,186 --> 00:58:16,946
...or guardians of this house...

553
00:58:17,589 --> 00:58:18,949
...or of his secrets.

554
00:58:19,156 --> 00:58:21,586
By the way, I mean,
somewhere there are the bodies...

555
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:25,661
...that belong to these people,
and he used them.

556
00:58:26,497 --> 00:58:30,397
I think ultimately, Aickman intended
to enhance Jonah's powers.

557
00:58:31,302 --> 00:58:33,502
Well, he amplified his seances.

558
00:58:33,704 --> 00:58:36,904
Somehow he bound the spirits of the
dead to their bodies, yes...

559
00:58:37,108 --> 00:58:41,238
...as an amplifier, probably through
some form of ritual or desecration.

560
00:58:43,047 --> 00:58:45,137
Perhaps buried outside the house?

561
00:58:50,019 --> 00:58:53,979
Perhaps it would help if we prayed
for all those poor souls that died here.

562
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:57,418
For the boy too.

563
00:59:14,512 --> 00:59:15,602
Mommy?

564
00:59:15,813 --> 00:59:17,843
- Come back.
- Mommy?

565
00:59:19,183 --> 00:59:21,313
Please, please, help me.

566
00:59:29,326 --> 00:59:30,486
- Mommy.
- Help me.

567
00:59:32,831 --> 00:59:34,061
Matt.

568
01:00:07,768 --> 01:00:08,958
Matt.

569
01:00:37,962 --> 01:00:39,692
Matt. Who are you?

570
01:00:39,897 --> 01:00:41,327
What are you doing in my house?

571
01:00:41,532 --> 01:00:42,902
- Matt?
- I'm a reverend.

572
01:00:43,101 --> 01:00:44,661
It's okay. We asked him to come.

573
01:00:44,869 --> 01:00:46,339
- Asked him?
- We met at the-

574
01:00:46,537 --> 01:00:48,437
- Get out of my house.
- Get off. It's fine.

575
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,800
We met at the hospital.
I receive treatment.

576
01:00:51,008 --> 01:00:53,168
- Get out.
- Well, he called me for advice.

577
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,370
- It's a little hard to explain.
- Try.

578
01:00:55,582 --> 01:01:01,152
I believe that there is something evil
in this house...

579
01:01:01,355 --> 01:01:03,875
...something no longer living
and not yet passed over.

580
01:01:04,092 --> 01:01:05,462
And it wants your son.

581
01:01:05,657 --> 01:01:08,527
That's a dangerous situation
for someone who's close to death-

582
01:01:08,728 --> 01:01:09,958
He's not.

583
01:01:10,563 --> 01:01:16,023
And I'm as hopeful as you,
but tell me, have you not...

584
01:01:16,802 --> 01:01:19,242
...felt something strange here?

585
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:25,640
I don't know what you're talking about.

586
01:01:25,845 --> 01:01:29,675
I appreciate the concern, but this is
not the type of help we need right now.

587
01:01:29,883 --> 01:01:31,823
I'd like you to leave.

588
01:01:32,318 --> 01:01:33,838
Of course.

589
01:01:40,992 --> 01:01:42,792
You're not alone.

590
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:45,282
Peter?

591
01:03:54,462 --> 01:03:55,892
Matt?

592
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:36,097
You're kidding.

593
01:04:37,606 --> 01:04:39,226
Hello!

594
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:41,102
Anybody home?

595
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:42,681
All the lights are on!

596
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,268
Why are all the lights on?

597
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:50,378
Ridiculous.

598
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:54,380
Everybody in this house is sleeping...

599
01:04:54,623 --> 01:04:57,223
...with the lights on
and I wanna know why!

600
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:59,446
He's been drinking.

601
01:05:01,296 --> 01:05:03,956
Why don't we just build a fire
and throw money into it?

602
01:05:04,666 --> 01:05:05,626
It's okay.

603
01:05:05,834 --> 01:05:08,464
I gotta pay a mortgage,
I'm now paying rent.

604
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:10,400
Here's another one.

605
01:05:10,974 --> 01:05:12,704
God.

606
01:05:13,008 --> 01:05:17,098
Every single room has got a light on!

607
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:32,617
Here. Here we go.

608
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:35,226
Sleep in the dark.

609
01:05:46,975 --> 01:05:48,565
There we go.

610
01:05:48,777 --> 01:05:50,797
Lights out.

611
01:05:54,516 --> 01:05:56,346
There we go.

612
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:58,606
Yeah.

613
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:04,786
Peter...

614
01:06:05,796 --> 01:06:09,286
...that was a cruel
and childish thing to do.

615
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:13,456
All you did was scare everybody
in this house.

616
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:18,340
Don't. Don't. Don't.

617
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:26,640
Your family needs your strength,
not your self-pity.

618
01:06:28,919 --> 01:06:33,219
You get drunk again, don't come home.

619
01:07:37,687 --> 01:07:39,157
Matt?

620
01:07:52,002 --> 01:07:52,972
Okay.

621
01:08:07,684 --> 01:08:09,914
I'm so sorry.
I just didn't know who else to call.

622
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,550
It's all right.

623
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:15,694
- Are you sure you're feeling up to this?
- Well, put it this way, I'm...

624
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:19,160
I'm exactly the right state of being...

625
01:08:19,365 --> 01:08:20,915
...to traffic with ghosts.

626
01:08:26,472 --> 01:08:28,132
What is that?

627
01:08:28,774 --> 01:08:30,774
Magnets. Iron magnets.

628
01:08:30,975 --> 01:08:32,305
Iron defends from evil.

629
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:37,180
So it's no accident
that prisons have iron bars...

630
01:08:37,381 --> 01:08:41,581
...to not merely contain the body,
but the evil that may lurk within it.

631
01:08:50,329 --> 01:08:52,589
- What are you looking for?
- Where he died.

632
01:08:54,466 --> 01:08:58,396
Sometimes when death is violent
or filled with anger...

633
01:08:58,603 --> 01:09:04,443
...or fear or any strong emotion...

634
01:09:05,876 --> 01:09:08,036
...it's as if the spirit doesn't pass on.

635
01:09:11,482 --> 01:09:16,292
That's why we cover mirrors,
light candles, open the shades...

636
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:18,980
...so that they may find their way out.

637
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:25,225
So a house with a trapped soul
is not so much haunted...

638
01:09:26,598 --> 01:09:29,158
...as it is possessed.

639
01:09:36,575 --> 01:09:38,865
What's down there?

640
01:09:39,911 --> 01:09:43,641
Matt's bedroom.
It's where they used to...

641
01:09:45,884 --> 01:09:48,124
Keep the children upstairs.

642
01:09:59,563 --> 01:10:00,693
Yeah.

643
01:10:00,898 --> 01:10:01,958
He's here.

644
01:10:02,167 --> 01:10:03,757
Do you see him, Matt?

645
01:10:06,136 --> 01:10:07,726
I don't see anything.

646
01:10:07,939 --> 01:10:11,539
That's because you're strong, you're
healthy. You shouldn't see anything.

647
01:10:43,777 --> 01:10:46,207
So this is where you're trapped.

648
01:10:48,648 --> 01:10:50,378
Don't worry.

649
01:10:51,249 --> 01:10:54,219
Whatever you may have done,
we're not here to punish you...

650
01:10:56,287 --> 01:10:58,647
...only to free you.

651
01:10:59,191 --> 01:11:01,091
Like a bird...

652
01:11:01,759 --> 01:11:04,029
...caught in a room.

653
01:11:17,245 --> 01:11:19,465
There must be another way.

654
01:11:19,713 --> 01:11:21,443
Perhaps the other side of that wall.

655
01:11:25,685 --> 01:11:29,635
I have to get his remains
out of the house.

656
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,270
Stop it!

657
01:13:25,306 --> 01:13:26,536
It stopped.

658
01:13:45,259 --> 01:13:46,749
Will Matt be all right now?

659
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,120
Yeah.

660
01:13:48,329 --> 01:13:50,089
The house is quiet and at peace.

661
01:13:50,731 --> 01:13:54,731
But I should warn you that sometimes
for a day or so after...

662
01:13:55,805 --> 01:14:00,705
...strange events, much like aftershocks
from an earthquake.

663
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:03,710
But don't be alarmed...

664
01:14:04,181 --> 01:14:06,481
...it will pass,
within a day or two at the most.

665
01:14:17,459 --> 01:14:18,429
- Okay.
- All right.

666
01:14:20,896 --> 01:14:22,226
Thank you.

667
01:14:22,764 --> 01:14:24,494
It's okay.

668
01:14:26,802 --> 01:14:30,742
I wish I could say
it was my pleasure, but...

669
01:14:34,842 --> 01:14:36,172
You gonna be okay to drive?

670
01:14:36,377 --> 01:14:38,807
We're all in God's hands.

671
01:15:10,146 --> 01:15:12,606
It's only five more sleeps
till parents' day.

672
01:15:12,815 --> 01:15:14,775
I can't wait.
I got a lot to show you, Dad.

673
01:15:14,983 --> 01:15:17,013
You'll see
how I shoot the bow and arrow...

674
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:21,450
...and how far I can swim
and they're having a father-son race.

675
01:15:21,657 --> 01:15:22,677
It's gonna be great.

676
01:15:22,892 --> 01:15:25,992
I bet you and me,
we beat all the others...

677
01:15:26,196 --> 01:15:29,456
...unless you're too old
and broke down.

678
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:33,263
Okay, well, I better go. Bye, Dad.

679
01:15:36,271 --> 01:15:39,431
All right,
whatever was here is gone now.

680
01:15:39,641 --> 01:15:41,941
Now, we've all had
some really bad nights.

681
01:15:58,361 --> 01:15:59,621
Stay here.

682
01:16:03,299 --> 01:16:04,599
Oh, my God.

683
01:16:04,801 --> 01:16:06,961
Oh, my- Oh, my-

684
01:16:08,172 --> 01:16:10,772
Oh, my God.
What have you done to yourself?

685
01:16:15,512 --> 01:16:19,042
All right, I'm gonna follow them. When
I get back, we're getting out of here.

686
01:18:14,499 --> 01:18:16,329
Sir?

687
01:18:17,367 --> 01:18:20,197
They'll be after you now.

688
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:21,844
Get out.

689
01:19:00,045 --> 01:19:01,205
Somebody help me!

690
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:15,391
Please! Somebody help me!

691
01:20:12,650 --> 01:20:13,950
Where's Matt?

692
01:20:14,153 --> 01:20:15,643
He's at the hospital.

693
01:20:15,854 --> 01:20:19,054
The doctors are gonna
take care of him, okay?

694
01:21:08,407 --> 01:21:10,967
Hi. We're not home right now,
so please leave a message.

695
01:21:11,176 --> 01:21:12,396
Thanks.

696
01:21:14,113 --> 01:21:16,583
I made a terrible mistake.

697
01:21:16,785 --> 01:21:20,115
Aickman didn't remove their eyelids
to make the dead see...

698
01:21:20,322 --> 01:21:22,262
...but to make them unseen.

699
01:21:22,457 --> 01:21:24,787
So all those missing bodies...

700
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,920
...all those poor souls in torment,
they're still there. They're in the house.

701
01:21:29,464 --> 01:21:33,024
But the boy wasn't evil.

702
01:21:33,266 --> 01:21:35,026
He was trying to free them.

703
01:21:35,235 --> 01:21:36,525
And I removed him.

704
01:21:39,105 --> 01:21:41,265
Now all that's left is their rage.

705
01:21:41,809 --> 01:21:43,209
You must get out now.

706
01:21:45,246 --> 01:21:46,796
Get out now.

707
01:22:27,188 --> 01:22:28,748
I'm sorry.

708
01:22:30,457 --> 01:22:33,427
It's okay. You're here now.
That's all that matters.

709
01:22:37,432 --> 01:22:40,302
He's sedated and comfortable.

710
01:22:40,901 --> 01:22:42,301
We ran his panels.

711
01:22:43,338 --> 01:22:45,268
I'm afraid it's not good news.

712
01:22:45,473 --> 01:22:47,173
His cell count is worse than before.

713
01:22:47,576 --> 01:22:50,836
The treatment has, frankly,
had no effect.

714
01:22:53,814 --> 01:22:55,544
How long do you think he has?

715
01:22:55,748 --> 01:22:58,648
With these numbers,
I don't know what's keeping him alive.

716
01:22:58,853 --> 01:23:00,753
He could go tonight.

717
01:23:00,954 --> 01:23:03,654
There's really no way of saying for sure.

718
01:23:05,893 --> 01:23:07,493
Then can we see him?

719
01:23:08,331 --> 01:23:10,161
Of course.

720
01:23:11,934 --> 01:23:13,094
To fight.

721
01:23:13,303 --> 01:23:15,133
One bright day
In the middle of the night

722
01:23:15,338 --> 01:23:17,358
Two dead boys got up to fight

723
01:23:17,573 --> 01:23:18,843
He couldn't have gotten far.

724
01:23:19,042 --> 01:23:21,572
- One bright day in the middle-
- Hi, this is Dr. Brooks.

725
01:23:21,775 --> 01:23:23,535
Get me security right away, please.

726
01:23:23,745 --> 01:23:25,365
Two dead boys got up to fight

727
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:26,950
One bright day
In the middle of the night

728
01:23:27,148 --> 01:23:29,478
Two dead boys got up to fight

729
01:23:38,059 --> 01:23:39,759
Matt?

730
01:23:41,364 --> 01:23:43,494
Matt?

731
01:23:43,833 --> 01:23:45,563
Matt.

732
01:24:00,515 --> 01:24:01,535
Come over. Come here.

733
01:24:03,953 --> 01:24:05,793
We're gonna play
hide-and-seek now, okay?

734
01:24:05,989 --> 01:24:07,619
Okay, go.

735
01:24:10,894 --> 01:24:13,394
- We have to get out of here. Come on.
- What's going on?

736
01:24:13,597 --> 01:24:15,357
We have to go. We have to-

737
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:17,460
Matt. Matt, no.

738
01:24:17,666 --> 01:24:18,856
Matt, no. No.

739
01:24:25,808 --> 01:24:27,468
- Get out.
- Matt.

740
01:24:27,677 --> 01:24:29,367
Get out.

741
01:24:29,578 --> 01:24:32,378
Matt. No. Matt.

742
01:24:32,581 --> 01:24:35,281
Get out. Whatever you do,
do not let them put out the fire.

743
01:24:35,485 --> 01:24:37,375
- What about you?
- I'm already dead.

744
01:24:38,988 --> 01:24:42,288
- Matt, come out. Matt.
- Matt.

745
01:24:45,593 --> 01:24:47,363
We'll find him.

746
01:29:02,755 --> 01:29:04,975
Mom. Dad.

747
01:29:05,958 --> 01:29:06,928
Where's Matt?

748
01:29:07,126 --> 01:29:09,316
- He's inside.
- I don't understand.

749
01:29:09,529 --> 01:29:12,159
- I thought you said it was over.
- Matt's trying to end it.

750
01:29:12,365 --> 01:29:13,385
- I gotta get in.
- Ma'am.

751
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:16,590
No, you gotta let me in there.
I have to get my son.

752
01:29:16,803 --> 01:29:19,703
- Fire.
- Please let me go. Please.

753
01:29:19,906 --> 01:29:21,736
To unbind the spirits.

754
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:47,970
What are we waiting for? Come on!

755
01:29:48,168 --> 01:29:49,898
Matt!

756
01:30:03,249 --> 01:30:05,269
Oh, my God.

757
01:30:05,853 --> 01:30:07,823
Okay.

758
01:30:10,791 --> 01:30:12,451
All right.

759
01:30:13,459 --> 01:30:16,949
I'm here. I'm here.

760
01:30:40,989 --> 01:30:42,509
The Lord is my shepherd.

761
01:30:42,724 --> 01:30:44,354
I shall not want.

762
01:30:44,592 --> 01:30:47,022
He maketh me
to lie down in green pastures.

763
01:30:47,927 --> 01:30:50,287
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

764
01:30:51,131 --> 01:30:53,431
He restoreth my soul.

765
01:30:53,634 --> 01:30:55,864
He leadeth me
in the path of righteousness.

766
01:31:01,041 --> 01:31:03,311
He helped my son.

767
01:31:27,701 --> 01:31:32,271
We're here. We're here. We're here.

768
01:31:46,488 --> 01:31:48,178
Matt.

769
01:31:54,195 --> 01:31:55,985
Be careful.

770
01:31:58,400 --> 01:31:59,920
Come on, wake up.

771
01:32:00,535 --> 01:32:01,755
Wake up.

772
01:32:01,971 --> 01:32:04,171
He's gonna be okay.
He's gonna be okay.

773
01:32:15,649 --> 01:32:17,909
No. Hold on.

774
01:32:18,118 --> 01:32:19,918
Wake up.

775
01:32:32,268 --> 01:32:34,968
Come on, Matty.
Come on, Matty, breathe.

776
01:32:37,206 --> 01:32:39,256
I love you.

777
01:32:51,586 --> 01:32:53,676
Wake up, Matt.

778
01:32:58,293 --> 01:33:00,133
I just love you so much.

779
01:33:02,598 --> 01:33:04,158
Come on, Matty, wake up.

780
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:07,830
Please, come on, honey.

781
01:33:09,337 --> 01:33:10,887
Come on.

782
01:33:16,978 --> 01:33:19,108
You'll be all right.

783
01:33:36,632 --> 01:33:38,122
Hey.

784
01:33:49,011 --> 01:33:51,041
He's okay.

785
01:34:09,898 --> 01:34:13,528
I don't really care
if anybody believes me or not.

786
01:34:14,369 --> 01:34:16,599
I know what happened.

787
01:34:16,807 --> 01:34:21,797
Doctors and nurses know
and my family knows.

788
01:34:23,614 --> 01:34:26,644
And my son is alive...

789
01:34:27,952 --> 01:34:29,942
...and well.

790
01:34:30,921 --> 01:34:33,051
That's all that matters.

791
01:34:34,390 --> 01:34:37,620
They say that God works
in mysterious ways.

792
01:34:38,628 --> 01:34:42,388
They just don't always tell you
how mysterious those ways can be.

793
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,690
Consider yourself warned.
