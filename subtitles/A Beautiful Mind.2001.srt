You the poor kid that never got to go to Exeter or Andover?

105

106
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:37,687

I'm actually quite well-balanced.

107

And they don't much like me.

118

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}怎么可能?
But why,

119

124

Because it's boring. It's really boring.

125

307
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:53,200
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}别担心，是我的东西
Don't worry, that's mine.

308
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,000
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我等会儿就去收拾
I'll come and get it in a minute.

309
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,400
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}噢，天呐
Oh, God.

310
00:19:00,728 --> 00:19:02,713
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}好戏来了，先生们
Incoming, gentlemen.

311
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:08,978
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}深呼吸
Deep breaths.

312
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:12,100
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}纳什，你最好从翻论文里
Nash, you might want to stop shuffling

313
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,400
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}先抽身几秒钟
your papers for five seconds.

314
00:19:18,514 --> 00:19:20,238
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我不请你们喝啤酒
I will not buy you gentlemen beer.

315
00:19:20,313 --> 00:19:22,672
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}噢，我们不是来喝啤酒的，朋友
Oh, we're not here for beer, my friend.

316
00:19:27,474 --> 00:19:30,435
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}你们是不是也觉得她最好以慢动作移动?
Does anyone else feel she should be moving in slow motion?

317
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,163
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}她会要求一个盛大的婚礼吗，你们觉得?
Will she want a large wedding, you think?

318
00:19:33,236 --> 00:19:35,720
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我们该用剑决斗吗? 还是黄昏时比枪法?
Shall we say swords, gentlemen? Pistols at dawn?

319
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,729
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}你们怎么都忘了?
Have you remembered nothing?

320
00:19:38,132 --> 00:19:40,117
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}还记得现代经济学之父
Recall the lessons of Adam Smith,

321
00:19:40,198 --> 00:19:42,126
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}亚当・史密斯教你们的吗
the father of modern economics.

322
00:19:42,196 --> 00:19:44,317
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}"在竞争中...
"In competition...

323
00:19:44,395 --> 00:19:46,550
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}个人的野心往往会促进公共福利"
individual ambition serves the common good."

324
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:49,144
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}-没错  -各凭本事，朋友们
-Exactly.  -Every man for himself, gentlemen.

325
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:51,912
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}出局的人负责去黏住她的朋友
And those who strike out are stuck with her friends.

326
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:53,645
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我不会出局的
I'm not gonna strike out.

327
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:54,945
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}你可以把金发美女带到水边
You can lead a blonde to water,

328
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:55,819
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}但你不能逼她喝水
but you can't make her drink.

329
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,276
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我觉得他可没说过这个...
I don't think he said that...

330
00:19:57,352 --> 00:19:59,314
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}都别动...她在看这边了
Nobody move... She's looking over here.

331
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:00,868
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}她在看纳什
She's looking at Nash.

332
00:20:01,214 --> 00:20:03,841
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}好吧，姑且算他现在占上风
Oh, God. He may have the upper hand now,

333
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:05,800
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}但等他一开口，啧啧
but wait until he opens his mouth.

334
00:20:05,878 --> 00:20:08,033
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}还记得上次吗?
Remember the last time?

335
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:09,799
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}噢，对，那一次可真是载入史册
Oh, yes, that was one for the history books.

336
00:20:16,536 --> 00:20:18,055
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}亚当・史密斯需要修订他的理论了
Adam Smith needs revision.

337
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:20,120
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

338
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,890
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}如果我们都去追那个金发美女...
If we all go for the blonde...

339
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,855
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}一定会互相拆台
we block each other.

340
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:33,285
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}到时候谁都别想得到她
Not a single one of us is gonna get her.

341
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,049
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}然后我们去找她的朋友
So then we go for her friends,

342
00:20:37,221 --> 00:20:38,947
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}她们肯定会泼我们冷水
but they will all give us the cold shoulder

343
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,513
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}因为没人愿意当二手选择
because nobody likes to be second choice.

344
00:20:41,983 --> 00:20:44,444
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}要是没人去追那个金发美女呢?
Well, what if no one goes for the blonde?

345
00:20:46,614 --> 00:20:48,701
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}那我们之间既互不侵犯
We don't get in each other's way,

346
00:20:48,778 --> 00:20:51,137
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}也没有羞辱到其他女孩
and we don't insult the other girls.

347
00:20:52,675 --> 00:20:54,603
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}这是咱们赢得芳心的唯一办法
That's the only way we win.

348
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:58,690
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}是咱们都能干一炮的唯一办法
That's the only way we all get laid.

349
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:06,158
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}亚当・史密斯曾说过
Adam Smith said

350
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,920
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}最好的结果来自于...
the best result comes...

351
00:21:08,996 --> 00:21:10,855
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}团体里的所有人都去做
from everyone in the group doing

352
00:21:10,855 --> 00:21:11,500
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}对他自身最有利的事，对吧?
what's best for himself, right?

353
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,746
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}他是这么说的，对不对?
That's what he said, right?

354
00:21:12,746 --> 00:21:15,488
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}不完整，不完整，好吧?
Incomplete. Incomplete, okay?

355
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:17,679
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}因为最好的结果来自于...
Because the best result will come...

356
00:21:19,854 --> 00:21:21,839
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}团体里的所有人
from everyone in the group

357
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,317
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}都去做对他自身和团体最有利的事
doing what's best for himself and the group.

358
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,345
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}纳什，你要是想拿这套歪理去独占那位金发美女
Nash, if this is some way for you to get the blonde on your own,

359
00:21:28,345 --> 00:21:29,215
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}你就可以滚了
you can go to hell.

360
00:21:29,215 --> 00:21:30,772
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}管理动态学，各位
Governing dynamics, gentlemen.

361

Governing dynamics. Adam Smith...

362
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,900
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}他错了
was wrong.

363
00:21:35,941 --> 00:21:38,165
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}-又来啦  -小心点，小心点
-Oh, here we go.  -Careful, careful.

00:21:40,972 --> 00:21:42,628
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}谢谢你
Thank you.

365
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,600
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}C(S)等于C(T)
"C" of "S" equals "C" of "T".

366
00:23:00,144 --> 00:23:01,800
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}你知道这会推翻一百五十年来
You do realize this flies in the face

367
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,642
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}牢不可破的经济理论吧?
of a 150 years of economic theory?

368
00:23:03,642 --> 00:23:04,462
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}是的，我知道，先生
Yes, I do, sir.

369
00:23:04,906 --> 00:23:06,391
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}那可是相当地肆意妄为，你不觉得吗?
That's rather presumptuous, don't you think?

370
00:23:06,473 --> 00:23:08,298
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}是，先生
It is, sir.

371
00:23:15,365 --> 00:23:17,224
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}好吧，纳什先生
Well, Mr. Nash,

372
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,658

with a breakthrough of this magnitude,

373

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我相信你可以去任何你想去的地方
I'm confident you will get any placement you like.

00:23:39,946 --> 00:23:41,840
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}斯提尔斯和弗兰克应该很合适
Stills and Frank are excellent choices.

Sol and Bender are extraordinary mathematicians.

380
00:23:47,574 --> 00:23:49,500
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}但纳什先生，你可曾想过，苏和本德尔
Has it occurred to you, Mr. Nash, that Sol and Bender

381
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}或许另有打算?
might have plans of their own?

382

513
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:02,787

520
00:33:16,983 --> 00:33:18,673

Well, conviction, it turns out,

525
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:34,067
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}可是旁观者才拥有的奢侈品，纳什先生
is a luxury of those on the sidelines, Mr. Nash.

526

Why is that?

530
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,878
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我喜欢归结于自己是个独狼的缘故
I like to think it's because I'm a lone wolf.

531
00:33:50,924 --> 00:33:53,477
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}不过主要是因为人们不喜欢我
But mainly it's because people don't like me.

532
00:33:55,254 --> 00:33:56,780
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}唔，在某些需要苦心孤诣的时候
Well, there are certain endeavors

533
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,186
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}缺乏人际交往
where your lack of personal connection

534
00:33:58,186 --> 00:34:00,345
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}反倒会被视为一项优势
would be considered an advantage.

535

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}这里是管制区
This is a secure area.

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}你来过这里吗?
Have you ever been here?

538

We were told during our initial briefing

539

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}这些仓库都被废弃了
that these warehouses were abandoned.

540
00:34:13,707 --> 00:34:16,725
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}不完全正确
That's not precisely accurate.

541
00:34:54,076 --> 00:34:55,702
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}等我告诉了你下面的内容
By telling you what I'm about to tell you,

542
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:57,580

I am increasing your security clearance

543

Disclosure of secure information can result in imprisonment.

548

and we lost the damn thing.

555

556

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}它们跟这个有关，不是吗?
they were about this, weren't they?

557

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}苏联内部并没有人们所认为的那样统一
The Soviets aren't as unified as people believe.

558
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,680
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}一小股自称 "新自由" 的红军
A faction of the Red Army calling itself Novaya Svobga,

and intends to detonate it on U.S. soil.

561

Their plan is to incur maximum civilian casualties.

562

McCarthy is an idiot,

566
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,680
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}不幸的是这并不意味着他是错的
but unfortunately that doesn't make him wrong.

567

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}新自由是通过报纸和杂志上的密码

through codes imbedded in newspapers and magazines,

569
00:36:19,242 --> 00:36:21,280

and that's where you come in.

570

What exactly is it that you would like me to do?

576

Okay, this may be a little uncomfortable.

584

That's got a little zap to it, doesn't it?

585

He just implanted a radium diode.

586

Don't worry, it's safe.

587

You didn't even look.

606
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,825
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我并没有说向量场是有理函数
I never said that the Vector Fields were rational functions.

607

So you're a painter?

643
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:34,456

That's not actually what I said,

That's a plan.

650

because of all the colors? At the governor's house...

1020

I left you with no other choice.

1021
01:15:03,189 --> 01:15:04,742
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}这点我非常明白...

1022

1023
01:15:06,377 --> 01:15:08,073
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}没关系
That's okay.

Everything's gonna be all right.

1025

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}一切都会好起来的
Everything's gonna be all right.

1026
01:15:15,846 --> 01:15:19,069
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我们必须小声说话
We just have to talk quietly.

1027
01:15:19,144 --> 01:15:23,503
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}他们可能在偷听，这里可能有窃听器
They may be listening. There may be microphones.

1028
01:15:24,073 --> 01:15:26,660
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我现在要告诉你所有事情
I'm gonna tell you everything now.

1029
01:15:26,739 --> 01:15:29,080

It's breaking with protocol

1030
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,968
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}但你必须得知道
but you need to know,

1031
01:15:30,968 --> 01:15:35,156
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}因为你得帮我逃出这里
because you have to help me get out of here.

1032

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我一直在替政府做最高机密的工作
I've been doing top-secret work for the government.

1033

1034
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:44,280
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}它将导致巨大的灾变
of catastrophic proportions.

1035

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}俄国人大概认为我的目标太大了
I think the Russians feel my profile is too high.

1036
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,784
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}所以他们没有直接做掉我
That's why they simply just don't do away with me.

1037
01:15:49,784 --> 01:15:53,077
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}他们把我关在这里好让我没法继续工作
They're keeping me here to try to stop me from doing my work.

1038

1052
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:30,476

-He thought it was harmless.  -Sol followed me?

1053

You see, the nightmare of schizophrenia

1071
01:18:35,792 --> 01:18:38,484

1073
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:44,380

John always spoke so fondly of being here at Princeton.

1085

1087

1096
01:21:24,064 --> 01:21:26,787

1101
01:21:47,179 --> 01:21:51,197
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}逼自己把他视为我的那个白马王子

1102
01:21:52,309 --> 01:21:54,396
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}然后他就是了
And he becomes that man.

1103
01:21:54,473 --> 01:21:58,991

I can see him because of a chemical

1222

that was released into my bloodstream

1223

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}释放了一种化学物质
when my implant dissolved.

1224

You've got to stop her, John.

1228

You leave her out of this.

1229

Who are you talking to?

1230

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}约翰
John.

1232

She'll compromise us again.

No, she won't.

1234

You'll go back to the hospital.

1235

John, answer me!

1236

Alicia?

1243
01:37:27,992 --> 01:37:30,311

-You know what you have to do, Nash.  -Get away from me.

1244

She's too great a risk.

I didn't mean to hurt you!

1247

Finish her. She knows too much now.

1248
01:37:44,148 --> 01:37:45,610

Uncle John?

1249
01:37:46,045 --> 01:37:48,050

You take care of her, you pathetic piece of shit,

1250
01:37:48,050 --> 01:37:49,250

I understand.

1259

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}她一直没有长大
She never gets old.

1260
01:38:43,967 --> 01:38:47,019
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}玛西不可能是真的，她一直没有长大
Marcee can't be real. She never gets old.

1261
01:39:20,074 --> 01:39:21,263

You see them now?

Yes.

1263

Why did you stop your meds?

1264
01:39:39,459 --> 01:39:41,614

Because I couldn't do my work.

1265

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我没法帮忙照顾孩子
I couldn't help with the baby.

1266
01:39:43,788 --> 01:39:45,182
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我没法...
I couldn't...

1267
01:39:46,986 --> 01:39:48,914
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我没法回应我妻子的需要
I couldn't respond to my wife.

1268
01:39:52,249 --> 01:39:54,043
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}你觉得那比做疯子要强吗?
You think that's better than being crazy?

1269
01:39:54,547 --> 01:39:56,999
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我们得让你接受更高强度的
We'll need to start you on a higher run

1270
01:39:56,999 --> 01:39:59,350

of insulin shocks and a new medication.

1271
01:39:59,350 --> 01:40:00,950
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}不
No.

1272
01:40:01,474 --> 01:40:02,740
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}一定还有别的办法
There has to be another way.

1273

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}精神分裂症非常不稳定
Schizophrenia is degenerative.

1274
01:40:04,806 --> 01:40:06,850
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}有些时候不会发病
Some days may be symptom-free,

1275
01:40:06,850 --> 01:40:08,703
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}但拖得越久，情况会越糟糕
but over time, you are getting worse.

1276
01:40:08,703 --> 01:40:12,231
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}它就是一个问题，仅此而已
It's a problem. That's all it is.

1277
01:40:12,699 --> 01:40:14,854
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}它就是一个还没有解的问题
It's a problem with no solution.

1278
01:40:14,931 --> 01:40:16,584
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}而那正是我的专长，我总能解出问题
And that's what I do, I solve problems.

1279
01:40:16,584 --> 01:40:18,151
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}-这是我最擅长的  -这不是数学
-That's what I do best.  -This isn't math.

1280
01:40:18,262 --> 01:40:20,050
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}你没法写出一行公式
You can't come up with a formula

1281
01:40:20,050 --> 01:40:21,526
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}来改变你对世界的认知
to change the way you experience the world.

1282
01:40:21,526 --> 01:40:23,045
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我只需要运用我的脑子就行
All I have to do is apply my mind.

1283
01:40:23,158 --> 01:40:24,848
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}没有什么定理，没有什么证明
There's no theorem, no proof.

1284
01:40:24,924 --> 01:40:26,447
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}你没法用理性思维去解决
You can't reason your way out of this.

1285
01:40:26,447 --> 01:40:27,684
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}凭什么? 我凭什么不行?
Why not? Why can't I?

1286
01:40:27,754 --> 01:40:31,177
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}因为你的脑子正是问题的发源地
Because your mind is where the problem is in the first place.

1287
01:40:32,651 --> 01:40:34,238
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我做得到
I can do this.

1288

I can work it out. All I need is time.

1289
01:40:42,477 --> 01:40:43,730
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}是孩子在叫吗?
Is that the baby?

1290
01:40:46,307 --> 01:40:48,162
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}孩子在我妈那儿，约翰
The baby's at my mother's, John.

1291
01:41:02,061 --> 01:41:04,750
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}如果不去治疗，约翰
Without treatment, John,

1292
01:41:04,826 --> 01:41:06,685
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}你可能会被你的幻想...
the fantasies may take over...

1293
01:41:07,757 --> 01:41:09,242
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}完全控制
entirely.

1294
01:41:27,509 --> 01:41:29,368
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}你快整理好了吗?
You almost ready?

1295

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}罗森在外面等你
Rosen's waiting outside.

1296
01:41:34,670 --> 01:41:36,898
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我不能再回到医院去
I can't go back to that hospital.

1297
01:41:40,932 --> 01:41:42,791
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}去了就回不来了
I won't come home.

1298
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:48,679
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}他说如果你这么说的话
He said that if you said that,

1299
01:41:49,792 --> 01:41:52,485
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}他为我准备了强制委托书
he has commitment papers for me to sign.

1300
01:41:55,421 --> 01:41:57,308
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}唔，也许你不会签的
Well, maybe you won't sign them.

1301
01:41:58,985 --> 01:42:01,277
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}也许你会多给我点时间
Maybe you'll just give me some time.

1302
01:42:03,847 --> 01:42:05,775
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我会找出解决的方法
I will try to figure this out.

1303
01:42:08,377 --> 01:42:09,805
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}不管你怎么定
Whatever you do,

1304
01:42:10,876 --> 01:42:13,429
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}罗森有一点说对了
Rosen is right about one thing.

1305
01:42:14,507 --> 01:42:16,435
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}你不该留在这儿
You shouldn't be here.

1306
01:42:18,670 --> 01:42:20,257
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我可能会伤害到你
I'm not safe anymore.

1307

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}你真会伤害我吗，约翰?
Would you have hurt me, John?

1308
01:42:37,655 --> 01:42:39,049
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我不知道
I don't know.

1309
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:43,048
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}也许你应该让罗森医生把你送去你妈那儿
Maybe you should let Dr. Rosen drive you to your mother's.

1310
01:43:50,266 --> 01:43:53,318
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}罗森说如果你想杀我什么的就马上打电话给他
Rosen said to call if you try and kill me or anything.

1311

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}或许让你...
Maybe the part...

1317
01:44:45,150 --> 01:44:47,550
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}能够从梦里醒过来的东西
that knows the waking from the dream,

1318
01:44:49,087 --> 01:44:51,015
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}或许它不在这儿
maybe it isn't here.

1319

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}或许它在这儿
Maybe it's here.

1320
01:45:02,577 --> 01:45:04,698
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我需要去相信
I need to believe

1321

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}某些非凡的事情是有可能发生的
that something extraordinary is possible.

1359

But I was wondering if I could hang around.

1362

No, I could just work out of the library.

1365

Well, this guy tries to wander into the library,

1366
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:27,868

but he doesn't have I.D.

1367

And while you rock and drool,

1381

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}这世界正要被烧成灰烬!
the world will burn to ashes!

1382

You are not real! You are not real!

1383

1393

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}你真该看看他们当时的表情
You should've seen their faces.

1394

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}大家都盯着我看
Everybody was just staring at me.

1395

1397
01:50:48,011 --> 01:50:49,802

But then, on the way home,

1398

Sometimes, I really miss talking to him.

1400

Maybe Rosen's right.

1401
01:51:06,230 --> 01:51:08,550
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}或许我应该考虑再回医院里去
Maybe I have to think about going back into the hospital again.

1402
01:51:09,950 --> 01:51:10,950
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}不

Come here.

1404

Maybe try again tomorrow.

1405

John, now, you can't ignore me forever.

1406

But I won't talk to you again.

Good-bye.

1413
01:52:46,653 --> 01:52:48,981
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我在想能不能旁听你的课
I was wondering if I might audit your course.

1414
01:52:50,451 --> 01:52:53,404
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}这是...这是我的荣幸，纳什教授
It's... It's an honor, Professor Nash.

1415

Is something wrong?

1416

eager young minds.

1419
01:53:30,486 --> 01:53:32,913
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}这样做不会有用的，约翰
It's never gonna work, John.

1420
01:53:32,984 --> 01:53:34,969
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}你只是在自取其辱
You're just humiliating yourself.

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}真是可怜!
It's pathetic!

1422

1522
02:00:47,617 --> 02:00:48,950
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我是来告知您
and I'm here to tell you

1523
02:00:48,950 --> 02:00:52,050
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}您被考虑授予诺贝尔奖了
that you're being considered for the Nobel prize.

1524
02:01:00,041 --> 02:01:02,196
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}请原谅，我只是有点惊呆了
Forgive me, but I'm just a little stunned.

1525
02:01:02,273 --> 02:01:04,064
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}在过去的几年中
Over the past few years

1526
02:01:04,138 --> 02:01:07,963
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}您的均衡理论已成为现代经济学的基石
your equilibrium has become a cornerstone of modern economics.

1527
02:01:08,034 --> 02:01:10,223
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}-突然间每个人都喜欢它了  -是啊
-Suddenly everybody likes that one.  -Yeah.

1528
02:01:10,299 --> 02:01:13,227

What about my work on other some such projects...

1529
02:01:13,297 --> 02:01:14,691
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}"流形嵌入" 呢?
manifold embedding?

1530
02:01:14,762 --> 02:01:18,148
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}您的议价理论已经应用在
The application of your bargaining problem

1531
02:01:18,148 --> 02:01:22,377
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}联邦电信委员会的宽频拍卖以及反托拉斯案件上...
to F.C.C. bandwidth auctions or to antitrust cases...

1532
02:01:22,456 --> 02:01:23,784
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}-反托拉斯案件?  -不错
-Antitrust cases?  -Yes.

1533
02:01:23,784 --> 02:01:26,781
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}这我倒没料到
I never would have considered that.

1534
02:01:26,853 --> 02:01:27,820
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我是不是刚好跨出了
Have I just reached

1535
02:01:27,820 --> 02:01:31,517
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}愚蠢的边界，踩到了一点儿紧挨着的正直?
some level of honesty that borders on stupidity?

1536
02:01:31,517 --> 02:01:33,104
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}不不，您可没有
No, no, you haven't.

1537
02:01:33,182 --> 02:01:35,110
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}因为我是想不到那些的
Because I wouldn't have thought of that.

1538
02:01:40,510 --> 02:01:42,097
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}咱们进去喝杯茶?
Shall we have tea?

1539
02:01:44,173 --> 02:01:46,350
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}噢，我不进去那，我通常只是...
Oh, I don't go in there. I usually just...

1540
02:01:46,350 --> 02:01:48,150
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}带着我的三明治去图书馆
take my sandwich in the library.

1541
02:01:49,403 --> 02:01:51,830
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}来吧，约翰，咱们喝杯茶去，今天可是大日子
Come on, John. Let's have some tea. It's a big day.

1542
02:01:53,033 --> 02:01:56,783
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}市场上绝大多数的品牌茶
Most commercially available brands of tea

1543
02:01:56,783 --> 02:01:58,450
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}都不合我的口味
are not suitable to my palate.

1544
02:01:58,750 --> 02:01:59,650
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我不是...
I'm not...

1545
02:02:00,028 --> 02:02:03,514
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}有一种北印度茶足够浓...
There are some northern Indian teas which are dense enough...

1546
02:02:03,514 --> 02:02:05,686
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我喜欢那种味道...
I enjoy the flavor that they have...

1547
02:02:05,686 --> 02:02:08,475
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我已经多少年没进来过了
I have not been in this room for some many years.

1548
02:02:08,554 --> 02:02:10,812
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}不知道他们都有些什么茶
I wonder what tea they serve.

1549
02:02:12,784 --> 02:02:14,607
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}噢，谢谢你，姑娘
Well, thank you, young lady.

1550
02:02:16,415 --> 02:02:18,774
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}这里的变化真大
Things have certainly changed around here.

1551
02:02:18,847 --> 02:02:20,775
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我有个儿子和她差不多大
I have a son that age.

1552
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:23,467
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}在哈佛
Harvard.

1553
02:02:29,238 --> 02:02:32,166
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我本以为诺贝尔奖的提名
I would have thought the nominations

1554
02:02:32,166 --> 02:02:34,857
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}是不会事先公开的
for the Nobel prize would have been secret.

1555
02:02:34,935 --> 02:02:38,521
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}只有在宣布的那一刻才知道
I would have thought you'd only find out if you won or lost.

1556
02:02:38,597 --> 02:02:40,150
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}一般来说是这样的，没错
That is generally the case, yes.

1557
02:02:40,150 --> 02:02:42,350
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}但是这次情况特殊
But these are special circumstances.

1558
02:02:44,094 --> 02:02:46,420
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}这个奖分量很重
The awards are substantial.

1559
02:02:46,492 --> 02:02:48,511
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}而且牵涉到私人基金
They require private funding.

1560
02:02:48,590 --> 02:02:49,950
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}因此...
As such,

1561
02:02:51,022 --> 02:02:53,577
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}诺贝尔奖得主的形象...
the image of the Nobel is...

1562
02:02:55,318 --> 02:02:58,802
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}明白了，你是来看我有没有疯对吧?
I see. You came here to find out if I was crazy?

1563
02:02:59,482 --> 02:03:01,350
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}看我会不会
Find out if I would

1564
02:03:01,350 --> 02:03:03,850
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}真的得了奖后把一切都搞砸?
screw everything up if I actually won?

1565
02:03:05,311 --> 02:03:07,164
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}在主席台上跳舞
Dance around the podium,

1566
02:03:07,164 --> 02:03:09,835
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}一丝不挂然后学鸡叫，类似这种?
strip naked and squawk like a chicken, things of this nature?

1567
02:03:10,107 --> 02:03:12,228
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}差不多啦，嗯
Something like that, yes.

1568
02:03:13,638 --> 02:03:15,225
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我会不会让你下不来台?
Would I embarrass you?

1569
02:03:19,400 --> 02:03:21,328
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}老实说，有可能
Yes, it is possible.

1570
02:03:24,363 --> 02:03:25,791
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}你知道，我...
You see, I...

1571
02:03:27,261 --> 02:03:29,086
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我是个疯子
I am crazy.

1572
02:03:31,124 --> 02:03:33,245
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}虽然我在服新药
I take the newer medications,

1573
02:03:37,087 --> 02:03:39,174
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}但还是会产生幻觉
but I still see things that are not here.

1574
02:03:42,083 --> 02:03:44,170
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我只不过是选择去否认他们
I just choose not to acknowledge them.

1575
02:03:46,579 --> 02:03:47,750
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}就像脑子的节食
Like a diet of the mind,

1576
02:03:47,750 --> 02:03:50,650
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我选择不放纵自己的某些食欲
I choose not to indulge certain appetites.

1577
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:55,459
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}比如对我症状的食欲
Like my appetite for patterns.

1578
02:03:57,604 --> 02:04:01,095
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}可能还有对想象和梦的食欲
Perhaps my appetite to imagine and to dream.

1579
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:04,328
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}纳什教授
Professor Nash.

1580
02:04:08,995 --> 02:04:11,254

It's good to have you here, John.

1582

1586

{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}干得好，约翰
Nicely done, John.

1587

1591

1598
02:05:43,656 --> 02:05:47,142
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我问自己，逻辑到底是什么?
I ask, what truly is logic?

1599
02:05:48,819 --> 02:05:50,247
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}谁决定了缘由?

1600
02:05:52,350 --> 02:05:55,550
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}我的追求带着我遍历了实体世界

1601
02:05:55,550 --> 02:05:57,450
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}形而上学

1606
02:06:17,296 --> 02:06:20,451

1607
02:06:20,528 --> 02:06:23,149
{\3c&H000000&\bord1.5\fn微软雅黑}才能找到合乎逻辑的缘由
