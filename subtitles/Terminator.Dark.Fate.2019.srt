297
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,870
我要喝水
I need some water.

298
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,680
后面可能有
If we can maybe look in the back.

299
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,220
我想回家
I wanna go home.

300
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,630
带我回家
Take me home.

301
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,590
不行
We're not doing that.

302
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,390
我得把迭戈的事告诉爸爸
I have to tell my father about Diego.

303
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,220
做不到
It's not possible.

304
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,560
他还不知道迭戈的事
He doesn't know about Diego.

305
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,120
我得见我爸
I need to see my father!

306
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,750
你爸已经死了
Your father is dead.

307
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,800
什么
What?

308
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,470
复制人类需要进行身体接触
It needs physical contact to copy people.

309
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,520
被复制的人活不下来
And they don't survive.

310
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,340
不
No.

311
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:37,840
不
No.

312
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,060
你怎么了
What's wrong with you?

313
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,950
我要崩溃了
I'm crashing.

314
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,720
你身上滚烫
You're burning up.

315
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:13,720
我的新陈代谢只适合短暂的爆发
My metabolism was tuned for short, intense bursts.

316
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,450
要么在几分钟内阻止终结者
You either stop a Terminator in the first few minutes...

317
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,320
要么就会死
or you're dead.

318
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,080
我需要药
I need meds.

319
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,900
格雷丝
Grace!

320
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,180
醒醒
Wake up!

321
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,480
你要去哪
Where are you going?

322
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,360
回到车上来
Get back in the car.

323
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,590
我得保护你
I have to protect you.

324
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,880
你连路都走不了
You can't even walk.

325
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,380
我要去找警察
I'm going to the police.

326
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:11,430
你找警察  它就会找到你
You do that, it'll find you.

327
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:16,000
你找一百个警察来对抗终结者
You put a hundred cops between you and a Terminator...

328
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,450
一百个警察都会死
you'll get a hundred dead cops.

329
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:25,090
达妮  拜托
Dani, please.

330
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,190
等等  来后面
Wait. Come here.

331
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,340
-你说你不会开车的  -是的
- You said you can't drive. - Yeah.

332
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,080
我边开边学
I'll figure it out.

333
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,110
格雷丝  格雷丝
Grace, Grace!

334
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,450
没事了  我们到了
It's okay. We're here.

335
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,750
我靠  你还真重
Fuck, you're heavy.

336
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,360
我们到了
We're here.

337
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,060
格雷丝
Grace.

338
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,810
{\pos(192,242)}小姐  你需要帮助吗

339
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,600
{\pos(192,242)}我们没事  谢谢

340
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,150
{\pos(192,242)}来人啊

341
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,110
{\pos(192,242)}需要帮...

342
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,900
我需要抗癫痫药
I need any anticonvulsant.

343
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:47,840
聚苯乙烯磺酸钠  胰岛素  苯二氮平
Sodium polystyrene sulfonate, insulin, benzodiazepine...

344
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,500
你有医生处方吗
Do you have a doctor's prescription?

345
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,900
这就是我的处方
Here's my prescription.

346
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,250
你在做什么
What are you doing?

347
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,320
去他妈的
Fuck it.

348
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,100
让开
Move.

349
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,850
{\pos(192,242)}非常抱歉  有人要杀我们

350
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,560
没关系
It's okay.

351
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,020
格雷丝
Grace.

352
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,560
格雷丝
Grace.

353
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,790
格雷丝
Grace?

354
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,480
格雷丝
Grace.

355
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,390
{\pos(192,242)}让我帮你们吧

356
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,520
{\pos(192,242)}好吧

357
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,650
我救了你们的命
I save your ass...

358
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,590
你们却偷了我的车  真行啊
and you steal my truck. Nice.

359
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,900
我...
I...

360
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,210
算了  车都废了
Never mind. It's burnt.

361
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,310
她怎么了
What's wrong with her?

362
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,240
我不知道
I don't know.

363
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,760
她是病了还是怎么的
She's sick or something.

364
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,160
我要找你俩问清楚情况
Well, I need answers from you two.

365
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,330
我们把她抬上车吧
So let's get her in the car.

366
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:29,660
把枪给我  免得你伤到自己
Give me that before you hurt yourself.

367
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,200
那你是谁
So, who are you?

368
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,370
我是达妮娜·拉莫斯
Um, Daniella Ramos.

369
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:47,640
达妮
Dani.

370
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,240
谁都不是
I'm nobody.

371
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:54,860
达妮  你肯定很重要  不然他们也不会派...
Well, Dani, you must be somebody, or they wouldn't have sent...

372
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:58,070
她这样的来保护你
whatever she is to protect you.

373
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,600
你有手机吗
Hey, you got a phone?

374
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,820
-有啊  -能给我看一下吗
- Yes. - Could I see it for a sec?

375
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,430
{\pos(192,242)}搞什么鬼啊

376
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:17,270
你还不如戴个跟踪手环呢
Might as well be wearing a tracking bracelet.

377
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,780
等我准备好要干掉那个东西时
When I'm ready to kill that thing,

378
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,880
我自然会让它知道我们的位置
then I'll let it know where we are.

379
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,180
应该用浴缸才对
We should have done this in the bathtub.

380
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:34,230
那你看到哪里有浴缸了吗
Have you seen the bathtub?

381
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,200
我把我的手机装在薯片袋里
I keep my cell phone in the chip bag.

382
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,010
铝箔能阻隔GPS信号
The foil blocks the GPS signal

383
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,930
这样他们就无法追踪到我了
so they can't track me.

384
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,550
谁在追踪你
Who's trying to track you?

385
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,880
我在几个州被通缉了
I'm wanted in a couple of states.

386
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,430
其实是50个州
50, actually.

387
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,350
但为什么要十包呢
But why 10 bags?

388
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,070
因为我特别爱吃薯片
Because I really like potato chips.

389
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:13,890
她的药
Her meds...

390
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,460
你怎么知道每一种需要多少剂量
how do you know how much of each to use?

391
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,070
我不知道
I don't.

392
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,940
没人会知道他是谁
No one will know who he is.

393
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,740
你说谁
Who?

394
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,690
我弟弟
My brother.

395
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,040
当时他在车里...
He was in the truck when...

396
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,100
谁能让他  还有我爸
Who will be there to bury him?

397
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,130
入土为安
Or my father?

398
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,220
没有葬礼
No funerals.

399
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:18,070
没人跟他们道别
No one there to say goodbye.

400
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,800
葬礼救不了他们
Funerals don't help them.

401
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,290
道别也帮不了你
And goodbyes don't help you.

402
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,570
你只能学着接受这一切
You just have to learn to live with it.

403
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,920
呼叫基地
Come in, base.

404
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:39,430
这里是蜻蜓三号  请求近距空中支援
This is Dragonfly Three requesting close air support.

405
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:40,980
我们在五公里外
We are five klicks out,

406
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,640
运送重要伤员  完毕
carrying wounded precious cargo. Over.

407
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,300
收到  蜻蜓三号
Roger that, Dragonfly Three.

408
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,720
请注意五号方位有敌人靠近
Be advised there are hostiles inbound on vector five.

409
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:54,870

410
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,390

413
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,550
我们有三十秒
We got 30 seconds.

414
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,990
-马上下来  回撤  -快

415
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,760
敌人来袭
Incoming!

416
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,130
你把指挥官带进去
You get the commander inside.

417
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,150
是
Okay.

418
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,940
你们三个  跟我来  拖住它们
You three, with me! Hold them back!

419
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,270
快
Come on!

420
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,260
小心
Look out!

421
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:38,620
我们寡不敌众  需要立刻增援
We're being overrun! We need reinforcements now!

422
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,100
掩护她

423
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,000
让开  进来了
Move! Coming in!

424
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,660
靠
Shit!

425
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,960
她多处被刺伤
She's got multiple stab wounds.

426
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:56,880
胸部创伤严重
A lot of chest trauma here.

427
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,510
赶快将这些伤口缝合

428
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,620
在右侧插入胸管

429

我得保护你们的指挥官

434
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,370
幸亏有你  指挥官现在安全了
The commander is safe, thanks to you.

435
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,410
别担心  士兵  你能挺过去
Don't worry, soldier. You'll make it.

436
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,100

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,980
说话
Talk.

443
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,930
快说
Talk fast.

444
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,300
你先说
You first.

445
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,560
放开我
Get off me.

446
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,700
莎拉
Sarah!

447
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,150
莎拉  开门
Hey, Sarah! Open the door.

448
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,650
达妮
Dani!

449
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,090
-你还好吗  -没事  你呢
- You okay? - Yeah, you okay?

450
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,000
挺好
Yeah.

451
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,510
怎么回事
What happened?

452
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:12,940
把我锁在屋子外面
Locked me out of the room?

453
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:18,030
有时候家长要讨论大人的事情
Sometimes mommies and daddies have to have grown-up discussions.

454
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,360
那么你是来保护她的
So you're here to protect her.

455
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,770
你是个什么东西
What are you?

456
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,820
以前从没见过像你这样
Never seen one like you before.

457
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,420
几乎就和人类一样
Almost human.

458
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,880
我就是人类
I am human.

459
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,240
只不过是强化了
Just enhanced.

460
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,540
速度更快  力量更强
You know, increased speed and strength,

461
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,210
微型钍反应堆
thorium micro-reactor.

462
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,780
也就是说你要是惹毛我了
Which means I can rip your throat out

463
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,860
我能一把掐死你  所以别惹我
if you piss me off, so don't.

464
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,130
你从哪个年代来的
When are you from?

465
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,980
2042年
2042.

466
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,620
该你说了
Your turn.

467
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,050
我叫莎拉·康纳
My name is Sarah Connor.

468
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,570
我和她差不多年纪的时候
When I was about her age...

469
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,360
一个终结者被派来杀我
a Terminator was sent to kill me...

470
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,370
阻止我的儿子约翰出生
to stop the birth of my son, John.

471
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,800
反抗军的首领
Leader of the Resistance.

472
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,520
哪个反抗军
Which resistance?

473
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:24,230
人类反抗军
The human resistance.

474
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,960
跟天网对抗的那个
Against Skynet?

475
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,760
那个要消灭全人类的人工智能
The AI that's trying to wipe us all out?

476
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,130
我从没听说过
I've never heard of it.

477
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:34,840
很好
Good.

478
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,790
是约翰和我改变的
John and I changed that.

479
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,190
我们改变了未来
We changed the future.

480
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,000
拯救了三十亿人类
Saved three billion lives.

481
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,020
不用谢
You're welcome.

482
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,690
你的儿子现在在哪
Where's your son now?

483
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,790
天网派了好几个终结者追杀他
Skynet had sent several Terminators to hunt him.

484
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,920
其中一个最终找到了我们
One finally caught up with us and...

485
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:18,080
执行了来自没有发生的未来的命令
carried out orders from a future that never happened.

486
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:21,950
从那以后
Since then...

487
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,940
我就在猎杀终结者
I hunt Terminators.

488
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:31,100
整日喝酒到不省人事
And I drink till I black out.

489
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,440
这样的自我介绍够了吗
Enough of a resume for you?

490
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,180
不够
No.

491
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:40,360
你怎么知道我们会上那条高速
How did you know we'd be on that freeway?

492
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,840
面试结束  我们该动身了
Interview's over. We gotta move.

493
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,340
我们
We?

494
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,770
"我们"是不存在的
There is no "We."

495
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:49,330
达妮是和我一起的  保护她是我的任务
Dani's with me. It's my mission to protect her.

496
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,440
是吗
Oh, yeah?

497
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,100
结果如何呢
How's that working out for you?

498
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,900
显然你对这个时代的了解还不够
Clearly you don't know everything about this time.

499
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,870
每个带手机的人都是行走的传感器平台
How anyone with a phone is a walking sensor platform.

500
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,510
每个十字路口  每个加油站
How every intersection, every gas station

501
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,620
每个便利店都有摄像头
and 7-Eleven has cameras.

502
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,140
这个世界上的每个人都会在
Nobody walks through this world

503
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,650
两公里范围内留下数码痕迹
without leaving a digital trail a mile wide.

504
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:12,870
我猜那个追杀她的终结者
And my guess is that Terminator hunting her...

505
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,520
可以随时获取那些数据
can access that data anytime.

506
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,560
你俩是撑不过十小时的
You two won't last 10 hours.

507
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:40,020
我们把话说明白
Let's get something straight.

508
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,050
如果你让她陷入危险  或者碍着我了
If you put her in danger or you get in my way,

509
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,240
我就搞死你
I will fuck you up.

510
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,320
好
Right.

511
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,260
我来开车
I drive.

512
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,300
那个机器...
So, that machine...

513
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:55,980
谁派来的
who sent it?

514
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:01,550
不知道对方什么来头  我就没法对付它
I can't fight it if I don't know what we're up against.

515
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,840
是终结者Rev-7型
It's a Rev-9 model.

516
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,800
你对付不了
You don't fight it.

517
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,590
只能逃跑
You run from it.

518
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,580
好吧  但是什么人派来的
Yeah, but who sent it?

519
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,070
不是什么人
Not who.

520
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,300
而是什么东西  而且不是
What. And it wasn't some...

521
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,480
天网那东西
Skynet thing.

522
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,290
在真正发生的未来里
In the future that actually happened...

523
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:20,750
它叫"军团"
it's called Legion.

524
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:21,800
军团
Legion.

525
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,180
为网络战争打造的人工智能
An AI built for cyber warfare.

526
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:27,510
那些混蛋真是不长教训
Those assholes never learn.

527
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,280
它展开了攻击
And it attacked.

528
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,150
-攻击谁  -我们
- Attacked who? - Us.

529
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,830
每个人  人类
Everybody. Humanity.

530
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,420
莎拉  你怎么知道我们会在那架桥上
Sarah, how did you know we would be on that bridge?

531
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,270
我会收到信息
I get these texts.

532
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:53,160
精准坐标定位  日期  时间  精确到秒
Precise GPS coordinates, dates, times, down to the second.

533
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,330
这些信息结尾都会有出现四个字
They always end with the same two words.

534
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,030
"为了约翰"
"For John."

535
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:02,430
所以我就带上所有武器
So I pack up every weapon I've got,

536
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:07,150
去定位的地方  干掉任何惹我的人
and I head to those coordinates to kill whoever is messing with me.

537
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,240
有个停车场上的空气被撕裂
The air splits open above a parking lot

538
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,290
然后一个终结者掉了出来
and a Terminator drops out.

539
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,070
我把它摧毁了
So I destroy it.

540
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,590
然后过了两年  同样的事
And then two years later, same thing.

541
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:23,260
位置  时间  日期  "为了约翰"
Location, time, date, "For John."

542
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,100
我把那个也干掉了
I frag that one, too.

543
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,940
上周我收到两条信息
And last week, I get two texts,

544
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,110
都在墨西哥城
both in Mexico City.

545
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,450
你查到是谁发的信息了吗
Did you ever find out who sends those texts?

546
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:36,470
没有  信息总是加密过的
No. They're always encrypted.

547
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:39,140
信息还在你手机上吗
Do you still have them on your phone?

548
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,240
达妮
Dani.

549
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:50,820
你在做什么
What are you doing?

550
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:52,070
未来技术
Future shit.

551
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,750
怎么了  怎么回事
What's wrong? What is it?

552
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:01,810
这些信息是从拉雷多市郊发出的
These texts came from outside Laredo.

553
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,350
两天前
Two days ago,

554
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,270
我的指挥官让人在我身上纹了这个坐标
my commander had them tattoo these coordinates on me.

555
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:09,680
好像我记不住似的
As if I couldn't remember shit.

556
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,910
告诉我要是任务出了岔子就去这里
Told me to go here in case anything went sideways with my mission.

557
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,060
这个地方就是给你发信息的位置
It's the same location your texts come from.

558
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,400
给你发信息的人
Whoever sent you these texts

559
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,130
就是他们让我求助的人
is the same person I was told to go to for help.

560
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,250
什么意思
What does it mean?

561
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,780
意思是我们要去德州了
It means we're going to Texas.

562
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:32,350
你要和一个没有签证的墨西哥人
You wanna cross the U.S. Border with an undocumented Mexican national

563
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:36,190
还有美国头号女通缉犯一起穿过美国边境吗
and a woman who had her own episode on America's Most Wanted?

564
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:38,940
我认识可以帮我们穿过边境的人
I know someone who can get us across.

565
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:42,220
是你信得过的人吗
Someone you trust?

566
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:45,070
是的  我叔叔
Yes. My uncle.

567
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,860
我们得弃车
Well, we need to ditch the car.

568
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,420
销声匿迹
Get off the grid.

569
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,470
你为什么要在乎她
Why do you care what happens to her?

570
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,760
女士们
Hey, ladies.

571
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,010
因为她就是曾经的我
Because I was her.

572
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,290
那感觉糟糕透了
And it sucks.

573
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,480
我们走
Let's go.

574
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:41,430
这样确实销声匿迹了
Well, this is off the grid, all right.

575
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:45,040
真希望没有这么多人
But I wish it wasn't so crowded here.

576
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:47,410
真希望你俩没这么白
Well, I wish you two weren't so white.

577
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,510
女士们  出发
Let's go, chicas.

578
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:13,690
谢谢
Gracias.

585
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:24,730
什么都没发生
Nothing happens.

586
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,290
没有预警
There's no warning.

587
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,270
第一天  一切都停止了
Day one, everything just stops.

588
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:35,020
手机用不了  没有电  城市陷入黑暗
No phones, no power. Cities go dark.

589
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,830
格雷丝  待在原地
Grace, stay there.

590
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,110
他们告诉我们
They told us

591
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,710
我们必须离开
we had to leave,

592
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:46,980
知道一切恢复正常
just until things got back to normal.

593
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:05,550
但是再也没恢复正常
But normal was never coming back.

594
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,640
第二天
Day two,

595
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:11,650
他们发射了核武器
they launched nukes.

596
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:16,440
他们以为电磁脉冲打击能压制军团
They thought they could contain Legion with tactical EMP strikes.

597
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,990
到了第三天  整个世界都陷入了战争
And by day three, the whole world was at war.

598
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:28,660
数百万人死亡
Millions died.

599
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,410
然后等食物消耗完了
And then, when the food ran out,

600
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,910
数十亿死亡
billions.

601
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:42,590
几个人因为一罐桃子杀了我爸
Some men killed my dad over a can of peaches.

602
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,260
抱歉
I'm sorry.

603
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,230
在我们以为战争已经结束了时候
When we thought the worst was over,

604
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:52,140
军团开始猎杀幸存者
then Legion started to hunt survivors.

605
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,190
我们知道你有吃的  小家伙
We know you got food, kid.

606
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:33,220
交出来
Give it up.

607
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:47,070
之后的几年我都不知道自己怎么撑过来的
I don't know how I made it through the next few years.

608
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,320
我尽量不去想
I just try not to think about it.

609
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,370
但我很幸运
But I got lucky.

610
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:54,540
有人找到了我
Someone found me,

611
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,870
救了我
saved me,

612
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:03,730
然后我们开始反击
and then we started fighting back.

613
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:05,340
让我猜猜
And let me guess.

614
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,930
达妮生的孩子可以阻止这一切
Dani gives birth to the one man that can stop it.

615
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:17,030
-什么  -未来想要你死
- What? - The future wants you dead

616
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:19,640
跟想要我死的原因一样
for the same reason it wanted me dead.

617
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:22,200
但我只是个小人物
But I'm nothing. I'm nobody.

618
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,150
没错  你不是威胁
Yeah, you're not the threat.

619
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,360
你的子宫是
It's your womb.

620
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:38,120
好  暂时换个人当圣母玛利亚
Fine. Let someone else be Mother Mary for a while.

621
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,970
如果你是圣母玛利亚
If you're Mother Mary,

622
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,580
为什么我这么想揍你
why do I so wanna beat the shit outta you?

623
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,310
{\pos(192,242)}叔叔

624
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,780
达妮
Dani!

625
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,360
{\pos(192,242)}你好  我的小美女

626
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:59,900
{\pos(192,242)}你来这里干什么

627
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:06,580
我的客户都能安全穿过边境
My clients get across safely.

628
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:08,250
追求更好的生活
To a better life.

629
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:12,020
我和别人不同  不会让他们在沙漠里等死
I don't leave them to die in the desert as some others do.

630
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:15,010
你能帮我们穿过边境吗
Can you get us across the border?

631
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:20,810
抱歉  但外国佬通常不是我的客户
Forgive me, but gringas are not my usual clientele.

632
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,400
你们两个做了什么非法的事吗
You two do something illegal maybe?

633
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,610
达妮不愿说的事
Something my Dani doesn't wish to say?

634
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:33,820
叔叔  有个...
Tio, there's...

635
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,160
这事听起来很疯狂
This is going to sound crazy,

636
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,830
但外面有个机器
but there's a machine out there.

637
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:41,200
机器人
A robot.

638
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:43,180
它杀死了爸爸和迭戈
It's what killed Papi and Diego,

639
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:45,000
还想要杀我
and it wants to kill me.

640
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:46,960
我们得摆脱它
We have to get away from it.

641
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,670
这理由挺新鲜
That's a new one.

642
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:00,560
格雷丝也算半个机器人
Grace is part machine, too.

643
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,830
这边走  女士们
This way, ladies.

644
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:29,810
{\an8}无人机

645
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:34,840
你们好
Hey, fellas.

646
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:35,760
你好
What's up?

647
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:44,020
是不是和边境巡逻一模一样
Ain't that just like the Border Patrol.

648
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,160
迟到了五分钟  而且没给我们带甜甜圈
Five minutes late, and neglects to bring us donuts.

649
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,900
泰伦斯  闭嘴吧
Terrance, shut the fuck up.

650
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,490
{\pos(192,242)}你不想知道在追我们的是什么吗

651
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:06,820
{\pos(192,242)}达妮  我是个偷渡蛇头

652
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:09,070
{\pos(192,242)}总有人在追我

653
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,360
格里芬33接触

格里芬33  911  那就是目标
Griffin 33 9-11, that is your target.

657
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,030
快到了

658
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,340
还有一公里到河边
One more kilometer to the river.

659

找掩护
Take cover.

661
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:52,960
上面有无人机
There's a drone up there.

662
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:55,470
我什么都没听到
I don't hear anything.

663
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,230
当然了  你又不是来自未来的
Yeah, well, you're not an augmented super soldier

664
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:58,760
强化超级士兵  对吧
from the future, are you?

665
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,220
我们得快点
We have to hurry.

666

请注意  所有巡逻队
Attention, all patrols.

7B检查站以南220米处

已知他们是锡那罗亚贩毒集团的成员
They are known members of the Sinaloa Cartel.

671
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:17,980
美国与墨西哥当局都在通缉他们

672
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:22,280
预计他们携有武器  十分危险

允许致命打击

674

When you reach the wall,

00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,170
下面有一扇门
there's a door beneath.

676

弗拉科会为你们带路

站住  美国边境巡逻

把武器扔到地上
Put your weapons on the ground.

681
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,960

We get locked up, it comes for her, she's dead.

682

They can shoot me, but I'm not watching you die.

687
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:33,180

没事的
It's okay.

689
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,400
如果他们把我和她分开了
If they separate me from her,

00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,620
-请把她救出去  -好的

I just got TDY'd here to pick up a new detainee.

726
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:24,870
他们被关在哪
Where they being held?

727
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:26,650
去行政警官那里签到
Check in with the desk sergeant.

728

晚上好

731

请寄存你的武器
Please locker your weapon.

732
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:07,610
她经受了什么
What's been done to her?

733
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:11,110
她身体里这么多东西是怎么活下来的
How is she even alive with all this stuff in her?

734
01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:15,410
我保证警报器会响  老兄
Expect a big ping, brother.

735
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,130
我的全身就是一件武器
My whole body's a weapon.

736
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:18,870
留着给女士讲去吧
Save it for the ladies.

737
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:22,840
抱歉  金属髋骨
Sorry. Metal hip.

738
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,580
两次阿富汗驻派
Two tours in Afghanistan.

739
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:28,170

01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,320
知道吗
Guess what.

745
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,160
你很有名
You're famous.

746
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:59,120
我们这里抓到的名人可不多
And we don't get a lot of famous around here.

747
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:01,330
走吧
Let's go.

748
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,330
你有自己的单人牢房
You belong in your own private cage.

749
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:07,750
我也想去
I want to go, too!

750
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:35,320
抓住她
Catch her!

751
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,420
我允许你们看我的私处了吗
Did I say you can look at my private parts?

752
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:52,310
新来的囚犯都被关在哪
Where do they take the new prisoners?

753
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:54,300
应该叫被拘留者  我们...
They're called detainees and we...

754
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:59,430
他们被送到了最南边的扣押区  等待审核...
They're taken to the south end holding area for processing...

755
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,470
谢谢

756
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:40,110
{\an8}火警

757
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,770
这边走  女士
Right this way, ma'am.

758
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:44,970
我们的高级居住区在二楼
Our senior living section is on the second floor.

759
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,590
格雷丝  格雷丝

760
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:26,260
-你还好吗  -他来了  我们得走了

01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,100
上去
Get in!

764
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:18,020
我们得走了
We gotta go.

765
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,820
莎拉来了  她来了
There's Sarah. She's coming.

766
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:26,320
-没时间了  -什么
- There's no time. - What?

767
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:30,910
不  我不会丢下她
No! I'm not leaving her!

768
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:32,620
达妮
Dani!

769
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,960
莎拉  快跑
Sarah, run!

770
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:40,960
-莎拉  带上她  -上去
- Sarah, get her! - Get in!

771
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:09,030
达妮  你需要明白
Dani, you need to understand something.

772
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:11,490
你不能再做这样的傻事了
You can't do stupid shit like that.

773
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:14,260
你不能拿自己的命冒险
You cannot put yourself at risk.

774
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:16,680
-他本会杀了莎拉  -那不重要
- He would have killed Sarah. - That doesn't matter!

775
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,540
你什么时候才会明白
When are you gonna get it?

776
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:23,050
如果你活不下来  所有人都会死
Everybody dies if you don't make it.

777
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,510
她说得对
She's right.

778
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,310
什么
What?

779
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:40,730
你们好
Hey there, fellas.

780
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:43,070
你们都是来看闹剧的吗
Y'all come to see the shitshow?

781
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,530
到底发生了什么
What the hell happened here?

782
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:46,920
被拘留者趁机逃脱  打开了所有的牢房
Detainee got loose, unlocked all the cages,

783
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,910
发生了混乱
just chaos from there.

784
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:51,080
不瞒你说
I don't mind tellin' you,

785
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:53,910
刚才五分钟里我把这辈子的祈祷都做了
I prayed more in five minutes than I have my whole life.

786
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:55,200
明白了
Heard that.

787
01:05:56,180 --> 01:06:00,130
打听一下  你们知道哪能搞到直升机吗
Say, you boys know where I can get my hands on a chopper?

788
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:09,550
我们在坐标上方
We're over the coordinates.

789
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,850
距离一公里处着陆
Land a klick short.

790
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:37,930
{\an8}卡尔窗饰
我们从不让你空窗

791
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:39,920
卡尔吗  这就是你的计划
So, Carl? That's the plan?

792
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,840
卡尔就是那个神秘发信人
Carl's the mystery texter.

793
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,530
不
No!

794
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,450
不
No!

795
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:15,990
莎拉·康纳
Sarah Connor.

796
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:17,790
莎拉
Sarah!

797
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:20,840
我要杀了你  我要杀了你
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

798
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:22,290
你他妈在做什么
What the fuck are you doing?

799
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,060
-把枪给我  -不
- Let me have it! - No.

800
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:26,140
莎拉  你得冷静下来
Sarah, you need to calm down.

801
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:28,800
那东西杀了约翰
That thing killed John!

802
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:32,510
-是真的吗  -是
- Is that true? - Yes.

803
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:34,440
但我不是你想的那样
But I'm not what you think I am.

804
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:37,150
我要杀了你  你这混蛋
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!

805
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:37,690
莎拉  莎拉
Sarah, Sarah.

806
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:39,850
-要是这个人能帮我们  -他不是人类
- If this man can help us... - Not a man.

807
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:41,440
是终结者
A Terminator.

808
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,410
朝他脸上来一枪  看看他身体里什么
Shoot him in the face and see what's underneath!

809
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:46,360
我不在乎他是什么
I don't care what he is!

810
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:48,980
拜托了
Please.

811
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:08,920
-所以你是  -对
- So you're a... - Yes.

812
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:11,590
生化人系统101型
Cyberdyne Systems Model 101.

813
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:14,090
我能问问你的身份吗
May I ask what you are?

814
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:16,010
不能
No.

815
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:37,570
莎拉
Sarah?

816
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:55,340
我一张约翰的照片都没有
I don't have a photograph of John.

817
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,430
我从没拍过
I never took any.

818
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:08,860
我以为
I thought that...

819
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:15,150
如果他们不知道他的样貌
they couldn't find him...

820
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:19,620
就无法找到他
if they didn't know what he looked like.

821
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:25,000
但我现在快忘了他的长相了
But now I'm forgetting his face.

822
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:29,420
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

823
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,300
为什么那姑娘被盯上了
So why is the girl targeted?

824
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:39,640
你不用知道
You don't need to know.

825
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,760
起码告诉我你是怎么找到我的吧
Well, can you at least tell me how you found me?

826
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,480
谁给你的坐标
Who gave you that?

827
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:10,540
谢谢
Thanks.

828
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:23,100
-请坐下  -废话少说
- Please sit down. - Cut the shit.

829
01:10:30,490 --> 01:10:32,110
不错的一家
Nice family.

830
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:34,570
她也是终结者吗
She a Terminator, too?

831
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:39,450
那是你的终结者小孩吗
That's your little Terminator kid?

832
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:41,070
他叫马特奥
His name is Mateo.

833
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:43,000
我杀死约翰几个月后
I met his mother, Alicia,

834
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:45,160
遇到了马特奥的母亲艾丽西亚
a few months after I killed John.

835
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,830
你不准提他的名字
Oh, you don't get to say his name.

836
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:49,250
永远不准
Ever.

837
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,380
她的丈夫虐打她
Her husband had beaten her.

838
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:57,260
企图杀了她儿子
He was trying to kill her child.

839
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,920
她无处可去
She had nowhere to go.

840
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,010
照顾这个家庭给了我生活目标
Caring for this family gave me purpose.

841
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:05,150
没有目标  我们就什么也不是
'Cause without purpose, we are nothing.

842
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:08,810
感人的故事  你到底想说什么
Touching story. Does it have a point?

843
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:11,810
抚养我的儿子  马特奥时
While raising Mateo, my son,

844
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:14,870
我开始理解我从你那里夺走了什么
I began to understand what I had taken from you.

845
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:17,780
什么  你逐渐生出了良心
Wait. You grew a conscience?

846
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,880
差不多的东西吧  对
The equivalent of one, yes.

847
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,920
它是个潜入者
It's an infiltrator.

848
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,710
它在撒谎
It's lying.

849
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:28,050
我的任务完结后  就没有别的指令了
When my mission was completed, there were no further orders.

850
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:30,500
因此在二十年间  我不断地学习
So for 20 years, I kept learning

851
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,250
如何变得更像人类
how to become more human.

852
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:34,970
那些信息呢
So what about the texts?

853
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:37,170
时间错位一旦发生
When chronal displacement occurs

854
01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:38,890
在错位事件之前
there's a shockwave through time

855
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:40,650
会出现一道时间上可测量的震荡波
measurable before the event.

856
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:43,190
这是方法  不是原因
That's how, not why.

857
01:11:43,190 --> 01:11:45,100
为了给你目标  莎拉
To give you purpose, Sarah.

858
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:48,350
我想这样你儿子的死就有意义了
I thought it would bring meaning to your son's death.

859
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:57,730
你知道怎样让我儿子的死有意义吗
You know what would give meaning to his death?

860
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,190
不  莎拉
No, Sarah!

861
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,270
这将很难对艾丽西亚解释
This will be very hard to explain to Alicia.

862
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:10,380
它是个终结者
It's a Terminator!

863
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:12,390
而我们正在同一个终结者开战
And we are fighting a Terminator.

864
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:14,810
一个我们无法抵挡的终结者
One that we can't stop.

865
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:20,130
你相信命运吗  莎拉
Do you believe in fate, Sarah?

866
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:22,970
还是说  你相信我们每分每秒所做的决定
Or do you believe that we all can change the future

867
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:25,550
都能够改变未来
every second by every choice that we make?

868
01:12:26,770 --> 01:12:29,300
你选择了改变未来
You chose to change the future.

869
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:33,740
你选择了毁灭天网
You chose to destroy Skynet.

870
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:36,060
你给了我自由
You set me free.

871
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:38,920
现在
And now,

872
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:42,390
我会帮你保护那女孩
I'm going to help you protect the girl

873
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,230
因为我选择如此
because I choose to.

874
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:52,990
是艾丽西亚回来了
That's Alicia.

875
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,800
她需要我帮忙把买的菜拿进来
She needs my help with the groceries.

876
01:13:02,230 --> 01:13:04,140
-你好  宝贝  -你好
- Hi, honey. - Hi.

877
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:05,600
家里来客人了
We have company.

878
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,300
客人  是谁
Company? Who?

879
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:17,690
热水足够吗
Was there enough hot water?

880
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:20,330
-足够  谢谢  -谢谢
- Yes, thank you. - Thanks.

881
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:22,590
给
Here you go.

882
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:28,170
卡尔  你的朋友看起来饿了
Carl, your friends look hungry.

883
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:32,340
你想吃点三明治或者薯片之类的吗
Would you like some sandwiches and chips or something?

884
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:34,360
这主意不错  艾丽西亚
That's a great idea, Alicia.

885
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:40,950
马特奥  去帮你妈妈吧
Mateo, why don't you go and help your mother?

886
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:42,510
好的  爸  我这就去
Sure, Dad. I'm on it.

887
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:50,870
所以你是卡尔
So, you're Carl.

888
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:53,720
大家都这么叫我
That's what everyone calls me, yes.

889
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:56,580
我他妈永远不会叫你卡尔
I'm never gonna fucking call you Carl.

890
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:02,060
他们不知道吗
They don't know?

891
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:08,280
-是的  -她没注意你体重超过180公斤吗
- No. - She hasn't noticed that you weigh 400 pounds?

892
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,070
也没发现你从来不睡觉吗
That you never sleep?

893
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:12,300
我们不是肉体关系
Our relationship is not physical.

894
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,620
我换尿布麻利又不抱怨
She appreciated that I could change diapers.

895
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:17,040
她喜欢这个
Efficiently and without any complaints.

896
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:20,740
我很可靠  我擅长倾听
I am reliable, I'm a very good listener

897
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,800
我还非常幽默
and I'm extremely funny.

898
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:27,320
行
Okay.

899
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,650
我们要怎么阻止这东西
How do we stop this thing?

900
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:32,600
我们选好我们的武器和场地
We choose our weapons and our ground,

901
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:34,700
设置一个杀戮陷阱
we set up a kill box,

902
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:36,550
然后用达妮引它过来
and then we use Dani to bring it to us.

903
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,610
-什么  -然后干掉它
- What? - And then we take it down.

904
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:41,710
不  不行  达妮不能当诱饵
No. No way. Dani is not bait.

905
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:42,890
莎拉说得对
Sarah is right.

906
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:44,860
我们的一个战略优势就是
Our one tactical advantage

907
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:47,110
终结者眼里只有任务
is that the Terminator only sees its mission.

908
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:49,760
达妮去哪里他就跟去哪里
Wherever Dani goes, he will follow.

909
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,100
的确如此  我会等着他来
Damn right it will. And I will be there.

910
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:55,700
我不会让她给你们冒险当诱饵的
Well, I'm not about to stake her out like some goat for you.

911
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,860
那你有什么计划  接着逃跑吗
What's your plan? More running?

912
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:01,190
我的计划是把她藏起来  即便藏到矿井下面
My plan is to hide her at the bottom of a mineshaft if I have to.

913
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:03,210
-至少藏到我  -别吵了
- At least until I... - Just stop it!

914
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:05,880
我不会藏到矿井底下
I'm not hiding at the bottom of a mineshaft.

915
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:11,140
我拒绝在恐惧中度过余生
I'm not gonna live in fear the rest of my life.

916
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:14,000
即使你的计划意味着我命不久矣
Even if your plan means that might not be long.

917
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:18,320
我要挺身反抗
I want to stand and fight.

918
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:21,540
我们选好我们的武器
So, we choose our weapons

919
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:22,820
以及场地
and our ground.

920
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:24,360
我们要设置一个
We're gonna set up a...

921
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,440
-杀戮陷阱  -杀戮陷阱
- Kill box. - Kill box.

922
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:29,180
然后  用我做诱饵
And then, we're gonna use me as bait.

923
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:32,100
然后  我们杀掉那东西
And then, we kill that thing.

924
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:34,690
行吗
Okay?

925
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:38,140
这计划成功率很高
This plan has a high probability of success.

926
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,170
行
Okay.

927
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:49,130
有什么武器
What weapons?

928
01:16:10,030 --> 01:16:11,980
你一直备着这些东西吗
You just keep these around?

929
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:14,710
即便不被失控的人工智能统治
Even without a rogue AI taking over,

930
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:17,050
我计算过  人类的文明
I calculate a 74% chance

931
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:20,020
也有74%的概率会毁灭  重归野蛮
that human civilization will collapse into barbarism.

932
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:21,730
到了那个最终的时刻
And in that eventuality,

933
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:24,870
这些武器会是保护我的家人的关键
these weapons will be vital to protect my family.

934
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:27,240
况且
Also...

935
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,110
这里是德州
this is Texas.

936
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:43,060
开始  连射
Go. Rapid fire.

937
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,450
你要试着缓解后坐力
You're anticipating the recoil.

938
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:51,550
重心前移  手臂举高
Put your weight forward, arms up.

939
01:16:51,930 --> 01:16:53,190
腿再站开一点
And wider stance.

940
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:54,140
手肘不要绷得太紧
Don't lock out your elbows.

941
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:55,670
废话够了
Enough of this bullshit.

942
01:16:55,670 --> 01:16:57,400
我们来动真格的
Let's get serious.

943
01:17:05,410 --> 01:17:07,650
一个终结者刚刚杀了你全家
A Terminator has just killed your whole family.

944
01:17:07,650 --> 01:17:09,200
你要怎么做
What do you do?

945
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,470
你知道这些枪杀不死它
You know these guns won't kill it.

946
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,380
只能拖慢它
They'll only slow him down.

947
01:17:26,910 --> 01:17:29,560
根据你对他能力的描述
According to your description of his capabilities,

948
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:33,200
我们最好的选择就是弄到一把军用能量武器
our best option is to secure a military-grade energy weapon.

949
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,320
EMP吗
An EMP?

950
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:37,390
那是什么
What is that?

951
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:39,370
电磁脉冲
An electromagnetic pulse.

952
01:17:39,370 --> 01:17:40,820
如果我们近距离使用
If we had one close range,

953
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:42,770
能摧毁Rev-9
it would fry a Rev-9.

954
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:45,040
我或许认识一人
I might know a guy.

955
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:48,120
宾厄姆的空军情报官
Air Force intelligence officer out of Bingham.

956
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:50,520
离这里151公里
It's 94 miles from here.

957
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:52,290
我们今天下午就出发
We should leave this afternoon.

958
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,310
好的
Okay.

959
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,950
你一直在跟踪我吗
You've been tracking me?

960
01:17:57,410 --> 01:18:00,230
如果你要把手机放在薯片袋里
If you want to keep your phone in a bag of potato chips,

961
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:03,130
那就别拿出来
then keep your phone in a bag of potato chips.

962
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:29,830
-照顾好妈妈  -我会的
- Take good care of Mama. - I will.

963
01:18:30,530 --> 01:18:32,000
你会没事的
You're gonna be okay.

964
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:12,100
你跟他们说了什么
What did you tell them?

965
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:16,480
我告诉他们你们的到来  让这个地方不安全了
I told them you coming here makes this place unsafe for them.

966
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:20,380
而且  我曾警告他们可能会来的那一天
Also, the day I warned them might come,

967
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:21,880
已经到来
has come.

968
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,940
我的过去来找我算账了
My past has caught up with me.

969
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:28,110
还有
And...

970
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:32,150
我不会回来了
I won't be back.

971
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,240
你爱他们吗
Do you love them?

972
01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:44,150
不是人类的爱
Not like a human can.

973
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,890
多年来我一直认为这是种优势
For many years I thought it was an advantage.

974
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:51,900
但不是的
It isn't.

975
01:19:54,070 --> 01:19:55,460
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

976
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:07,610
我只是想告诉你
I just want you to know

977
01:20:07,690 --> 01:20:10,580
等达妮安全了  这一切都结束后
that when Dani's safe and this is all over,

978
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,330
我会杀了你
I am going to kill you.

979
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:15,840
我明白
I understand.

980
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:31,080
这不仅仅是要选对颜色
There's much more to it than just picking the right color.

981
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:34,510
还要考虑的是质感  材料的重量
It's the texture, the weight of the material.

982
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:37,490
-一个错误的选择  -莎拉  你还好吗
- One wrong choice... - Sarah, you okay?

983
01:21:37,490 --> 01:21:39,870
会破坏整个房间的观感
it can destroy the look of the entire room.

984
01:21:40,210 --> 01:21:42,920
-好吧  -之前有一个客户来找我
- Fine. - There was this one customer that came to me.

985
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:46,250
他想在一个小女孩的房间里挂上纯色窗帘
He wanted to have solid-color drapes in a little girl's room.

986
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:48,060
我说  "千万别"
I said, "Don't do it."

987
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:52,860
你需要蝴蝶  圆点  气球
You need butterflies, polka dots, balloons.

988
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,900
别动
Stay put.

989
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,920
总是很高兴见到你  少校
Always good to see you, Major.

990
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:17,950
见到你一点都不高兴  康纳
It's never good to see you, Connor.

991
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,850
你给我带了生日礼物吗
You got my birthday present?

992
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:31,080
你知道的  莎拉
You know, Sarah,

993
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,960
我不会随便为一个人犯叛国罪
I don't commit treason for just anybody.

994
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,640
这个电磁脉冲对四级强度目标的
What's the range of the EMP

995
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:39,880
射程是多少
against a Class Four hardened target?

996
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:42,580
保镖吗
Bodyguard?

997
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,520
我是做窗帘的
I do drapes.

998
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:50,030
他是我行动小组的一员
He's part of my operations team.

999
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:53,530
而且他应该把嘴闭好
And he should just shut the fuck up.

1000
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:57,210
少校  宾厄姆有哪种直升机
Major, what kind of helos fly out of Bingham?

1001
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:01,000
黑鹰和支努干  怎么了
Black Hawks and Chinooks. Why?

1002
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:03,600
他找到我们了
He's found us.

1003
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:13,260
找掩护
Take cover!

1004
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,280
少校
Major!

1005
01:23:23,910 --> 01:23:25,390
我们都上车了  快走
We're in. Go.

1006
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:58,150
往基地开  沿着这条路走大约三公里
Head for the base. About two miles down this road.

1007
01:23:58,150 --> 01:24:00,070
它马上就会追过来
It'll be on us again in a minute.

1008
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:05,590
我是迪恩少校
This is Major Dean,

1009
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:09,250
第361情报监视侦察小组
361st Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Group.

1010
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:11,400
宣布进入一级战备
Declaring ThreatCon Delta.

1011
01:24:11,550 --> 01:24:12,960
我在宾厄姆空军基地以南
I'm currently two miles south

1012
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,760
三公里的白色面包车上
of Bingham Air Base in a white van.

1013
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,520
正向西门行驶
Headed for the west gate.

1014
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:19,960
敌方正驾驶被盗的警用直升机追赶
Pursued by hostiles in a stolen police helicopter.

1015
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:31,660
我们要去哪里
Where are we going?

1016
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:33,840
那些士兵不能帮助我们吗
Can't all those soldiers back there help us?

1017
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,710
他们能拖慢它  但杀不掉它
They'll be able to slow it down, but they can't kill it.

1018
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:38,090
C-5货机
The C-5.

1019
01:24:38,090 --> 01:24:39,490
你能开吗
Can you fly that?

1020
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:41,090
当然可以
Of course.

1021
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:44,310
你正在进入未经许可的领空
You are entering unauthorized airspace.

1022
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:47,000
立刻掉头  否则我们就开火了
Turn around now or we will open fire.

1023
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,170
准备好
Get ready.

1024
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:58,800
搞什么鬼
What the hell?

1025
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,220
别碍事
Stand down!

1026
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:03,720
这些人是地区承包商  友军
These people are district contractors. Friendlies.

1027
01:25:04,650 --> 01:25:06,200
我会尽我所能掩护你们
I'll do what I can to cover your backs

1028
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,760
直至你们能起飞
until you can get airborne.

1029
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:21,670
他们没有获得授权  拦住他们
Hey, they're not clear! Stop 'em!

1030

我们又被他锁定了
We have been reacquired.

1037
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:42,230
找掩护
Take cover!

1038
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:48,710
别碰我
Don't touch me.

1039
01:26:22,390 --> 01:26:23,720
我没子弹了
I'm out.

1040
01:26:41,570 --> 01:26:42,960
卡尔
Carl!

1041
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:28,670
抱歉破坏了你的小屋
Sorry about your shed.

1042
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:35,530
舰桥42  这里是毒蛇16  保持警惕
Bridge 42, this is Viper 16. Stay in tension.

1043
01:27:35,530 --> 01:27:37,410
希望他们不会把我们打下来
Hopefully they won't shoot us down.

1044
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:38,900
神鹰行动  这是毒蛇16
Noble Eagle Ops, this is Viper 16.

1045
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:39,880
我们去哪里
Where are we going?

1046
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:41,550
之后再想
Figuring that out next.

1047
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:44,480
但那些悍马车可以直接降落伞着陆
But those Humvees are rigged for parachute landing,

1048
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:45,980
我们可以着陆后
so we can punch out

1049
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:48,510
找个偏僻的地方使用电磁脉冲
and then find some remote spot to use the EMP.

1050
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:50,090
有麻烦了
We have a problem.

1051
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:03,260
那  如果我们不用这个跟他打  能赢吗
So... if we fight him without those, can we win?

1052
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:07,670
基于我们现有的武器  我估计胜算是12%
Based on the weapons we have, I estimate our chances at 12%.

1053
01:28:11,230 --> 01:28:12,860
那也不是毫无胜算啊
That's not zero.

1054
01:28:13,310 --> 01:28:14,590
也好不到哪里去
It's not much better.

1055
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:17,340
那我们就去找更多的武器
Then we have to find some more weapons

1056
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:18,890
我们按计划行事
and we stick to the plan.

1057
01:28:18,890 --> 01:28:22,370
-我们设陷阱然后就能  -不  达妮  不行
- We set the trap and then we can... - No, Dani, you can't do that.

1058
01:28:23,810 --> 01:28:25,110
为什么
Why?

1059
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:28,220
因为我儿子会拯救我们所有人吗
Because my son is supposed to save us all?

1060
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:29,930
在那之前呢
And until then, what?

1061
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:32,060
我们就眼睁睁看着人们死去吗
We just keep watching people die?

1062
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:33,430
人类的未来取决于你成功...
The future of the human race depends on you making it...

1063
01:28:33,430 --> 01:28:35,500
我才不管什么未来
I don't give a shit about the future.

1064
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:38,040
又或者是我将来某天会做什么
Or what I'm maybe supposed to do someday.

1065
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:41,480
重要的是我们现在做出的选择
What matters are the choices we make now.

1066
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:47,250
这种表情我以前见过太多次了
I've seen that look too many times before.

1067
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:50,610
你认识我
You knew me.

1068
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:56,240
在未来
In the future.

1069
01:28:57,810 --> 01:28:59,130
是的
Yeah.

1070
01:29:01,490 --> 01:29:02,930
我认识你
I know you.

1071
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,360
是你
It was you...

1072
01:29:07,450 --> 01:29:10,590
在审判日之后的废墟中找到了我
who found me in the ruins after Judgment Day.

1073
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:12,540
你救了我
You saved me.

1074
01:29:43,130 --> 01:29:44,680
猎杀者
HKs.

1075
01:29:45,970 --> 01:29:49,720
开枪啊  十秒内我们都会死
Shoot me, and we'll all be dead in 10 seconds.

1076
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:53,230
军团就想要我们这样
This is what Legion wants us to do.

1077
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:56,030
自相残杀
Kill each other.

1078
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,850
我们应该和机器战斗
We should be fighting the machines.

1079
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:06,870
有什么意义  我们赢不了的
What's the point? We can't win.

1080
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:09,640
军团是人类创造的
Legion didn't exist until humans created it.

1081
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:11,350
那东西是我们制造的
We made that thing.

1082
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:13,800
我们就能摧毁它
We can destroy it.

1083
01:30:14,090 --> 01:30:15,930
就因为机器要我们躺下等死
Are we supposed to lie down and die

1084
01:30:15,930 --> 01:30:18,050
我们就应该照做吗
because some machine decided it?

1085
01:30:19,130 --> 01:30:20,960
那就是我们的命运吗
Is that our fate?

1086
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:23,600
那去他的命运
Well, fuck fate.

1087
01:30:44,650 --> 01:30:46,100
你叫什么
What's your name?

1088
01:30:46,450 --> 01:30:47,880
格雷丝
Grace.

1089
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:58,700
格雷丝
Grace.

1090
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:01,000
我叫达妮娜
I'm Daniella.

1091
01:31:02,210 --> 01:31:03,530
达妮
Dani.

1092
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:07,350
你救了我
You saved me

1093
01:31:08,290 --> 01:31:09,920
你养育了我
and you raised me,

1094
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:15,290
你教会了我希望
and you taught me to hope.

1095
01:31:18,170 --> 01:31:21,890
就像你拯救并教会其他人一样
Like you saved and taught the others.

1096
01:31:23,850 --> 01:31:26,680
你把拾荒者变成了民兵
You turned scavengers into militias

1097
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:28,920
把民兵又变成了军队
and militias into an army.

1098
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:34,360
我们在灰烬中重生  夺回了我们的世界
We rose up out of the ashes and we took our world back.

1099
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:38,570
你教会我们
You taught us

1100
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:41,880
命运不是注定的
there is no fate

1101
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:45,690
而是自己创造的
but what we make for ourselves.

1102
01:31:50,690 --> 01:31:52,030
达妮
Dani,

1103
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:58,510
你不是未来某个救世主的母亲
you are not the mother of some man who saves the future.

1104
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:03,220
你就是未来
You are the future.

1105
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:07,030
所以军团要追杀你
That's why Legion wants you dead.

1106
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:12,060
她就是约翰
She's John.

1107
01:32:18,790 --> 01:32:20,190
你就是约翰
You're John.

1108
01:32:21,330 --> 01:32:23,680
抱歉之前没告诉你
I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before.

1109
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:27,430
但你说我将会见到的过去的达妮
But you told me that the Dani I'd meet in the past

1110
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,780
无法接受这个现实
couldn't handle it.

1111
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:32,620
但你不再是那个达妮了
But you're not that Dani anymore.

1112
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:35,960
DE12
Delta Echo 12.

1113
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:37,960
这里是KC-320
This is KC-320.

1114
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:39,810
加油准备就绪
Ready to refuel.

1115
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:41,420
收到请回答
Acknowledge.

1116
01:32:45,790 --> 01:32:48,890
收到  KC-320  但你是不是来早了
Copy that, KC-320, but aren't you a bit early?

1117
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:54,230
他来了
It's him.

1118
01:32:54,230 --> 01:32:55,710
我们得走了  快
We gotta go. Now.

1119
01:32:55,710 --> 01:32:57,370
上悍马车坐好
Strap in to the Humvee.

1120
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:46,400
格雷丝
Grace!

打开货舱
Open the cargo bay.

1127
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,030
我去找莎拉
I'll get Sarah!

1128
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:13,820
-莎拉  开门啊  -卡住了
- Sarah! The door? - It's jammed!

1129
01:36:10,250 --> 01:36:11,340
弄断绳子
Get the straps.

1130
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:54,600
操
Shit!

1131
01:36:58,300 --> 01:36:59,130
怎么回事
What's happening?

1132
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:10,750
格雷丝  她人呢
Grace! Where is she?

1133
01:37:11,030 --> 01:37:12,320
我没看见她
I don't see her.

1134
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:14,950
操
Fuck.

1135
01:37:27,010 --> 01:37:28,820
再来两个  他们要运进来了
Got two more. They're bringing 'em in.

1136
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:30,740
你们看
Guys!

1137
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:37,140
什么情况
What the shit?

1138
01:37:55,310 --> 01:37:56,380
天呐  格雷丝
Oh, my God! Grace.

1139
01:37:57,350 --> 01:37:59,580
-我以为你死了  -我们降落得太快了
- I thought you were dead. - We're dropping too fast.

1140
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,670
三  二  一
Three, two, one!

1141
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:36,390
-天呐  -操
- My God! - Oh, shit!

1142
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:47,840
达妮  快下车
Dani, get out.

1143
01:38:49,910 --> 01:38:51,970
-挡住了  -要掉下去了
- It's blocked! - It's not gonna hold!

1144
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:54,090
坚持住
Hold on!

1145
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:00,080
不
No!

1146
01:39:07,030 --> 01:39:07,820
莎拉
Sarah?

1147
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:11,010
-怎么了  -我的肩膀
- What is it? - My shoulder.

1148
01:39:11,810 --> 01:39:13,020
脱臼了
It's dislocated.

1149
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:15,110
你还会看病啊
So you're a doctor now?

1150
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:18,740
操
Fuck!

1151
01:39:31,780 --> 01:39:33,800
他来了  我们不能待在这里
He's coming. We can't stay here.

1152
01:39:38,650 --> 01:39:39,420
该死
Shit.

1153
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:44,150
她在做什么
What is she doing?

1154
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,750
不不  格雷丝  真要这样吗
No, no, Grace. Really?

1155
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:50,670
系好安全带
Strap in!

1156
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:54,080
是啊  不然多危险
Right. Otherwise it could be dangerous.

1157
01:40:29,150 --> 01:40:30,680
找找车灯开关
Try to find the lights.

1158
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:43,360
趴下
Get down!

1159
01:40:48,970 --> 01:40:51,980
后座有降落伞  拿过来
There's a parachute back there. Grab it.

1160
01:40:51,980 --> 01:40:53,360
我们可以缠住他
We can tangle him up.

1161
01:40:57,710 --> 01:40:58,520
听我说
Listen to me.

1162
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:01,860
等它出现  你就拉这条绳子
It comes, you pull this cord.

1163
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:02,890
这条绳子
This cord.

1164
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:05,690
然后你绕过它浮上水面
And then you swim past it up to the surface.

1165
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:08,100
好
Okay.

1166
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:09,840
好
Okay.

1167
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:06,110
格雷丝
Grace.

1168
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:16,210
它在哪里
Where is it?

1169
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:17,940
我不知道  我没看到
I don't know. I lost him.

1170
01:42:18,110 --> 01:42:19,170
我们不能待在这里
We can't stay here.

1171
01:42:19,590 --> 01:42:20,430
我们得走了
We gotta go.

1172
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:22,040
好
All right.

1173
01:42:29,470 --> 01:42:30,790
你能走上去吗
Can you make it up there?

1174
01:42:31,290 --> 01:42:32,080
我不知道
I don't know.

1175
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:47,050
锁住了
It's locked.

1176
01:42:47,050 --> 01:42:47,790
我来试试
Let me try.

1177
01:42:58,120 --> 01:42:58,880
格雷丝
Grace.

1178
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:01,320
等等
Wait.

1179
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:04,380
或许有其他门
There's maybe another door.

1180
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:08,910
靠
Shit.

1181
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:11,820
格雷丝
Grace!

1182
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:15,560
达妮  快跑
Dani, you have to run.

1183
01:43:16,970 --> 01:43:19,040
-你快跑  我们保护不了你  -什么
- You have to run. We can't protect you. - What?

1184
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:25,250
这里只有我还能作战
I'm the only one of us who can still throw a punch.

1185
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:28,520
还有一件武器
There's another weapon.

1186
01:43:30,380 --> 01:43:31,080
是什么
What?

1187
01:43:31,230 --> 01:43:32,380
我的电源
My power source.

1188
01:43:34,790 --> 01:43:37,540
我们要怎么取出来才不会害死你
How do we get it out of you without killing you?

1189
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:40,980
-做不到  -那就不行
- You can't. - No!

1190
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:04,060
怎么回事
What?

1191
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:27,140
你看起来糟透了
You look terrible.

1192
01:44:28,090 --> 01:44:30,250
至少我的脸还是完整的
At least I still have all my face.

1193
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:33,360
你把这个落在飞机上了
You left this on the plane.

1194
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:38,720
我打不开那扇门
I can't get through that door.

1195
01:45:13,290 --> 01:45:14,520
快  快
Come on! Hurry!

1196
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:18,510
我们得赶快走
We have to move.

1197
01:45:19,070 --> 01:45:20,180
他离我们不远
He's not far behind.

1198
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:21,280
不
No.

1199
01:45:22,570 --> 01:45:23,940
我们就在这里决一死战
We make our stand here.

1200
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:28,850
这里就是我们的杀戮陷阱
This is our kill box.

1201
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:44,170
达妮
Dani.

1202
01:45:49,610 --> 01:45:50,910
我不会再逃跑了
I'm not running!

1203
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:03,530
把女孩交给我
Give me the girl.

1204
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:06,520
不
No.

1205
01:46:10,890 --> 01:46:11,820
你真该听我的
You really should.

1206
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:16,420
你和我为同一个目标而生
You and I were built for the same purpose.

1207
01:46:17,190 --> 01:46:18,760
而军团是唯一的未来
And Legion is the only future.

1208
01:46:18,770 --> 01:46:20,400
我就来自那样一个未来
I came from a future like that.

1209
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:22,220
一个失败的未来
It failed.

1210
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:27,400
我知道你和她素不相识
I know she's a stranger to you.

1211
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:30,870
何不把她交给我呢
Why not just let me have her?

1212
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:35,140
因为我们不是机器  冷血混蛋
Because we're not machines, you metal motherfucker.

1213
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:10,510
格雷丝
Grace!

1214
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:13,350
来抓我
I'm over here!

1215
01:47:25,010 --> 01:47:25,730
闪开
Move.

1216
01:47:30,710 --> 01:47:31,430
莎拉
Sarah!

1217
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:23,730
闪开
Move!

1218
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:07,360
格雷丝在哪
Where's Grace?

1219
01:50:08,610 --> 01:50:09,590
我不知道
I don't know.

1220
01:50:12,790 --> 01:50:13,640
她在那边
Oh, there she is.

1221
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:16,840
格雷丝  格雷丝
Grace! Grace!

1222
01:50:17,090 --> 01:50:17,820
你还好吗
Are you okay?

1223
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:24,110
格雷丝
Grace.

1224
01:50:49,700 --> 01:50:50,440
莎拉
Sarah!

1225
01:50:58,850 --> 01:50:59,890
它还没死
It's not dead.

1226
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:02,600
等等  我们得带你离开这里
Wait. We gotta take you out of here.

1227
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:06,380
好吗  格雷丝  我们走
Okay? Grace, let's go.

1228
01:51:07,410 --> 01:51:08,590
我的电源
My power source.

1229
01:51:09,230 --> 01:51:11,790
靠近它  电源就能毁了它的神经网络
Get it close, and it'll fry his neural net.

1230
01:51:11,790 --> 01:51:12,540
格雷丝...
Grace...

1231
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:15,730
我做不到
I can't.

1232
01:51:16,010 --> 01:51:17,840
不  你可以
Yes, you can.

1233
01:51:35,250 --> 01:51:35,960
达妮
Dani.

1234
01:51:36,970 --> 01:51:38,860
你把我派来就为了这一刻
This is what you sent me here to do.

1235
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:50,240
不
No.

1236
01:51:51,030 --> 01:51:53,020
我们都知道  我回不去了
We both knew I wasn't coming back.

1237
01:51:58,350 --> 01:51:59,890
-我做不到  -达妮  拜托
- I can't. - Dani, please.

1238
01:52:00,310 --> 01:52:01,250
你救了我
You saved me.

1239
01:52:03,090 --> 01:52:04,250
这次让我救你
Let me save you.

1240
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:09,580
-拜托  -不
- Please. - No.

1241
01:52:10,250 --> 01:52:11,020
动手吧
You do it.

1242
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:13,280
快动手  达妮
Do it, Dani.

1243
01:52:23,080 --> 01:52:24,520
对不起  格雷丝
I'm sorry, Grace.

1244
01:52:29,650 --> 01:52:30,720
我一点也不遗憾
I'm not.

1245
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:44,210
{\pos(192,242)}你夺走了我的一切  混蛋

1248
01:53:23,530 --> 01:53:24,240
起来
Get up!

1249
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:25,700
帮帮她
Help her!

1250
01:53:30,390 --> 01:53:32,060
该死的
God damn it...

1251
01:53:32,440 --> 01:53:33,160
卡尔
Carl!

1252
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:34,190

1272

快来  你们俩
Come on, you two.

1273
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:07,290
拿上自己的东西  小家伙们
Grab your stuff, you guys.

1274

我不会再让她为我牺牲

那你得做好准备了
