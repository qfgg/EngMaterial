164
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,510

要走了  再见
Gotta go. Bye!

166
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:03,800

我有五个孪生兄弟
I have, like, five twin brothers,

173
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,840
轮流出来

290
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,590
或者

这个是佐罗和美杜莎
This one's Zorro and Medusa.

292
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,680
有点牵强
Kind of a deep cut.

293
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,350
说不好  这很蠢
I don't know, it's stupid.

294
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,770
我不觉得这很蠢

恰吉  这不是课本

这些都不是课本

你一直等在这里吗
Were you here the whole time?

327
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,800
我给你做了一份礼物
I made you a present.

328

-一根断木棍  -安迪

332
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,950
他就是个混蛋
He's just an asshole.

333
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,290
反正也无所谓
It doesn't matter anyway.

334
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,920
最终他也会离开我们
He's just gonna end up leaving us,

335
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,540
就像其他人一样

我永远不会离开你
I will never leave you.

337
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,550
我们玩得开心吗
Are we having fun now?

338
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,600
算是吧

I still have to teach you so much about this. Okay...

-那是什么  -猫抓了我
- What is that? - The cat scratched me.

347
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,470
疼死了
Hurts like hell.

348
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,020
猫咪伤了安迪吗
Kitty hurt Andy?

349
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,230
是的  待在这里  我去找创可贴

我发誓  我受够了这只猫
I swear, I'm so sick of this cat.

352

鲁尼  我对天发誓  如果你不闭嘴
Rooney, I swear to God, if you don't shut up,

353
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,740
我就给你换回干猫粮了
I'm putting you back on dry food.

354
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,120
恰吉  住手
Chucky! Stop!

355
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,640
你不能那么做  你为什么要那么做
You can't do that, okay? Why would you do that?

356
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,010
他伤了你  他让你不开心
He was hurting you. He was making you unhappy.

357
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:43,430
恰吉  听着  看着我
Chucky, okay, listen, look at me.

358
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,850
这很重要

359
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,520
你不能伤人  或者猫
You can't hurt people, or cats.

360
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,660
这样不好
It's not cool.

361
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,650
我知道你与众不同  但是
I know you're different, but...

362
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,020
我们必须保密  知道吗
that's gotta be our secret. Okay?

363
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,690
别说古怪的话或者吓唬人
And don't say any weird shit or creep people out.

364
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,530
猫吓坏了
Cat's freakin' out.

365
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,950
把房间收拾干净
Clean up this room.

366

368
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,940
好了  如果要成功
Okay. If this is gonna work,

369
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,060
我需要你的样子
I need you to look as creepy

370
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,550
越诡异吓人愤怒残忍越好  知道吗
and scary and angry and mean as possible. All right?

371
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,560
尽可能睁大你的眼睛  像这样
So, open your eyes as wide as you can, like...

372
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,640
不  你还是很可爱
No, you still look cute.

373
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,020
尽可能张大嘴巴
Open your mouth as wide as you can

374
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,440
呲牙咆哮
and snarl with your lips.

375
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,980
不过像笑一样
But kinda smile.

376
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,570
完美  好  就像这样

378
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,950
尽可能张大嘴笑
Smile as wide as you can.

379
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,570
更大

00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,330
棒
Yes!

381
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,290

还真的挺吓人的
It's actually pretty damn creepy.

383
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,960
好了  可以停下了

太他妈吵了
It's fucking loud.

388
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,680
太他妈吵了
It's fucking loud.

389
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,700
那东西说脏话了
That thing just swore.

390
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,650
它应该不能说脏话的
It... It's not supposed to be able to do that.

391
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,400
是的  我知道  他...

392
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,250
它并不遵守规则
It doesn't really follow the rules.

393
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,750
它不遵守规则
It doesn't follow the rules?

394
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,200
就像它能选择一样吗
Like it has a choice?

395
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,340
算是吧
Kinda, yeah.

396
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,120
抱歉  我打断一下  他什么都能做吗
Sorry, can I pop in here? So he just does whatever?

397
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,160
你让他做什么都行吗
You can make him do whatever?

398
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,410
基本上是的
Pretty much.

399
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,140
我能说一句吗
Okay, can I just point out that

400
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,290
所有机器人末日剧情都是这样开始的

我本来想教他

409

不过这可能是个坏主意

410

你错了  这主意太棒了

你想唱巴弟之歌吗
Do you wanna sing the Buddi song?

不  说"为了图派克"  然后捅它
No! Say, "This is for Tupac," and stab the asshole.

432
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,560

456
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,080
而且具体
And specific.

457
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,890

我不是很饿
I'm not really hungry.

481
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,490
我再去拿瓶啤酒
I'm gonna grab another beer.

不过看上去真的不错
They do look good though.

483
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,790

很好吃
It's good.

485
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,180

490
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,400
你开什么玩笑
You gotta be kiddin' me.

491
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,780
肖恩真是个混蛋
Shane's such an asshole.

492
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,620
-肖恩真是个混蛋  -你觉得这很好笑吗
- Shane's such an asshole. - You think that's funny?

我没让他说任何话
I didn't make him say anything!

496
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:10,060
好吧  你知道吗  你得少跟他在一起玩
Okay. You know what? You're spending less time with this thing.

497
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,850
最多每天一小时
One hour a day, tops.

498
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,400
然后其它时间  他都得待在这里
And the rest of the time, he's going in here.

499
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,230
妈妈  停手  你会吓到他的
Mom, stop, you're gonna scare him!

500
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,400
这是个玩具
It's a toy.

501
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,510
你不必把他也卷进来
You don't have to bring him into this.

502
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,600
这是个玩具  安迪
It's a toy, Andy.

503
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,860
而且他总是吓到鲁尼  好吗
And he keeps freaking out Rooney, okay?

504
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,370
所以我要分开他们
So I'm keeping them separated.

505
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,200
如果他待在我的房间里
I can keep him away from Rooney

506
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,660
就不会跟鲁尼有接触了
if he stays in my room.

507
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,480
必须把他放那里  没得商量
He's staying in there, that is final!

508
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,120
鲁尼
Rooney!

509

00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,420
二代巴弟发售那天我不会去上班的
I'm not working the Buddi 2 launch.

520
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,740
那天是我孩子的生日
It is my kid's birthday,

521
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,470
而且我也不上夜班了
and I'm not doing night shifts anymore.

522
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,830
你见到鲁尼了吗
Hey, have you seen Rooney?

523
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,250
肖恩没关门  或许他跑出去了
Shane left the door open. Maybe he got out.

524
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,290
为什么没关门
Why is the door being left open?

525
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,830
我们要点披萨外卖
We are ordering pizza.

526
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,290
你饿吗  你想吃什么
You hungry? What do you want?

527
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,460

00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,090
怎么了
What?

530
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:32,070
-你要去哪  -普格家

531
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,410

不想要了
Don't want it.

533
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,850
说真的  我做什么了
Seriously, what did I do?

534
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,900
只要我走进来  他就离开
Every time I walk in a room, he leaves.

535
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,250
根本不是这样
That is not true, at all.

536
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,380
安迪只是有些与众不同  好吗

他甚至不能和我共处一室
Kid can't even be in the same room as me.

538
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:10,090
你是我最最最好的朋友吗
Are you my b-b-b-best buddy?

别再用你的娃娃了
No more using your little doll.

546
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,210
妈妈

我跟你还没完呢
I'm not through with you.

549
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,280
你对我有意见
Now you got a problem with me,

550
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,330
当个男人  跟我说清楚

551
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,500
来吧  说来听听
Come on. Let's hear it.

552
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:28,630
是啊
Yeah.

553
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,130
我就知道你没种
That's what I thought.

554
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,700
我恨他  我恨死他了
I hate him. I hate him so much!

555
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,930
他就不能放过我们吗
Why can't he just leave us alone?

556
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,900
他就不能消失吗
Why can't he just go away?

557
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,330
我只想让他消失
I just want him gone.

558
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,110
我只想让他放过我们
I just wish he would leave us alone.

559
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,300
我只想说他是我儿子
I'm just saying he's my son,

560
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,950
如果你对他有意见的话
so if you have a problem with him,

561
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,930
跟我说  我去跟他谈
talk to me, and then I'll talk to him.

562
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,550
因为你不是他爸爸  而且...
Because you're not his dad and...

563
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,470
行了  我听明白了

564
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,470
听着  是他很无理我才想教训他
Look, he was being rude, and I called him on it.

565
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,390
我只是觉得有点过火
I just think it's too much.

566
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,470
我只不过跟他说了几句而已
All I did was I talked to him.

567
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,420
-有点过火  没别的  -你知道吗  随便吧
- It's a little much, that's all. - You know what? Fuck it.

568
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,960
听上去是你的问题  不是我的
Sounds like a "you" problem, not a "me" problem.

569
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,430
是的  我知道
Yes, I know.

听着  给我听着
Listen, just listen,

我他妈要发火了  知道吗

我已经够努力了
I work hard enough as it is,

573
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,940
我不要跟你讲这些废话

我在家做的还不够多吗
I don't do enough around here?

578
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,060
我他妈应该先把插头拔了
I guess I should've fucking unplugged them first.

579
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,530
见鬼
Oh, fuck!

580

没人能伤害我最好的朋友
Nobody hurts my best buddy!

587
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,290

590

指纹采集进展如何

出什么问题了
What's the problemo?

他身体的其他部分呢
Where's the rest of him?

为什么
Why?

619
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,670
我不知道

他头上有个蝴蝶结

该死  该死

早就有迹象  但是我们袖手旁观

-不行  -他死了 我可以告诉他们真相

告诉他们真相  没问题
Tell them the truth? Sure.

628

告诉他们一个死人的脸皮
We tell them that a dead guy's face skin

629

出现在你的房间里

It's winking at me. I can't look at it anymore.

藏在哪里
In what?

00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:56,950
该死

639
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,080
你就径直走去垃圾滑槽
Just go straight to the garbage chute

640

00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,790
他们想要伤害我  安迪
They're trying to hurt me, Andy.

705
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:29,440
他怎么会这么强壮
How is he so strong?

706
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:30,290
安迪
Andy!

707
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:34,230
抱歉  恰吉  这是唯一的办法
I'm sorry, Chucky. It's the only way.

708
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,480
但你是我的朋友
But you're my friend!

709
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,530
你在等什么  快动手
What are you waiting for? Do it!

710
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:41,650
♪ 你是我的朋友  直到永远 ♪
♪ You are my buddy until the end ♪

711
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:44,320
安迪  快
Andy! Come on.

712
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:11,630
就这样吧
That's it.

713
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:16,150
永远不要向任何人说起今晚发生的事
We never talk about what happened tonight to anybody.

714
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:53,330
中大奖了
Jackpot.

715
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:29,670
好了
There you are.

716
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,650
连接断了  但整体还行
The connectivity's down, but not in bad shape overall.

717
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:39,350
只要把你修好  我就能倒卖个好价钱
I'll make a pretty penny on resale once we get you sorted.

718
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:43,650
该把你拆开了
Time to open you up.

719
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:46,050
看看有什么毛病
Let's see what we're dealing with.

720
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,330
太愚蠢了
So stupid.

721
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,170
我怎么能这么愚蠢
How could I be so stupid?

722
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:13,420
我很快回来  好吗  你就待在这里
I'm gonna be right back, okay? Just stay here.

723
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,500
-好  -好
- Okay. - Okay.

724
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,180
小伙子  别担心  好吗
Hey, man. Don't worry, okay?

725
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,840
我的搭档只是在问她一些常规问题
My partner is just asking her some routine questions.

726
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:33,500
我爱你
I love you.

727
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:42,030
好的
Okay.

728
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:53,180
还需要我提供支援陪你妈妈吃晚饭吗
Still want some backup with your mom for some dinner?

729
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,110
不用了
We're good.

730
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,990
我开玩笑的  进来吧
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Come on.

731
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,570
这是...好吧
This is... Okay, all right.

732
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:18,230
-他还不知道这个  -安迪
- He doesn't know about it yet. - Andy?

733
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:19,920
-不  我要问安迪  -好
- No, I'll just ask Andy. - Sure.

734
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:20,790
安迪 好
- Andy! - Okay.

735
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:22,040
我要宣布一件事
I have an announcement to make.

736
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:23,690
我下载了...
I downloaded...

737
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:24,730
你们准备好了吗
You ready?

738
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,370
-卡斯兰应用  -好
- The Kaslan app. - Okay.

739
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,970
-卡斯兰专车  -卡斯兰专车
- The Kaslan drive. - Kaslan drive.

740
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:31,790
我还以为是约会应用  天呐
I thought it was a dating app. Oh, my God.

741
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:32,900
你太笨了
You are so silly!

742
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,840
你能想象她出去约会吗
Can you imagine if she was out here dating?

743
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,350
怎么了  我很迷人
And so what? I'm desirable.

744
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:37,900
是我说错话
Excuse me.

745
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,460
安迪  帮我看看这个东西
Anyway, Andy, help me figure this thing out.

746
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,040
好
Okay.

747
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,240
应用在这里  我要怎么做
So, here's the app. What do I do?

748
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:47,140
好  你注册后  只要按下这个按键
Okay. So, once you sign up... you just press this button

749
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,360
车就会出现在你所在的位置
and the car will show up to wherever you are,

750
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:50,120
带你去你想去的地方  非常简单
take you wherever you want. It's super easy.

751
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,110
不  等等  它会送我去玩宾果游戏吗
No, wait. It'll drive me to Bingo,

752
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:55,890
那我就不用让这个笨蛋带我跑东跑西了
and I don't have to worry about this bozo driving me around?

753
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:56,400
是的
Yeah.

754
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,730
安迪  你是我的新好友
Andy, you're my new best friend.

755
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,260
我不想让你独自出门  好吗
I don't want you going out there alone, okay?

756
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,440
那样不安全
'Cause it's not safe.

757
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:05,640
这里唯一不安全的就是你的厨艺
The only thing not safe around here is your cooking.

758
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,960
-是吗  因为我...  -是的
- Is that right? 'Cause, um, I can... - Yeah.

759
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:10,230
-可怜的安迪遭罪了  -吃起来像速食
- Poor Andy gotta suffer... - It tastes like instant!

760
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,790
很好吃  我觉得很好吃
It's good. I think it's good.

761
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:13,260
-你知道吗  -谢谢你  安迪
- You know what? - Thank you, thank you Andy.

762
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,790
你太为别人着想了  安迪
You are just too sweet for your own good, Andy.

763
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,440
别吃了  别被他影响
That's all. Don't be influenced by him.

764
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,230
我的厨艺是向你学的
I learned my cooking from you, you know?

765
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:20,760
对  因为我厨艺很好
Yeah, 'cause I can cook.

766
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:25,710
天呐
Oh, God...

767
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:27,650
-妈  -怎么了  宝贝
- Hey, Ma. - Yeah, baby.

768
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,840
你又去买古董了吗  我没见过那个
You been to vintage shoppin' again? 'Cause that looks new.

769
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,950
这是安迪给我做的
Andy made this for me.

770
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,710
我们要...
And we are gonna...

771
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,320
我知道  可重了
Yeah, I know. It's heavy.

772
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,280
我们要在他生日那天拆开它
And we are gonna open it on his birthday.

773
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,740
说说看  你上一次给我做东西是什么时候
Tell me, when's the last time you made me anything?

774
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:47,520
从来没做过
Never.

775
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,250
好吧
Okay.

776
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:52,330
天呐  妈妈真难搞  对吧
Oh, my God, moms, right?

777
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:02,860
我知道大家可能一直在跟你说我的事
Look, um... I know that people have probably been talking to you about me,

778
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,530
但别相信你所听到的一切
but, uh, don't believe everything you hear.

779
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:08,930
这个社区有不少坏影响
You know, this neighborhood has a lot of bad influences.

780
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:09,800
你懂吗
You know what I mean?

781
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:14,140
人们喜欢保持沉默
People like to keep their mouth shut.

782
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,590
认为他们需要融入环境
You know, thinking they need to fit in,

783
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,600
但融入并不总是一件好事
but fitting in isn't always a good thing.

784
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,440
你懂吗
You know what I mean?

785
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:23,770
在这种地方你得谨慎选择一起混的人
Gotta be careful who you hanging around in a place like this.

786
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:29,560
等你长大一点  就会开始意识到...
When you get a bit older and you start to realize that it's just...

787
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,480
连听力障碍者都不想听我说话
Even the hearing impaired don't wanna listen to me.

788
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,030
真棒
That is fantastic.

789
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:18,780
你的巴弟已连接
Your Buddi is now connected.

01:06:11,490 --> 01:06:14,050
他在跟踪多琳  我可以给你看
He's following Doreen. I can show you.

989
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,490
你怎么会有奥马尔的手机
Why do you have Omar's phone?

990
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:18,600
我拿的
I took it.

991
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:19,690
为什么
Why?

992
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:21,070
我不得不拿  我...
I had to. I...

993
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:22,770
我必须盯着恰吉  妈妈
I had to follow Chucky, Mom.

994
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:23,500
好吧
Okay.

995
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,440
我没疯  妈妈
I'm not crazy, Mom!

996
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,310
我要把这个还给奥马尔
I'm giving this back to him.

997
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:28,810
妈妈  没人肯听我说  求你了
Mom, no one's listening to me. Please.

998
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:30,070
我得把这个还给他
I have to give this back to him

999
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:30,690
免得事情变得更糟
so this doesn't get any worse.

1000
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:32,060
没人肯听我说
Nobody's listening to me!

1001
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:33,670
-你乖乖待在这里  好吗  -妈妈
- Just stay right here, okay? - Mom!

1002
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:35,100
然后你要跟我一起去上班
And you're coming to work with me.

1003
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:36,350
他要杀了我们
He's trying to kill us!

1004
01:06:36,350 --> 01:06:37,700
待着别动
Do not move.

1005
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:49,470
靠  靠
Oh, shit. Shit.

1006
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:12,570
你不能肯定
You don't know that.

1007
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:19,390
我们不了解这孩子  他可能是个疯子
We barely know this kid. He could be batshit crazy.

1008
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:24,110
要是恰吉根本没出过故障呢
What if Chucky never malfunctioned?

1009
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:28,550
都是他  都是他编造出来的
He just... He just made it all up?

1010
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:30,520
-要是他杀了...  -闭嘴
- What if he killed... - Shut up.

1011
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,460
我一直看着他们  安迪
I've watched them, Andy.

1012
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:37,650
我知道他们是怎么伤害你的
I've seen how they hurt you.

1013
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:48,080
在这边  安迪

1014
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:49,640

1015
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,180
在这边
Over here.

1016
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:54,680
不让我们一起玩
If they don't let us play,

1017
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:57,180
他们都得消失
they all go away.

1018
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:01,640
你为什么要这样
Why are you doing this?

1019
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,990
我们玩得开心吗
Are we having fun now?

1020
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:11,420
你是我最好的朋友吗
Are you my best buddy?

1021
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:14,560
不让我们一起玩
If they don't let us play,

1022
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:16,930
他们都得消失
they all go away.

1023
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:21,450
躲猫猫
Peekaboo.

1024
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,060
停下
Stop!

1025
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,890

1026
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,190

1027
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:41,380

Turn it off!

1028
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:54,510
即使今晚可能降雨
But the chance of rain tonight

1029
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:56,220
也无法阻挡巴弟粉丝的热情

1030

1032
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:00,230
没错  人们都排着队
That's right, people have been lining up

1033
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:02,420
等待午夜二代巴弟的发售

It's Doreen.

1040
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:33,030
我觉得她死了  到处都是警察
I think she's dead. There are cops everywhere.

1041
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:35,340
如果恰吉真的...
What if Chucky's...

1042
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:38,230
如果安迪是对的呢
What if Andy is right?

1043
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,140
你想怎样
The hell you want?

1044
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:43,220
奥马尔  给我们看看你的巴弟

不如你们去问问安迪

或许你也坏了
