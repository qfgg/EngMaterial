1
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,378
该起床了
It's time.

2
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,016
小乖乖
Hey there...

3
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,318
你起来干嘛？
Hey. What are you doing up?

4
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,254
是爸爸吗？
Is that Daddy?

5
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,629
嗨，女牛仔
Hey there, cowgirl.

6
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:47,397
她今天很调皮
She's a little feisty today.

7
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,975
小宝宝应该多睡觉
Babies should be sleeping.

8
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:54,272
我肚子太饿了
"I'm too hungry for my own good." Yes.

9
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,976
我要去准备了
I gotta get ready.

10
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:08,256
今天可不能丢东忘西
Wrong day to be forgetting stuff.

11
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,963
大家都说你很幸运，别搞砸
You know how lucky you are. Don't screw this up.

12
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,156
好啦
All right! Jesus.

13
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,328
她睡了吗？
She go back to sleep?

14
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,027
睡了，她吃撑了
Yes. Ate like a pig.

15
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,866
我知道我很幸运
I know I'm lucky.

16
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:23,271
今天通过考验，前途就无量
I ace this job, the department's wide open.

17
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:26,137
搞不好哪天能当分局长
Get my own division someday. 

18
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,575
他们都住豪宅
You should see their houses.

19
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:36,684
哈罗
Hello?

20
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:41,785
对
Well, yes.

21
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,291
放心，我会的
Don't worry, I will.

22
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,825
对，他在
He's right here. It's Alonzo.

23
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,242
霍特？ 是，长官
-Hello. -Hoyt? -Yes, sir.

24
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,342
你要去局里报到吗？
Going to roll call?

25
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,342
我正要出门
I'm leaving now.

26
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,480
霍特 是，长官
-Hoyt? -Yes, sir?

27
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,212
巡警才去报到，我们不必去
Fairies go to roll call. We don't.

28
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,372
那很好
Good to know.

29
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,918
十点钟到七街口咖啡店碰面
There's a coffee shop on 7th. Be there at 10.

30
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,783
穿便衣、跑鞋
Be in comfortable shoes. 

31
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:11,424
多带一把枪，你有吗？
Got a backup gun?

32
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,822
没有，我只有贝瑞塔警枪
Only the standard issue Beretta.

33
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,621
连手铐一起带着
Bring it. Cuffs too.

34
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:19,391
也许进办公室，但先去抓毒犯 这是顶尖的缉毒小组
Maybe we'll do some business. We're aggressive.

35
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,329
所以我才自愿加入
I know. That's why I signed up. 

36
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,402
我只想谢谢你…
I want to thank you for this--

37
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:34,840
怎么了？
What's wrong?

38
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,710
这好像第一天参加足球集训
Feels like football tryouts.

39
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,653
真希望今天就知道有没有通过
I wish it was tomorrow so I'd know if I made the squad.

40
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:46,687
今天是好日子
Listen, it's not tomorrow, it's today.

41
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:49,326
你一定会通过考验
I know it's gonna work out.

42
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:50,861
真的吗？
You do?

43
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,078
早安，长官
Good morning, sir.

44
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,952
不，谢了
No, thank you, ma'am.

45
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:24,256
办正事前先吃早饭，我请客
Get some chow in you. My dollar.

46
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,365
谢谢你，我吃过了
Thank you, sir, but I ate.

47
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:27,830
好吧，随你便
Fine. Don't.

48
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,139
这儿挺好的
It's nice here.

49
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:39,102
我想好好看报
May I read?

50
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,246
对不起，长官
I'm sorry, sir. I--

51
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:41,540
谢谢
Thank you.

52
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:43,238
我点东西吃好了
I'll get something to eat.

53
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,851
不行，你错过机会了
Hell, no you won't. You fucked up.

54
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,820
我想看报纸，请你闭嘴
I'm trying to read. Please shut up.

55
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:12,841
不必坐在像烤箱的警车真好
I'll like not being in a hot black and white all summer.

56
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,717
跟我说一个故事
Tell me a story, Hoyt.

57
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:21,612
我的故事？
Like my story?

58
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,915
不是，是说一个故事
Not your story, a story.

59
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,652
你不肯乖乖闭嘴让我看报
Since you can't shut up so I can read, 

60
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,386
就说故事给我听
tell me a story.

61
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:30,587
我不会说故事
I don't know any.

62
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:31,696
你不会说故事？
You don't?

63
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,093
不会 好吧，那我说给你听
-No. -I'll tell you one.

64
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,361
这是份报纸
This is a newspaper, right? 

65
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:39,436
九成都是废话，但很有娱乐性
It's 90 percent bullshit. But it's entertaining. So I read it.

66
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,970
我看报就是要娱乐一下
It entertains me. 

67
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:45,475
你一直烦我，那就换你娱乐我
You won't let me read it, so you entertain me.

68
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,204
说故事给我听，快点
Tell me a story now. Go.

69
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,077
有一次我拦下酒醉驾驶 酒醉驾驶吗？
-There was a DUI stop. -A DUI stop?

70
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,344
我最好赶快掏出枪来
Let me load up!

71
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,579
醉汉好危险哦
-A DUI? Oh, shit! -Well, I--

72
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:58,691
很精采，我们在巡逻
Listen, we were on midwatch--

73
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,053
你们？
We who?

74
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,285
我和黛比 黛比是谁？
-Oh, me and Debbie. -Who's Debbie?

75
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,557
黛比麦斯薇，我的训练官
Debbie Maxwell, my training officer.

76
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,332
女训练官？
A female training officer?

77
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:09,730
是的
Yes, sir.

78
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,962
好极了，太好了
Okay. All right.

79
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:14,834
她是黑人或白人？
Was she black, white?

80
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,168
白人
She was white.

81
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:18,837
她有没有搞头？
Lick-her license?

82
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:20,105
什么？
A what?

83
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,738
她是不是女同性恋？
A lick-her license. Was she a dyke, a lesbian?

84
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,612
她行不行？
Is she any good?

85
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:26,953
她挺厉害的
She's pretty good.

86
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,918
黛比很棒，进行巡逻，说吧
-Okay, Debbie, midwatch. Go. -Right.

87
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,785
那晚很平静
-It was a quiet night-- -Boom!

88
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,124
你要随时接受震撼教育
-What the fuck? -You never know, that's the point. Go.

89
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,460
我们正在巡逻，我开车
It was quiet and we're rolling...

90
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:44,001
一辆本田房车从巷子冲出来
...I'm driving. This Acura, just a beautiful car...

91
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:45,638
超速冲越了中隔线
...comes out a side street, all over the median.

92
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,205
于是我亮警灯、鸣警笛
I hit the wailer.

93
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:50,700
他继续开了十个街口才停车
He drives for 10 blocks before he pulls over.

94
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,846
我测量了酒精浓度就逮捕他
Plates run clean, so I test and arrest.

95
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,814
我把他押上警车，黛比去搜车
I'm belting in our unit, and she's tossing his car.

96
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:02,648
找到一把手枪和两把散弹枪 装了子弹上了膛
She shows me a .38 and two loaded shotguns.

97
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,154
真的还假的？ 我不盖你
-No shit? -No shit! So...

98
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:07,452
她呼叫总部，我继续搜索
...she calls and I'm searching. 

99
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,152
结果找到五百公克的安非他命
I find 500 grams of meth.

100
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,231
这砘锸潜Ｊ统鲇的烟毒犯
Turns out he's on bail for distribution...

101
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,233
他正要去把他的前合伙人干掉
...on his way to smoke his ex-partner before trial.

102
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,028
我们阻止一起谋杀案
Prevented a murder.

103
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:21,231
你逮到他，真了不起
You got him. It's amazing.

104
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,068
是真的
It is. That you're out there...

105
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,973
你跟霹雳娇娃一起巡逻一年
...with a fine bitch for a year and the best story you can tell me...

106
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:31,709
最得意的故事竟然是拦下醉汉
...is a drunk stop.

107
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,379
我不相信你
But I don't believe you. 

108
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,886
你一定有跟她上床
You tapped that ass, didn't you?

109
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,821
老实说，你一定搞过她
Tell the truth. You know you tapped that ass.

110
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,830
你们在后座就做了起来
In the back, bam! Code X.

111
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:47,863
我有老婆
I got a wife.

112
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,433
你也有老二
You got a dick.

113
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,469
不是吗？
You do have one, don't you? 

114
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,401
是的
Yes.

115
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:58,033
你的老二在裤档，左右有口袋
Your dick lines up straight. Right and left of it are pockets.

116
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:01,977
口袋里有钱，把钱掏出来 你买单
In those pockets are money. Look in either one. Pay the bill.

117
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,784
帮我把传单拿走
Grab that menu off that window for me.

118
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,228
上车，车门没锁
Get in, it's unlocked.

119
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,465
丢进置物柜
Throw that in the glove box.

120
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,070
这辆车不是警方用车
This is not from the motor pool.

121
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,840
不是，不过很拉风，对吧？
No. Sexy, though, huh?

122
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,050
办公室在分局吗？
Where's the office, at division?

123
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:40,943
这就是办公室
You're in the office.

124
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:44,446
起来了
Going up.

125
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,180
今天是训练日，霍特警官
Today is a training day.

126
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,816
我要带你到街头办案
Give you a taste of the business.

127
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,882
我有38起案子等着开庭
I got 38 cases pending trial...

128
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,581
有63起正在办
...63 active investigations, 

129
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,352
有250起破不了案
250 I can't clear.

130
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:25,430
我有五个手下，性格南辕北辙
I supervise five officers. Five personalities.

131
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,499
你表现得好就是第六个
Five sets of problems. You could be six.

132
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,931
但我不会特别照顾你
I ain't holding no hands.

133
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:33,470
你只有今天能证明你的能耐
You got today to show me what you're made of.

134
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,540
不想缉毒就滚下车
You don't like Narcotics, get the fuck out of my car...

135
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,075
就回办公室处理文件
...get a job 

136
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,645
追讨厂商支票，你懂吗？
chasing bad checks. You hear me?

137
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,577
我懂 很好
-I hear you. -Okay.

138
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:46,749
你为什么想参加缉毒组？
Why do you want to be a narc?

139
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:52,482
我想铲除毒枭，为社会服务
To serve my community by ridding it of dangerous drugs.

140
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,092
你真正的理由是什么？
Right, but why a narc?

141
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:57,691
我想升警探
I want to make detective.

142
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:00,424
这就对了，跟着我就没问题
Stick with me, you can do it.

143
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,966
忘了警校学的那一套
Unlearn that academy shit.

144
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,037
乖乖守规矩在街头肯定送命
Don't bring that here. It'll get you killed.

145
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,231
你要我做什么我都做
I'll do anything you want me to do.

146
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:12,773
好兄弟
My nigger.

147
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,615
先把车窗摇下来
Roll your window down. Start there.

148
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:21,754
熟悉街头的声音、味道和感觉
-Got to hear it, smell it, taste it. -Right.

149
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,850
你会说西班牙话吗？
How's your Espao.

150
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:30,426
一定要学，学了能保命
Learn that shit. That will get you killed.

151
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,497
那些流氓会在背后暗算你
They plot all kinds of shit behind your back.

152
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:36,197
你打算教我抓了嫌犯…
You gonna teach me that old-school Rodney King shit?

153
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,768
就狠狠打一顿那一套吗？
We don't roll like that no more.

154
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:40,702
那一套不管用了
Now we use this.

155
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:44,366
一定要动脑筋，他们太强悍了
These niggers are too strong.

156
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,068
你认为我疯了，是吗？
Think I'm crazy?

157
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:47,872
我根本搞不清状况
I don't know what to think.

158
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,140
是吗？ 是
-Yeah? -Yeah.

159
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,240
很好
Good.

160
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:56,954
那就好
Good.

161
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,498
你结婚多久？
Been married long?

162
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:09,667
一年了
-About a year. -Yeah?

163
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,298
有小孩吗？
You got a kid?

164
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,769
小女儿，九个月大
A girl, 9 months.

165
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,435
我有四个
I got four. 

166
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,309
都是儿子
Boys.

167
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,138
想生儿子就让我帮你老婆
You need a son, I'll hook your lady up. 

168
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:21,405
保证生儿子
Can't miss.

169
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,739
请不要谈我家人
Can we not talk about my family, all right?

170
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,053
我尊重你
I respect that.

171
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,054
我也结婚了，也有美娇娘
I'm married, I got my queen too.

172
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:36,318
新婚夫妻总是如胶如漆 你们做爱一定面对面
I remember having a young bride. You probably fuck her face-to-face, don't you?

173
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,422
别提起我老婆
Let's not talk about her.

174
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:43,535
这就是重点，你很爱你的家人
That's my point. You're so in love, it's coming right out.

175
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,469
办案时你有顾虑就回不了家
The day you bring that here is the day...

176
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:50,209
你要隐藏这份感情
...you don't make it back. Hide it deep inside of you.

177
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:55,314
否则这些人渣就会用来威胁你
The maggots out here will find it use it against you and chew you up.

178
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,343
别戴婚戒来办案
Never wear the ring to work.

179
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,620
我是说真的 好啦，谢了
-I'm serious about that. -Thanks.

180
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,715
为何停在这里？
What's here?

181
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,680
毒品交易
Transactions.

182
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,355
你看到那个帮派小混混吗？
You see that guy 

183
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,360
他假装没在卖大麻
trying to act like he's not slanging dope?

184
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:45,463
对
Yeah.

185
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,091
他是我的手下
That's my boy.

186
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,093
他是我的手下，他叫奈托
That's my boy, Neto.

187
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,336
他才十七岁就是狠角色
Only 17, but he can kill.

188
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,564
他替我工作
Works for me.

189
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:56,106
他是线人吗？
He's an informer?

190
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,073
我到处都有眼线
Teammate. I got eyes everywhere.

191
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,111
我让他卖大麻，赚点钱养家
He gets to make some cash. Lets me know when big things happen.

192
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,842
有大买卖时他就告诉我
Big transactions.

193
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,183
你相信他？ 当然了
-You trust him? -Damn right I do.

194
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:16,755
我帮他老妈留在美国 来了，来了，仔细看了
Sprung his mom from INS detention. Here we go. Watch this.

195
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,959
很好
That's right. 

196
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:24,392
来吧
Come on down.

197
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,300
你看，很精采吧
Come on. Look at it. Sexy, ain't it?

198
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,140
这就对了
That's right.

199
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:32,735
你看到货脱手了吗？ 看到了
-See the hand-to-hand? -I saw it.

200
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,777
你上次几时逮过嫌犯？
When was your last felony stop?

201
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,142
两礼拜前
Two weeks ago.

202
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,340
你得多练习
You need practice.

203
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:38,609
他们好像大学生
College kids.

204
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,776
他们要接受震撼教育
They'll get an education today.

205
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,450
先叫他们举手，我在前你在后
I want them grabbing glass. You take the back.

206
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:48,321
别向总部报告
Stay off of the Rover.

207
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,624
这群臭小子 跑呀，臭小子
-You little fuckers. -Run, baby, run.

208
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,817
警察！手举起来！
Police! Let's see your hands!

209
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,249
举起来 看前面
Put them up! Put them up!

210
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,980
你们两个，手放在挡风玻璃上
Put your hands on the windshield!

211
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:21,093
用左手把排档换到停车档 这是手排车
-Put your hands on the glass. -Driver, put it in park! -It's a stick shift!

212
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:26,130
钥匙丢出来，双手放在胸口
Throw the keys out the window!

213
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,960
把手放在胸口
Put your hands on your chest!

214
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,831
交出来吧，小子
All right, fork it over.

215
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:37,275
少装了，把大麻交出来 快交出来
-What? -You know. The marijuana. Give it to me!

216
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,808
好啦
Give it!

217
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:39,637
对不起
Okay! Sorry, sir.

218
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:43,271
闭嘴，地上的烟斗也给我
Shut up! Give me that pipe.

219
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,143
这是我老妈的
My mom gave me that pipe.

220
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,376
管你的，叫她到牢里拿
She can pick it up in jail. 

221
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,783
香烟也给我，拿来
Give me the cigarettes too.

222
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,616
给我看好嫌犯
Control your suspect!

223
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,223
小姐，手放在玻璃窗上
Palms on the glass!

224
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,088
你敢乱动，我就赏你一巴掌
Move the hands, I'll slap you! 

225
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,855
把脸帖在玻璃上，快点
Face against the glass! Right there!

226
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,428
你们干嘛来这里？ 这是帮派地盘
You know this is a gang neighborhood?

227
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,331
知道这里是帮派地盘吗？
You know this is a gang neighborhood?

228
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,267
别来这里
-Yeah! -Then don't come down here.

229
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:09,738
下次再让我逮到
I see you down here again, 

230
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,206
我就逼你们走路回家
I'll make you walk home.

231
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,641
那些流氓会轮暴你女友
I'll let the homeboys run a train on her. 

232
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,371
你知道吗？
Know what that is?

233
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,675
是，长官，知道了
Yes, sir.

234
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:19,079
好吧，各位
All right, gentlemen. 

235
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,217
谢谢你们的合作
Thanks for your cooperation.

236
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,392
走吧，把枪收起来
Let's go. Safe your iron, son.

237
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,991
可恶
Shit!

238
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:41,567
好过瘾
I like that shit.

239
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,231
你刚才的表现不错
I like how you move. 

240
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,900
你被训练得很好，你瞧瞧
You were trained well. Check that out.

241
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:50,013
劣等货，夹杂了小颗粒
It's a bad dime. See the hairs, undeveloped seeds.

242
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:52,344
叶子根本就没长好
You see how immature it is.

243
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:56,181
墨西哥大麻，这是垃圾 给我看
That's classic Mexican garbage.

244
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,583
好像放太久了，去年的货吧
Let me see. It's old. Probably last year's.

245
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:01,283
优秀的缉毒干员
To be truly effective...

246
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:05,090
一定要了解和热爱毒品
...a good narcotics agent must know and love narcotics.

247
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,199
最优秀的缉毒干员
A good narcotics agent should have...

248
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:10,268
一定要尝尝毒品的味道
...narcotics in his blood.

249
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,370
你要抽吗？
What, you gonna smoke that?

250
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,971
不，你要抽
No, you are.

251
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,570
我才不抽
-Hell if I am! -Yes.

252
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,974
你不抽？ 不抽
-You're not? -No.

253
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:21,970
你是摩门教徒吗？
Why? You a Mormon?

254
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,308
我会丢掉工作的
I'm not losing my job.

255
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,677
这就是你的工作 我办不到
This is your job.

256
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:25,875
快抽
-Smoke it. -No.

257
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,483
这不是考试，吸一口
This ain't a test. Take a hit.

258
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:33,550
我当警察是为了阻止人吸毒
Listen, I became a cop to stop people from using--

259
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,594
这又不是可卡因，吸一口吧
That ain't cocaine. Take a hit.

260
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:38,856
不要
No, man.

261
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,297
老天爷
Jesus Christ!

262
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,027
你完了
Yeah, right.

263
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:49,308
我若是毒贩，你这样早就死了
If I was a dealer, you'd be dead!

264
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:53,070
你会因公殉职，你有毛病吗？
Turn shit down out here, and your wife gets a flag.

265
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,344
我不要你加入我的缉毒小组
You know what? I don't want you in my unit. 

266
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,112
滚下车，回去坐办公室吧
Get the fuck out of my car, rookie.

267
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:04,813
孬种
Poo butt-ass.

268
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,622
拿给我
-What's the holdup? -Move it! Give me that thing.

269
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,995
我要抽，给我吧
I'll smoke it. Give it to me.

270
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,463
你要我抽，我就抽
You want me to, I'll smoke it.

271
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,686
你的初体验
Virgin lungs. Man up now. Man up, nigger. Man up.

272
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:38,049
用力吸，有种一点
Go ahead. Get it.

273
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,657
你都没吸到，多吸几口
Come on!

274
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:42,226
给我闭嘴，乖乖地等
Shut the fuck up and just wait!

275
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,764
带点种，快吸呀
-Man the fuck up! Finish that shit! -Geronimo.

276
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,811
好吧，走了
Let's go, nigger. Let's go.

277
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,198
天啊
Oh, shit!

278
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:07,572
你还好吧？
You okay, kid?

279
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:10,576
你吸了蛮多的
That's a man size hit you took. 

280
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,075
你几时抽过大麻？
When's the last time you smoked weed?

281
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:18,147
高三那年
The last-- Twelfth grade.

282
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:22,156
我们…
We were....

283
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,022
抽大麻
-Well, we were.... -Smoking weed.

284
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,629
对
-Yeah. -Yeah.

285
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,764
你没老实跟局里说
Left that out of your service jacket.

286
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,869
你有秘密，大家都有秘密
I know you got secrets. Everybody got secrets.

287
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,231
没想到你爱这玩意
Didn't know you liked it wet, though.

288
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:37,568
什么玩意？
What's wet?

289
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,473
神仙粉
Butt-naked. Ill. 

290
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,306
天使尘
Sherm. Dust.

291
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:46,509
PCP，苯环利定
PCP. Primos. 

292
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,313
俗称P毒品
P-dog.

293
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,146
你抽的就是这玩意
That's what you had.

294
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,921
你尝不出来？
You couldn't taste it?

295
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,192
我没抽过
I never done it.

296
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,922
现在有了，我没有，你有
I haven't, but you have now.

297
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,698
该死
Shit!

298
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,104
今天要验尿，我会被开除的
Shit. I'll get piss-tested, and I'll get fired.

299
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:12,710
队长一礼拜前已警告我们
The boss has our back. We know before we piss.

300
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,312
可恶
Shit!

301
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:16,808
可恶
Boom!

302
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,317
你为什么要害我？
Why did you do this?

303
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:22,977
你是大人，没人逼你嗑药
You're an adult. Nobody made you smoke.

304
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,047
这是你自己的决定
You made a decision. Live with it.

305
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,551
我又没拿枪逼你
Not like I put a gun to your head.

306
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,906
真是的
Man....

307
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,641
你最好振作一点
-Oh, man, shit. -Come on, get your shit together now.

308
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,315
这是我线人的家
This is my dog's house.

309
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:58,813
我让他看看你
We'll see what he thinks of you.

310
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:12,434
快进来吧
Get your ass in here!

311
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,766
罗杰，怎么样？
Roger, what's up?

312
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,738
最近好吗？握个手吧
-How are they treating you? -All right.

313
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:18,143
我没吵醒你吧？
I didn't wake you up?

314
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:20,711
你知道我不睡觉的
I never sleep.

315
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,507
我的新手下杰克
Right. This my new guy, Jake.

316
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:25,013
进来吧
Come on. Get in here.

317
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:29,318
我也想喝一杯，你喝什么？
Yeah. Time to get my swerve on here! What you drinking?

318
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:30,750
最好的酒
The best.

319
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,050
当然了，你一定喝最顶级的
The best, I know. Best for the best.

320
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,521
听说你在赌城惹了事
I heard about Vegas. 

321
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,087
有人要追杀你
Got a green light on your ass.

322
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:39,856
没事了
No problem.

323
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:42,592
俄国佬要你的命，我会保护你
Russians want you. I got your back.

324
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,167
我知道，谢了
I know that. Thank you.

325
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:47,671
来
Here. 

326
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,839
喝两口吧
Get that medicine up in you.

327
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:55,038
祝你健康
-Back to the world. -Back to the world.

328
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,481
你干嘛找来一个菜鸟？
Went and got yourself a daisy-fresh rookie.

329
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,293
老天，他嗑过药了
He's high as a motherfucker. 

330
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:14,865
你给他嗑什么药？
What did you give him?

331
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:17,194
上好的墨西哥大麻
-A little of Mexico's finest. -Yeah.

332
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:23,667
垃圾
Garbage.

333
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,768
你在哪儿长大？
Where'd you grow up?

334
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:27,411
北好莱坞
North Hollywood.

335
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,672
你姓什么？
What's your last name?

336
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:29,880
霍特
Hoyt.

337
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:33,382
霍特…
Hoyt. Hoyt....

338
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,354
北好莱坞高中美式足球队
Strong safety, North Hollywood High.

339
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:38,888
没错
Right.

340
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,186
你怎么知道？
How'd you know that?

341
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,122
是呀，你怎么知道？
How did you?

342
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,090
好球员我都记得
-I follow all the good players. -No doubt.

343
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:47,221
对不起
Excuse me. Shit.

344
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:51,731
美式足球，是吗？
Strong safety, huh?

345
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,202
干嘛？
It's me. What's up?

346
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,909
我也没辄，你自己看着办
I can't do anything. Clean up your own mess. Don't call me.

347
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:03,578
我有一个笑话
Hey! Here's a joke, boy.

348
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:10,087
一个人出门看到门口有只蜗牛
Man walks out of his house, sees this snail lying on his porch.

349
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:14,090
他把它检起来用力丢到后院
So he picks it up, chucks it into the backyard.

350
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,387
蜗牛撞到一块石头
Snail bounces off a rock, busts its shell up all to shit...

351
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:20,589
摔破了壳，掉到草地上
...lands in the grass.

352
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,860
蜗牛奄奄一息地躺着
Snail lies there dying.

353
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:31,509
但是它没死，它开始慢慢爬
But...snail doesn't die. Soon it can crawl again.

354
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,308
有一天
And one day...

355
00:23:35,348 --> 00:23:38,909
它又朝着门口一步一步爬
...snail heads back to the front of the house.

356
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:42,782
转眼间一年就过去
Finally, after about a year...

357
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:46,649
它终于又爬到门口
...the little guy crawls back on the porch.

358
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:50,023
房子的主人要出门上班
Right then the man walks out of his house...

359
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:51,959
他又看到那只蜗牛
...sees this snail again.

360
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:55,123
他看了它一眼说
So he looks at it...and he says:

361
00:23:58,037 --> 00:24:00,096
你有毛病呀？
"The fuck's your problem?"

362
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:08,680
不好笑，真的不好笑
That's not funny.

363
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:11,248
那你干嘛笑？
What you laughing for then?

364
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:12,975
我不知道
-I don't know, man. I-- -Hey!

365
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:18,089
想通这笑话就能搞懂道上规矩
Figure that joke out, you'll figure the streets out.

366
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:23,325
没什么好想的，这全是废话
Nothing to figure out. It's senseless bullshit.

367
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:26,898
我早就搞懂了
You know-- I already figured it out.

368
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,624
是吗？
Really?

369
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,496
你知道道上规矩？
-Yeah. -You already figured the streets out?

370
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:35,732
最重要的是笑和哭
Well, it's all about smiles and cries.

371
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:38,406
拜托，你在胡扯什么？
-Put the drink down. What is that? -Hold on!

372
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:43,139
慢着，艾朗索，笑和哭
Hold on. Smiles and cries.

373
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,408
笑和哭，我懂了
Smiles and cries. Smiles and cries. I hear you.

374
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:49,748
你一定要能控制你的感情
Yeah, you gotta control your smiles and cries...

375
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:53,949
那是你的尊严，没人能够夺走
...because that's all you have, and nobody can take that away.

376
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:02,492
真是的
Oh, shit.

377
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:04,095
你觉得怎样？
What you think, dog? 

378
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,834
这菜鸟能当卧底警察吗？
Think this greenhorn can handle undercover?

379
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:10,567
你当年跟他一样
You were just like him. 

380
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:13,875
你也是满腔热血
Same silly-ass look and everything.

381
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,273
想要拯救世界
Saving the goddamn world.

382
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:20,545
才怪，现在我是哭笑不得
Now that's some smiles and cries for your ass!

383
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,812
我才没那么伟大
-That was you. -Shit lasted a week.

384
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,385
我得回去办事了
Gotta get back to it.

385
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,461
多谢了，很高兴见到你
Thanks for the snort. -Good to see you. -Yeah.

386
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,194
你有什么打算？
Yes, sir. What you doing later?

387
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:36,164
多存点钱，再熬一年就能脱身
Stay home. Save some cheddar. My dream's less than a year away.

388
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:39,099
我要去菲律宾，去了就不回头
Philippine Islands, here I come.

389
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,636
我跟你一起去
Let me go too.

390
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:41,898
欢迎你来
You're invited.

391
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:01,990
张开眼睛会比较舒服
Hey. Open your eyes, man. You'll feel a lot better.

392
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,767
坐直了
Boom! Come on, man. Sit your ass up.

393
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,539
你是谁？
Who are you?

394
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,142
我是大毒枭，你是什么人？
I'm the Zig-Zag man. Who are you?

395
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:24,416
我是警察，小心点
I'm a cop. Watch out!

396
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,016
别乱杀人
Don't shoot nobody.

397
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:28,619
喝点啤酒会比较清醒
Get that beer in you for ballast.

398
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,754
是真的，喝下去就会好过
-No, man. -Get it in you. You'll feel better.

399
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:51,101
停车
Stop the car!

400
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,905
快停车，有状况
Stop the car! I saw something!

401
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,411
快停车 好啦…
-Just relax. -Stop! All right! Hold the fuck on-- Hey!

402
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,885
去你的
Fuck me, man! Shit.

403
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:12,264
我是警察，快放开那女孩
Police officer! Get away from the girl!

404
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:14,422
我也要让你好看
-I'm gonna fuck you too, cop! -Get the--

405
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,728
我们没干坏事，是她自己发春
We didn't do shit! Bitch is crazy!

406
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:58,174
转过去，快点
Roll over, man. Roll the fuck over!

407
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,835
王八蛋
Fucking ass prick!

408
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:06,444
干得好
My nigger!

409
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:09,349
好耶，牛仔，你真神勇
Go ahead, cowboy, you got mad squabbles.

410
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:12,951
多谢你的帮忙 你应该开枪
-Thanks for the help. -You should've shot them.

411
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,353
你没事吧？
What's happening?

412
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,858
你死定了
You're dead!

413
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,053
别冲动
Okay! Wait! Hold it!

414
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,130
你这臭白人也死定了
-You too, white boy! -Okay....

415
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,824
我表哥是古惑仔，他会宰了你
-My cousins will blast you fools! -Calm down.

416
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:25,095
冷静点，你还好吧？
-Calm down. You okay? -No, I'm not!

417
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,897
我不好，我流血了
-Look at my nose! -I see it.

418
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:30,303
流鼻血而已，敷冰块就没事
Put ice on it. You'll be fine. 

419
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:32,569
你在这儿干嘛？
What're you doing here?

420
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:35,077
搞不好他们有爱滋病
-I was just-- -They probably got AIDS.

421
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,611
你怎么没上课？
Why you not at school?

422
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:39,080
我正要回家
I was going to a ditch party and--

423
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:41,549
你差点就回不了家
You almost became the ditch party.

424
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:43,744
你表哥混帮派？
Where your cousins from?

425
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:46,254
山联帮，给我记住了
Hillside Trece! Remember that!

426
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,757
叫你表哥保护你
Tell your cousins to get your back.

427
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,895
拿了书包回家吧
Grab your bag and go home now.

428
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,223
我要她做笔录
No! I need a statement--

429
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:53,763
回家吧
Don't need no statement.

430
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:57,032
他们会把你们揍扁
They'll fuck you up.

431
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:58,258
你要放他们走？
We gonna let them go?

432
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:00,837
你想拿他们发泄就动手呀
You wanna beat them up, go ahead.

433
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:02,667
要发泄我家有沙袋
I got a punching bag at home. 

434
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,502
他们应该坐牢的
They should be off the streets.

435
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:07,038
你听到吗？
You hear that?

436
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,206
你想回家还是坐牢？
Wanna go home or to jail?

437
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:10,439
你说呢？
What you think?

438
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,914
牢里的兄弟不是好惹的
Got room at the booty house. You been there?

439
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:19,520
他们会狠狠修理你
You'll grab your ankles.

440
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:22,092
去死吧，有人替我撑腰
Suck my dick! I know people.

441
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,455
你太天真了
That's how it starts.

442
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:26,222
你呢？你身上有什么？
What about you? What you got?

443
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,994
没有？你确定？
-Got nothing? -No. -You sure? -Yeah.

444
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:30,597
你的烟斗呢？
Where's your horn?

445
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,497
我没有烟斗
Got none.

446
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,804
但是你有钱
You got money, though.

447
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:41,707
你骗我
You lied to me!

448
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:44,508
幸好我没逼你吃下去
Lucky I don't make you eat that.

449
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:46,907
站起来
Stand up, you. 

450
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,482
给我站起来
Stand the fuck up!

451
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:57,661
后悔了吗？
Yeah. Oh, shit, huh?

452
00:30:05,738 --> 00:30:08,571
转过去，快点，转过去
Turn around, sucker. Turn around.

453
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:12,468
你喜欢强暴女人吗？
So you like raping girls?

454
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,209
你的嗜好是强暴女生吗？
-Like to rape girls? -No, man.

455
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,645
你就喜欢强暴女孩子
-That's what you like? -No....

456
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,244
你就爱这一套，别说谎
That what you like? Don't lie.

457
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:25,879
你不是叫我去死吗？
Told me to suck your dick. Is that what you said?

458
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:28,926
看着我
Look at me.

459
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:32,090
你是不是叫我去死？
You wanted me to suck your dick, right?

460
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,363
不是吗？
Isn't that what you said?

461
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,734
你叫我去死，别死不承认 难道我是骗子吗？
Didn't you say suck it? Don't lie. Am I a liar?

462
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:43,170
你没叫我去死，我在说谎吗？
You didn't say that?

463
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:44,602
我在说谎吗？
That's not what you said? So I'm lying?

464
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:45,937
求求你住手
No, please!

465
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:47,874
这是什么？
Where is it? I can't find it.

466
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,311
把裤子脱掉 快脱掉
Pull your pants down.

467
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:57,980
你要我打你哪一边的鸟蛋？
Which nut you want? I'll leave you one.

468
00:30:58,157 --> 00:31:01,422
快决定，快点
Your choice. Just make a decision.

469
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:03,485
好吧
All right. 

470
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:04,993
把手举高
Put your hands on your head.

471
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:08,891
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes. 

472
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,032
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

473
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:19,371
要不是我有事就会割掉那话儿
Lucky I got other business.

474
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:22,639
然后塞进你的屁眼，人渣
I'd cut your fucking dick off and stick it up your funky ass. Bitch.

475
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,875
可恶
Damn! 

476
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,951
我渴了，我想喝啤酒，你呢？
I'm thirsty. I want a beer. What about you?

477
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,712
你喝不喝？
You want a beer?

478
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:35,826
我不打扰你们了
I'm gonna leave you three to it.

479
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,959
臭小子
Pussy-ass bitch!

480
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,733
你再让我看到就死定了
I see you again, I'll fuck you up!

481
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:49,998
你连怎么死都不知道
You won't see shit coming!

482
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:53,576
我会到你背后一棒把你打死
I'll dent your mouth, I'll crack your head open.

483
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,542
臭警察，来呀
You fucking pig! Come on!

484
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,056
那女孩才十四岁
That girl's 14.

485
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:12,356
她是女人了，全身的骚劲
She all woman, though. You tax that ass for days, man! 

486
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:13,520
你快滚吧
Keep walking, bitch!

487
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:26,235
来罐啤酒吧
You want a beer?

488
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,146
我不要喝啤酒
No, I don't want a beer, man.

489
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:30,906
你生气了？
No? You mad?

490
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:46,865
你要那六十块，拿去呀
Want to book that $60, huh?

491
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:48,465
拿去当证物
Here, go ahead, book it into evidence.

492
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:51,592
嫌犯呢？回去逮他们呀
Where the suspects? Go get them.

493
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,260
你把他们放走了
You let them go.

494
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:54,166
我？
I let them go?

495
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,102
对，就是你
You did.

496
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,536
你想逮人就去当巡警
You want to run and gun, stay in Patrol.

497
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:02,578
缉毒组一定要以毒攻毒
This is Investigations. Garbage men handle garbage.

498
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:05,740
我们要放长线钓大鱼
Professional anglers go after the big fish.

499
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:09,512
小毒虫会杀了你
Chasing them crackhead motherfuckers....

500
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:11,019
所以才要把他们抓起来
-They'd have killed you. -They belong in jail.

501
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:14,386
他们被打一顿，没了毒品和钱
Why? They got beaten, lost their money.

502
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,585
她的古惑仔表哥会把他干掉 你还要什么？
Hillside's éses will smoke them. What more you want?

503
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:20,129
伸张正义 这不算伸张正义？
-I want justice. -That's not justice?

504
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:20,993
这是以暴制暴
That's street justice.

505
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,030
那有什么不对？
So?

506
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,690
让坏人自相残杀吗？
-Let them kill each other? -God willing.

507
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:27,327
那样最好，全都死光就好了
Fuck them! Everybody looking like them.

508
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:30,737
没这么好的事，好人一定先死
Reality is, the good guys...they die first.

509
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:34,072
小学生、母亲、居家男人
The school kids and moms family men,

510
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:36,476
他们可不想被流弹打破脑袋
don't want to catch any bullets.

511
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:40,414
想要保护羔羊就要抓到野狼
To protect the sheep, you got to catch the wolf.

512
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,712
野狼才能抓到野狼，懂吗？
It takes a wolf to catch a wolf, understand?

513
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:44,183
什么？
What?

514
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,221
想要保护羔羊就要…
Protect the sheep by killing wolves.

515
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:47,551
我听到了
I heard you.

516
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:49,660
你听了也是白听
-You didn't hear me. -All right. Whatever.

517
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:52,262
随便啦 随便个头
Whatever the fuck-ever!

518
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:07,645
你几时才肯抓人？
Do you ever lock anybody up? 

519
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:09,280
你都忙着把坏人放走
You seem busy keeping people out.

520
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:11,575
你在说什么？
You don't know shit!

521
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,117
有没有搞错，监狱是为我盖的
Shit, they build jails because of me!

522
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:17,482
法官根据我办的案子
Judges gave over 15,000 man-years of incarceration time...

523
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:21,387
判了一万五千年的刑期
...based on my cases.

524
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,187
我的记录辉煌
My record speaks for itself.

525
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:25,091
你抓过几名犯人？
How many felons have you got?

526
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,195
没话可说了吧
I rest my case.

527
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,567
我不嗑可卡因
I'm not smoking crack, all right?

528
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:39,040
好啦，放进置物柜
I'm glad. Put it in the glove box.

529
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:41,739
六十块也放进去
Put the $60 in there too.

530
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:46,684
以后可能用来当公费之类的
That'll come in handy. We'll use it like a credit card.

531
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:58,729
不管怎样，你做得很对
No matter what I say, you did the right thing.

532
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:04,666
我以前也是对坏人毫不留情
Reminds me when I was chasing down bad guys.

533
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,304
你刚才的表现很了不起
Pretty amazing shit you did back there.

534
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:10,733
谢了
Thanks.

535
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:14,773
我看到你用了锁喉功
I noticed you applied that chokehold though, huh?

536
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,776
那不是禁忌吗？
That's a no-no procedure.

537
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,275
我被打得很惨耶
I was getting my ass kicked.

538
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,717
所以你必须不择手段
You did what you had to do.

539
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:26,380
为了求生必须不择手段
You did what you had to do.

540
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:28,951
没错
That's right.

541
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,756
野狼才这么做，你是吗？
What a wolf does. You a wolf?

542
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:40,298
大野狼，一起嚎叫吧
Come on, wolf! Come on, dog!

543
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,838
我是说嚎叫，不是咕咕叫
No, I said a wolf, not a rooster, a wolf.

544
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:50,738
那是公鸡，我要大野狼
That's a rooster, give me a wolf!

545
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:52,816
算了，把啤酒给我
Give me a beer!

546
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,316
拿去，这才是好兄弟
There you go! That's my nigga.

547
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:58,316
你是个聪明人，霍特
You got the magic eye, Hoyt.

548
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,916
你一定会是好警察
You have the magic eye.

549
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:06,821
只要多混几天就能打击毒贩
You up your street IQ you'll do some damage, I guarantee.

550
00:36:09,101 --> 00:36:10,568
犯罪克星
Crime fighter.

551
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:54,236
你要什么？
What you need?

552
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:56,640
快克，二十块钱
-Crack. -Uh, 20 bucks....

553
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:58,373
快克？ 对
Crack?

554
00:37:00,152 --> 00:37:02,416
我看你是警察吧
Smell like bacon! Do I look like a sucker to you, nigga?

555
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:06,656
去死吧，菜鸟
Fuck you, rookie!

556
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:13,596
追上去呀
Go fetch, dog.

557
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,198
你要我去…
You want me to....

558
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:18,397
饶了我吧

574
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:33,134
你老板是谁？
Who you working for?

575
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,007
我没有老板，我是残障人士耶

576
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:38,046
胡说，你在贩毒
Shit! You know you cracking.

577

我早就不干了
I don't sell no more.

578
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:42,049
他身上没快克？
-No rocks? -No rocks.

579

那不是我的，是他栽的赃

我没有老板，你逼我干嘛？
Told you I don't work for nobody, man!

585
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,300
你的快克呢？
Where the rocks?

586
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,065
我没贩毒，我不干了

593
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:25,589
好吧
Yeah, okay.

594
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:26,927
你有笔吗？
You got a pen, 

595
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,087
写字的笔？

596
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,191
我不知道他在追我
Didn't see the motherfucker coming!

597
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:35,230
你嘴里没东西？
Nothing in there?

598
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:39,407

线报说他的老婆住在这儿

746
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:45,279
或是一只羔羊

747
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:49,481

我不在就别一个人跑来

我是说真的，别来找死

你怎么能通行无阻？

839
00:57:12,363 --> 00:57:14,888
我知道她，她很聪明
I know Landers. She's a sharp lady.

840
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:19,192
不是吗？
No?

841
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:20,894
开庭之前
Guy gets ahold of some peanut butter, 

842
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:25,007
这砘镌谄ㄑ廴了一坨花生酱
packs his ass-crack with it.

843
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:28,042
他坐在法庭等着法官宣判
He's standing before the bench, waiting to give his statement.

844
00:57:28,212 --> 00:57:34,617
突然就从屁眼掏出那坨花生酱
Shoves his hand down his pants, comes out with extra-chunky Jif.

845
00:57:37,488 --> 00:57:39,285
狱卒不敢靠近他
Bailiffs won't come near him.

846
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:48,962
他看着法官，并把花生酱舔光
Now he looks the judge right in the eyes and licks his fingers clean.

847
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:53,402
老天爷
Holy shit.

848
00:57:53,871 --> 00:57:58,740
法官看他疯了，不能让他坐牢
So the judge says: "This man's insane. He can't go to prison."

849
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:00,001
于是判他进精神疗养院
Sends him to Psychiatric.

850
00:58:00,177 --> 00:58:01,576
她上当了
She fell for it.

851
00:58:01,745 --> 00:58:03,770
因为她没那么聪明
Yeah! She's so fucking smart.

852
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:08,082
等她发现了 那砘镌缇捅灰萍
By the time she found out, the guy's already been transferred.

853
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:15,451
后悔也来不及
Proceedings closed.

854
00:58:15,626 --> 00:58:16,888
已经结案了
Yeah, closed.

855
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:20,828
他会住进精神疗养院半年
He'll do six months in the puzzle factory...

856
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:22,966
诊断正常后就被放走
...and they'll let him go.

857
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:24,862
连一天牢都不必坐
Never, ever do a day in prison.

858
00:58:25,302 --> 00:58:26,633
我很佩服他
Give him credit.

859
00:58:26,804 --> 00:58:29,364
他玩弄司法制度获得自由
He worked the system, deserves his freedom.

860
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,531
你真这么想？
Yeah? Think so?

861
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:33,299
也许不是
Or not.

862
00:58:34,778 --> 00:58:36,245
我告诉你
I'll tell you what.

863
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:41,610
我要找到这砘锶缓蟊辛怂
I'll find this guy on the street...and I'll do him.

864
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:48,790
你最好没收他的子弹
Better take his bullets away, Stan.

865
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,618
可恶
Shit!

866
00:58:54,565 --> 00:58:57,500
听说你这周末在赌城闯了大祸
Heard you had an expensive weekend in Vegas.

867
00:58:58,435 --> 00:59:02,030
你怎么会捅这么大的篓子？
How did you ever screw up so bad?

868
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:05,471
小事一桩，我只是人生地不熟
It's nothing. I didn't know. It's not my town.

869
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:08,611
俄国佬才不管你是警察
The Russians don't care if you're a cop.

870
00:59:08,779 --> 00:59:11,873
他们要杀你，你最好快逃
They'll whack you. You ought to get on a plane.

871
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:15,212
逃什么？我会搞定的
Why? It's an easy fix.

872
00:59:15,419 --> 00:59:15,942
怎么搞定？
How?

873
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:17,677
我要去收一笔钱
I'll just cash in an account.

874
00:59:19,156 --> 00:59:19,986
谁的钱？
Whose?

875
00:59:20,157 --> 00:59:22,091
第一个线民
One of my old ones. My first one.

876
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:25,961
反正那砘锊豢煽
The guy's a high-security risk.

877
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:28,927
我被杀了，谁来监管他？
If I'm not around, who will keep him off the radar?

878
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:30,760
我只想刮点钱
I'm just taxing him, 

879
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:32,596
可以吗？
that's all. Okay?

880
00:59:41,612 --> 00:59:43,170
你自己决定
It's your call.

881
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,348
你最好别搞砸
Don't dick this up.

882
00:59:46,517 --> 00:59:50,544
别跟前几个一样把事情闹大
I do not want to see you on the front page like the others.

883
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:53,221
我知道
Yeah, I understand.

884
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:56,391
你们谁开车？
Who's driving?

885
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,890
我，灰色宾士
Me. Gray Mercedes.

886
01:00:01,365 --> 01:00:02,389
拿车
Get the car.

887
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:08,896
黑色房车，后窗被打烂了
Black Monte Carlo there, back windows shot out.

888
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:26,083
是我，可以行动了
It's me. Listen, we got the green light.

889
01:00:26,557 --> 01:00:31,585
把搜索票传真去给法官签名
Fax a copy of the warrant to the clerk. Get it signed by the judge,

890
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:34,822
你跟保罗到第一地点交给我
and I want you and Paul to bring it to me.

891
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:38,490
叫杰夫带工具，十字镐和铲子
Tell Jeff to pick up some tools. Picks and shovels.

892
01:00:38,669 --> 01:00:41,035
登记在维修部门的名下
Make sure he signs them out from maintenance. 

893
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:42,535
对，知道吗？
Copy?

894
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:45,637
没错，动作快点
That's right. Hurry up! Later.

895
01:00:47,711 --> 01:00:49,906
你拿了多少现金？
So how much cash was in that jacket?

896
01:00:50,948 --> 01:00:52,381
四万元
Forty G's.

897
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:54,645
用来做什么？
What's that for?

898
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:56,415
你真的想知道？
Really want to know?

899
01:00:56,587 --> 01:00:58,350
对，我真想知道
Yes, I do.

900
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:01,156
天下没有免费的午餐
Nothing's free in this world. 

901
01:01:01,725 --> 01:01:03,955
连搜索票都要钱
Not even arrest warrants.

902
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,428
可恶，我不想知道
Shit, man, I didn't want to know.

903
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:19,942
你看这个混蛋 马克，好帅哦
Check this out. Nice suit, Mark.

904
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,737
好漂亮的外套
Beautiful suit.

905
01:01:21,912 --> 01:01:23,539
去你的
Yeah, fuck you guys!

906
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:44,033
很好，很好
All right. Nice, nice.

907
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:45,259
艾朗索，怎么样？
What's up, Alonzo?

908
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:47,431
十字镐和铲子呢？
The picks and shovels?

909
01:01:47,604 --> 01:01:48,798
在后车厢
In the trunk.

910
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:50,666
你们要挖水沟吗？
Digging a ditch?

911
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:55,011
不，是你挖，好帅的外套
No, you are. Nice suit you got on there.

912
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:56,440
我早就说了
That's what I said.

913
01:01:57,681 --> 01:01:58,613
帅哥，怎么样？
What up, killer?

914
01:01:58,782 --> 01:02:00,443
很好，你是怎么了？
What's up with you?

915
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:03,251
道上有很多谣言
-Heard you ran into trouble. -It's all good.

916
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,945
没事了，我跟长官谈过
Don't worry, everything's fine.

917
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:09,181
你说没问题，我就跟你干
Shit, if we can get away with it, I'm with you.

918
01:02:11,028 --> 01:02:12,518
他是什么人？
Who the fuck is this?

919
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:16,265
杰克霍特，我第一天加入
Jake Hoyt. It's my first day.

920
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:18,458
这儿可没有星巴克咖啡
You're a long way from Starbucks.

921
01:02:20,871 --> 01:02:22,839
你干嘛让他参一脚？
Why the fuck is he here?

922
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,830
他总要有第一次嘛
Gotta get his cherry popped.

923
01:02:25,008 --> 01:02:27,442
你最好别碍到我
Stay the fuck out of my way.

924
01:02:27,611 --> 01:02:29,806
这儿没菜鸟的份
This is for the big dogs. Feel me?

925
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:33,508
这就是搜索票
Here it is, all legit, 

926
01:02:33,684 --> 01:02:34,981
有法官签名，完全合法
signed by the judge, okay?

927
01:02:35,152 --> 01:02:36,551
这要多谢沙人的钱
Thanks to the Sandman. Now listen.

928
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:39,016
安全第一
Safety is first.

929
01:02:39,189 --> 01:02:41,885
他敢反抗就毙了他
He gives us shit, we give him lead.

930
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:45,619
干完这一票就回家做爱
Let's do this right so we can all go home.

931
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:48,561
准备好，出发吧
Time to punch in, ladies.

932
01:03:36,379 --> 01:03:39,439
别动，趴下来，快点
Freeze! On the floor!

933
01:03:39,616 --> 01:03:41,015
你们跑来干嘛？
-Down! -What are you clowns doing?

934
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:44,051
菜鸟，他敢乱来就开枪
Hey, new guy, watch him!

935
01:03:44,955 --> 01:03:46,013
没问题
I'm on him.

936
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:47,417
你有没有搞错？
You know what you're doing?

937
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:49,525
数到0前把手上的东西放下
Drop your gun!

938
01:03:49,693 --> 01:03:53,823
5…4…3…2…
Five. Four. Three.

939
01:03:57,868 --> 01:03:59,460
别逼我开枪
Give me a reason.

940
01:04:00,437 --> 01:04:02,701
艾朗索会整死你们
Alonzo's gonna have your ass.

941
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:04,703
罗杰，你好
What's up, Roger?

942
01:04:05,876 --> 01:04:06,865
这是怎么回事？
What's going down, brother?

943
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:08,704
没事
Oh, it's all good, baby.

944
01:04:12,282 --> 01:04:13,476
没事的
It's all good.

945
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:17,912
给你的
That's for you.

946
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,451
我拿来干嘛？擦屁股吗？
What am I supposed to do with this? Wipe my ass?

947
01:04:27,097 --> 01:04:28,962
我有坏消息
Bad news, dog.

948
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:32,858
我可以喝你的顶极威士忌吗？
Gimme some of that $300-a-glass shit.

949
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:34,094
请便
Please.

950
01:04:35,772 --> 01:04:37,831
今天我跟长官们吃中饭
Had lunch with the wise men.

951
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:40,439
他们叫你乖乖付一笔规费
You gotta render unto Caesar.

952
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,407
他们想把我干
Those vampires want my pension.

953
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:44,012
不，没那么糟啦
No, no.

954
01:04:49,753 --> 01:04:51,482
他们只是要你缴点税
Just a tax.

955
01:04:51,655 --> 01:04:55,648
他们要供游艇、情妇和豪宅
They got their boats and mistresses, house payments.

956
01:04:55,826 --> 01:04:57,157
我也拿他们没辄
Nothing I can do. 

957
01:04:57,327 --> 01:04:59,693
我只是小罗喽，我是被逼的
I'm just a lowly civil servant.

958
01:04:59,863 --> 01:05:01,421
你是他们的走狗
You're their bitch.

959
01:05:02,032 --> 01:05:03,499
我有什么下场？
What about me?

960
01:05:03,667 --> 01:05:05,157
我会保护你
I got your back.

961
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:07,667
我不会让你坐牢的
Don't worry, 

962
01:05:07,838 --> 01:05:09,635
拿一点钱你不会心疼
we won't take anything you'll miss.

963
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:13,371
抱歉，我是听命行事
I'm sorry. Orders, dog.

964
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:15,511
不，你一点都不抱歉
No you ain't, cop.

965
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:19,547
提姆、杰夫和杰克跟我到厨房
In the kitchen, fellas.

966
01:05:19,716 --> 01:05:21,308
去拿工具，散弹枪给我
Give me the bitch.

967
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:24,286
把他看好
You guys hold him down.

968
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:27,353
谁要把地板修好？
Who'll pay for my floor?

969
01:05:27,524 --> 01:05:28,650
市政府
The city.

970
01:05:37,701 --> 01:05:38,759
就是这儿
Right here.

971
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:20,269
没错了，这就是了
That's what I'm talking about.

972
01:06:28,251 --> 01:06:29,411
里面有可卡因吗？
What's in here? Coke?

973
01:06:29,586 --> 01:06:31,144
别急，等着瞧
You'll see.

974
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,354
用铁锤把锁敲掉
Grab that hammer and knock this lock off.

975
01:06:38,128 --> 01:06:40,426
1…2…
One, two....

976
01:06:48,872 --> 01:06:52,933
那是25万，总共有四百万
That's $250,000 you're holding. Over four million in here.

977
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:55,878
你第一天就破获三百万赃款
A $3 million bust on day one.

978
01:06:56,046 --> 01:06:57,240
你说四百万
You said four.

979
01:06:57,414 --> 01:07:00,349
我要抽税，天下没免费午餐
Minus tax, brother! Nothing's free in this world.

980
01:07:02,419 --> 01:07:04,887
替老婆买辆车，送小孩上大学
Buy your wife a car. Put the kids through college.

981
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:10,992
不，我只领洛城警局的薪水
The only checks I cash say "L.A.P.D."

982
01:07:11,828 --> 01:07:14,456
这砘锸羌俚姥
Somebody didn't sleep through Ethics.

983
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,992
你不想分一杯羹吗？
You don't want a piece of this?

984
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,804
不想
No, right?

985
01:07:23,673 --> 01:07:26,836
不能这样，我不要
Not like this. No.

986
01:07:28,078 --> 01:07:29,568
你不要？
No?

987
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:38,450
第一次不习惯，我替你保管
First time, you're not comfortable. I'll hold it for you.

988
01:07:38,822 --> 01:07:39,754
你习不习惯？
What about you?

989
01:07:39,923 --> 01:07:41,390
我很习惯
Oh, I'm comfortable.

990
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:43,389
你习惯吗？
How about you?

991
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,891
我早就习惯了
I'm very comfortable.

992
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:47,185
准备收工吧
Let's wrap this up.

993
01:07:50,867 --> 01:07:53,563
什么也别碰，这都是证物
Don't touch a thing! Evidence.

994
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:01,066
那群老头儿在想什么？
Alonzo, what are those pricks thinking?

995
01:08:01,711 --> 01:08:05,147
他们都把我当死人耍着玩吗？
That I'm gonna stand still and let them horsefuck me?

996
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:08,249
我倒是可以打死你
Could put you out of your misery.

997
01:08:11,221 --> 01:08:12,347
拿去
Hey, Jake, here.

998
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,319
坐下来
Sit down.

999
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:22,960
我跟你说个秘密
Here's a secret:

1000
01:08:23,133 --> 01:08:25,124
你只要杀了嫌犯
When you kill someone on duty...

1001
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:28,498
他下辈子就得当你奴隶
...they have to be your slave in the afterlife.

1002
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:34,342
动手吧
There you go.

1003
01:08:35,345 --> 01:08:37,210
开始养奴隶吧
Start an entourage.

1004
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:42,050
你要我杀了他？ 对
-Shoot him? -Yeah.

1005
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:45,676
给我个痛快吧
Come on, kid. Do me a favor. Come on.

1006
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:49,250
帮个忙，毙了他
Do yourself a favor. Hit him.

1007
01:08:49,426 --> 01:08:50,757
你是说真的？
Are you serious?

1008
01:08:51,428 --> 01:08:52,918
把百叶窗拉上
Hey, close the blinds.

1009
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,903
好，我开枪 快呀
-All right, I'll shoot him. -Go.

1010
01:09:15,452 --> 01:09:16,578
杀了他
Shoot him.

1011
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:18,954
不行
No, man.

1012
01:09:20,857 --> 01:09:23,519
年轻人真没用，你不开枪？
Kids these days. Not gonna do it?

1013
01:09:23,693 --> 01:09:24,660
给我吧
All right, give it to me.

1014
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:27,728
菜鸟
Rookies!

1015
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:30,764
要办事非得自己动手
You want shit done, you gotta do it yourself.

1016
01:09:32,068 --> 01:09:33,626
我的天
Holy shit!

1017
01:09:35,472 --> 01:09:37,269
呼吸
Come on, breathe.

1018
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:40,338
呼吸，对了
Breathe, there you go.

1019
01:09:42,946 --> 01:09:45,073
放松
Just let it go.

1020
01:09:45,248 --> 01:09:46,977
呼吸
Breathe, dog!

1021
01:09:55,892 --> 01:09:56,483
他死了
He's finished.

1022
01:09:59,028 --> 01:09:59,960
这里
All right, Jeff.

1023
01:10:04,334 --> 01:10:07,462
杰夫，你在门口中弹
You took fire coming in.

1024
01:10:07,737 --> 01:10:09,432
我是想休假啦…
I need some time off, but....

1025
01:10:09,606 --> 01:10:12,939
拜托，瞄准一点
Watch the shades.

1026
01:10:13,109 --> 01:10:14,633
好啦
All right.

1027
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:19,778
好了吗？ 来吧
-Ready? -Kiss me.

1028
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:21,041
第一枪
One....

1029
01:10:24,287 --> 01:10:25,584
你没事吧？ 没事
-You okay? -Yeah.

1030
01:10:25,755 --> 01:10:27,586
我要再开一枪
I gotta give you one more, though.

1031
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:29,421
来吧
Do it.

1032
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:30,923
可恶
Fuck!

1033
01:10:32,529 --> 01:10:35,862
真相没人信，证据才重要
It's not what you know, it's what you prove.

1034
01:10:36,032 --> 01:10:36,862
这是破案经过
Here it is. 

1035
01:10:37,033 --> 01:10:39,126
马克和保罗把门撞开
Mark and Paul kick the door.

1036
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:43,102
杰夫冲进来被罗杰开了两枪
Jeff's in first. Roger fires twice.

1037
01:10:46,776 --> 01:10:48,107
怎么？射到了？
What, one go through?

1038
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:50,110
你射伤他了
You shot him!

1039
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,508
你射到我了
You fucking shot me, man!

1040
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:53,410
你会得到奖章
Don't worry.

1041
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:54,982
快叫救护车
Call an ambulance!

1042
01:10:55,218 --> 01:10:57,118
你想坐牢还是回家？
Go to jail, or go home?

1043
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:00,018
让我先把证词套好
All right, here's the scenario.

1044
01:11:00,190 --> 01:11:03,421
马克和保罗撞门，杰夫冲进去
Mark and Paul kick the door. Jeff runs in.

1045
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:06,027
罗杰开两枪打中杰夫
Roger opens fire, hits Jeff.

1046
01:11:06,196 --> 01:11:08,994
菜鸟霍特接着冲进去
Hoyt is in second, 

1047
01:11:09,165 --> 01:11:10,894
用散弹枪把罗杰解决掉
drops Roger with the shotgun.

1048
01:11:11,067 --> 01:11:11,726
谁杀了罗杰？
Who shot Roger?

1049
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:12,959
菜鸟，他开的枪
New guy.

1050
01:11:13,136 --> 01:11:14,068
菜鸟毙了他
New guy.

1051
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:14,964
你看到什么？
You two?

1052
01:11:15,138 --> 01:11:15,832
霍特把他轰死
Hoyt.

1053
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:18,599
去他的，叫救护车啦
Fuck Hoyt. Ambulance time!

1054
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:20,367
好了，快通报吧
Done. Paul, call them up.

1055
01:11:21,077 --> 01:11:28,609
这是刑警，有警员中枪受伤…
11-49. 998. Shots fired. Officer down. Repeat, officer down. 5951 Baxter Street.

1056
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:34,520
恭喜了，你会获颁英勇奖章
Congratulations. You're gonna get a medal of valor for this.

1057
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:35,519
我没杀死他
I didn't shoot him.

1058
01:11:35,692 --> 01:11:37,523
一屋子的警察都说是你
Four cops saw it.

1059
01:11:37,694 --> 01:11:40,026
不是我，是你
But I didn't. You did.

1060
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:46,326
一名洛城警局缉毒组警官
"An L.A.P.D. narcotics officer was killed today...

1061
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:51,064
今天在办案时不幸殉职
...serving a warrant in Echo Park."

1062
01:11:51,241 --> 01:11:52,333
把枪给我
Give me the bitch.

1063
01:11:56,379 --> 01:12:01,840
警局发言人表示该警官留下…
"A spokesperson said the officer is survived...

1064
01:12:02,018 --> 01:12:04,077
一名妻子和幼女
...by a wife and child."

1065
01:12:04,254 --> 01:12:06,620
你无路可退了，懂吗？
There's more. You get the picture?

1066
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:08,051
我懂了
Yeah, I get it.

1067
01:12:09,392 --> 01:12:12,589
你拿枪指过我两次，事不过三
That's the second time you pointed a gun at me!

1068
01:12:12,762 --> 01:12:16,323
乖乖，我就知道你很厉害
Goddamn, boy! That's it, Jake!

1069
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:18,763
你们都看到吗？
Y'all see this? That's it!

1070
01:12:18,935 --> 01:12:20,869
我很乐意替你毙掉他
I'll put a bullet in that melon.

1071
01:12:21,037 --> 01:12:22,368
慢着
Wait, wait.

1072
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:24,904
放心，把枪放下
I'm gonna be cool. Drop the gun!

1073
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:27,008
尽管下手吧，我要找他陪葬
Shoot me. He's coming with me.

1074
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:27,972
我要开枪了
I'll shoot!

1075
01:12:28,144 --> 01:12:29,202
他是联邦干员
He's a fed.

1076
01:12:29,379 --> 01:12:30,676
他不是
No, he ain't. 

1077
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:34,078
他只是刚正不阿的乖乖牌
He's just a kid that got the drop on y'all.

1078
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:38,914
大家放轻松把话谈开，好吗？
Let's take a deep breath and just diffuse this. Jake?

1079
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:41,716
你不能害我，我不要犯法
I didn't sign up for this!

1080
01:12:41,891 --> 01:12:43,256
我知道你很生气
I know you're angry. 

1081
01:12:43,426 --> 01:12:45,519
大家把枪放下
Everybody, put the guns down.

1082
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:46,491
不行
Hell, no.

1083
01:12:46,663 --> 01:12:48,290
乖乖牌先让步
Choirboy first.

1084
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:52,525
把枪放下，这是我的命令
Listen! That's an order! Put them down!

1085
01:13:00,977 --> 01:13:03,343
仔细听我说
Use your ears, Jake.

1086
01:13:03,513 --> 01:13:06,448
有时候你一定要面对事实
Sometimes we take this shit all the way.

1087
01:13:06,616 --> 01:13:08,607
这就是现实的残酷
It's the nature of the business.

1088
01:13:09,285 --> 01:13:13,813
下次没有人会逼你开枪
You'll never have to pull the trigger again, all right?

1089
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:15,917
你要转到哪里？
Mark, where are you transferring?

1090
01:13:16,092 --> 01:13:18,287
重案组
S.I.S.

1091
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:19,722
他升了警探
Detective.

1092
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:23,730
我会在一年半内让你升官发财
You give me 18 months, I give you a career.

1093
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:27,027
破获巨额赃款、逮捕头号要犯
We make the big seizures, Jake.

1094
01:13:27,203 --> 01:13:31,299
你一旦加入了就要完全投入
But if you're in my unit, you gotta be in it all the way.

1095
01:13:31,474 --> 01:13:34,500
我以为你办得到，我错了
I thought you were man enough to handle this shit.

1096
01:13:34,677 --> 01:13:38,579
五名资深警官都说是你开的枪
Five decorated officers say that you shot Roger.

1097
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:42,741
调查员会替你抽血验毒
They will check your blood for intoxicants.

1098
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:45,547
他们会发现什么？
What are they gonna find?

1099
01:13:45,722 --> 01:13:48,885
你成天都在嗑药
You've been smoking PCP all day.

1100
01:13:49,058 --> 01:13:50,082
你计划了一整天
You've been planning this all day.

1101
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,352
我计划了一整个礼拜
All week, son.

1102
01:13:53,129 --> 01:13:56,724
你敢乱说话我就让你去验血
You talk, your blood gets to the lab.

1103
01:13:56,899 --> 01:13:59,766
你只要出门逛街马上血溅五步
You wanna take a walk? You won't make it out of here.

1104
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:03,804
不过你只要合作就是英雄
If you're cool, you're a hero.

1105
01:14:03,973 --> 01:14:06,237
你是没杀过人的菜鸟警察
You're above suspicion.

1106
01:14:06,409 --> 01:14:08,843
另一把手枪还剩两发子弹
Alonzo, there's two shots left.

1107
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:13,607
我们杀了菜鸟就说是罗杰干的
We need to kill him now and say Roger got him.

1108
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:17,082
不，我们不杀人
No, we ain't killing nobody.

1109
01:14:17,253 --> 01:14:20,620
他是个好人，也是个聪明人
This is a good man. I can feel it.

1110
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:24,783
这是震撼教育，我们都经历过
Just had a little freak-out, that's all.

1111
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:29,964
他会合作的，谁也别杀他
I say he's cool. Nobody's gonna hurt him.

1112
01:14:30,133 --> 01:14:32,260
不过你要做个决定
You do have a decision to make.

1113
01:14:32,435 --> 01:14:36,872
十秒后一大堆警察会冲进来
Because this place is gonna be overrun with blue suits.

1114
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:40,440
你可以到外面
So why don't you please go outside, 

1115
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:42,976
好好想一想
clear your head.

1116
01:14:43,379 --> 01:14:45,347
或是杀了我
Or shoot me.

1117
01:14:58,728 --> 01:14:59,990
保罗
Hey, Paul?

1118
01:15:05,034 --> 01:15:07,002
你死定，听到了吗？
You're dead, motherfucker! You hear me?! 

1119
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:07,898
你死定了
Dead!

1120
01:16:25,181 --> 01:16:26,910
别一直吃
Well, lay off the device.

1121
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,577
好
All right.

1122
01:16:31,554 --> 01:16:34,114
浴缸要洗干净
Make sure that tub is clean.

1123
01:16:34,857 --> 01:16:36,017
好吗？
All right?

1124
01:16:39,195 --> 01:16:40,423
好，待会见
All right, later.

1125
01:16:45,835 --> 01:16:47,200
你没事吧？
You all right?

1126
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:56,741
这次你最好别乱来
It behooves you not to dick around on this one.

1127
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:01,407
这算是自卫杀人…
Justifiable homicide in the line of duty.

1128
01:17:01,584 --> 01:17:05,577
这算是谋杀和抢劫
-Now, what happened-- -What happened was murder. And armed robbery.

1129
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:09,322
警察就有权杀人吗？
We had badges, so it's different?

1130
01:17:09,492 --> 01:17:12,120
张开双眼吧，你看不到吗？
Son, open your eyes! Can't you see?

1131
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:16,698
他是你朋友，你却一枪杀死他
That man was your friend, and you killed him like a fly.

1132
01:17:16,866 --> 01:17:19,164
朋友？为什么？
My friend? Tell me why?

1133
01:17:19,335 --> 01:17:22,065
就因为他认识我？
Because he knows my first name?

1134
01:17:22,605 --> 01:17:25,665
我只是利用他，这是我的职责
This is the game. I played his ass.

1135
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:27,672
这也是你的职责
That's our job.

1136
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:30,137
罗杰卖毒品给小孩
Roger sold dope to kids. 

1137
01:17:30,313 --> 01:17:33,146
这世界没有他会更安全
The world's better off without him.

1138
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:38,982
他是全洛杉矶最大的毒枭
This man was the biggest major violator in Los Angeles.

1139
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:42,420
我盯了他十年了
I watched that cocksucker for years 

1140
01:17:42,592 --> 01:17:43,820
现在我逮到他
and now I got him.

1141
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:46,826
干这一行要斗智斗力
This is chess, not checkers!

1142
01:17:53,936 --> 01:17:57,895
难道闯进他家把他铐起来
What'd you think? We'd roll up in a black and white?

1143
01:17:58,074 --> 01:18:00,269
说：你被捕了 就能解决问题吗？
Slap the cuffs on him?

1144
01:18:00,443 --> 01:18:02,206
他可是大毒枭耶
He's a high roller, dog.

1145
01:18:06,082 --> 01:18:07,982
把钱拿去吧 我说过，我不要
-Take the money. -I'm not taking it.

1146
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:09,378
我不要这笔钱
-Just take it. -No!

1147
01:18:09,552 --> 01:18:12,612
那就那去煎炒煮炸都无所谓
Look, I don't give a fuck, 

1148
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:13,948
你拿去大伙儿会好过些
but the boys'll feel better.

1149
01:18:14,123 --> 01:18:15,750
我才不管他们
Fuck their feelings!

1150
01:18:15,925 --> 01:18:19,019
你这样就不算我们一伙
Jake, we're a team.

1151
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:20,753
一伙？
A team?

1152
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:23,194
你们是一伙疯子
You guys are fucking insane.

1153
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:27,430
我宁愿去当交通警察开罚单
I'll go back to the Valley, I'll cut parking tickets.

1154
01:18:31,741 --> 01:18:33,106
警察不该是这样
It can't be like this.

1155
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:37,837
就是这样 抱歉让你看到丑陋一面
It is. I'm sorry, but it is.

1156
01:18:38,014 --> 01:18:39,038
但这是必要的
It's ugly, but it's necessary.

1157
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:43,242
我当警察的目的是抓坏人
I became a cop to put away dealers and criminals, 

1158
01:18:43,419 --> 01:18:44,351
不是自己当坏人
not to be one.

1159
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,249
你跟我以前一样
You sound just like me.

1160
01:18:46,489 --> 01:18:50,220
我知道你的感受，你很害怕
I know what you're going through and feeling. You're scared.

1161
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:51,325
我才不怕
I'm not.

1162
01:18:51,494 --> 01:18:55,863
你怕得要命 第一次都会这样，我也是
Yes, you are. Everyone goes through that the first time. I did.

1163
01:18:56,799 --> 01:19:04,205
只要你接受残酷的现实世界
The sooner you match what's in your head with what's in the real world...

1164
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:06,739
心里就会好受很多
...the better you'll feel.

1165
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:10,606
干缉毒这一行一定要犯点错
In this business...

1166
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:12,771
别人才会信任你
...you gotta have dirt on you to be trusted.

1167
01:19:13,049 --> 01:19:18,817
等你想通了 美好世界会等着你
When all this is behind you, a whole other world will open up for you.

1168
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:22,423
我就是你的向导
I walk a higher path, son.

1169
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:25,355
我能为你开启每一扇门
I have the keys to all the doors.

1170
01:19:27,063 --> 01:19:28,894
你在说什么？
What do you mean?

1171
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:32,399
我的手下不是做领导的料 他们都是小丑
My guys aren't leaders, they're clowns. You're a leader.

1172
01:19:32,568 --> 01:19:35,128
你才是领袖，你可以取代我
You want my job? You got it.

1173
01:19:35,304 --> 01:19:38,865
你想抓坏人 这才是最好的机会
You want to lock up poisoners? This is the place to do it.

1174
01:19:40,810 --> 01:19:44,712
但你要有耐心，先升上警探
But you gotta take your time. You'll make detective,

1175
01:19:44,914 --> 01:19:49,044
学聪明点，然后再做改变
you'll grow wise. And then you can change things.

1176
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:53,186
不过你得先改变自己
But it's gotta be from the inside.

1177
01:19:55,991 --> 01:20:00,428
我待会带你回总局找史丹
Let's go downtown to the station. Talk to my guy, Stan.

1178
01:20:01,197 --> 01:20:05,156
他会教你该怎么跟检察官说
He'll go through what you gotta say to the D.A.

1179
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:56,943
我们来这儿干嘛？
What are we doing now?

1180
01:20:57,119 --> 01:20:58,677
我的线人坐牢
I told an informant 

1181
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:01,414
我答应要照顾他家人
I'd take care of his family for him.

1182
01:21:05,294 --> 01:21:07,728
我都替他们带些吃的用的
Bring them food, stuff like that.

1183
01:21:07,997 --> 01:21:09,487
帮他养家活口
Gotta help out the family.

1184
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:14,662
信不信由你，我都在做好事
Believe it or not, I do try to do some good.

1185
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:21,699
干嘛？你来找死吗？
You know where you're at, dog?

1186
01:21:27,516 --> 01:21:28,881
看什么看？
The fuck you looking at?

1187
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:07,221
我带了好东西来
Hey, we got some things for the family.

1188
01:22:21,537 --> 01:22:22,834
厨房在这儿
Kitchen's this way.

1189
01:22:30,813 --> 01:22:34,146
放在柜台
Put it on the counter.

1190
01:22:43,859 --> 01:22:46,726
我去一下厕所，等我出来就走
I'm gonna go to the head. Two seconds, we're gone.

1191
01:22:48,664 --> 01:22:51,929
真好，我要雷射唱盘
Hey, let me get the CD player.

1192
01:22:52,101 --> 01:22:54,535
果汁机给你，我要雷射唱盘
No, the CD player's mine.

1193
01:22:54,737 --> 01:22:56,728
卓梦，给我进来
Dreamer! Come here!

1194
01:22:58,073 --> 01:22:59,836
到房间数一数
Count that shit, all right?

1195
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:03,968
拜托，我正在忙耶
Thanks a lot, I was busy.

1196
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:06,671
下次你最好自己数
Learn how to count, fucking math whiz.

1197
01:23:09,785 --> 01:23:10,774
你偷看牌
-You looked! -I didn't.

1198
01:23:10,953 --> 01:23:14,047
才没有，你说我出老千？
You calling me a cheater, ése?

1199
01:23:14,423 --> 01:23:16,789
再发一次牌
Deal again, Sniper.

1200
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:21,056
你玩牌吗？
You play cards, cop?

1201
01:23:21,397 --> 01:23:23,194
不常玩
No, not really.

1202
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:26,468
喝啤酒吗？来一瓶吧
Want a beer? Have a cold one.

1203
01:23:26,635 --> 01:23:28,626
不，谢了
No, thanks, I'm good.

1204
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:33,069
坐下来，玩一把嘛
Come on, sit down. Play a card game with us.

1205
01:23:33,242 --> 01:23:35,836
你是客人，有点礼貌
Don't be rude, ése. You're a guest.

1206
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:38,138
坐下来玩一把
Why don't you play one hand?

1207
01:23:38,814 --> 01:23:41,009
放心，我们不赌钱
Don't worry, we ain't betting money.

1208
01:23:41,183 --> 01:23:43,674
我们马上就走了
We gotta roll in a second.

1209
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,252
艾朗索在大号，没那么快
Alonzo's taking a shit.

1210
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:51,015
好吧，我就玩一把
All right, I'll play one hand.

1211
01:23:52,461 --> 01:23:54,827
你们在玩梭哈吗？
Is this five-card draw?

1212
01:23:54,997 --> 01:23:57,591
小丑是王牌
Yeah, jokers are wild.

1213
01:23:57,766 --> 01:24:02,260
告诉我，你当猪猡多久了？
Why don't you tell us something? How long you been a pig?

1214
01:24:03,906 --> 01:24:05,737
对不起，对不起
My bad. My bad.

1215
01:24:05,908 --> 01:24:09,639
我是说你当警察有多久？
I meant a police officer.

1216
01:24:09,812 --> 01:24:11,712
我当了19个月
I've been a pig for 19 months.

1217
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,040
是吗？
Is that right? 

1218
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:14,239
你喜欢吗？
You like it?

1219
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:16,247
我应该当消防员，还要一张
I should've been a fireman. One more.

1220
01:24:20,556 --> 01:24:21,989
你有什么牌？
What you got, dog?

1221
01:24:22,191 --> 01:24:23,556
三张十一点
Three of a kind.

1222
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:25,660
我什么也没有
I didn't get shit.

1223
01:24:25,995 --> 01:24:28,190
太棒了
Boo-ya, baby!

1224
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:31,695
我有两对，两对耶
Two pair!

1225
01:24:35,671 --> 01:24:36,035
你高兴什么？警察赢了
What the fuck? He won.

1226
01:24:37,873 --> 01:24:41,900
拜托，我有两对耶
I got two pair!

1227
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:45,940
三条比你的两对大啦
Three of a kind beats two pair, you fucking dumb truck.

1228
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:52,047
你真是笨，你一定没吃药
You're fucking stupid. Take your medication.

1229
01:24:52,221 --> 01:24:54,451
听好了，我才是聪明人
Seriously. I know I'm number one.

1230
01:24:54,623 --> 01:24:57,786
因为有这呆瓜，我们才不赌钱
See why we don't play for money? Because of this vato.

1231
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,120
很好，给我看你的砘
Show me your cohete.

1232
01:25:01,296 --> 01:25:02,126
什么？
What?

1233
01:25:02,297 --> 01:25:04,595
你的佩枪，给他看
Your gun, homes. Underneath your shirt.

1234
01:25:06,368 --> 01:25:08,097
你用的是点三八口径手枪吗？
What is it, .380 stainless?

1235
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:09,601
九厘米贝瑞塔
9mm Beretta.

1236
01:25:09,772 --> 01:25:11,535
像这一把吗？
Like that?

1237
01:25:13,709 --> 01:25:14,767
一模一样
Just like it.

1238
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:16,001
真的吗？
Yeah?

1239
01:25:16,178 --> 01:25:18,408
这就是问题了
Here's the problem.

1240
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:22,411
我看过这把，我要看你那把
I seen this one. I want to see yours.

1241
01:25:23,552 --> 01:25:27,113
来啦，我不会开枪的
Come on, ése, I ain't gonna shoot nobody.

1242
01:25:29,925 --> 01:25:31,483
给我看看
Let me check it out.

1243
01:25:41,603 --> 01:25:43,833
那招是在警校学的？
Learn that in the Academy?

1244
01:25:44,006 --> 01:25:44,802
是呀
Neat trick. 

1245
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:46,235
挺厉害的
This is nice.

1246
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:49,033
不错，这真不错
Nice. 

1247
01:25:49,211 --> 01:25:51,406
一枪就把坏蛋给毙了
You could fuck a vato up with this.

1248
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:57,676
你只要拿起来瞄准对方
What you do is, you aim like that.

1249
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:02,756
我只是在耍你
I'm just playing.

1250
01:26:02,925 --> 01:26:04,017
我得走了
Yeah, I gotta go. 

1251
01:26:04,193 --> 01:26:05,592
艾朗索
Alonzo!

1252
01:26:07,029 --> 01:26:08,394
留下来玩吧
Kick back and party.

1253
01:26:09,098 --> 01:26:10,690
你走不了了
Ain't nothing out there for you.

1254
01:26:11,934 --> 01:26:13,333
什么意思？
What are you talking about?

1255
01:26:17,473 --> 01:26:18,838
白小子
Hey, white boy.

1256
01:26:19,374 --> 01:26:23,276
既然你都问了，我就说吧
If you ask me homes, that's just, of course, if you ask...

1257
01:26:23,479 --> 01:26:26,073
艾朗索出卖你了
...Alonzo played you, ése.

1258
01:26:26,248 --> 01:26:27,715
他把你害惨了
Big time.

1259
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:31,977
等一等，你想去哪？
Wait, where you going?

1260
01:26:32,488 --> 01:26:34,183
该你发牌了
It's your deal.

1261
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:46,664
钱都在这儿
It's all there.

1262
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:48,465
你确定？
Sure? 

1263
01:26:48,637 --> 01:26:51,071
你不信就自己数呀
You can count it yourself.

1264
01:26:56,145 --> 01:26:59,342
艾朗索一定有魔法
Alonzo pulled off a miracle.

1265
01:26:59,515 --> 01:27:01,847
时机很差，他却弄到这笔钱
Times are tight. Scared up a lot of cash.

1266
01:27:02,084 --> 01:27:03,642
他杀了谁？
Who'd he jack, homes?

1267
01:27:04,786 --> 01:27:05,980
我不知道
I don't know.

1268
01:27:09,992 --> 01:27:11,823
他杀了罗杰
He jacked Roger.

1269
01:27:12,461 --> 01:27:13,621
把那砘锖涞袅
Blasted that fool.

1270
01:27:13,795 --> 01:27:18,630
艾朗索是个贪污腐败的坏警察
Alonzo's a low-down, ruthless vato.

1271
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,495
不过我很佩服他，他够狠
But I like that.

1272
01:27:20,669 --> 01:27:25,231
不，我才不会跟他握手
That's why I never shake his hand.

1273
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:28,035
他什么都不尊重
He don't respect nada.

1274
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:29,837
他弄那笔钱干嘛？
Know what the money's for?

1275
01:27:30,779 --> 01:27:33,907
艾朗索太火爆了
Alonzo, he's a hothead.

1276
01:27:34,116 --> 01:27:35,777
上礼拜在赌城
Last week in Vegas, 

1277
01:27:35,951 --> 01:27:39,819
有一个俄国佬把他给惹毛了
some Russian starts talking shit.

1278
01:27:40,856 --> 01:27:43,222
他把对方活活打死
Alonzo, he just snapped. Beat his ass to death.

1279
01:27:43,392 --> 01:27:47,658
结果这俄国佬是重要角色
Turns out, that Russian, he's a somebody.

1280
01:27:47,829 --> 01:27:52,562
艾朗索欠他们一百万美元
Now, Alonzo's into the Russians for a million.

1281
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:54,167
你怎么知道？
How do you know that?

1282
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:01,438
艾朗索今晚一定要付钱
Alonzo has until tonight to pay up.

1283
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:04,272
要不然就会被追杀
But he's still on their list.

1284
01:28:04,446 --> 01:28:07,938
想不到他真的弄到这笔巨款
Nobody thought he could get the cash.

1285
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:12,652
幸好他有一组手下替他干活
Good thing he did. They're looking for him.

1286
01:28:12,821 --> 01:28:18,191
今晚午夜他没赶到市区交钱
If he don't turn up downtown with the cash by midnight....

1287
01:28:18,727 --> 01:28:22,026
你老友就死定了
Your vato...he's dead.

1288
01:28:22,864 --> 01:28:27,460
你被别人鸡奸过吗？
Hey, pig. Ever had your shit pushed in?

1289
01:28:27,636 --> 01:28:29,263
快回答
Simple question.

1290
01:28:29,438 --> 01:28:30,598
没有
-No? -No.

1291
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:32,103
我被鸡奸过
Had my shit pushed in.

1292
01:28:32,274 --> 01:28:33,434
没错
Yeah, man.

1293
01:28:33,609 --> 01:28:39,138
我也被鸡奸过，好惨哦
I had my shit pushed in, bro! Big time!

1294
01:28:41,116 --> 01:28:42,811
史麦利呢？
Smiley?

1295
01:28:42,985 --> 01:28:47,388
我也被别人鸡奸过
Sure, I always get love from the homeys.

1296
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,697
你们把他揍扁了
You guys fucked him up!

1297
01:28:58,867 --> 01:29:00,300
把她们带走
Go next door.

1298
01:29:00,869 --> 01:29:02,598
快滚出去
Get the fuck out of here!

1299
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:06,902
你完蛋了
You fucked up.

1300
01:29:08,043 --> 01:29:09,874
你被捕了，臭警察
You're under arrest!

1301
01:29:10,045 --> 01:29:14,812
谁叫你在我家撒野
For being a cop, dogging me in the mouth in my own pad.

1302
01:29:15,417 --> 01:29:19,513
你会被毒打一顿，小杂种
You got the right to be bitch-slapped!

1303
01:29:22,524 --> 01:29:25,152
把他拖进浴缸
Drag him to the tub.

1304
01:29:27,929 --> 01:29:30,124
动手吧
Raid his ass!

1305
01:29:54,289 --> 01:29:55,984
关门，声音会很大
Do it! It's gonna be loud.

1306
01:29:59,428 --> 01:30:03,455
我先拿他的钱
Let me get his money.

1307
01:30:03,632 --> 01:30:04,758
快点
-Wait. -Hurry up.

1308
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:12,304
史麦利
Smiley, check it out.

1309
01:30:12,474 --> 01:30:15,375
你铁会生气 这不是你表妹吗？
Is that your little cousin?

1310
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:24,510
你从哪儿拿来的？
-What's this? -I found it!

1311
01:30:24,686 --> 01:30:28,247
我检到的，我检到的
-Who had it? -I found it!

1312
01:30:28,857 --> 01:30:29,619
哪儿？
Where?

1313
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:34,057
我在麦卡锡公园检到的
I found it in MacArthur Park! MacArthur Park!

1314
01:30:38,667 --> 01:30:40,862
等等，我看不到
Wait up, I can't even see.

1315
01:30:41,036 --> 01:30:42,560
给我闭嘴
Shut the fuck up!

1316
01:30:42,738 --> 01:30:44,933
信教的话就祷告吧
Get in your last prayer.

1317
01:30:45,107 --> 01:30:48,702
听我说，她当时被强暴
Listen to me, man. She was being raped.

1318
01:30:48,877 --> 01:30:52,973
我阻止两个毒虫强暴她
Two crackheads were attacking her...

1319
01:30:53,148 --> 01:30:55,082
我发誓，我阻止了他们
...and I stopped them! I swear to God!

1320
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:55,978
你在说谎
You're lying to me!

1321
01:30:56,151 --> 01:30:58,278
我发誓我没说谎
I am not lying!

1322
01:30:59,554 --> 01:31:03,854
她被强暴，我阻止他们
She was being raped! I stopped them!

1323
01:31:04,025 --> 01:31:04,957
我有一个小孩
Please! I got a kid.

1324
01:31:05,127 --> 01:31:06,116
闭嘴
Shut up, fag!

1325
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:07,852
毙了他吧
Blast his ass.

1326
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:10,997
我有一个小女儿
I have a little girl!

1327
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:14,034
下手吧
Do it!

1328
01:31:15,337 --> 01:31:19,068
她是我表妹，我要问清楚
I'm gonna get to the bottom of your bullshit. She's my cousin, homes.

1329
01:31:19,241 --> 01:31:21,709
她只是小孩，不该把她扯进来
Ain't right involving her.

1330
01:31:22,277 --> 01:31:23,471
你完蛋了
You fucked up.

1331
01:31:27,816 --> 01:31:30,011
要是你敢说谎
If you're lying to me...

1332
01:31:30,185 --> 01:31:32,085
我就打爆你的鸟蛋
...I blow your balls off.

1333
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:34,448
莉蒂，你在干嘛？
-Hello. -Hey, Letty.

1334
01:31:34,623 --> 01:31:37,683
表哥，我在做功课
-What's up? -Hey, Smiley. Just doing homework. 

1335
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:38,689
你要找汤尼吗？
You want Tony?

1336
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:42,057
我要找你，你今天有上学吗？
No, I want you. You go to school today?

1337
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:43,822
有啊
Yeah.

1338
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:45,364
你没有翘课吗？
-You didn't ditch? -Nope.

1339
01:31:45,534 --> 01:31:49,026
我都有上课呀，怎么了？
I went to every class. Why?

1340
01:31:49,204 --> 01:31:50,865
听说不是这样
I heard different.

1341
01:31:53,642 --> 01:31:55,735
警察找过你吗？
Cops talk to you today?

1342
01:31:58,814 --> 01:32:00,543
没有
No, no.

1343
01:32:00,715 --> 01:32:03,980
老实说，别骗我
All right, Letty... don't bullshit me.

1344
01:32:07,422 --> 01:32:10,323
好啦，我被两个毒虫攻击
I got jumped by two crackheads.

1345
01:32:10,492 --> 01:32:11,823
你被攻击？
You got jumped?

1346
01:32:11,993 --> 01:32:14,689
我猜他们想强暴我
I think they wanted to rape me.

1347
01:32:14,863 --> 01:32:17,263
他们只打了我几下而已
But nothing happened, okay?

1348
01:32:17,432 --> 01:32:21,129
有个警察跑来救我
Because this cop came.

1349
01:32:21,303 --> 01:32:24,602
他差点没命，不过他很神勇
They almost killed him ...but he kicked their ass.

1350
01:32:24,773 --> 01:32:26,570
这警察长什么样？
Describe him.

1351
01:32:27,142 --> 01:32:30,236
他是白人，蛮年轻的
He was a white boy. He looked real young.

1352
01:32:31,413 --> 01:32:32,345
你真的没事？
You're okay?

1353
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:33,980
没事啦，我很好
Yeah, I'm fine.

1354
01:32:34,182 --> 01:32:37,242
莉蒂，这件事以后再说
-Hey, Letty. -Yeah? -We're not done.

1355
01:32:37,419 --> 01:32:38,647
好吧
Okay.

1356
01:32:40,121 --> 01:32:41,418
怎么样？
What's up?

1357
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:43,217
你要不要毙了他？
You gonna blast him?

1358
01:32:45,994 --> 01:32:48,053
他说的是实话
Vato was telling the truth.

1359
01:32:48,597 --> 01:32:50,360
真没想到
Life's a trip, qué no?

1360
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:53,125
真是太巧了
This is some trippy shit.

1361
01:33:06,715 --> 01:33:09,479
看在你救了我表妹的份上
That's for getting my cousin's back.

1362
01:33:10,819 --> 01:33:14,186
拿去，别把地板弄脏了
Cover your head. You'll mess up my floor.

1363
01:33:15,357 --> 01:33:17,951
你知道这只是公事公办
You know this was just business, right?

1364
01:33:21,863 --> 01:33:23,262
对吧？
Right?

1365
01:33:25,267 --> 01:33:26,825
对
Right.

1366
01:34:41,109 --> 01:34:46,240
菜鸟，来找死吗？ 你不能来这里
What you doing here? You know you don't belong here.

1367
01:35:09,337 --> 01:35:11,134
你有事吗？
You got business here, rookie?

1368
01:35:11,773 --> 01:35:13,536
我来找艾朗索
I'm here for Alonzo.

1369
01:36:25,747 --> 01:36:26,771
你爸在吗？
Hey. Is your dad home?

1370
01:36:26,948 --> 01:36:28,006
他在卧室
In the bedroom.

1371
01:36:28,183 --> 01:36:31,710
他在卧室吗？帮我开门？
He's in the bedroom? All right, you wanna open up the door?

1372
01:36:34,189 --> 01:36:36,020
你在看电视吗？
Okay. Thanks. You watching TV?

1373
01:36:37,192 --> 01:36:38,659
好看吗？
Yeah, anything good on?

1374
01:36:47,368 --> 01:36:49,359
你要我叫妈咪吗？
Do you want me to call my mom?

1375
01:36:49,537 --> 01:36:50,697
不要
No, I don't.

1376
01:36:52,073 --> 01:36:53,540
这样好了
I'll tell you what I want.

1377
01:36:55,009 --> 01:36:59,639
我要你躲起来，有地方躲吗？
Find a good hiding spot. Do you have a favorite place to hide?

1378
01:37:00,548 --> 01:37:01,776
衣橱
The closet.

1379
01:37:01,950 --> 01:37:04,009
这间衣橱吗？太好了
In the closet? That's perfect.

1380
01:37:04,586 --> 01:37:08,522
打开来，对，很好
Okay, open up the closet. All right. Good, good.

1381
01:37:08,723 --> 01:37:10,782
我要你坐下来
Can you sit down in there?

1382
01:37:12,393 --> 01:37:13,917
待在这儿
All right. Now stay in here and be very quiet.

1383
01:37:14,095 --> 01:37:18,589
别出声，我马上回来
I'll be right back. All right?

1384
01:37:45,994 --> 01:37:47,894
全都在这儿
It's all good, baby.

1385
01:37:55,270 --> 01:37:57,033
你靠着墙壁
You, against the wall.

1386
01:37:57,205 --> 01:37:59,105
你把手伸出来
Move real slow. 

1387
01:37:59,274 --> 01:38:00,536
钱放在袋子里
Put the money in that bag...

1388
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:04,200
把枪放进枕头套
...take your weapons and place them inside that pillowcase.

1389
01:38:06,681 --> 01:38:08,171
恭喜了
Congratulations, son. 

1390
01:38:09,117 --> 01:38:10,516
你没有死
You made it.

1391
01:38:10,785 --> 01:38:13,879
你通过考验，你是缉毒员了
You passed the test. You're a narc.

1392
01:38:14,055 --> 01:38:16,853
把枪放下，别害她心脏病发作
Put the gun down before you give her a heart attack.

1393
01:38:17,025 --> 01:38:22,930
钱放袋子里，枪放进枕头套
I said put the money in that bag. Place your weapons inside that pillowcase.

1394
01:38:23,131 --> 01:38:26,225
你别想去见俄国佬，来不及了
Fuck your appointment with the Russians.

1395
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:28,198
好吧
Oh, okay.

1396
01:38:29,404 --> 01:38:31,463
把枕头套给我
Okay. Hand me the pillowcase, baby.

1397
01:38:32,507 --> 01:38:34,202
把枕头套给我
Baby! Hand me the pillowcase.

1398
01:38:35,310 --> 01:38:37,141
你想把我带回局里？
You're gonna book me?

1399
01:38:37,312 --> 01:38:39,837
别忘了你嗑了药
You smoked the dust.

1400
01:38:40,014 --> 01:38:42,574
你也像疯子一样打死罗杰
You ran out, and you're the one that shot Roger.

1401
01:38:44,419 --> 01:38:45,044
拿去吧
Here you go.

1402
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:46,915
还有你脚上的佩枪
And the one on your ankle?

1403
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:49,150
背后那把也要吗？
Want the one in my back pocket too?

1404
01:38:49,324 --> 01:38:50,689
对
One problem: 

1405
01:38:54,462 --> 01:38:56,930
问题是你没有目击证人
You got no witnesses.

1406
01:38:57,131 --> 01:39:00,828
谁是证人？罗杰？史麦利？
Who are your witnesses, huh? Roger? Smiley?

1407
01:39:01,002 --> 01:39:03,197
我的手下才不会帮你
You think they'll help you?

1408
01:39:03,471 --> 01:39:08,238
真相没人信，证据才重要
It's not what you know. It's what you can prove.

1409
01:39:11,846 --> 01:39:14,747
你能证明什么？
What can you prove, huh? Nothing.

1410
01:39:14,916 --> 01:39:15,848
你哪来的证据？
-Where's your evidence? -There.

1411
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:16,982
那笔钱
Oh, shit!

1412
01:39:27,061 --> 01:39:28,790
决斗开始了
It's on now, Jake.

1413
01:39:30,231 --> 01:39:31,357
别动
Don't move.

1414
01:39:34,335 --> 01:39:35,563
你在哪里？
Where you at, Jake?

1415
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:38,370
出来吧
Come on out, dog!

1416
01:39:52,654 --> 01:39:54,053
我看到了
-Ah! I see you. -Shit!

1417
01:40:00,628 --> 01:40:02,528
我可是神枪手
I'm surgical with this bitch. 

1418
01:40:02,697 --> 01:40:04,164
你想死得很难看吗？
How you want it?

1419
01:40:04,365 --> 01:40:08,096
坐轮椅的砘镆彩俏业慕茏
That fool in the wheelchair? How you think he got there?

1420
01:40:17,145 --> 01:40:19,010
你看到吗？
You see what I see?

1421
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:20,711
霍特警官
Officer Hoyt, 

1422
01:40:20,882 --> 01:40:25,114
警察的天职，拯救人命
job number one: Preserve life.

1423
01:40:25,286 --> 01:40:26,583
别伤害我儿子
There's my son. Don't hurt him.

1424
01:40:26,754 --> 01:40:29,154
我们一起走出来
We're walking out together.

1425
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:56,144
你没事吧？
You all right?

1426
01:40:56,317 --> 01:40:57,682
我要找妈咪
I want my mommy.

1427
01:40:57,852 --> 01:40:59,581
我知道
I know, I know, I know.

1428
01:40:59,787 --> 01:41:03,848
别乱动，不会有事的
Just sit tight, all right?

1429
01:41:05,426 --> 01:41:06,552
我知道
It's gonna be all right. I know.

1430
01:41:12,934 --> 01:41:15,027
手伸出来，他人呢？
All right, let me see your hands! Where is he?

1431
01:41:15,203 --> 01:41:16,431
窗口
-The window. -Come on!

1432
01:41:16,604 --> 01:41:19,129
快来抱你儿子
-Get your kid, stay down. -Alonzito!

1433
01:46:24,979 --> 01:46:27,413
羔羊手上有枪可不好玩吧
It's no fun when the rabbit has the gun, is it?

1434
01:46:29,383 --> 01:46:31,044
好砘
My nigga.

1435
01:46:35,790 --> 01:46:39,226
谁先一枪毙了他
Hey, first Damu puts one in his head...

1436
01:46:39,794 --> 01:46:41,523
我就让他发财
...I'll make you a rich man!

1437
01:46:42,963 --> 01:46:46,126
快呀，谁想发财？
Come on now. Who wanna get paid?

1438
01:46:47,668 --> 01:46:49,226
谁想发财？
Who wanna get paid?

1439
01:46:53,274 --> 01:46:54,798
他们跟你不一样
They're not like you.

1440
01:46:55,843 --> 01:46:57,708
我今天学到一件事
You know what I learned today?

1441
01:46:58,779 --> 01:47:00,110
我也跟你不一样
I'm not like you.

1442
01:47:00,281 --> 01:47:03,182
很好，那敢情好
That's good. I'm glad to hear that.

1443
01:47:04,385 --> 01:47:05,750
很好
Good. 

1444
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:07,414
现在怎样？
So, what now? Huh?

1445
01:47:09,523 --> 01:47:11,320
你要杀我吗？
What you gonna do, shoot me?

1446
01:47:11,492 --> 01:47:14,188
你要杀一个警察吗？
You gonna bust your cherry killing a cop?

1447
01:47:20,234 --> 01:47:22,134
动手呀
There it is, Jake.

1448
01:47:23,838 --> 01:47:25,203
杀了我
Hit me.

1449
01:47:25,806 --> 01:47:27,933
你没杀过人吧？
You never killed nobody before. 

1450
01:47:28,109 --> 01:47:30,270
这跟踩死蚂蚁不同
It ain't like stepping on ants.

1451
01:47:30,778 --> 01:47:32,507
男子汉才能杀人
Takes a man to kill.

1452
01:47:34,115 --> 01:47:36,049
你是男子汉吗？
Are you man enough to kill?

1453
01:47:38,552 --> 01:47:40,349
轰了我脑袋
Hit me right there.

1454
01:47:44,425 --> 01:47:47,360
杀我，杀了我吧
Get me, Jake. Get me.

1455
01:47:47,528 --> 01:47:48,460
动手呀
Hit me. Hit me.

1456
01:47:48,662 --> 01:47:49,856
你下不了手
You can't do it.

1457
01:47:51,565 --> 01:47:53,795
帮我把这砘锉辛
Somebody drop this fool for me.

1458
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:14,248
我们受够你了，你自求多福吧
You got us twisted. You got to put your own work in.

1459
01:48:15,456 --> 01:48:17,754
好吧，就是这样吗？
All right. It's like that, Bone?

1460
01:48:17,925 --> 01:48:19,085
就是这样
It's like that.

1461
01:48:22,997 --> 01:48:26,296
我跟你杠上了
Player to player, pimp to pimp.

1462
01:48:26,667 --> 01:48:28,157
我不相信你会开枪
I don't believe you'd shoot me.

1463
01:48:28,369 --> 01:48:29,802
别逼我
Don't do it.

1464
01:48:30,971 --> 01:48:31,733
别逼我
Don't.

1465
01:48:31,906 --> 01:48:33,840
我不信你有种开枪
I don't believe you got it in you.

1466
01:48:44,952 --> 01:48:50,117
我要把枪和钱都拿走 而你却不敢怎样
I'm gonna get that gun and that money. You ain't gonna do a thing.

1467
01:48:50,291 --> 01:48:53,385
因为你不敢从背后向警察开枪
You ain't gonna shoot no cop in the back.

1468
01:48:54,695 --> 01:48:55,491
别逼我
-Don't do it. -You know what you'd get?

1469
01:48:55,663 --> 01:48:58,496
杀警察会进毒气室
The gas chamber. You know what it smells like?

1470
01:48:58,666 --> 01:49:01,897
毒气闻起来就像松油
Pine oil. 

1471
01:49:02,069 --> 01:49:05,004
我要把你送上西天
That's where you headed, to pine oil heaven.

1472
01:49:05,172 --> 01:49:07,868
我要拿枪，然后拿钱
I'm gonna get that gun and that money.

1473
01:49:08,042 --> 01:49:11,500
我不信你有种向我开枪
I don't think you got it in you. I'm gonna go get it.

1474
01:49:12,813 --> 01:49:14,838
可恶
Shit! 

1475
01:49:15,316 --> 01:49:17,375
你这小王八蛋
Ah, you motherfucker!

1476
01:49:17,551 --> 01:49:19,451
下一枪就毙了你
The next one will kill you.

1477
01:49:19,653 --> 01:49:21,518
小杂种
Son of a bitch! 

1478
01:49:21,889 --> 01:49:23,379
你打中我屁股
You shot me in the ass!

1479
01:49:23,591 --> 01:49:28,460
好，等一下，听我说
Okay, wait, wait, wait. Okay, okay.

1480
01:49:28,629 --> 01:49:30,961
我需要那笔钱，快给我
All right. Come on, I need the money. Give me the money.

1481
01:49:31,131 --> 01:49:33,065
杰克，快把钱给我
Give me that money!

1482
01:49:33,234 --> 01:49:34,724
办不到
It's not gonna happen.

1483
01:49:35,135 --> 01:49:37,968
你要杀了我，抢我的钱？
You gonna take my own money from me?

1484
01:49:38,138 --> 01:49:41,403
这是证物，你想坐牢或回家？
That's my evidence. You wanna go to jail or go home?

1485
01:49:44,278 --> 01:49:46,178
我想回家
I wanna go home, Jake.

1486
01:49:48,048 --> 01:49:50,812
把钱给我让我回家
Give me the money, and let me go home.

1487
01:49:50,985 --> 01:49:51,883
你想回家？
You wanna go home?

1488
01:49:52,052 --> 01:49:53,519
对，让我回家
Yeah, let me go home, Jake.

1489
01:49:54,488 --> 01:49:56,649
把钱给我，让我回家
Give me the money, and let me go.

1490
01:49:58,359 --> 01:50:00,759
把钱给我，让我回家
Give me the money, and let me go home, Jake.

1491
01:50:01,762 --> 01:50:03,093
快点
That's right, come on.

1492
01:50:06,433 --> 01:50:08,663
你不配当警察
You don't deserve this.

1493
01:50:09,770 --> 01:50:11,431
好吧，小混蛋
Okay, motherfucker.

1494
01:50:16,844 --> 01:50:20,371
杰克，你走，快走吧
Jake, go and bounce, homey.

1495
01:50:20,548 --> 01:50:22,106
我们会掩护你
Get up out of here. We got your back.

1496
01:50:23,050 --> 01:50:24,312
什么？
What?

1497
01:50:24,485 --> 01:50:25,452
就是这样
-It's like that. -Oh, no, you didn't!

1498
01:50:25,653 --> 01:50:29,714
不，你不能这样，你不能这样
Wait a minute! No, you-- Hey, hey, Jake!

1499
01:50:29,890 --> 01:50:35,157
杰克…杰克…
Hey! Jake! Jake!

1500
01:50:35,329 --> 01:50:37,297
回来
Jake, come back here!

1501
01:50:38,265 --> 01:50:39,493
杰克
Jake!

1502
01:50:41,969 --> 01:50:45,405
你这个忘恩负义的臭小子
You disloyal, fool-ass, bitch-made punk.

1503
01:50:47,641 --> 01:50:49,233
我需要那笔钱
I need my money!

1504
01:50:51,912 --> 01:50:53,277
杰克
Jake!

1505
01:50:56,250 --> 01:51:01,187
你们这群混球，好吧
Oh, you motherfuckers! Okay.

1506
01:51:01,388 --> 01:51:04,789
我要把你们全都关进大牢
All right! I'm putting cases on all you bitches!

1507
01:51:04,992 --> 01:51:06,823
你们一个都别想逃
Huh? You think you can do this shit? Jake!

1508
01:51:08,395 --> 01:51:11,159
你们竟然这么对我？
You think you can do this to me?!

1509
01:51:11,699 --> 01:51:17,763
我要让你们一个个都蹲苦窑
You motherfuckers will be playing basketball in Pelican Bay when I get finished with you!

1510
01:51:18,739 --> 01:51:21,367
每天做苦工
Shoe program, nigga!

1511
01:51:21,575 --> 01:51:23,907
永远不见天日
Twenty-three hour lock-down!

1512
01:51:24,078 --> 01:51:26,273
我才是这儿的老大
I'm the man up in this piece!

1513
01:51:26,914 --> 01:51:30,008
你们最好别把我惹毛
Who you think you fucking with?!

1514
01:51:30,184 --> 01:51:34,644
我是警察老大，你们是老百姓
I'm the police! I run shit here! You just live here!

1515
01:51:35,990 --> 01:51:38,788
没错，快躲起来
That's right, you better walk away.

1516
01:51:38,959 --> 01:51:41,587
因为我要把这地方给拆了
I'm gonna burn this motherfucker down!

1517
01:51:41,962 --> 01:51:45,921
大金刚都动不了我
King Kong ain't got shit on me!

1518
01:51:57,444 --> 01:52:01,312
没关系，没办法
That's all right. That's all right.

1519
01:52:01,482 --> 01:52:04,542
管它的，反正我是赢家
Shit, I don't fuck-- I'm winning anyway. I'm winning.

1520
01:52:04,718 --> 01:52:09,678
怎么样我都赢，我不会输
I'm winning anyway. I can't lose.

1521
01:52:10,324 --> 01:52:14,693
我就像是一只打不死的蟑螂
Shit, you can shoot me, but you can't kill me.

1522
01:52:20,801 --> 01:52:22,735
今天真倒霉
Oh, what a day.

1523
01:52:23,070 --> 01:52:25,436
今天有够倒霉了
What a motherfucking day!

1524
01:55:23,083 --> 01:55:25,745
一名洛城警局缉毒组警官
An L.A. police officer was killed today...

1525
01:55:25,919 --> 01:55:29,514
今天在办案时不幸殉职
...serving a warrant near LAX.

1526
01:55:29,690 --> 01:55:32,989
警局发言人表示艾朗索警官…
An L.A.P.D. spokesperson said Officer Harris...

1527
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:36,527
留下一名妻子和四名幼子
