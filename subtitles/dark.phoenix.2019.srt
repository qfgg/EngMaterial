1
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,100
我们是谁
Who are we?

2
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,540
难道我们只能活成别人期待的模样
Are we simply what others want us to be?

3
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,960
无法逃脱既定的宿命
Are we destined to a fate beyond our control?

4
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,620
还是说  我们能够进化
Or can we evolve?

5
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,340
超越自己
Become... something more?

6
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,050
{\an8}1975年

7
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,080
你能换个频道吗
Can you change the station?

8
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,960
等这首歌放完  亲爱的
When the song's over, honey.

9
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,490
两首歌之前  你就这么说了
You said that two songs ago.

10
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,990
这首可是经典老歌
You know this is a classic, right?

11
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,200
这样吧  我答应你
Okay, how about I make you a promise?

12
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,590
等你长大  能自己开车了
When you're old enough to drive,

13
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,890
你想听什么歌都行
you can listen to whatever music you want.

14
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,880
行吗
That a deal?

15
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,510
-约翰  -不是我
- John. - Wasn't me.

16
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,560
琴  是你干的吗
Jean, was that... Did you?

17
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,800
我什么也没干
I didn't do anything.

18
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,180
-琴  你...  -我不知道  不是我
- Jean, what are you... - I... I don't know. It's not me.

19
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,460
安静
Quiet.

20
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,870
安静
Quiet.

21
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,630
安静
Quiet!

22
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,120
她连块皮都没破
She doesn't have a scratch on her.

23
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,300
也没有内伤
No internal injuries.

24
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,460
你确定她在事故车辆上吗
And you're sure she was in the car?

25
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,680
确定
Yeah.

26
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,230
那这事儿谁通知她
Who's gonna tell her?

27
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,160
谢谢
Thank you.

28
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,470
你好
Hello.

29
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,080
我爸妈呢
Where are my parents?

30
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,100
-我叫查尔斯·泽维尔  -他们死了
- My name's Charles Xavier, and... - They're dead.

31
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,200
对吗
Aren't they?

32
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,070
对  没错
Yes, they are.

33
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,180
我很抱歉  告诉你这个噩耗
And I'm very sorry to have to tell you that.

34
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,600
那我接下来会怎样
So what happens to me now?

35
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,290
我就是为此事而来
Well, that's why I'm here, actually.

36
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,790
我开了一所学校
You see, I have a school

37
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,870
专门收像你一样的孩子
that is for young people, who are like you.

38
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,340
特别之人
Special.

39
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,340
特别只是客气话  用来代称...
Special is just a nice word for...

40
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,820
怪胎  疯子
Weird? Or crazy?

41
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,510
没错
Yep.

42
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,250
没错  有时是这样
Yep, sometimes it is.

43
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,510
但有时也可以用来形容那些重要的人
Sometimes, it can be a word used to describe people who are significant.

44
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,450
了不起的人  或者...
Or amazing. Or...

45
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,780
或者是那些很棒的人
Or just... just really cool.

46
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
你有天赋  琴
You've got gifts, Jean.

47
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,200
是这样
Do you know what?

48
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,060
拿着这支笔
Take this pen, right.

49
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,850
这支笔…
It's something that...

50
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,150
你就拿着吧
Well, actually, just take it.

51
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,420
这是礼物
It's a gift.

52
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,840
你可以用这支笔画出一幅佳作
Now, you could choose to draw a really good picture with that...

53
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,600
也可以用来戳爆别人的眼睛
or you could use it to poke someone's eyes out.

54
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,530
但不管怎样  这只是一支笔
But either way, it's still just a pen.

55
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,640
只是一个礼物[天赋]It's just a gift.

56
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,170
如何使用上天赐予你的礼物[天赋]And what you choose to do with your gift,

57
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,940
完全取决于你
well, that's entirely up to you.

58
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,940
但如果你想用天赋做善事
But if you want to use it to do good stuff...

59
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,280
我能帮你
Well, I can help.

60
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,050
你和其他医生不一样
You're not like the other doctors.

61
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,710
对
No.

62
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,010
你也和其他病人不一样
And you're not like the other patients.

63
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,600
怎么样
What do you think?

64
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,890
我不能待在这儿
I can't stay here.

65
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,970
为什么
Okay. Why not?

66
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,220
这里太美好了
It's too nice.

67
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,860
我
I...

68
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,170
我总是会破坏
I break things. 

69
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,480
这样吧
Well, how does this sound:

70
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,060
如果你破坏了任何东西  我来修复
If you break something, anything, I can fix it.

71
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,370
不是一切都能修复
Not anything.

72
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,590
我能帮你
I can help you.

73
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,510
我帮你  你以后就再也不用破坏了
I can help you so that you never have to break things ever again.

74
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,150
你觉得你也能修好我
You think you can fix me too.

75
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,520
不
No.

76
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:49,200
不是那样  因为你没有毛病
No, because you are not broken.

77
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,930
十  九  八  七
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

78
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:14,900
六  五  四  三  二  一
six, five, four, three, two, one...

79
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,640
{\an8}X战警   黑凤凰

80
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,410
{\an8}1992年

81
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,610
发动机正在加速
Engines throttling up.

82
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,960
三台发动机效能达到104%
Three engines now at 104%.

83
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,180
我侦测到了异常情况
Hey, I'm... I'm picking something up here.

84
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,990
长官  六号卫星  显示异常
Ma'am, I've got something on sat six.

85
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,270
休斯顿  我们遇到麻烦了
Houston, we have a problem.

86
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,980
奋进号飞船在执行任务中遇到问题
Space Shuttle Endeavour has encountered problems on its mission.

87
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,660
-我知道你想怎样  -我才是会读心术的人
- I know what you're thinking. - That's my trick.

88
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,740
行不通  X战舰飞不了那么高
And the answer is no. The jet can't get that high.

89
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,210
加装推进火箭  经过你的改装后也不行吗
Even with the new booster rockets and all your modifications?

90
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,970
那是用来加速  而非提升高度
They're built for acceleration, not elevation, okay?

91
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,650
这不可行
Not this. No.

92
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,560
推力矢量已经失去控制
They've lost thrust vector control.

93
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,970
轨道设置失常
Trajectory settings are irregular,

94
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,420
可能是发动机长时间工作造成
likely from the constant engine burn.

95
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,750
制氧系统也已停止运行...
Oxygen generation is down...

96
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,170
喂  我是
Yes? Yes, this is he.

97
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,580
-查尔斯  -总统先生
- Charles? - Mr. President.

98
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,410
你看到新闻了吗
Are you seeing this on TV?

99
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,350
我正在看
Yes, I'm watching now.

100
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,550
汉克
Hank?

101
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,040
好
Yeah.

102
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,780
这是一次简单的救援任务
It's a simple extraction.

103
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,970
我们上太空
We go into space,

104
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,970
救出宇航员  带他们回来
we get the astronauts, we bring them home.

105
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,570
-有问题吗  -有  大概上千个
- Any questions? - Yeah, like a thousand.

106
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,910
没时间回答你上千个问题
We don't have time for a thousand.

107
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,150
我们要上太空
So we're going to space?

108
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,240
对  科特  我们要上太空
Yes, Kurt, we are going into space.

109
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,920
我们都接太空任务了  真帅
We're doing space missions now. Cool.

110
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,910
X战舰能飞那么高吗
Will the X-Jet even get that high?

111
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,880
-技术上来说...  -可以
- Well, technically, the... - It will get us there.

112
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,040
走吧
Let's go.

113
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,650
你真觉得没问题吗
Are you okay with this?

114
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,980
我有时候会忘记你可以读心
I forget sometimes you can read minds.

115
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,200
我不需要读你的心
I didn't need to read your mind.

116
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,280
都写在脸上了
It's written all over your face.

117
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,960
你说没问题就行
You tell me it's good, it's good.

118
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,150
如果出了什么状况
If anything goes wrong,

119
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,380
我会带大家立刻调头
I'll turn us around in a heartbeat.

120
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,290
我知道你会
I know you will.

121
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,800
另一艘飞船已经发射升空
A second ship has been spotted in the sky.

122
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,100
据了解  总统召集了X战警前来求援
We are being told the president has called in the aid of the X-Men.

123
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,280
航天局的各位同志们
Ladies and gentlemen of NASA,

124
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,770
我是查尔斯·泽维尔
this is the voice of Charles Xavier.

125
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,230
哪位告诉我一下最新的情况
Could somebody please apprise me of the situation?

126
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,180
我们探测到太阳耀斑
We were picking up solar flares.

127
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,810
应该是热量导致电力系统短路
We believe the heat shorted out their electricity.

128
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:42,580
他们失去了控制  通信  导航  几乎所有功能
They lost control, communication, orientation, pretty much everything.

129
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,660
指挥中心  不用担心  救援已上路
Not to worry, Mission Control. Help is on the way.

130
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,570
这没有我想象得那么好玩
I think this is not as much fun as I thought it would be.

131
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,520
那是太阳耀斑吗
That's a solar flare?

132
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,730
我从没见过这样的探测值
I've never seen a reading like this.

133
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,650
方位推进器熄火了
The orientation thruster's misfiring.

134
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,560
-船舱挺不了多久  -科特  你能进去吗
- That cabin won't hold for long. - Kurt, can you get in there?

135
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,460
转得太快  我看不清窗户里面
It's spinning too fast. I can't see inside the window.

136
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,780
斯考特  你去炸掉推进器  降低旋转速度
Scott, I need you to blast that thruster, slow down the spin.

137
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,830
科特  带上皮特  出发
Kurt, take Peter. Go!

138
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,820
暴风女  封住裂缝
Storm, seal those cracks.

139
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,730
马上回来
Be right back.

140
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,190
糟糕
Shit.

141
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,590
-系好安全带  我们回家  -等等
- Strap in, we're headed home. - Wait.

142
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,090
我们的指挥官  他不在
Our commander, he's not here.

143
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,510
他在气阀舱修推进器
He was in the airlock working on the thruster.

144
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,880
热能指数飙升
The heat signature's rising fast.

145
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,800
我撑不住了
I can't hold it any longer.

146
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,330
赶紧离开  我说了  系好安全带
We gotta get out of here. I said strap in.

147
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,090
不  瑞雯  不行  我们不能抛下任何人
No, Raven. No. We're not leaving anyone behind.

148
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,420
我不能让这个团队冒险
I am not putting this team in more danger.

149
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,180
他们的团队呢
What about their team?

150
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,990
琴能稳住那架飞船
Jean can hold that shuttle together.

151
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,240
可以吧  琴
Can't you, Jean?

152
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,260
你知道只要专注  你就无所不能
You know you can do anything you set your mind to.

153
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,800
我能稳住那架飞船  但在这里不行
I can hold the ship together but not from here.

154
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,300
-我需要进去  -热量爆表了
- I need to get inside. - The heat's spiking.

155
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,230
离耀斑爆炸不到一分钟了
We've got less than a minute till those flares hit.

156
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,770
她说她能做到
She said she can do it.

157
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,530
给你们三十秒
Thirty seconds.

158
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,110
倒计时  开始
Count it down. Go.

159
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,980
我们有二十秒
We got 20 seconds.

160
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,540
十
Ten...

161
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,370
九  八
nine, eight...

162
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,870
七  六
seven, six...

163
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,570
五
five...

164
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,660
四
four...

165
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:33,940
三
three...

166
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,970
二
two...

167
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,400
一
one.

168
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,650
琴呢  科特  她人呢
Where's Jean? Kurt, where is she?

169
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,890
-她在哪  -对不起
- Where is she? - I'm sorry!

170
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,400
做好受冲准备
Brace for impact.

171
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,920
大家
Is every...

172
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,950
大家都没事吧
Is everybody okay?

173
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,110
当然  我们都没事
Yeah, we're okay.

174
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,280
那就回家吧
So let's go home.

175
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,630
-X战警好棒  太厉害了  -好样的
- Yay, X-Men! Woo! - Yeah!

176
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,390
厉害  X战警
Yeah! X-Men!

177
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,920
好了  孩子们  可以了
That's enough, boys and girls. That's enough.

178
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:41,020
X战警今天做了一件惊天动地的大事
The X-Men have today done an incredibly brave thing.

179
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,960
再次向人类证明了他们为什么需要我们
They've once again proved to humanity exactly why they need us,

180
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,920
需要你们这样的人
people like yourselves.

181
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,070
总统发来了问候
The president sends his regards,

182
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,040
并表达了诚挚的谢意
as well as his heartfelt gratitude.

183
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,980
至于我本人  我感到前所未有的骄傲
And, as for myself, I've never been prouder.

184
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,980
大家好好放松  这是你们应得的
Enjoy yourselves. You certainly deserve it.

185
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,200
事实上  你们也是
In fact, you all do.

186
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,230
停课  今天放假
No more class, the end of the day.

187
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,070
琴
Jean?

188
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,500
你今天把我们吓坏了  你感觉怎么样
You gave us quite a scare up there. How are you feeling?

189
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,430
我感觉还挺好
Actually, I... I feel fine.

190
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,170
-汉克  -到
- Hank? - Yeah?

191
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,310
给琴做个检查
Would you take a look at Jean?

192
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,630
外勤伤员的常规体检就行
Standard medical for anyone injured in the field.

193
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,780
谢谢
Thank you.

194
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,530
总统差点就致以哀悼了
You know, the president was almost sending his condolences.

195
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,650
-她本该没命了  -幸好  她没有
- She should be dead. - Thankfully, she's not.

196
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,230
基本上都是哥的功劳
I basically did everything.

197
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,750
琴在最后也帮了一点小忙
I mean, Jean did a little, like towards the end,

198
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,090
但主要是靠哥逆转乾坤
but it was mostly all me.

199
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,250
你让我们以身犯险了  查尔斯
You put us in danger, Charles.

200
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,740
你不顾那些孩子的安危
You put those kids in danger.

201
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,420
他们已经不是孩子了  瑞雯
They're not kids anymore, Raven.

202
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,180
而且我和你一样担忧他们的安危
And I care about their safety just as much as you do.

203
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,800
你确定吗
Are you sure about that?

204
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,960
我们接的任务越来越危险了
'Cause we're taking bigger and bigger risks.

205
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,240
为了什么呢
And for what?

206
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,480
你可千万别说这是为了你的自尊心
Please, tell me it's not your ego.

207
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,930
为了上杂志封面
Being on the cover of magazines,

208
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,960
为了获总统勋章
getting a medal from the president.

209
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,900
你很享受吧
You like it, don't you?

210
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,630
不被追杀  也不被人类唾弃
As opposed to being hunted and despised?

211
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,380
我确实觉得不错
Well, you know, actually, I do.

212
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,270
不过是为了达到目的而已  瑞雯
It's all just a means to an end, Raven.

213
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,760
-什么目的  -让我们安全活着
- What end is that? - Keeping us safe.

214
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,410
你应该比谁都了解
You should understand better than anyone

215
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,370
只要稍有差池
that we're only ever one bad day away

216
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,640
我们就又会被人类仇视
from them starting to see us as the enemy again.

217
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,840
于是就让我们穿着一样的制服
So, what? We wear matching costumes

218
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,800
微笑合影  靠作秀安抚民心吗
and smile in pictures to make everyone feel safe?

219
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,940
{\an8}这只是为了相安无事的小牺牲
That is a small price to pay for keeping the peace.

220
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,690
-让我们的人舍身救他们  -对  是的
- By risking our people to save theirs? - Yes! Yes!

221
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,390
真有意思
It's funny.

222
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,720
我都记不起来你上一次冒险是什么时候了
I can't actually remember the last time you were the one risking something.

223
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,730
另外
And by the way,

224
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,290
这里一直都是女人给男人擦屁股
the women are always saving the men around here.

225
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,880
你该考虑一下把队名改成"X女战警"了
You might wanna think about changing the name to X-Women.

226
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,160
心跳脉搏  稳定有力
Your heartbeat's strong, pulse is good,

227
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,340
大脑活动也正常
brain activity is normal.

228
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,880
至于基因数据  我得再看看
The genetic reading, I'm gonna take another look at.

229
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,170
什么不可能
What can't be right?

230
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,540
你没经我允许  就对我读心了吗
Did you just read my mind without permission?

231
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,040
对不起  无心之过  你说什么不可能
Sorry, I didn't mean to, but what can't be right?

232
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,860
太空中那场不明事件  让你变强了
Whatever happened up there made you stronger.

233
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,830
我从未见过像这种能量值
You know, I've never seen a power reading like this.

234
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,600
你真的是  数据爆表了
You're-You're literally... I mean, you're off the charts.

235
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,220
这是什么意思
So what does that mean?

236
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,980
意思是
It means...

237
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,500
看来要建一个更先进的机器了
We'll have to build a better machine.

238
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,710
不过  你感觉如何
But... how do you feel?

239
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,150
我感觉挺好
I feel good.

240
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,450
那就好
Good.

241
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,110
就我看来  你没事了
Well, as far as I can tell, you're good to go.

242
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,890
-你可以上楼了  -好
- You can head upstairs. - All right.

243
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,090
多谢了  汉克
Thanks, Hank.

244
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,600
汉克说的吗
Hank said that?

245
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,580
-"数据爆表"  -是
- "Off the charts"? - He did.

246
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,740
那个蓝毛大块头  那个博士汉克吗
The big blue furry guy? The doctor? That Hank?

247
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,740
就是他  怎么了
That's the one. Why?

248
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,930
你有点害怕吗
You a little intimidated, maybe?

249
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,310
一直都是
Constantly.

250
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,160
琴  琴
Jean. Jean...

251
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,750
你确定自己没事吗
Are you... Are you sure you're okay?

252
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:19,770
我不仅没事  我还感觉棒极了
I'm better than okay. God, I feel great, I do.

253
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:26,170
怎么说呢  感觉一切都被激活了
I don't know, I feel like everything is just... turned up.

254
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,750
-不  只是  -只是什么
- No, it's just... - Just what?

255
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,060
我今天差点失去你了
I thought I lost you today.

256
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,810
我知道
I know.

257
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,440
但我回到你身边了
But I came back to you.

258
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,510
我永远都会回到你身边
I'll always come back to you.

259
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,320
是露娜在叫吗
Is that Luna?

260
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,570
大概看到松鼠而已
Probably just squirrels.

261
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,340
我去看看她  马上回来
I'm just gonna check on her. I'll be right back.

262
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,490
别走
Just stay.

263
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,890
-让她安静点  -露娜
- Tell her to shut up. - Luna!

264
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,750
露娜
Luna!

265
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,300
露娜
Luna!

266
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,830
亲爱的
Honey!

267
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,150
怎么了  怎么了  乖狗狗
What is it? What is it, honey?

268
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,370
他的笑声最蠢了
He's got the dumbest laugh.

269
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,530
不是
That's not...

270
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,620
不是那么回事
That's not how it happened.

271
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,950
-我的天啊  -那是...
- My God. - That was...

272
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,750
玛格丽特
Margaret?

273
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,460

282
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,730
再来一杯吗
One more?

283
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,650
好  我先喝完手里这杯
Yeah, I'll go ahead and finish this one.

284
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,620
再去拿两杯
Two more?

285
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,300
好
Yeah.

286
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,890
♪ 把手放入我的怀里 ♪
♪ Put your hands on me ♪

287
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,180
来点冰块
Rocks.

288
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,780
谢谢
Thanks.

289
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:00,720
-她怎么样了  -她很渴
- How is she doing? - She's... thirsty.

290
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,260
我看到了
Yeah, I see that.

291
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,120
你看着她像是没事吗
Does she seem okay to you?

292
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,650
对于刚被太阳耀斑击中的人来说
For someone who's just been hit with solar flares...

293
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,230
-我觉得她看起来挺好  -谢谢
- I'd say she's doing pretty good. - Thanks.

294
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,940
不久以前
You know, it wasn't so long ago

295
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,720
我们也这样在派对上狂欢
we were throwing parties like this.

296
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,610
现在只剩下我们
Now we're the only ones left.

297
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,010
是啊  原班人马就只剩我们了
Yeah. Last of the first class.

298
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,250
我一直在考虑
I've been thinking.

299
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:31,350
我们也许该离开了
Maybe it's time for us to... move on.

300
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,530
什么意思  离开去哪儿
What do you... Move on where?

301
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:36,880
我也不知道  只是查尔斯
I don't know. It's just Charles.

302
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,240
你们之间不管发生什么  总会过去
Whatever is going on between you two, it will blow over.

303
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,370
不  不会
No, it won't.

304
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,380
我爱他  但他变了
I love him, but he's different.

305
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,920
现在一切都变了
Everything is... it's different now.

306
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,320
是啊
Yeah.

307
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:51,520
我们改变世界  才能得以生活
We changed the world so we could live in it.

308
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,860
也许我们该去过自己的生活
Yeah, but maybe that's what we should go do.

309
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,480
但这就是我们追求的人生
Yeah, but this is our life. This is what we wanted.

310
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,290
-不是这样的人生  -瑞雯
- Not like this. - Raven...

311
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:02,460
这不是我们的人生  汉克  是他的人生
It's not our life, Hank. It's his.

312
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,440
不然你以为X战警里的"X"代表着什么
What do you think the "X" in X-Men stands for?

313
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:11,310
危急时刻  总是查尔斯和他的X战警逆转乾坤
Charles and his X-Men are where we turn when facing our worst fears.

314
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,160
谢谢你  总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

315
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,400
谢谢你
Thank you.

316
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,810
我不过是创造了一个世界
All I've really done is create a world

317
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:29,420
使孩子们能够平和而骄傲地接受自己的与众不同
in which children can find peace and pride in being different.

318
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:34,230
我知道有些人会称我们为"超级英雄"
Now, I know that some of you choose to call us "Superheroes."

319
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,310
我得承认  我真不知道这个词是什么意思
I must confess, I don't really know what that word means,

320
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,890
但总比你们过去对我们的称呼好听多了
but it is a damn sight better than what you used to call us.

321
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,150
-来一起跳个舞吧  -你想要跳舞
- Come dance with me. - You wanna dance?

322
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,530
来吧  斯考特
Come on, Scott.

323
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:52,060
你有听到那些孩子们怎么称呼你吗
Did... Did you hear what the kids are calling you?

324
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,480
-是好话吗  -是
- Do I wanna know? - Yeah.

325
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,950
凤凰
Phoenix.

326
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,440
很棒吧  一种浴火重生的鸟
It's cool, right? You know, a bird that rises from the dead.

327
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,890
你还好吧  不然我们休息下
You okay? Hey, maybe we should take a break.

328
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,630
琴
Jean.

329
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,460
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait.

330
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,130
不  停下  停下  停下
No, stop, stop, stop, stop.

331
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,050
{\an8}异常

332
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,930
琴
It's Jean.

333
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,450
琴  琴  求你了
Jean. Jean, please.

334
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,100
停下  停下  停下
Stop, stop, stop.

335
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,340
停下  停下  停下
Stop, stop, stop!

336
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,920
-谢谢你  -谢谢你  查尔斯
- Thank you. - Thank you, Charles.

337
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,640
抱歉各位  我得先行告辞了
I'm terribly sorry, everyone, but I'm going to have to leave.

338
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,760
非常感谢你们
Thank you very, very much.

339
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,910
怎么样  你看到什么了
What is it? What do you see?

340
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,110
我什么都看不到
Nothing.

341
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,490
她的变异太过强大
Her mutation has grown too powerful.

342
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,960
这是我第一次无法看到她的思想
For the first time, I can't penetrate her mind.

343
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,940
所以才来这里吗
So that's what we're doing down here?

344
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,620
汉克造出了脑波增幅器来增强我的异能
Hank built Cerebro to amplify my power.

345
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,520
现在只能这样进入她的大脑
I think that's the only way I'm going to get inside her head now.

346
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,510
汉克  能请你再增强一点吗
Hank, could you turn it up, please?

347
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,140
再增强一点  谢了
A little more. Thank you.

348
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,830
她在那儿
There she is.

349
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,930
-没错  -很好吃吧
- Yes, it is. - Isn't that yummy?

350
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,920
这是正常显示吗
Is it supposed to look like this?

351
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,550
心灵意识本就是脆弱之物
The mind of a psychic is a fragile thing.

352
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,320
只需轻触
It takes only the slightest tap

353
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,080
就足以带入歧途
to tip it in the wrong direction.

354
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,910
她小时候  我必须修改她的记忆
I had to make adjustments to her mind when she was young.

355
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,050
什么样的修改
What kind of adjustments?

356
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,000
就像搭建脚手架
Scaffolding.

357
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,940
更像是筑墙  隔绝所有心理上的创伤
Walls, rather, to keep out all the trauma.

358
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,590
查尔斯  你到底对她做了什么
What did you do to her, Charles?

359
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,920
我救了她
I saved her.

360
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,060
太空中那场不明事故  对她造成了影响
I think that whatever happened in space did something to her.

361
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:09,560
这个过程中  我筑起的墙垒渐渐倒塌
In the process, those walls that I erected are being torn down.

362
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,390
安静
Quiet!

363
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,410
那是什么
What is that?

364
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:21,250
那是我不愿让她忆起的伤痛
That... is what I was trying to save her from.

365
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,100
单人桌  老样子
Table for one. My usual.

366
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,550
谁在说话
What is that voice?

367
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,180
-不  -查尔斯
- No... - Charles?

368
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,860
查尔斯
Charles?

369
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,760
她要醒过来了
She's waking up.

370
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,620
琴
Jean?

371
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,450
琴  不要害怕  只是我而已
Jean, don't be afraid. It's only me.

372
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,920
你要保持镇定
I want you to remain calm,

373
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,080
专心听我的声音
and I'd like you to focus on my voice.

374
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,220
滚出我的大脑
Get out of my head.

375
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,240
琴  冷静点
Just stay calm, Jean.

376
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,950
她在反抗我  帮我增强
She's fighting me. I need you to turn it up.

377
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,260
我听见我父亲声音了
I heard my father.

378
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,330
-他还活着  -你听错了
- He's alive. - You're just hearing things.

379
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,690
琴  你的大脑需要休息
Jean, your mind, it needs rest.

380
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,590
你
You're...

381
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,580
你骗我
You're lying to me.

382
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,770
我能感受到
I can sense it.

383
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,160
增强
Turn it up.

384
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,770
-不行  已经太强了  -别增强  汉克
- No, it's too much already. - Don't do it, Hank.

385
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,410
-汉克  -不  我不会这么做
- Hank. - No, I won't do it.

386
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,480
天呐  查尔斯
For God's sake, Charles!

387
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,640
滚出我的大脑
Get out of my head!

388
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,900
查尔斯
Charles!

389
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,740
-查尔斯  -查尔斯
- Charles! - Charles!

390
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,130
琴  你
Jean! Are you...

391
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,500
你还好吗
Are you okay?

392
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,590
发生什么了  我们之前在外面  然后
What happened? We were outside, and then...

393
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,970
你出了意外  然后昏过去了
You had an accident. You blacked out.

394
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:57,510
我让你受伤了吗
Did I... Did I do... do that?

395
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,730
没关系
It's fine.

396
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,470
-有关系  -只是个意外
- No, it's not fine. - It was an accident.

397
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,370
我不知道自己怎么了
I don't know what's happening to me.

398
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,760
我无法控制  我不能待在这里  斯考特
I can't control it. I can't stay here, Scott.

399
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:08,660
我真得必须离开了
I really, I need to go.

400
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,410
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

401
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,520
-你要去哪儿  -我要去见
- Where are you going? - I need to see...

402
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,880
我要去见我父亲
I need to see my father.

403
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,770
-你父亲他  -他还活着  我听见他了
- Your fa... Your father's... - He's alive. I can hear him.

404
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,000
他在那场车祸中丧生了  还记得吗
He died in the crash, remember?

405
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,570
斯考特  抱歉  我必须走了
I'm sorry, Scott. I need to go.

406
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,770
-等等  -你就让我走吧
- Hang on, hang on, hang on. - God, please let me go.

407
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:24,410
-求你了  -你冷静一下
- Please. - Slow down, please.

408
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:27,340
这种力量来袭时  我无法控制  无法停下
I can't control it when it comes. I can't stop it.

409
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,760
到时可能又会伤到你
Okay? I could hurt you again.

410
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,390
我自愿承担后果
I'll take that chance.

411
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,930
我知道
I know.

412
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,170
我知道
I know.

413
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,770
但是我不愿意
But I won't.

414
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,100
-他没事吗  -我没事
- Is he gonna be all right? - I'm gonna be fine.

415
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,960
-不  他有事  -我不会有事
- No, he's not fine. - I'm going to be fine.

416
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,970
你看到了什么
What did you see?

417
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:05,000
她充满了欲望
She's all desire.

418
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:08,860
还有狂怒和痛苦
All rage, all pain.

419
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,300
所有情绪一同爆发
And it's all coming out at once.

420
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,450
瑞雯  她身上出问题了
Something's happening to her, Raven.

421
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:19,100
她变了
She's changing.

422
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,130
变成什么
Into what?

423
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,660
我不知道
I don't know.

424
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,310
琴不见了  她走了
Jean's gone. She left.

425
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,160
-去哪儿了  -我不知道
- Gone where? - I don't know.

426
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,120
查尔斯  你可以用意念来追踪她
Charles, you can track her with your mind.

427
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,660
没法再追踪了
Not anymore.

428
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:35,150
她现在太强大  我也无能为力了
She's grown too powerful, even for me.

429
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,200
她说她要去见她父亲
She said she was going to see her father.

430
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,580
这根本说不通吧
That doesn't make any sense, right?

431
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,120
准备一下飞机  我们去把她带回家
Prepare the jet. We're going to bring her home.

432
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,650
"我们"  查尔斯  你现在状态不行
"We"? Charles, you're in no condition.

433
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,200
我必须阻止她  她会发现...
I have to stop this. She's going to find...

434
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,090
她去那里  不会有好结果
She's going to find nothing good there.

435
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:10,250
德巴里帝国就剩这些人了吗
So this is all that's left of the D'Bari Empire?

436
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,300
你好  武克
Greetings, Vuk.

437
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,420
你掌握地球人的语言了吗
Have you learned their language?

438
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,870
小菜一碟
With ease.

439
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,480
你有什么发现
What have you learned?

440
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:25,590
那股力量蕴藏在他们中一人体内
The power is being contained inside one of them.

441
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,420
-竟然是个原始物种  -她比较厉害
- This primitive species? - She's stronger.

442
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,290
她是一个变种人
A mutant.

443
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,400
她对此还毫不知情
She has no idea what's happening to her.

444
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,690
我可以利用这一点
I can use that.

445
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,850
如果我们可以控制这股力量
If we can control that power...

446
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,040
就可以复活我们的种族了
we can resurrect our race.

447
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,500
东山再起
Begin again.

448
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,080
统治这里
Here.

449
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,510
她在哪儿
Where is she?

450
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,540
你有什么事吗
Can I help you?

451
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,610
爸
Dad?

452
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,150
琴
Jean.

453
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,390
你怎么知道要去哪里  查尔斯
How do you know where we're going, Charles?

454
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:58,510
如果你没法追踪她  怎么知道她在哪儿
If you can't track her, how do you know where she is?

455
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,350
你明知故问
You know how.

456
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,870
天呐
Jesus Christ.

457
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,630
你对她做了什么
What did you do?

458
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,550
我那是保护她
I protected her.

459
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,160
向她隐瞒真相
From the truth.

460
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,440
说得这么冠冕堂皇
There's another word for that.

461
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,740
他跟我说  你死了
He told me you were dead.

462
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,950
我从没想过会回来这里
I never thought I'd be back here.

463
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,370
家里还是跟以前一样
It's the same.

464
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,840
一点没变
All of it.

465
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:43,820
你想吃点什么  喝点什么吗
Can I get you something to drink or-or eat?

466
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,760
不用  我...
No, I'm good. I'm...

467
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,750
不用招待我了
I'm really good.

468
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,150
见到你真好
It's so good to see you.

469
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,670
我去给你倒杯水
I'll get you some water, okay?

470
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,580
安静
Quiet.

471
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,770
琴
Jean?

472
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,460
这些照片里  一张都没有我
All these photos, none of me.

473
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,430
你从没找过我
You never looked for me.

474
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,030
-琴  -你为什么不来找我
- Jean... - Why didn't you look for me?

475
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,840
还是坐下来说吧
Maybe we should sit down.

476
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,420
不  我不要坐下
No, I don't wanna sit down.

477
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,650
你当年为什么没来找我
Why didn't you come looking for me?

478
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,920
别想骗我  我会读心术
And don't try to lie. I can read your mind.

479
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,920
我没法抚养她
I can't handle her.

480
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,390
我都不知道她是什么
I don't even know what she is.

481
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,270
我知道
I do.

482
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,580
你会带走她
Then you'll take her?

483
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,790
你都没跟我告别
You didn't even say goodbye.

484
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,030
我当年也没机会跟你妈告别
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to your mother.

485
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,890
我当时才八岁
I was eight years old.

486
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,840
你怎么能这样对我
How could you do that to me?

487
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,480
你想读我的大脑吗
You wanna come in?

488
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,840
那就好好看看吧
Come all the way in.

489
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:56,590
别忘了你的所为
Don't forget what you did.

490
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,110
我不知道  不是我
I don't know. It's not me.

491
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,090
安静
Quiet!

492
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,970
不  不
No. No.

493
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,190
抱歉  琴
I'm sorry, Jean...

494
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,710
我的世界在那一天崩塌了
but my whole world died that day.

495
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:36,100
我也当你死了
And... you went with it.

496
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,930
琴  别这样
Jean, don't, please.

497
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,260
住手
Stop that.

498
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,330
住手
Stop it.

499
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,840
不是我  是他们
It's not me. It's them.

500
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,380
你们不该过来
You shouldn't have come here.

501
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,410
怎么这么说  我们只是来带你回家  琴
Why is that? We've only come to bring you home, Jean.

502
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:20,710
我没有家了  都是拜你所赐
I don't have a home. You made sure of that.

503
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,800
你父亲当时没法抚养你
Look, your father couldn't handle you,

504
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,570
我们收留了你
and we took you in.

505
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,080
你跟我说  我父亲死了
You told me my father was dead,

506
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,050
然后利用我的异能为你效劳
and you used me for my powers.

507
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,720
不是那样  事实并非如此
No, that's just not true. That's not what happened.

508
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,450
琴  我们能帮你
Jean, we can help you.

509
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:35,520
我能帮你  但你得听我的话
I can help you, but you have to listen to me.

510
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,500
不  我才不要
No. No, I don't.

511
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,610
斯考特
Scott.

512
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,170
他骗了我  斯考特  欺瞒了我一切
He lied to me, Scott. About everything.

513
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,080
我们一起想办法  回到我身边
We'll figure everything out together. Just come back to me.

514
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,320
你说过  你会永远回到我身边  记得吗
Remember, you said you'd always come back to me.

515
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,210
回到我身边吧
Come back to me.

516
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,840
琴
Jean.

517
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,180
别过来  都别过来
Stay away from me. Stay away from me.

518
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,940
别过来
Stay away from me!

519
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,190
-立刻阻止她  -查尔斯  等一下
- Stop her quickly! - Charles, wait, wait!

520
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,990
琴  别这样
Jean, please!

521
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,360
琴  住手
Jean, stop!

522
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,830
-我瞄准了  可以...  -别开枪
- I've got the shot. I'm taking... - No, you're not.

523
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,470
抱歉  汉克  我想让瑞雯劝服她
I'm sorry, Hank. I want Raven to have a chance.

524
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,440
我让你别靠近了
I told you to stay away.

525
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,140
我做不到
That's never gonna happen.

526
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,880
你别再过来了
Please. Stop.

527
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,040
我必须先确保你没事
Not until I know you're gonna be okay.

528
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:28,180
我身上出问题了
Something's happening to me.

529
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,160
那就回家
So come home.

530
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,180
我们来治愈你
Let me take care of you.

531
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,760
你做不到
No, you can't.

532
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,570
你不行  你不懂
You can't. You don't...

533
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,210
你不懂这种感觉
You don't know what it's like.

534
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,380
那就告诉我
Then tell me.

535
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,570
这种力量来袭时
When it comes...

536
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,340
身边的人会受伤
people get hurt.

537
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,170
我不怕你  琴
I'm not afraid of you, Jean.

538
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,390
看着我
Look at me.

539
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,280
专心听我的声音
Focus on my voice.

540
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:59,430
我们会一起度过这个难关
We're going to get through this together.

541
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,210
我不会放弃你  琴
I'm not giving up on you, Jean.

542
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:04,350
家人之间就是这样  彼此扶持
This is what family does. We take care of each other.

543
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,420
你是我的亲人  琴
You're my family, Jean.

544
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,700
不管发生任何事
No matter what.

545
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,060
别再说了
Stop!

546
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:55,380
-瑞雯  -我喘不过气
- Raven... - I can't catch my breath.

547
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,660
不
No.

548
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:01,880
我爱你
I love you.

549
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,930
什么
What?

550
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:09,990
我
I...

551
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,090
瑞雯  别死
Raven, please.

552
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,620
瑞雯
Raven.

553
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:26,550
瑞雯  我爱你  瑞雯
Raven. I love you, Raven.

554
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,290
不
No.

555
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:33,930
不
No.

556
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:05,480
人这一生  就是我与我周旋  都身处战场
We are all at war, at war with ourselves,

557
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:09,740
而瑞雯这一生都在和自己对弈
and Raven had been waging that war for most of her life.

558
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,320
愿她安息
I hope now she's found peace.

559
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,800
瑞雯到死都如此重情义
Raven died doing what she did best...

560
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,570
她死于帮助一个困境中的朋友
helping a friend, a friend in need.

561
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:26,770
她没有离开
She is not gone.

562
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:30,790
她的精神永在  通过我
She lives on, through me,

563
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,710
我们
through us...

564
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,850
以及X战警传承下去
and through the spirit of the X-Men.

565
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:47,560
这是真的吗
Is it true?

566
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:49,420
琴杀了她
Jean killed her?

567
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,490
她当时不是自己了
She didn't know what she was doing.

568
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,360
琴失控了
Jean lost control.

569
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,590
但她还是琴
But she-she's still Jean.

570
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:09,350
她还是我们的朋友
She's still our friend.

571
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,200
我们还是可以帮她  找到她
We can still help her. We can find her.

572
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:14,450
带她回家
And bring her home.

573
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:20,410
我们一定要这么做
That's... That's what we're gonna do, okay?

574
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:34,670
那不是意外  斯考特
It wasn't an accident, Scott.

575
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,670
她杀了瑞雯
She killed Raven.

576
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:40,600
即使你无法对自己  对孩子们承认这一点
Maybe you can't admit that to yourself or to them,

577
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,380
但事实就是如此
but it's the truth.

578
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,120
那不是琴  不是我认识的琴
That was not Jean, not the Jean I know.

579
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:54,070
有时  你想要相信别人不是那样
Sometimes you want to believe people are something that they are not.

580
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:58,050
然而  等你觉悟时
And then, by the time you realize who they are...

581
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,200
一切都太迟了
it's too late.

582
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:30,620
我和瑞雯就是在这里相识
Do you know, this is where I first met Raven.

583
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,690
她当时还是个孩子
She was just this little girl, and...

584
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:41,700
她偷闯进来  找东西吃
she'd broken in, looking for food.

585
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:43,780
我跟她说可以留下
I said she could stay,

586
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,690
这样她就不用再挨饿了
and that she'd never have to go hungry again.

587
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,040
我还承诺让她过上好日子
And then, I think I promised her a better life.

588
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:54,540
结果你把她害死了
And then you took it from her.

589
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:57,570
-你说什么  -你听到了
- I beg your pardon? - You heard me.

590
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:01,080
-汉克  -这都怪你  查尔斯
- Hank... - This is your fault, Charles.

591
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,170
她死了  都怪你
It's your fault she's dead.

592
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:05,270
你别不讲理
Come on, that's not fair. 

593
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:07,040
讲理  别跟我来这一套
Fair? No, don't talk about fair.

594
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,030
你篡改了一个八岁小女孩的记忆
You messed with the mind of an eight-year-old girl.

595
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,400
你把所有痛苦与愤怒都埋藏起来
You pushed down all that pain and anger...

596
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,570
你觉得那些压抑的情感会去哪儿
Where do you think it's gonna go?

597
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:12,460
我那样是为了她好
I did that to help her. 

598
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,350
-我做的一切都是为了孩子们  -行了  别狡辩了
- What I do, I do to help all of them. - Please, come on, please.

599
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:18,030
-你还是看不清自己的错  -就是...
- You still can't see what you did wrong? - It's just...

600
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:20,650
你得面对现实  查尔斯  面对自己的错
No, you need to face this, Charles! You need to face it.

601
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,390
你就承认吧  承认错误吧
Come on, admit it to me right now. Come on!

602
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,510
承认你错了
Admit it!

603
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,780
查尔斯  求你就认错吧
Charles, just admit you were wrong, please.

604
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:33,580
你还是无法认错
You still can't.

605
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,640
希望这会让你好过些  汉克
I really hope you feel better, Hank.

606
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:40,720
我刚安葬了自己的养妹
I hope that railing on me five minutes

607
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,710
你就朝我发泄  借此能让你好过...
after I put my foster sister in the grave has made you feel...

608
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:44,280
我不是为了自己发泄
This isn't about me.

609
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,340
我肯认错  查尔斯
You, know what? I know what I did wrong, okay, Charles?

610
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,150
她本打算离开
She was gonna leave. 

611
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,560
瑞雯本来想离开  我说服她留下了
Raven was gonna leave, and I talked her out of it.

612
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:55,820
她看清了一件我们都没看清的事
She saw what the rest of us didn't.

613
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,280
什么事
And what was that?

614
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,110
我们一直以来都在保护孩子们不受外界伤害
This whole time, we've been trying to protect these kids from the world,

615
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:04,950
但其实  孩子们真正应该远离的人是你
when really, we should've been protecting them from you.

616
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,650
我到底是怎么了
I don't know what's happening to me.

617
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:18,720
为什么
Why?

618
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,450
我为什么会这么做
Why did I do that?

619
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,380
-平民不许...  -联调局
- No civilians past this... - FBI.

620
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:02,470
你们先出去
Give us the room.

621
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:14,430
你们是什么人
And who are you supposed to be?

622
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:20,160
我们是来帮你的人  葛雷先生
We're the ones who are going to help you, Mr. Grey.

623
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:25,090
我不知道她会回来
I didn't know she was gonna come back.

624
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,860
我很抱歉搞成这样
I'm sorry for all this.

625
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:31,180
没事
It's okay.

626
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:40,310
我们就是想了解一下琴到底是个怎样的人
We just wanna get an accurate picture of who Jean is.

627
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:42,840
说说看  你何时把她交给了变种人
Tell us about when you gave her to the mutant.

628
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,990
我还是
Maybe...

629
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:56,310
还是跟律师谈一下吧
it might be better if I talk to a lawyer.

630
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:02,600
很抱歉  葛雷先生
I'm so sorry, Mr. Grey,

631
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:05,310
我要立刻了解她的一切
but I need to know everything about her now.

632
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:10,940
事情发展到这一步  实属遗憾
This truly is an unfortunate development.

633
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,740
这话是什么意思
Why-Why is that?

634
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:17,930
因为你不惨叫  我才能更好地理解你的话 
Because it's so much easier to understand your language when you're not screaming.

635
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,060
来者何人
Who are you?

636
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,450
有何目的
What are you doing here?

637
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:15,990
回答我
Answer the question.

638
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,080
你退下
Leave her.

639
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:32,900
你怎么来了
Why are you here?

640
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:44,250
你受伤了吗
Are you hurt?

641
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:46,500
没有
No.

642
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,340
你别见怪
You'll have to forgive them.

643
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:52,570
他们不太喜欢不速之客
They're not accustomed to uninvited guests.

644
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:55,860
请
Please.

645
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:08,100
从头说起吧
Why don't you start at the beginning?

646
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:13,290
那是谁的血
Whose blood is that?

647
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,260
-什么  -你衬衫上
- What? - On your shirt.

648
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,630
是谁的血
Whose blood is it?

649
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,900
我不是查尔斯
Look, I'm not Charles.

650
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,920
我不会读心术
I can't read your mind.

651
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:34,730
你伤人无数
You hurt people.

652
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,880
-那都是以前的事了  -但你确实如此
- It's been a while. - But you did.

653
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,190
是  你为什么来问我这件事
Yes. What did you come here to ask me?

654
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,200
你是怎么停手了
How did you stop?

655
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,510
我这一生都活在仇恨之中
I've lived with vengeance my whole life.

656
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:57,440
我从小起
Ever since I was a child, 

657
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:02,110
就慢慢失去了所有亲人挚爱
I... lost everyone I ever loved, so...

658
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,890
我伤人
I hurt people.

659
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:06,700
杀人
Yes, killed people.

660
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,470
我以为杀死那些人  就能平复伤痛
Killed whatever I thought would make the pain go away.

661
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:15,380
但没有
It didn't,

662
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,940
不管我送多少人去见阎王  都无法平复
no matter how many souls I sent under...

663
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,110
于是我收手了
so I stopped.

664
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,300
我不知道怎么收手
I don't know how to stop.

665
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:30,420
我不知道自己到底怎么了
I don't know what's happening to me.

666
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:39,010
我失控时
When I lose control...

667
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:44,340
就会出事  伤及他人
things happen, bad things...

668
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,650
伤害所爱之人
to people I love.

669
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,040
那是谁的血
Whose blood is that?

670
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:01,340
这不正是你此行目的吗
Isn't that why you came here?

671
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,510
-你想让我怎么帮你  -我说不清
- What do you think I can do for you? - I don't know!

672
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:06,010
你可以  那是谁的血
Yes, you do. Whose blood is that?

673
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:07,540
-我不想说  -你伤人了吗
- I don't wanna talk about it. - Did you hurt someone?

674
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,180
-拜托  我  -回我我  琴
- Please, I... - Answer the question, Jean.

675
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,380
-别追问了  埃里克  你激怒我了  -很好
- Stop, Erik, you're making me angry. - Good!

676
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:12,640
我就是想激怒你
I want you to be angry.

677
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,570
-我要看看有什么后果  琴  -我不想伤到你
- Show me what happens, Jean. - I don't wanna hurt you!

678
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:16,000
我要看看激怒你的后果是什么
What happens when you're angry? Show me.

679
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,820
-让我看看  -别说了
- Show me what... - Stop!

680
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:20,310
军方来人了
We've got military.

681
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:22,240
就要降落了
Inbound.

682
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,370
待在这里
Stay here.

683
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:32,990
两架美军直升机
Two birds. US.

684
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:35,030
让大家冷静  但做好防备
Tell everyone to stay calm, but ready.

685
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,920
好  别再靠近了
All right, that's far enough.

686
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:18,670
我们有权待在此地
We have a legal right to be here.

687
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:22,100
政府将这里授权于我们
This land was given to us by the US government.

688
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:24,320
我们无意收回授权
We have no intention of taking it back.

689
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,110
我们不是来找你
We're not here for you.

690
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,990
我们来找一位X战警  琴·葛雷
We're looking for one of the X-Men. Jean Grey.

691
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:31,040
我很久没见过她了
I haven't seen her in a long time.

692
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,690
那你不介意我们四处看一下吧
Then you won't mind if we look around.

693
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:35,470
我没有家了  都是拜你所措
I don't have a home. You made sure of that.

694
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:37,640
如果我不打招呼  就闯入你家
Would you mind if I came to your home...

695
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,930
{\an8}家人之间就该这样
This is what family does.

696
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,100
你介不介意呢
unannounced and uninvited?

697
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,170
你是我的亲人  琴
You're my family, Jean.

698
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,720
是这样
Look...

699
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:45,470
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

700
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,950
-我不想挑事  -最好别挑事
- I don't wanna fight. - No, you don't.

701
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,170
那你就让开
Then step aside.

702
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,880
我们和你  你家人  享有一样的权利
We have the same rights as you and your family.

703
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:57,890
我说过了  我们不是来找你
And like I said, we're not here for you.

704
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,240
我们是来找那个放弃这些权利的女子
We're here for a girl who gave up those rights

705
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,950
她伤了一队警员
when she attacked a squad of police officers.

706
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,620
那些警察也有家人
They have families, too.

707
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,350
看来你还不知情
Guess you didn't hear about that.

708
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,670
我们这里看不到新闻  上尉
We don't get the news out here, Captain.

709
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,890
住手
Stop that.

710
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,050
我让你住手
I said stop that right now!

711
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:26,900
-不是我  -是我
- It's not me. - It's me.

712
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:29,690
琴
Jean?

713
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:33,930
琴
Jean!

714
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,290
趴下
Get down!

715
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:22,080
赶紧上直升机离开
Get in the chopper and go!

716
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,550
我撑不了多久
I can't hold it!

717
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,340
撤退  撤退
Fall back! Fall back!

718
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:29,130
快走  快撤退
Let's go, move, move!

719
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,040
快走  撤离  快离开
Let's go! Hook in! Move it! Come on!

720
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,080
-快走  快走  -走
- Let's go, let's go, let's go! - Come on!

721
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,050
把手给我  拉我一把
Give me your hand. Help me!

722
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,350
你走
Go!

723
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,290
-离开这里  -我需要你的帮助
- Leave this place! - I need your help.

724
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:02,200
你不是保护这里的变种人吗
I thought you protected mutants here.

725
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,350
我确实保护他们  不受你的伤害
I am protecting them... from you.

726
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,540
你赶紧走
You need to leave.

727
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,570
走
Go!

728
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:29,110
今晚最新消息
Word coming late tonight that 

729
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:32,670
国会正考虑设立变种人临时拘留所
Congress is considering temporary mutant internment facilities

730
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:34,460
用来关押那些
for those whose powers have been deemed

731
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:37,230
其异能会伤害民众的变种人
a clear and present danger to human citizens.

732
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:40,440
这是官方应对"琴·葛雷事件"之策
This coming on the heels of the Jean Grey incidents

733
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,510
她毁坏了两处住宅区
which, after destroying two communities,

734
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:45,560
袭击了警察与军方人员
and attacking police and military personnel...

735
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,580
我是查尔斯·泽维尔
This is Charles Xavier.

736
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:03,300
我要和总统通话
I'd like to talk to the president.

737
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:07,010
泽维尔先生  本线路已作废
Mr. Xavier, this phone will no longer be operational.

738
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,780
我得告诉他  别这么做
I have to tell him not to do this.

739
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,820
没必要将我们的成果都付之一炬
There's no need to throw away everything that we've accomplished.

740
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,630
要给我们机会...
You have to give us a chance and...

741
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:28,570
如果你破坏了任何东西
If you break something, anything,

742
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:30,040
我来修复
I can fix it.

743
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:31,610
不是一切都能修复
Not anything.

744
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:37,900
官方正在对葛雷进行国际搜捕
An international search is underway for Grey.

745
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,830
政府呼吁市民避免与其接触
Authorities are urging citizens to keep their distance.

746
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,970
见到她的踪迹  要立刻报警
Any sighting should be reported to the police immediately.

747
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,690
政府官员已经...
Government officials have...

748
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:47,260
这个人被电死了
This man was electrocuted...

749
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,930
你就这点本事吗
Is that all you got?

750
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,020
再来一杯
Give me another.

751
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:16,940
你好  琴
Hello, Jean.

752
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:26,920
你没法控制我的心智
You can't control my mind like theirs.

753
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,290
我跟他们不一样
I'm not like them.

754
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,850
我也来一杯这个酒
Same, please.

755
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:36,030
你是怎么找到我的
How did you find me?

756
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,750
我在政府里有关系
Let's just say I have friends in high places.

757
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:43,340
你是谁
Who are you?

758
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:45,950
更应该问的是
The better question is...

759
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,820
你是谁
who are you?

760
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:51,710
你是那个对轮椅男言听计从的惊慌小女孩
Are you a scared little girl who answers to a man in a chair...

761
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:55,500
还是这个星球上最强大的存在者
or are you the most powerful creature on the planet?

762
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:01,120
我不清楚自己是谁
I don't know who I am.

763
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:02,570
你清楚
Yes, you do.

764
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:06,480
你是个众叛亲离的女子
You're the girl who everyone abandons.

765
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,060
也许是我活该被离弃
Maybe they had good reason.

766
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,490
因为你体内的力量吗
Because of what's inside you?

767
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:21,590
你畏惧是因为你觉得这种力量滋生邪恶
You're afraid of it because you think it makes you bad, evil,

768
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:25,600
你一直以来都被管束  做乖乖女
all the words you've been taught to keep you in line.

769
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:31,440
这些教导都是远古时代  思维受限的男人们所创
Words created a very long time ago by men with very little minds.

770
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:34,590
他们无法理解你这种强大的存在
They can't begin to comprehend what you are.

771
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:36,470
你的X战警队友也无法理解
Even your X-Men.

772
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,530
你能理解吗
And you can?

773
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:42,660
查尔斯
Charles?

774
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:46,800
查尔斯  查尔斯
Charles? Charles!

775
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:49,760
-汉克不在班上  -什么
- Hey, Hank's not in class. - What?

776
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,400
汉克没去教课
Hank's not in class.

777
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:54,160
你去他宿舍看过了吗
Did you check his quarters?

778
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,850
看过了  也没人
Yeah, he's not there either.

779
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:13,570
其他人呢
Where are the rest of them?

780
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:15,460
我一人前来
No, I'm alone.

781
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,240
查尔斯没跟来吗
What, no Charles?

782
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,510
如果你来找琴
If you're looking for Jean...

783
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,490
她走了
she's gone. 

784
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,770
我知道
No, I know that.

785
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,090
那你为何事而来  汉克
Then why are you here, Hank?

786
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:31,190
你耳目遍及天下
You have eyes and ears around the world

787
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:33,190
能帮你找到变种人
to help you find mutants for this place.

788
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:36,260
我想让你帮我找到琴
I want you to help me find Jean.

789
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:38,310
我何必找她
I've no reason to find her.

790
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:39,770
不是为了我
Not for me.

791
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:41,930
为了瑞雯
Do it for Raven.

792
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:44,690
她派你过来的吗
Did she send you?

793
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:48,250
你还不知情
You don't know?

794
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:53,500
知道什么  汉克
Know what, Hank?

795
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,080
瑞雯死了
Raven's dead.

796
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,720
琴杀了她
Jean killed her.

797
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,790
你得帮我找到琴
I need you to help me find Jean.

798
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,780
我找到她  我会杀了她
If I find her, I'll kill her.

799
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:34,580
我知道
I know.

800
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:53,960
他们知道我是谁
They know who I am?

801
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,110
对
Yes.

802
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,600
他们不怕我
And they're not afraid of me?

803
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:05,220
这里只有你才惧怕自己的异能
The only person here afraid of your power... is you.

804
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:21,360
召集其他人
Go, gather the others.

805
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:26,200
如果她控制不了  就将其毁掉
If she can't control it, then we will destroy it.

806
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:34,490
这就是你要给我看的吗
This is what you wanted to show me?

807
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:35,980
不是
No.

808
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:39,110
这才是我要给你看的景象
This is what I want to show you.

809
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,380
太空中进入你体内的不是太阳耀斑
What entered you in space was not a solar flare.

810
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,080
而这也不是一场意外
And it was not an accident.

811
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:05,720
这种力量被你吸引
It was drawn to you.

812
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,900
是什么东西
What-What was it?

813
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:12,560
一种威力无比纯粹的宇宙能量
A pure and unimaginably powerful cosmic force.

814
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:15,810
我们看到这种力量进入你的体内
We saw it enter you in space.

815
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:20,270
我们当时追随这种力量  亲眼所见  琴
We were there, Jean, following that force.

816
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,240
为什么
Why?

817
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:25,620
因为这是激活宇宙万物的生命火花
Because it's the spark that gave life to the universe...

818
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:28,980
那股烈焰摧毁了我的星球
and the flame that consumed my world.

819
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:36,910
族人中的幸存者一直追寻这种力量
What remains of my people searched the stars for that power, 

820
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:38,140
想要控制这种力量
to control it,

821
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:41,460
但这种力量所到之处  尽是毁灭
but it destroyed everything it ever came into contact with.

822
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:43,410
直到遇见你
Until you.

823
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,880
为什么是我
Why me?

824
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:50,050
因为你不知道自己多么强大
Because you're stronger than you know.

825
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:53,560
因为你天赋异禀  琴
Because you're special, Jean.

826
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:02,900
有我帮忙  你可以控制体内的这种力量
With my help, you could control what's inside you.

827
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,620
驾驭这种力量  创造全新的世界
Harness that power to create whole new worlds...

828
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:10,570
化尘为水
turn dust into water...

829
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:13,550
化水为生命
water into life.

830
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:18,520
你宿命如此  注定成就不凡  琴
It's your destiny, Jean, to become something greater...

831
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:23,620
演化成银河系中最强大的能力者
to evolve into the greatest force in the galaxy.

832
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:40,450
我说过  他们永远无法企及你
I told you they could never understand you.

833
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:44,270
而面对无法掌握的未知  他们惧怕
And what they don't understand, they fear.

834
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:46,050
但凡他们惧怕
And what they fear...

835
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,170
就会想办法摧毁
They seek to destroy.

836
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,190
瑞雯死得痛苦吗
Did Raven suffer?

837
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:57,980
还算痛快
Not for long.

838
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:08,340
我们以前关系不合  但是
I know we've had our differences in the past, but...

839
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,990
我们都爱瑞雯
We both love Raven.

840
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,040
对
Yes.

841
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,400
她生前  我们都很爱她
Yes, we did.

842
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:20,090
发现那个女人的踪迹了
There's been a sighting of the girl.

843
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:21,610
哪里
Where?

844
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:22,810
纽约
New York.

845
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,920
到了之后  自会有人帮我们找到她
We'll have eyes on the ground when we get there.

846
01:09:18,690 --> 01:09:19,920
该动身了
It's time.

847
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:28,320
我们知道琴的位置了
We know where Jean is.

848
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,130
你不是说无法追踪她吗
I thought you said you couldn't track her.

849
01:09:30,130 --> 01:09:31,680
不是我找到她的
It wasn't me who found her.

850
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,300
而是埃里克
It was Erik.

851
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,090
汉克跟他在一起
Hank's with him.

852
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:37,100
他们去找她了  打算杀了她
They're on their way to her, and they're gonna kill her.

853
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:39,000
还会杀掉阻挡他们的人
And anyone who stands in their way.

854
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:42,540
科特  就只带我和斯考特过去
Kurt, I'd like you to take Scott and I there, but that's all.

855
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,520
把我们带过去之后  你就走
I want you to leave us there and then come home.

856
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,770
我呢
And me?

857
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:47,920
我不是以X战警的身份跟你说话
I'm not talking to you now as X-Men.

858
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:51,630
我和斯考特会为琴而战  你不用去
Scott and I will go and fight for Jean without you.

859
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:52,920
我心意已决
End of discussion.

860
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,530
暴风女  我失去太多所爱之人
Storm, I have lost so many of the people I love.

861
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,250
我不会让你涉险
I'm not going to ask you to go.

862
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:01,140
我要去
I am.

863
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,080
我们需要你
We need you.

864
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:06,500
我需要你
I need you.

865
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,560
-我定当鼎力相助  -听着
- I've got your back. - Look...

866
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,040
我心意已决
End of discussion.

867
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:19,010
科特  闭上眼
Kurt, close your eyes.

868
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:21,300
我给你看目的地
I'll show you our destination.

869
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:35,340
他们在哪儿
Where are they?

870
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:53,410
她在里面
She's in there.

871
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:57,020
你好啊  老朋友
Hello, old friend.

872
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,110
别套近乎了  查尔斯
Save the "Old friend" shit, Charles.

873
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:13,800
别挡路
And stay out of my way.

874
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,190
她的所为  我很抱歉
I'm sorry for what she did.

875
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:18,330
但我不能让你进去
But I can't let you go in there.

876
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:20,050
你总是不停道歉  查尔斯
You're always sorry, Charles. 

877
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:22,090
还每次都来说教那一套
And there's always a speech.

878
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:25,410
但没人在乎了
But nobody cares anymore.

879
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:30,230
如果在这里开战  人们会把我们当成大魔头
We do this here, now, they'll see us as monsters.

880
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:32,970
纽约街头上斗殴的残暴怪物
Violent freaks, fighting on the streets of New York.

881
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:33,910
我说什么来着
What did I tell you?

882
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:36,300
该死  你的家园将不复存在
Damn it, man, your homeland will be gone.

883
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:38,330
你努力的一切都将付诸东流
Everything you care about.

884
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:39,720
省省吧
Save it.

885
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:42,070
你敢动她  我就杀了你
If you touch her, I will fucking kill you.

886
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,630
别这么做  埃里克
Don't do this, Erik.

887
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:47,840
人死不能复生  杀了琴也无济于事
Killing Jean will not bring Raven back.

888
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:50,860
这个女人必须死
The girl dies.

889
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,320
科特  来帮我
Kurt, I need you!

890
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:38,120
科特  把我带进去
Kurt, get me inside.

891
01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:41,950
不是只有你会控心术
You're not the only one who can control minds.

892
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:43,120
科特
Kurt!

893
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:40,780
他们来杀你了  别让他们得逞
They're coming to kill you. You're not gonna let them.

894
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:42,420
你要反击
You're gonna fight back.

895
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:55,910
连通你体内的那股力量
Feel the power inside you.

896
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:58,420
那股力量就是你的化身
The power is you.

897
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:31,590
拖住他们
Hold them!

898
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,070
我知道那是谁的血了
I know whose blood that was.

899
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:54,480
你对我下了逐客令
You cast me out.

900
01:14:55,550 --> 01:14:57,430
现在又来取我性命
Now you come here to kill me?

901
01:14:58,070 --> 01:14:59,340
没错
That's right.

902
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:21,650
你连杀我都做不到
And you couldn't even do that.

903
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:28,070
我来教教你吧
Let me show you how.

904
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,770
斯考特  帮个忙
Scott, a little help?

905
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:13,920
科特
Kurt!

906
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,470
科特  科特
Kurt! Kurt?

907
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:17,320
-你还好吧  -不好
- You all right? - No!

908
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:20,700
过来  赶紧把我带进去
Come here! Get me in that house now!

909
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:25,920
你也是来杀我的吗
Have you come to kill me, too?

910
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:27,160
绝不是
Never.

911
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:28,850
琴  我永远不会那么做
Jean, never!

912
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:31,630
我辜负了你  我知道
I failed you. I know that, but...

913
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:34,210
但这不是你
this isn't you.

914
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:37,150
科特
Kurt!

915
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:42,150
-琴  拜托  -你根本不了解我
- Jean, please! - You have no idea who I am.

916
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:44,220
我一手把你养大
I've raised you since you were a little girl.

917
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:45,420
我了解
I think I do.

918
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:50,010
她不再是小孩子了
She's not your little girl anymore.

919
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,670
你...
Who...

920
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:55,770
你是谁
What are you?

921
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:01,760
琴  回想一下我对你的教导
Jean, please try and remember what I taught you.

922
01:17:01,870 --> 01:17:03,080
你能够控制
You can control it.

923
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:06,050
只要专注  你就无所不能
You can do anything you set your mind to.

924
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:07,540
那你就证明给我看
So show me.

925
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,700
走过来
Walk to me.

926
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:16,580
我是个瘸子
You know I can't.

927
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:22,080
不
No!

928
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:32,480
别这样  琴
Please, Jean.

929
01:17:41,650 --> 01:17:43,060
求你了
Please.

930
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:00,970
我没法对你使用读心术了
I can't see in your mind anymore...

931
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:04,970
但你可以读我的心
but you can see in mine.

932
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:08,440
看一下吧
So look.

933
01:18:10,230 --> 01:18:11,760
琴  看看吧
Jean, look.

934
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,100
如何使用上天赐予你的礼物[天赋]And what you choose to do with your gift,

935
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,440
完全取决于你
well, that's entirely up to you.

936
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:22,910
这里可以是你的新家
This could be your new home.

937
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,690
我们可以成为你新的家人
We could be your new family.

938
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:28,360
不
No!

939
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:33,260
因为你没有毛病
Because you are not broken.

940
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:43,100
你会带走她
Then you'll take her?

941
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:45,210
对
Yes.

942
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,660
不
No!

943
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:54,250
我可以更好地帮她
I can help her in ways that you can't.

944
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:56,260
谁都帮不了她
She can't be helped.

945
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:58,750
她无药可救了
She's a lost cause.

946
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:03,920
不  她不是
No, she's not.

947
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:06,270
只要有人关爱她  相信她
As long as there's someone to care for her, who believes,

948
01:19:06,270 --> 01:19:07,820
她就还有希望
then there's still hope.

949
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:15,870
还有希望
Then there... There's still hope.

950
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:34,010
我就知道  我就知道你本性未泯
I knew. I knew you were still in there.

951
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,420
他只是给你看了你的过去
He just showed you your past.

952
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:45,190
跟随我  一起迈入你的未来
Follow me... into your future.

953
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:48,720
不
No.

954
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:57,000
武器使用麻醉剂
Set weapons to neutralize.

955
01:19:57,290 --> 01:19:59,360
我没想获得这种异能
I never asked for this.

956
01:19:59,390 --> 01:20:00,710
这一切都非我所愿
Any of it.

957
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:05,600
我跨越星系追寻这种力量  你却想弃之如敝屣
I traveled to the stars for a gift that you don't want.

958
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:09,850
那你就拿走吧
Then take it.

959
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:13,920
求你
Please.

960
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,060
放我自由
Free me.

961
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,760
我试试看
I'll try.

962
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:09,010
住手  你会杀了她
Stop it. You're going to kill her.

963
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,660
你们的生命如同草芥
Your lives mean nothing.

964
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:16,830
你们的世界将属于我们
Your world will be ours.

965
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:18,450
你要杀光所有人
You'd kill us all.

966
01:21:18,970 --> 01:21:21,250
对
Yes.

967
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:22,970
琴  你得放手
Jean, you have to let go.

968
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:27,400
琴  放开
Jean, let go!

969
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,430
快放开  琴  放开
Let go, Jean. Let go!

970
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,660
放开
Let go!

971
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:42,780
那边有一个  放倒他
There's one! Get him!

972
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,260
琴
Jean!

973
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:55,830
琴
Jean.

974
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:57,780
琴
Jean?

975
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,820
琴  琴
Jean, Jean.

976
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:02,140
-查尔斯  怎么了  -不知道  我没法进入她的大脑
- Charles, what's wrong? - I don't know. I can't read her mind.

977
01:22:06,490 --> 01:22:07,710
快  出去  把他带出去
Come on, out! Take him out!

978
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:09,960
快出去  快  各位  快走
Come on, out, out! You guys, come on. Train.

979
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:11,300
你们四个跟我走
You four with me, let's go!

980
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:12,420
-我们走  -行动
- Let's go! - Come on, move!

981
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:14,200
行动  快  快
Come on. Move, move, move!

982
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:26,520
-她还活着  -斯考特  你得把她带出去
- She's alive. - Scott, you have to get her out.

983
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:27,760
你得...  不
You have to... No!

984
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:35,020
目标已全部搞定
We're clear!

985
01:22:57,530 --> 01:22:58,530
最后一个
Last one.

986
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:03,360
搜索最后三处街区  我们走
We need a clean sweep on the last three blocks. Let's go!

987
01:23:20,210 --> 01:23:21,950
我家孩子以前很崇拜你们
My kid used to be a fan.

988
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:33,430
瑞雯说得对
Raven had the right of it.

989
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,830
大恶人不是琴
Jean was never the villain.

990
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:41,050
而是我
I was.

991
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:46,620
我当初就不该骗她
I should never have lied to her.

992
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:50,490
我错了
I was wrong.

993
01:23:53,130 --> 01:23:58,150
但她体内的这股力量
But this power inside of her, 

994
01:23:58,150 --> 01:23:59,750
非我安排
I never put that there.

995
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:02,740
我绝不会有意伤害她
I would never do anything intentionally to hurt her.

996
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:06,410
我的初衷并非恶意  琴也如此
That isn't me and this is not Jean.

997
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:09,550
我们还是能把她救回来
We can still save her.

998
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:12,630
她还留存着本性
She's still Jean inside.

999
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:24,180
离变种管制中心还有十英里
We're 10 miles out from Mutant Containment Center.

1000
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:25,930
准备好转移囚犯
Prepare for prisoner transfer.

1001
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:38,470
她被什么控制
What exactly is controlling her?

1002
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:39,800
不清楚
I don't know.

1003
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:43,320
但那个女人  那个生物体
But this woman, this... thing...

1004
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,130
尝到了这种力量的甜头
has had a taste of that power,

1005
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:46,260
她还会再回来吸取这种力量
and she'll be coming back for more.

1006
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:48,070
她会再回来找琴
She'll be coming back for Jean.

1007
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:50,390
很好  让她来
Good. Let her.

1008
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,440
她会为了吸取力量而杀死她
She'll kill her to get it.

1009
01:24:52,650 --> 01:24:55,680
但我保证  杀戮不会到此为止
But I promise you, the killing will not end there.

1010
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:58,220
瑞雯还活着  不会希望发生这种事
That's not what Raven would have wanted.

1011
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,940
你心知这点
You know that.

1012
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,220
你们俩都清楚
You both do.

1013
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,030
队长  你看到了吗
Skipper, are you seeing this?

1014
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:27,810
A1小队  多名敌人来袭
Alpha One, you have multiple hostiles onboard.

1015
01:25:27,810 --> 01:25:29,180
他们正向车尾移动
They're heading towards the back.

1016
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:31,350
-打开四号门  五号门  -收到
- Open four to five. - Copy that.

1017
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:32,620
你们俩  跟我来
All right, you two, come with me.

1018
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:35,090
其余人留守  看住犯人
The rest of you, stay here, guard the prisoners!

1019
01:25:35,090 --> 01:25:37,510
别犯傻  你们需要我们
Don't be fools! You need our help!

1020
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:39,260
快  锁门
Lock it down! Now!

1021
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,960
可恶的变种来救你们了
Goddamn muties come to spring you.

1022
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,480
他们不是变种人
They're not mutants.

1023
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,070
放了我们  你们会需要我们
Free us, you're going to need our help.

1024
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:47,870
只有我们出手  你们才能活命
We're the only chance you have.

1025
01:25:47,870 --> 01:25:49,400
闭嘴吧
Keep your mouth shut.

1026
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:19,770
求救  求救
Mayday! Mayday!

1027
01:26:31,230 --> 01:26:33,200
汇报一下变种人敌情
What's the status on those mutants?

1028
01:26:33,270 --> 01:26:35,520
我们正在撤退  他们不是...
We're falling back now! They're not...

1029
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:37,560
什么
What?

1030
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:40,160
他们不是什么
They're not what?

1031
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:43,390
-他们不是变种人  -他们来找琴了
- They're not mutants! - They're here for Jean.

1032
01:26:45,050 --> 01:26:46,470
准备开火
Get ready to open fire!

1033
01:26:46,470 --> 01:26:48,480
你家孩子没看错我们
Your kid was right about us.

1034
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,990
我们能救你们
We could help you!

1035
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:01,290
放开我们
Please!

1036
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:04,610
开火
Fire!

1037
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:17,840
后面还有敌人
There's more!

1038
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:48,230
我们的目标只是那个女人  让开
We only want the girl. Step aside.

1039
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:49,370
不要
No!

1040
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,630
你干什么
What are you doing?

1041
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,530
瑞雯还活着  就一定会这么做
What Raven would have.

1042
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,290
斯考特  把我带到琴那里
Scott, get me to Jean!

1043
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:56,700
塞琳
Selene!

1044
01:28:59,790 --> 01:29:00,930
汉克
Hank!

1045
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:03,940
帮一下暴风女
Help Storm!

1046
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:34,070
不不  别死啊
No, no, no, no, no, please.

1047
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:36,470
别死啊  别啊
Don't die. No.

1048
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,540
到了  到了
That's it, that's it, that's it.

1049
01:30:32,710 --> 01:30:34,330
斯考特  守住入口
Scott, guard the entrance.

1050
01:30:35,190 --> 01:30:36,360
琴  醒醒
Jean, wake up.

1051
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:38,870
琴  醒醒  你得赶紧醒过来
Jean, wake up. You have to wake up now.

1052
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:55,950
汉克
Hank!

1053
01:32:52,430 --> 01:32:54,410
我不想跟你打
I have no desire to fight you.

1054
01:32:55,390 --> 01:32:57,180
这话我常听
I get that a lot.

1055
01:32:57,510 --> 01:32:59,400
你之前想让她死
You wanted her dead.

1056
01:33:00,860 --> 01:33:02,970
我改变心意了
I had a change of heart.

1057
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:29,470
我当时是想保护你
I was trying to protect you.

1058
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:33,570
我不想让你经历那些痛苦  但是
I was trying to keep the pain away, but...

1059
01:33:33,570 --> 01:33:35,350
你只是将其埋藏起来了
You just buried it.

1060
01:33:37,490 --> 01:33:38,620
琴
Jean.

1061
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:42,770
这是哪儿
Where...?

1062
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:46,850
这是在我的大脑里吗
Are we inside my mind?

1063
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:50,320
这里比我的大脑要平静
It's more peaceful than mine.

1064
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,650
我当年那么对你  我很抱歉
I'm so sorry for what I did to you.

1065
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:58,870
我知道
I know.

1066
01:33:58,870 --> 01:34:01,900
我当时只是一心想保护你
All I ever wanted was to protect you

1067
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:03,740
让你过上常人的生活
and give you what you deserved.

1068
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:06,090
拥有一个美好的童年
What every child deserves.

1069
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:24,110
一个美好的家
A family.

1070
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,160
对
Yeah.

1071
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:33,010
我知道你是出于爱才这样做
I know you did what you did out of love.

1072
01:34:33,070 --> 01:34:34,330
我原谅你了
I forgive you.

1073
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,170
我知道我现在要做什么了
I know what I need to do now.

1074
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:59,250
做什么
And what is that?

1075
01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:01,500
保护我的家人
Protect my family.

1076
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:06,340
琴  琴
Jean. Jean.

1077
01:38:30,310 --> 01:38:31,480
你想要这股力量吗
You want this power?

1078
01:38:32,730 --> 01:38:34,140
那就给你
You're gonna get it.

1079
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:49,650
琴
Jean!

1080
01:38:57,740 --> 01:39:00,970
你无法控制
You can't control it.

1081
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:06,960
如果你杀了我  也会杀死大家
If you kill me, you'll kill them all.

1082
01:39:23,890 --> 01:39:27,150
情义使你不堪一击
Your emotions make you weak.

1083
01:39:34,410 --> 01:39:35,590
琴
Jean.

1084
01:39:36,590 --> 01:39:37,760
够了
Enough.

1085
01:39:40,790 --> 01:39:42,130
琴
Jean!

1086
01:39:52,660 --> 01:39:53,980
你错了
You're wrong.

1087
01:39:55,340 --> 01:39:57,570
情义使我无所不能
My emotions make me strong.

1088
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:49,900
她消失了
She's gone.

1089
01:41:00,990 --> 01:41:02,140
她
She...

1090
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:06,300
她自由了
She's free.

1091
01:41:47,930 --> 01:41:56,140
{\an8}琴·葛雷天赋青少年学校

1092
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:51,610
我清楚自己是谁了
I know who I am now.

1093
01:41:52,420 --> 01:41:55,530
我不是别人眼中期待的模样
I am not simply what others want me to be.

1094
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:00,080
我不是无法逃脱宿命的人
I am not destined to a fate I can't control.

1095
01:42:00,650 --> 01:42:03,660
我进化超越了
I evolved beyond this world.

1096
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:06,460
这不是我的终结
This is not the end of me...

1097
01:42:06,980 --> 01:42:08,520
也不是X战警的终结
or the X-Men.

1098
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,570
这是一个崭新的开始
It's a new beginning.

1099
01:42:16,270 --> 01:42:19,340
别跑  安全第一
Hey, slow down. Safety first.

1100
01:43:22,990 --> 01:43:24,960
退休生活如何
How's retirement treating you?

1101
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:27,520
你怎么来了  埃里克
What are you doing here, Erik?

1102
01:43:27,950 --> 01:43:29,740
我来见见老朋友
I came to see an old friend.

1103
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:32,960
来一局如何
Fancy a game?

1104
01:43:35,430 --> 01:43:37,230
今天不来了  谢了
No, not today. Thank you.

1105
01:43:41,270 --> 01:43:44,960
很久之前  你救了我一命
A long time ago, you saved my life.

1106
01:43:46,930 --> 01:43:48,570
然后给了我一个家
Then you offered me a home.

1107
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:52,190
我如今也想这么做
I'd like to do the same for you.

1108
01:44:08,530 --> 01:44:09,990
就来一局
Just one game.

1109
01:44:11,650 --> 01:44:12,960
毕竟故交一场
For old times' sake.

1110
01:44:25,990 --> 01:44:27,480
我会手下留情
I'll go easy on you.

1111
01:44:28,950 --> 01:44:30,290
你可不会
No, you won't.
