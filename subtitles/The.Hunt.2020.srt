00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,010
我在一个加油站
I-I am at a gas station!

290
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,250
你就不能追踪这个电话吗
Could you please just trace the call?

291
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,650
当然可以  这个主意不错
Of course. That's a... that's a great idea.

292
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,090
我们会追踪你的位置的  先生
We'll trace you, sir.

293
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,470
请耐心等待
Sit tight.

294
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,020
-好吧   -救援马上到
- Okay. - Help's on the way.

295
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,090
好
Good.

296
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,100
他们怎么说  哥们
Wh-What'd they say, dude?

297
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,990
他们说他们马上到
They said they're coming.

298
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,230
谢天谢地
Thank Christ.

299
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,520
-给我一个  -自己拿
- Hey, let me get one of them. - Get your own.

300
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,580
孩子  你能把枪放下吗
Son, would you mind putting your gun away?

301
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,710
你看起来有点激动
You seem a little worked up,

302
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,040
小心别擦枪走火
and you don't want it to go off by accident.

303
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,590
不会走火的  我有七把枪
It's not gonna go off on accident. I own seven guns.

304
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,090
-为什么  -什么
- Why? - What?

305
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,170
为什么你有七把枪
Wh-Wh-Why do you own seven guns?

306
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,550
-"坚守立场"  -因为这是我的宪法权利
- "Stand your ground." - Because it's my constitutional right

307
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,100
在有人拿枪指着我的时候
to protect myself if I should ever

308
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,600
保护自己
happen to be getting fucking shot at,

309
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,310
正如现在这样
which is exactly what's happening right now.

310
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,250
可以吗
Is that okay?

311
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,750
这么说  那些朝你开枪的人
So, those people that are shooting at you,

312
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,920
他们也只是在行使同样的权利吗
they're just exercising the very same right?

313
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,280
你在说什么呢
What the fuck are you talking about?

314
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,590
"反抗以后还有糖吃吗"
"Will there be sugar after the Rebellion?"

315

英国作家乔治·奥威尔

316
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,680
她没事吧
Is she okay?

317
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,350
当然  她没事
Oh, sure, she's fine.

318
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,100
你呢
How are you?

319
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,610
怎么回事
What the fuck?

320
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,480
-你没事吧  -怎么了
- Hey, you okay? - What's wrong?

321
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,670
拿点水来
Get some water, dude!

322
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,590
-她怎么了  -我不知道...
What's wrong with her? - I don't... I don't...

323
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,490
她怎么了
What happened to her?

324
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,840
该死  不  不  不
Oh, damn. No, no, no, no, no.

325
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,380
-操  -坐起来  快
- Fuck. - Come on. Sit up. Come on.

326
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,700
拿点水来
Get some water, dude.

327
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,990
我觉得她中毒了
I think she's dianetic.

328
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,200
天呐
Oh, sh... Oh, my God.

329
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,270
别搞得太乱
Don't make a mess.

330
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,130
什么
What?

331
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,640
我可不会收拾他的惨剧
I'm not cleaning him up.

332
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,990
你们会下地狱的
You're going to hell.

333
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,950
我不信地狱
I don't believe in hell.

334
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,640
正如你在帖子上高谈阔论的那样
As you so eloquently posted,

335
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,660
我是个"无神论精英"
I'm a "godless elite."

336
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,170
我要说一句  混蛋
For the record, asshole,

337
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,130
气候改变  是真的
climate change, it is real.

338
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,710
打开排风扇  亲爱的
Hit the vent, honey.

339
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,020
我去拿个拖把
I'll get a mop.

340
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:51,710
抱歉
Sorry.

341
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,170
不好意思又撞到了
Oh, sorry again.

342
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,160
怎么了
What?

343
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,750
没事
Nothing.

344
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:32,970
别瞒我了  亲爱的
Oh, come on, honey.

345
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,000
告诉我  怎么了
Tell me, what's wrong?

346
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,080
他戴着结婚戒指
He's wearing a wedding ring.

347
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,380
他是个坏人
He's a monster.

348
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,110
亲爱的  他可能辱骂了黑人
Honey, he probably uses the "N" word.

349
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,340
甚至都不是私下里  他可能在推特上骂了黑人
And not even in private. He probably uses it on Twitter.

350
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,360
那些人在这个混蛋的祖先手下
Those people suffered 400 years of bondage

351
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,320
受了四百年之长的奴役之苦
at the hands of that piece of shit's ancestors.

352
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,390
"那些人"
"Those people"?

353
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,770
抱歉  是黑人
Sorry. Black people.

354
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,410
非裔美国人
African Americans.

355
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,370
亲爱的  这是基本权利  朱利斯
Honey, it's... Privilege, Julius.

356
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,650
现在再叫他们"黑人"完全没问题
It's perfectly fine to call them "black" again.

357
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,570
谁说的
According to who?

358

乱箭射穿他  然后把他炸成碎片
Stuck him full of arrows and then blew him to pieces.

370
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,110
很残忍  话说回来
It was brutal. Anyway...

371
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,870
雪球现在朝你们这边来了
Snowball's headed toward you now.

372
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,640
可能已经走了五分钟了
She's maybe five minutes out.

373
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,190
你们准备好了  还是需要我们拖延下时间
You gonna be ready, or do you need us to slow her down?

374
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,960
-我们准备好了  -不用了

Over and out.

379
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,410
亲爱的  那是毒药
Honey, that's poison!

380
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,840
你给汽水下了药
Y-You rigged the soda?

381
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:57,140
没有  这一瓶里有四十三克糖
No. There are 43 grams of sugar in that bottle.

382
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,520

Oh, good God, Miranda. You really scared me.

383
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,040
我这是关心你
I am not going to apologize for caring.

384
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,800
好吧
All right, then.

-继续杀人吧  -好的

气候改变的神话今天再次遭遇打击...
The climate-change myth suffered another blow today with...

387
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,430

You don't understand the question?

405
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,100
不是  我懂  只是...

多数人知道自己在哪
Most people know where they are.

407
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,600
我不是多数人

431
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,530
我应该绕到后面去看看
I guess I should check around the back.

432
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,920
该死  我失去了...
Shit, I-I lost the...

433
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,050
-发生什么事了  -我不知道
- What happened? - I don't know.

434
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,200
我看不见了  信号断了
I-I can't see anything. The signal went out.

435
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,460
关掉无线电
Turn your radio off.

436
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,830
什么
What?

437
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,750
立刻关掉无线电
Turn your fucking radio off now!

438
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,840
至少还有一个聪明人
At least one of you is smart.

439
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,450
不许动
Don't fucking move!

440
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,660
你把枪放下
You lower your gun.

441
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:11,850
我是友军
I'm a friendly.

442
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,290
我怎么知道
How do I know that?

443
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,130
不如你拉车门把试试
Why don't you pull that door handle?

444
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,980
你会被炸飞  然后你就知道了
Then you'll blow the fuck up, and then you'll know.

445
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,010
该死
Oh, shit.

446
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,310
-谢了  -你不该打下那架无人机的
- Thanks. - You should not have shot that drone.

447
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,500
但现在他们看不见我们了
But now they can't see us.

448
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,650
他们用不着看  你刚才已经暴露我们位置了
Don't need to. You just told them we're here.

449
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,570
你要去哪
Where you going?

450
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,090
我之前看到一些轨道
Saw some tracks earlier.

451
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:48,280
我要跟着走
I'm gonna follow 'em.

452
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,450
谁的脚印[轨道]
Whose tracks?

453
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,960
喂  谁的脚印
Hey, whose tracks?

454
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,240
他们为什么不在你进来时就杀了你
Why didn't they just kill you when you came in?

455
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,220
不在乎
Don't care.

456
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,310
你想听听我的分析吗
You want to hear my theory?

457
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,680
不太想
Not really.

458
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,600
你有没有看过那篇文章
Did you read that article?

459
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,790
每年  一些自由派精英
Every year, these liberal elites--

460
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,690
就是那些管理深层政府的全球主义混蛋
you know, the globalist cucks who run the deep state--

461
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,090
会绑架一些我们这样的普通人
kidnap a bunch of normal folks like us

462
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,090
然后狩猎我们为消遣
and hunt us for fucking sport

463
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:28,320
就在佛蒙特州一间庄园之类的地方
in, like, this mansion in Vermont or something.

464
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,990
我转发给了50个朋友
I forwarded that to 50 friends.

465
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,700
我倒不是真相信啦
It-It's not like I believed it.

466
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,210
你相信吗
You believe it?

467
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,080
相信你有50个朋友吗
That you have 50 friends?

468
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,000
不是  其它部分
No, the rest of it.

469
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,920
这里不是佛蒙特州
This ain't Vermont.

470
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,010
是啊
Yeah.

471
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,550
你现在又要去哪
Where you going now?

472
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,690
我叫加里
I'm Gary.

473
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,310
闭嘴  加里
Shut the fuck up, Gary.

474
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,500
-你速度有多快  -什么
- How fast are you? - What?

475
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,970
火车拐弯时车速最慢
Train will be going slowest at the curve.

476
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,540
我们傻站着可上不去
We're not getting on standing still.

477
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,000
等等
Wait!

478
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:16,770
谢了
Thanks.

479
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:17,930
不客气
Welcome.

480
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,160
谁在那里
Who's there?

481
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,450
滚出来  不然我开枪了
Come the fuck out, or I'll shoot!

482
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,210
不是吧
Oh, come on.

483
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,800
怎么了
What?

484
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,760
他们不是真的
They're not real.

485
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,560
你知道他们是什么人吗  危机演员
You know what we have here? Crisis actors.

486
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,740
唯一开着门的那节车厢里
What are the chancesthe one train car

487
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,080
碰巧都是非法移民  那得多巧啊
with the open door is full of illegals?

488
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,830
你仔细看看这些家伙啊
I mean, I mean, will you look at these fucks?

489
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,610
你不觉得太明显了吗
A little obvious, don't you think?

490
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,840
你们这些混蛋是想教训我们吗
Oh, are you fucks trying to teach us a lesson?

491
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,250
不
Oh, no!

492
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:15,010
我好同情移民和难民哦
I feel so sorry for immigrants and refugees.

493
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,760
我得重新思考对移民的看法了
I'm gonna have to rethink my entire position on immigration.

494
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,220
不是的  加里  他们有个婴儿
No, Gary, they got a baby.

495
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,920
那又怎样  有危机婴儿的啊
So? There are crisis babies.

496
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,380
你演技可真好  默罕默德
Oh, you're good, Muhammad,

497
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,690
但要是你三秒内不说真话
but if you don't cut the bullshit in three seconds,

498
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:35,680
我就把你老二打断
I am gonna blow your fucking dick off.

499
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,180
一
One.

500
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,930
二
Two.

501
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,190
加里  快过来  蠢货
Gary. Come here, you fuck...

502
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,980
-把枪扔了  -什么
- Toss your gun. - What?

503
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,590
快扔了  不然我们别想活命
Toss it, or we're fucking dead.

504
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,370
先生  先生  打扰一下
Sir. Sir, excuse me.

505
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:48,500
我不知道我们现在在哪  但我是美国人
I don't know exactly where we are, but I'm an American.

506
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:49,810
美国人
American.

507
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,630
-美国人  -对  没错
- American? - Yeah. Yeah.

508
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,510
她也是
Her, too.

509
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,940
我给你解释一下  先生
Look, let me explain everything, sir,

510
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,890
我很清楚这是怎么回事
'cause I know exactly what's going on here, okay?

511
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,360
这些不是真的难民
These are not real refugees.

512
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,470
而是危机演员
These are crisis actors.

513
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,120
听着  我有个播客
Look, I have a podcast.

514
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,580
我多次揭穿过这种人
I've been exposing these people, okay?

515
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:11,370
他们会被安排到庄园之门的火车上
They were placed on the train as a part of Manorgate.

516
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:15,900
这一切都是精心设置的陷阱  引我们上钩
This has all been an elaborate trap to try to ensnare us.

517
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,460
他们似乎不信你  加里
I don't think they believe you, Gary.

518
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,970
你听见他说英语了吗
Did you hear him?

519
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,490
扯淡
Bullshit.

520
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,370
这都是鬼扯
This is... That-that's bullshit.

521
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,580
你们都是假扮的
You're all fake!

522
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,600
都是假扮的
You're all fake!

523
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,710
加里  你得冷静点  知道吗
Gary, you have just got to chill, okay, buddy?

524
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,210
其他难民不是安排好的
Now, those other refugees, they weren't part of this.

525
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:00,010
他们都是真的  我知道  因为我混进了他们之中
They're real. I know. I have been embedded with them, okay?

526
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,920
那些士兵也是货真价实的
And those soldiers, well, they're fucking real, too.

527
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,590
火车本来不该停下的
That train wasn't supposed to be stopped.

528
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,640
所以你给我镇定一点
So just calm the fuck down,

529
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,600
我们会挺过去的  知道吗
and we will get through this, all right?

530
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,580
还有
And you know what?

531
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,890
我甚至会让你们先出发
I'll even give you guys a head start

532
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,630
然后我才来追你们  怎么样
before I come after you. How's that sound?

533
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,170
好不好
You good?

534
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,460
说嘛  哥们
Come on, buddy.

535
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,480
加里  加里  不要
Gary, Gary, Gary, don't.

536
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,430
我不是你哥们
I am not your buddy!

537
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,620
再见了  混蛋[奶嘴]
Sayonara, sugar tits.

538
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,870
不不不  不要
No, no, no, no, no, no.

539
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,320
操  该死  该死
Fuck. Shit, shit,

540
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,340
该死  该死  该死  该死
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

541
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,490
该死  该死
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

542
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,180
该死  该死  该死  该死
Fuck. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

543
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,830
该死  该死  该死  该死
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

544
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,850
我叫迪诺  他是博扬
I'm Dino, and this Bojan.

545
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,520
你有证件吗
You have papers?

546
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,530
这是什么地方
Where are we?

547
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,490
你觉得呢
Where you think?

548
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,240
这个...
Well...

549
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,740
我之前正在密西西比州吃饭
I was, uh, eating in Mississippi

550
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,410
然后被人击晕
when I got knocked out

551
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:14,850
至少晕过去18小时
for what was at least 18 hours.

552
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,790
所以考虑到以上几点
So, taking that kind of into account,

553
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,610
加上你的口音和我之前看见的一个车牌
along with your accent and a license plate I fucking saw,

554
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,970
我猜我应该是在...
I'm guessing I'm probably in...

555
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,060
波斯尼亚
Bosnia.

556
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,430
塞尔维亚
Serbia?

557
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,440
克罗地亚
Croatia?

558
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,730
那我就是在克罗地亚了
I'm in Croa... Croatia, then.

559
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,410
-你怎么来到这里的  -这不重要
- How you get here? - Doesn't matter.

560
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,150
你得联系美国大使馆
You need to call the American embassy.

561
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,170
出示你的证件
Show us paper.

562
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,200
我没有证件
I don't have papers.

563
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,160
你能打电话给大使馆吗
C-Can you call the embassy?

564
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,740
你被人狩猎吗
You are hunted?

565
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,890
谁说我被狩猎
Who said I was hunted?

566
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:55,620
唐
Don.

567
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,980
你和唐一样被狩猎吗
You hunted like Don?

568
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,340
谁他妈是唐
Who the fuck is Don?

569
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:06,720
带唐过来
Bring Don.

570
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,370
能给我抽一根吗
Can I have one of those?

571
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,230
不行
No.

572
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,910
唐
Don.

573
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,030
你好
Howdy.

574
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,890
没错  像唐一样被狩猎
Yeah, hunted like Don.

575
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,410
我早说过了  混蛋
Yeah. I told you, assholes.

576
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,960
那些狗追我时我正往北走
Yeah, I was heading north when the dogs came after me.

577
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,420
老天  我还以为我死定了
Man, I thought I was fucking dead.

578
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,260
我本来以为是那些庄园之门的混蛋
You know, that it was those Manorgate assholes.

579
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:51,110
原来是俄罗斯人
Man, I was... I was relieved

580
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,760
我真的松了口气
when it was just the fucking Russians, you know.

581
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,020
再多点  再多点
Uh, little more, little more, pal.

582
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,520
还有  那个箱子是怎么回事
You know, a-and what was up with that crate?

583
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,960
他们为什么要先给我们武器
I mean, why-why did they give us weapons

584
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,960
再开始逐个解决我们
before they started picking us off?

585
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,570
是为了更公平吗
To make it more fair?

586
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,590
还有那头猪是怎么回事
And what was up with that pig?

587
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,620
他们不是全都是素食者吗
I thought they were all vegans.

588
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,040
我等不及要揭露这件事了
Well, I cannot wait to... to blow the lid off this shit.

589
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,460
因为我们会上《汉尼提直播秀》的
'Cause we gonna be on Hannity,you and me,

590
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:23,540
就像那两个害惨尼克松的犹太小子一样
just like them two Jew boys that fucked Nixon up.

591
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,130
你想告诉我你在想什么吗  亲爱的
You want to share what you're thinking, sweetie?

592
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,010
说吧
Come on.

593
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,990
你不在乎他们为何这样对待我们吗
You don't care why they're doing this to us?

594
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:36,430
他们想杀我  我不在乎为什么
Well, they're trying to kill me.I don't give a shit why.

595
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,290
那不是山姆大叔的侄子吗
Well, if it ain't Uncle Sam's nephew.

596
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,960
我们得救了
We're rescued.

597
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:37,410
所以你意思是他们在这里
So you're telling me that they built

598
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,180
建了一整个加油站
an entire gas station out here

599
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,660
就为了让你们相信这里是阿肯色州中部吗
just to convince you this was the middle of Arkansas?

600
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,980
多扭曲的人才会想出这种事啊
What kind of sick individual even comes up with that?

601
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:45,680
太可怕了
It's horrifying.

602
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,270
你说对了  小子
You fucking said it, junior.

603
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,690
好  我们先回大使馆
Okay, we're gonna get back to the embassy.

604
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,190
我会联系国务院
I'm gonna contact the State Department.

605
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:52,220
他们会给我们提供军事援助
We're gonna get military support out here.

606
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,610
我们会找到这些畜生的
We're gonna find these animals.

607
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:54,590
好样的
Attaboy.

608
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,280
他们为什么会做这种事
Why would they do something like that?

609
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,200
精英做任何事都出于同个原因
Same reason elites do anything--

610
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,220
他们认为自己高人一等
'cause they think they're better than us.

611
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,370
对  但为什么是你们
Yeah, but... but why you?

612
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:06,190
似乎是针对你们  不是吗
I mean, it seems so personal, right?

613
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,770
什么
What?

614
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,170
不  我意思是  我就是想问
No, no, I mean, I'm... I-I'm just asking,

615
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:12,090
为什么偏偏选中你们
why pick you of all people?

616
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:14,670
你们一定做了什么  引起了他们的注意
You must have done something to pop up on their radar somehow.

617
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:17,510
否则  为什么特别把你们当成目标
Otherwise, why target you so specifically?

618
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:20,450
-我们什么也没做  -好吧
- We didn't do shit. - Okay.

619
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,260
-怎么  难道你认为是我们的错吗  -不
- So, wh-what, you think this is our fucking fault? - N-no.

620
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,790
不是的  我不是这意思
No, no, that's not what I'm...

621
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:27,380
-不  我绝不会责怪受害者  -嗯
- No, I would never blame the victim. - Yeah.

622
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,250
我只是觉得肯定有某个原因
There'd have to be a reason, is all.

623
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,510
你能想到是什么原因吗
Can you think of anything--

624
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,650
任何原因  不管多小
anything at all, no matter how minor--

625
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:37,620
可能会导致某人想做这种...
that might make somebody want to try something as...

626
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,770
天啊  天啊  天啊
Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

627
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:45,580
什么  不
What? No.

628
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,480
不  天啊
No! Oh, my God!

629
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:50,480
停车  停车
Stop the car! Stop the car!

630
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:52,530
不  不
No! No!

631
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,280
天啊
Oh, my God!

632
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:58,570
你疯了吗  女人
Are you out of your mind, woman?!

633
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,050
不  你为什么要这么做
No, no, no. Why did you do that?

634
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:02,970
不  你为什么这么做
Oh, no. Why did you do that?

635
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:05,290
天啊  天啊  他死了吗
Oh, God. Oh, God. Is he dead?

636
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,390
你有什么毛病啊
You, what is wrong with you?

637
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:09,750
你有什么毛病啊  你这人不正常
What is wrong with you? You are not right.

638
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:10,880
天啊
Oh, my God.

639
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,340
搞...
What the...

640
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,770
操
Oh, fuck.

641
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,610
你为什么要那么做
Why did you do that? Why...

642
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:19,970
他想救我们啊  他...
He was trying to save us. He was...

643
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,890
上帝啊
Jesus.

644
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,020
不  那是加里
Nope, that's Gary.

645
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:29,940
你怎么知道他在说谎
How'd you know he was lying?

646
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,690
因为所有人都在说谎
Because everyone is lying.

647
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,990
也许
Well, maybe...

648
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,250
也许你该等等再杀他
maybe you should've waited to kill him until...

649
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,160
让他先告诉我们  他们为何这么做
till he told us why they're doing this.

650
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:43,290
我很肯定他希望我们能自己告诉他
Pretty sure he wanted us to tell him.

651
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:47,640
好吧  我们刚醒来时有11个人
Right, there was 11 of us when we first woke up.

652
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,710
出大门后死了四个
There was four down out of the gate.

653
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,500
有一个人被炸死了
A guy got grenaded.

654
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:54,920
你说加油站那里有三个人
Uh, you said there were three at the gas station.

655
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:59,760
我猜和你一起跳上火车的就是这个人
And I assume this is the guy you hopped a train with.

656
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:04,970
那就只剩下你和我了
That just leaves you and me.

657
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:07,640
没错
Yeah.

658
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,600
那是什么
Wh-Wh-What is that?

659
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,110
是鬼扯先生要带我们去的地方
It's where Mr. Bullshit was taking us.

660
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,320
感觉有点太刻意了
This seems a little obvious, like...

661
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,370
就像他们故意想让我们找到似的
like maybe they wanted us to find it.

662
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,680
这要看他们是扮蠢的聪明人
Depends on whether they're smart pretending to be idiots,

663
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,550
还是扮聪明的笨蛋
or idiots pretending to be smart.

664
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,890
要我说  别管那些混蛋了
Well, I say fuck those fuckers, okay?

665
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,640
我们有车了  直接开走吧
We got us a car. Let's just fucking go.

666
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,750
好吗  我来开  给我钥匙
Okay? And I'm driving. Give me the key.

667
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:35,800
不
No.

668
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,760
"不"
"No"?

669
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,060
不
No.

670
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,860
我妈以前常跟我讲一个故事
My mama used to tell me this story

671
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,030
关于一只兔子和一只乌龟
about the jackrabbit and the box turtle.

672
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:03,490
那只兔子是个混蛋
The jackrabbit is a real dick,

673
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:06,450
因为他总吹嘘自己
'cause he brags all the time.

674
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,120
说没人跑得比他快
Says nobody's faster than him.

675
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,170
那是真的
And, well, it's true.

676
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:17,000
因为兔子每次比赛都是赢家
'Cause every time he races, the jackrabbit always wins.

677
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,940
森林里所有动物都得忍受他
The whole fucking forest has to put up with his shit--

678
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,070
日复一日
day in, day out.

679
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:23,610
那混蛋总想参加比赛  就为了强调自己的地位
Fucker always wants to race just to rub it in some more.

680
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:27,180
于是乌龟想着  "有何不可
So the box turtle figures, "Why not?

681
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,060
我尽管去试试"
I'll give it a try."

682
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:31,080
兔子笑着说
And the jackrabbit, like, laughs.

683
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,700
"好啊  会很有意思的  我们就来比一场"
Like, "Okay, this'll be fun. So let-let's fucking go."

684
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,290
比赛开始  兔子瞬间冲出去  不见兔影
So bang! Jackrabbit leaves the box turtle in his fucking dust.

685
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:39,420
他把乌龟远远甩在后面
I mean, he is way out in front.

686
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,670
这是当然了  因为兔子永远是赢家
Of course he is, 'cause jackrabbit always wins.

687
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:45,090
但他想增加戏剧性  让战况看起来更激烈
But he wants to put on a show and he'll make it seem close.

688
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:47,700
于是他停下来  打了个盹
So he stops, and he takes a nap.

689
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:57,460
但他没想到自己睡了那么久
He sleeps longer than he wanted to.

690
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,130
等他终于醒来后
By the time he wakes up, the...

691
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:05,470
他知道自己完蛋了
I mean, he knows he's fucked.

692
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:08,320
兔子全速追赶  但为时已晚
Jackrabbit... goes full tilt, but it's too late.

693
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,740
乌龟率先冲过了终点线
The box turtle crosses the finish line first,

694
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,100
观众全部...
and the crowd's like...

695
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:16,020
激动欢呼
Goes fucking wild.

696
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:21,990
到了晚上  乌龟和他家人吃饭时
Later that night, box turtle's having dinner with his family.

697
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,700
他告诉他的小乌龟们  他是如何成功的
He's telling his little box turtles how he did it.

698
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,700
"永不放弃  我...
"I mean, never give up. I...

699
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,200
一直不停往前爬
"Just keep crawling forwards, and...

700
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:34,620
你就能战胜一切"
you can overcome just about anything."

701
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:39,460
这时门被撞开
Door smashes in.

702
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,380
是兔子
It's the jackrabbit.

703
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,390
他拿着把锤子
And he has a hammer.

704
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:51,450
他先砸死妻子和孩子们
Smashes up the wife and kids first

705
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:53,770
这样乌龟就得眼睁睁看着他们死
so the box turtle has to watch 'em die.

706
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:57,060
然后轮到他
And then it's his turn.

707
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,730
乌龟一家人都被砸成碎块后
Once the whole family's broken into little pieces...

708
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,190
兔子坐下来  吃他们的晚餐
...he sits down and eats their dinner.

709
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,410
一口不剩
Every last bite.

710
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,170
因为兔子永远是赢家
'Cause the jackrabbit always wins.

711
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:26,050
你妈妈跟你讲这种故事吗
Your mama told you that story?

712
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:28,480
等等
Uh, so... so wait.

713
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:30,850
那谁是兔子
So, who's the rabbit?

714
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:33,470
我们还是他们
I mean, i-is it us or them?

715
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:43,020
你也看见一只穿着衣服的猪了吧
You see a pig with a shirt on, right?

716
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:46,570
对
Yep.

717
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,320
一只小猪
A little pig.

718
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,590
奥利弗到底在哪
Where the hell is Oliver?

719
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,840
他去找他们已经好几小时了
He left to get them hours ago.

720
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,590
他肯定没事的  泰德
I'm sure he's fine, Ted.

721
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:09,530
天啊  阿娃·杜威内导演刚给我点了赞
Oh, wow. Ava DuVernay just liked one of my posts.

722
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:10,970
你也是阿娃的朋友吗
You're friends with Ava, too?

723
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:14,140
不是  也许吧
No. Uh, maybe.

724
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,740
我们在"全球最具影响力百人"晚宴见过
We met at a Time 100 dinner.

725
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,450
她点赞的就是这张照片
Th-This is the photo that she liked.

726
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:18,580
我在海地时拍的
It's from when I was in Haiti.

727
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,870
等等  等一下  你去过海地吗
Wait a second. Wait. You were in Haiti?

728
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,580
再告诉我们一次  你去哪里做什么来着
Remind us, what were you doing there again?

729
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:24,790
你在棚户区治疗艾滋
You were curing AIDS in a favela.

730
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,790
{\an8}-艾滋  -那不是...
- Aids. - Isn't that...

731
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:27,570
-别拿艾滋开玩笑  -不不  我没开玩笑
- Don't joke about AIDS. - No, no, no. I'm not joking.

732
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,050
艾滋是很严肃的事
AIDS is very, very serious,

733
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:34,120
幸好马丁独力承担起如此重责大任
and thank God Martin is single-handedly taking it on.

734
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:38,510
好了  首先  海地没有棚户区
Okay. First of all, there are no favelas in Haiti.

735
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,930
-那是巴西才有的  -我只是...
- That's Brazil. - Well, I just...

736
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:42,710
我听说你在那里搞大了一个女孩的肚子
I-I heard that you got a girl pregnant down there.

737
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:45,190
我只是陷入爱河了
I fell in love.

738
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:45,980
希望她赞成堕胎合法
Hope she was pro-choice.

739
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,980
别拿选择开玩笑  拜托
Don't joke about choice, man, please.

740
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,770
重要的是海地这几十年来
What matters is that Haiti is in the midst

741
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,260
都处于人道主义危机之中
of a decades-long humanitarian crisis,

742
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,400
它需要一切可能的帮助
and it needs all the help it can get.

743
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,220
谢谢你
Thank you.

744
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,860
-那需要马丁的精液吗  -够了
- Does it need Martin's semen? - Okay.

745
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:58,070
够了  理查德
Enough, Richard.

746
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,830
兄弟们  我们是站在同一边的
Guys, uh... we're all on the same team.

747
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:01,940
你刚是说"兄弟们"吗
Did you say "guys"?

748
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,730
抱歉  我疏忽了
I'm sorry. I gendered it.

749
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:04,710
他们在哪
Where are they?

750
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:06,210
用无线电呼叫奥利弗吧
Just call Oliver on the radio.

751
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:08,500
反正他们认为他是大使馆的人员  所以他...
I mean, they think he's part of the embassy, so he's...

752
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,530
该死
Oh, shit.

753
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,070
戴尔中士  帮个忙
Uh, Sergeant Dale, little help?

754
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,550
我们要小声一点
Please, let's keep the voices down.

755
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:18,240
-为什么  他们在车里  -你雇我是要听我的建议
- Why? They're in a car. - You hired me to consult you.

756
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,040
我现在就在给你建议
I'm consulting you.

757
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:22,500
你演过的那部电影叫什么来着
What was the name of that movie you did again?

758
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:24,130
《太阳之泪》
Tears of the Sun.

759
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,190
他们真起了这个名字吗
That's... I mean, that's actually what they called it?

760
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:27,460
《太阳之泪》
Tears of the Sun?

761
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,960
太阳为什么哭了
Why is the sun crying?

762
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:31,860
真有上映吗
It-it came out?

763
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,320
我是指在电影院之类的
I mean, like, in theaters and stuff?

764
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,280
-布鲁斯·威利斯是主演  -什么
- Bruce Willis was in it. - What?

765
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,320
我好爱布鲁斯
I love Bruce.

766
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,360
-他好酷  -别聊天了

767
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:41,230
抱歉  雅典娜  我去撒泡尿
Sorry, Athena. Well, I'm gonna go take a piss.

768
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,230
洗手液在谁那里
Who has the hand sanitizer?

769
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,310
老天  理查德  你就将就一下吧
Oh, christ, Richard, just rough it.

770
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:46,980
玩你的蛋去  利伯蒂
Go fuck yourself, Liberty.

771
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,920
当心碰到绊线
Hey, watch out for the trip wires.

772
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,730
我知道
I know.

773
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:04,000
竟敢叫老子将就一下
Fucking "rough it."

774
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,090
好像你这辈子就将就过一样
As if you ever roughed a thing in your fucking life.

775
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:18,720
这是你的猪吗
Is this your pig?

776
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,310
都起来
Everybody up.

777
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:46,420
像练习过的那样
Like we practiced.

778
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,850
-我操  -别拿步枪了
- Motherfucker! - Leave the rifles.

779
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:49,540
只带随身武器  快点
Sidearms now. Come on, come on.

780
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:51,170
该死
Shit.

00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:05,940
理查德

782
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,060
你别嘘我
Don't shush me.

783
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,030
理查德
Richard?

784
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,150
冷静
Easy.

785
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,410
他们会踩到绊线的
They'll hit the trips.

786
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:21,160
该死
Shit.

787
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:38,470
操
Oh, fuck!

788
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:42,640
停火  停火
Stop! Stop!

789
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:48,190
奥威尔
Orwell!

790
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,330
怎么回事
What the fuck?!

791
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:51,410
它是无辜的
He was an innocent.

792
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,980
猪是怎么进来的
How the hell did that get in here?

793
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,330
你丫差点打中我了
You almost fucking shot me.

794
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:57,110
但我又没真打中你  因为你不是...
Well, I didn't, did I? Because you're not...

795
00:53:58,050 --> 00:53:59,030
婊子
Hey, bitch.

798
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,790
不  不  不
No, no, no, no.

799
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:42,090
你个乡巴佬
You hick.

800
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,600
该死
Goddamn.

801
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,770
别开枪  是我
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, it's me.

802
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:00,030
谢谢你啊  帮了大忙
Thank you for all the help.

803
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,570

来  给我把枪
Come on, give me a gun.

805
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:08,410
你觉得你能找到一个吗
Do you think you could find one?

806
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:17,500
唐  你有什么想问她的吗
Don, is there anything you would like to ask her?

807
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,150
什么
What?

808
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:22,650
你因为我直接杀了车里的那个混蛋
You got mad that I killed the fucker in the car

809
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:25,010
让你没机会问话而很生气
before you could ask him anything,

810
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:28,220
我想  你这次有机会了
and I thought, you know, now's your chance.

811
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,020
你为什么要这么对我们
Why are you doing this to us?

812
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,310
因为上帝要我这么做
Because Jesus told me to.

813
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:40,860
你回答完了
Well, there's your answer.

814
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,820
拜托  你不能...她是个女人
Come on, you can't just... She's a woman.

815
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,910
女士
Hey, miss...

816
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:50,630
你觉得你应该因为你是个女的
do you think you should be afforded mercy

817
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,200
而被仁慈对待吗
just 'cause you're a girl?

818
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:54,910
不觉得
No.

819
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:58,710
你他妈到底什么毛病
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

820
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:02,170
唐
Don?

821
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:04,090
唐
Don.

822
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:05,680
你干掉她了吗
Did you get her?

823
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:09,010
唐
Don!

824
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:12,720
唐
Don.

825
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:19,230
到底怎么回事
What's going on?

826
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,610
你是他们的人吗
You one of them?

827
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:23,360
什么  不是
What? No.

828
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,700
你放下枪  回答她
You drop the gun and answer her.

829
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:31,490
我不会放下我的枪
I'm not dropping my gun.

830
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,660
唐  到底怎么了
Don, what's going on?

831
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,790
回答她
Answer her.

832
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:37,870
你是谁
Who is this?

833
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:39,480
你不需要再继续假装了
You don't have to pretend anymore.

834
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,460
她都知道了
She's figured it out.

835
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,760
我不知道那是谁
I don't know who the fuck that is.

836
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,260
-打死她  -放下枪
- Shoot her. - Drop the gun.

837
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,030
赶紧打死她  唐
Fucking shoot her, Don!

838
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:50,990
他们在耍你  他们在玩你
They're playing you. They're fucking with you.

839
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:52,400
我是你这边的
I'm on your side here.

840
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:53,560
赶紧放下枪
Just drop the gun.

841
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:00,690
唐
Don?

842
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:02,730
她受伤了吗
Is she hurt?

843
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,230
唐死了
Don's dead.

844
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:08,650
我杀的
'Cause of me.

845
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,030
那我想你最好赶紧来抓我
Then I guess you'd better come and get me.

846
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,390
我听说他们都叫你顾问
I heard them call you a consultant.

847
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,600
是你训练了这些混蛋吗
You trained these fuckers?

848
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,060
是的
Yeah.

849
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,690
他们给你多少钱
How much did they pay you?

850
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:42,480
不给钱
Nothing.

851
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:46,070
我欠她一个人情
I owed her a favor.

852
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:50,910
她在哪里
And where is she?

853
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,320
为什么
Why?

854
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:54,030
你赢了
You won.

855
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:56,990
回家去吧
Just go home.

856
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:05,210
因为我...
Because I am, like...

857
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,430
然后...
And, uh...

858
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:16,760
我在一家汽车租赁公司上班
I work at a car rental company.

859
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:20,060
没办法发泄那一切
And there is nowhere to put that.

860
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,850
所以也许今天...
So maybe today...

861
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:25,610
我可以...
I can, like...

862
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:40,580
所以  她到底在哪里
So, where the fuck is she?

863
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,020
好吧  好吧
Okay, okay.

864
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,710
-抱歉  抱歉  -好吧  好吧
- Sorry. Sorry. - Okay, okay.

865
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,300
-抱歉  -好吧  好吧  好吧
- Sorry. - Okay, okay, okay, okay.

866
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:53,300
好吧
Okay.

867
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:56,950
-往西北三公里  -"西北三公里"
- Three klicks northwest. - "Three klicks northwest."

868
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:58,240
有一条通往庄园的碎石路
There's a gravel road to the manor.

869
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,240
"通往庄园的路"
"Road to the manor."

870
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,310
你根本不知道你要对付的是什么
You have no idea what you're up against.

871
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:03,440
她...
She's...

872
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,650
她训练了八个月
She's been training for eight months.

873
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,070
她会把你撕成碎片
She's gonna rip you into pieces.

874
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,440
走着瞧
We'll see.

875
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:13,450
你...你参过军吗
You... you were in the service?

876
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:15,820
是的
Uh, yes.

877
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:18,240
阿富汗
Afghanistan.

878
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:20,750
你呢
Were you?

879
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:22,370
国民警卫队
National Guard.

880
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:27,080
所以你从来没见过真正的战场
So you were never in the shit.

881
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:30,130
我现在就在战场上
I'm-I'm in it now.

882
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,420
这种心态很好
That's a nice way of looking at it.

883
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:38,640
谢谢你做出的贡献
Thank you for your service.

884
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:47,980
{\an8}一年前

885
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:54,150
你好  保罗
Hello, Paul.

886
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:56,240
你好  雅典娜
Hey. Athena, hi.

887
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:57,820
你在我的办公室里干什么
What are you doing in my office?

888
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,030
请坐
Take a seat.

889
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:05,540
你好  妮可
Hello, Nicole.

890
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:07,080
雅典娜
Athena.

891
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:10,250
请坐
Have a seat.

892
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:19,320
你知道马丁的账户上周被黑了吧
So, you're aware Martin's account got hacked last week, right?

893
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,600
我是总裁  保罗  我什么都知道
I'm the CEO, Paul. I hear everything.

894
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,180
马丁还是我最好的朋友之一
And Martin's one of my closest friends.

895
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:28,190
那你肯定知道他的处境有多尴尬
So you know how embarrassing it was for him.

896
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:32,170
公开他的婚外情
All the, uh, extramarital communiqués.

897
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:36,380
我觉得只是给他妻子的肿瘤医生发屌照
I call it sending his wife's oncologist pictures of his cock.

898
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,130
不仅仅只有屌照
I mean, there are more than just the cock pics.

899
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:40,590
还有短信和邮件
There were texts and e-mails,

900
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:44,160
他还说了一些关于总统的很敏感的话
and he said some extraordinarily critical things about the president.

901
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:46,850
我记得现在还是言论自由的吧
Last I heard, free speech still exists.

902
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:49,750
别这样  别对我引述《第一修正案》
Don't do that. Don't-don't First Amendment me, please.

903
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:52,090
这不是国家  这是生意
It's not a country. It's a business.

904
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:54,960
生意就要顾及形象
A business, and there are optics.

905
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:57,010
你开除了马丁吗
You fired Martin?

906
01:01:57,110 --> 01:01:59,320
不  他知道自己要为团队承担责任
No, he realized he had to take one for the team.

907
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,860
-团队  -对  团队
- The team? - Yeah, the team.

908
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,350
我们有团队  我们的团队
We have a team, our team.

909
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:04,060
这问文件里有什么  妮可
What's in the file, Nicole?

910
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:05,470
等一下
Just a sec. Um...

911
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:08,620
你记不记得你在12月17日早上十点
Do you recall a text thread you had

912
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:10,950
与马丁  皮特  理查德  利伯蒂和其他人
with Martin, Peter, Richard and Liberty, amongst others,

913
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,250
群聊里发的信息
December 17 at 10:00 in the morning?

914
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:16,530
我不记得上周二发了什么信息  保罗
I don't recall a text thread I had last fucking Tuesday, Paul.

915
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,280
说...说吧  妮可
Go... go ahead, Nicole.

916
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:28,330
马丁说   有人看到那该死的猪头上司干了什么吗
Martin: "Did anyone see what our ratfucker-in-chief just did?"

917
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,750
利伯蒂说  看到了  今天算是完了
Liberty: "Yes. Day equals ruined."

918
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:33,750
皮特说  烦死了
Peter: "Infuriating."

919
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:36,360
雅典娜说  "至少马上可以狩猎了
Athena: "At least the hunt's coming up.

920
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,110
没有什么比去庄园
"Nothing better than going out to The Manor

921
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:40,340
杀十几个可怜人更开心的事了"
and slaughtering a dozen deplorables."

922
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:44,220
米兰达说  我们说好不会在短信里说起庄园的
Miranda: "We promised not to talk about The Manor on text."

923
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,470
泰德说  庄园万岁
Ted: "Viva El Manor."

924
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:48,810
利伯蒂说  删除记录
Liberty: "Deleting this thread."

925
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:52,770
我想起来了
Oh, I get it.

926
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,080
你知不知道外界有一些人
Are you aware there's an active group of people out there

927
01:02:57,090 --> 01:02:58,820
认为这是真的
who believe this is a real thing?

928
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:01,570
认为什么是真的
Believe wh-what's a real thing?

929
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:04,280
你们为了消遣而狩猎人类
That you're hunting human beings for sport.

930
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,210
不好笑
Yeah, not funny.

931
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,940
什么嗯  现在网上全是阴谋论
What? Yeah, conspiracy websites are all over it.

932
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,840
全都在说些有的没的
They're going bananas. They're going berserk.

933
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:26,600
论坛  我也不知道到底叫什么
Reddit. I mean, I don't know the names of them all.

934
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:29,120
但是有人调出了你在佛蒙特
But, anyway, somebody pulled a property-tax record

935
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,540
买下一座庄园的财产税记录
for the manor that you bought in Vermont.

936
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:35,440
庄园  我在佛蒙特可没有什么庄园
"Manor"? No, I don't own a fucking manor in Vermont.

937
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:38,080
那是一幢三居室的房子
It's a three-bedroom house.

938
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,990
天啊  真不敢相信你会用这个词
Jesus, I can't believe you used that word.

939
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:41,740
庄园吗
"Manor"?

940
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,610
不
No.

941
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:43,910
"可怜人"
"Deplorables."

942
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,130
这...很歧视
It's... charged.

943
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:48,640
我刚开始打的是"该死的乡巴佬"
Oh, well, I initially typed "fucking rednecks,"

944
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,100
然后我发现不一定全都是...
but then I decided that wasn't specific...

945
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,470
-拜托  -怎么了
- Hey, come on. - What?

946
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:53,580
你希望我叫他们什么  保罗
What would you prefer I call them, Paul?

947
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:57,390
-"持枪同性恋"吗  -喂  别说了
- "Gun-clutching homophobes"? - Hey, hey, stop, please.

948
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,760
"素质堪忧的种族歧视者"
"Academically challenged racists"?

949
01:03:59,810 --> 01:04:01,020
"没牙的顽固派"怎么样
What about "tooth-deprived bigots"?

950
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:03,190
我们找了最好的公关团队
We have our best team at reputation management

951
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:05,990
不停...不停地在网上操作
flooding... flooding the search engines

952
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:08,030
希望能赶紧压下这件事
in the hopes this thing doesn't go mainstream.

953
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:10,060
但就算真的发生了奇迹  真的压下来了...
But even if by some miracle it doesn't--

954
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:11,930
我觉得基本没有可能...
and I really don't see that happening--

955
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,740
马丁做了该做的事
Martin did what he had to.

956
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,120
理查德做了该做的事  他已经去蓝西了
Richard did what he had to. He's out at BlueWest.

957
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:19,290
朱利斯和米兰达退出了他们的基金会
Julius and Miranda had to step down from their foundation.

958
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:21,080
利伯蒂退了他的资金
Liberty exited her fund.

959
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:21,990
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

960
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:24,820
你必须要走
You got to go.

961
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:28,330
保罗
Paul...

962
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:31,950
那只是一个玩笑
it was just a joke.

963
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:33,960
一个玩笑
One joke.

964
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:36,250
-那不好笑  -那不是真的
- Wasn't funny. - It wasn't real.

965
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:38,380
我也不希望发生这种事
I mean, I wish this didn't happen.

966
01:04:39,730 --> 01:04:42,970
真的  但是这...
I really do, but this...

967
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:48,360
这种想法已经形成了  人们都信了
...idea is out there, and these people believe it,

968
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,720
已经很难抹除了
and they're not going away.

969
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,270
什么人
What people?

970
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:58,610
什么
Sorry?

971
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:05,820
什么人会相信我在我的庄园里狩猎人
What people believe I'm hunting human beings at my manor?

972
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:08,870
什么人会信
What fucking people?!

973
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:13,680
这是gary4USA
Okay, this is gary4USA.

974
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:14,510

977
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:18,520
他的P得分为8.5
He's a P score 8.5.

978
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,600
这个P到底是什么意思
What-what does that "P" stand for again?

979
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,150
"屁混蛋"  我投赞成

伙计们  我们不能全选
Guys, we can't include everybody, okay?

988
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:36,370
有上千人发帖喷庄园之门
Thousands of people posted about Manorgate, so...

989
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:38,160
天啊  这是"门槛"吗
Oh, Christ. It's a "gate" now?

990
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,250
他们毁了水和披萨  为什么不再祸害庄园呢
Well, they ruined water and pizza. Why not manors?

991
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,370
听着  我和大家一样
Listen, I want to slaughter all of them

992
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:42,750
想把他们都杀了
just like everybody else here, okay,

993
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:44,000
但是我们的军事顾问说
but our military consultant says

994
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,540
我们必须在12点结束
we got to cap it out at 12.

995
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:47,150
为什么  这是我们的第一次
Why? It's our first time.

996
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:48,990
安全考虑  好吗
Safety reasons, okay?

997
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,430
天  上帝不希望伤害到他人
Heavens. God forbid somebody gets hurt.

998
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:53,640
你穿着和服吗  你这叫挪用  理查德
Is that a kimono? That's appropriation, Richard.

999
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,040
利伯蒂和泰德在哪里
Hey, where are Liberty and Ted?

1000
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:56,810
-在治疗  -天啊  又去了
- In therapy. - Jesus. Again?

1001
01:05:56,810 --> 01:05:58,100
他们失去了一切  理查德
They lost everything, Richard.

1002
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:00,140
他们失去了工作和名誉
They-they lost their jobs and their reputations.

1003
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:01,520
我也是  米兰达
Yeah, so did I, Miranda.

1004
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,150
但我在慢慢接受
But I'm dealing with it with, you know,

1005
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:04,690
用药和酒  就像普通人
drugs and alcohol, like a normal person.

1006
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:07,170
不好意思  这里有人被派到克罗地亚了吗
Excuse me, did anyone else here get reassigned to Croatia?

1007
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,900
没有吗  因为我可是被派了
No? No? Because I did.

1008
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,280
那可能还是件好事呢
That was a blessing in disguise.

1009
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,610
我们不用花几分钱就能建好那个加油站
We're gonna build that gas station for pennies.

1010
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:13,720
不用引渡...下一张
There's no extradition... Next slide.

1011
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:19,490
-不  不  -天啊  奥利弗  我不觉得
- No, no. - Jesus, Oliver, I don't think...

1012
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:20,500
听着  听着  听着
Listen. Listen, listen, listen, listen,

1013
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,830
如果我们连一个有色人种都没有
if we don't have at least one person of color in this,

1014
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:24,400
那肯定会有问题的
it is going to be problematic.

1015
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:27,290
我假装成阿拉伯难民  其实我来自康涅狄格州
I'm playing an Arab refugee. I'm from Connecticut.

1016
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,380
这没有问题吗
Isn't that a little problematic?

1017
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:30,130
-那是你的主意  -是你的主意
- That was your idea. - It was your idea.

1018
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:30,840
你说出来的感觉更奇怪了
It was weird when you said it.

1019
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:35,090
因为我们要遵循刻板印象
Because we need to lean in to the stereotype...

1020
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:36,930
-没错  -让他们暴露出他们的偏向
- Correct. - ...to let them just expose their biases.

1021
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:39,010
或者只要他们拿起枪  我们就打死他们
Yeah, or we can just shoot 'em as soon as they grab their guns.

1022
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:40,680
那他们就不知道我们为什么要杀他们了
Then they're not gonna know why we're killing them, okay?

1023
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,420
-下一张  -我们有机会...
- Next slide. - We have the opportunity to...

1024
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:46,560
好了  Justice4Yall
Okay. Justice4Yall.

1025
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,760
她6.5分
She's a 6.5.

1026
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:49,470
她是这么说的
This is what she says.

1027
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:51,550
"这个女人去死吧
"Fuck this bitch.

1028
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:54,780
雅典娜·斯通杀死无辜的男..."
Athena Stone murders innocent men and..."

1029
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:56,180
我不需要继续听下去了
I don't need to hear more.

1030
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,270
这就是我们的雪球
That's our Snowball.

1031
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:17,620
把你的枪放在信箱里
Put your gun in the mailbox.

1032
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:22,600
我为什么要这么做
Why the fuck would I do that?

1033
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,290
大门下埋了一个改装的C4炸弹
There's a shaped C-4 charge underneath the gate.

1034
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,170
我可以随时把你炸飞
I could blow you up right now.

1035
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,800
不过那有什么意思呢
But where's the fun in that?

1036
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,390
不许带枪
No guns.

1037
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:37,140
给我放在信箱里
Put it in the mailbox. Now.

1038
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,160
我一直觉得很神奇
It's amazing to me.

1039
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:27,310
人们往往穷尽一生
People go their entire lives

1040
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:30,670
都不知道最简单和明显的真相
without realizing the most simple, obvious truth.

1041
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,220
削番茄最好的方式
The only way to properly slice tomatoes

1042
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:37,760
就是用面包刀
is with a bread knife.

1043
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:43,100
你杀了唐吗
Did you kill Don?

1044
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:48,350
因为我让你以为他是我们的人
Because I convinced you he was one of us.

1045
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:49,520
是吗
Was he?

1046
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:51,610
也许吧
Maybe.

1047
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:53,860
也许不是
Maybe not.

1048
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,450
我是谁
Who am I?

1049
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:04,490
我是谁
Who am I?

1050
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:08,170
女士  我不知道你是谁
Lady, I don't know who you are.

1051
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:10,020
我只知道你疯了
I just know that you're crazy.

1052
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:11,130
我疯了
I am crazy.

1053
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:13,000
但我知道我疯了
But I know I'm crazy.

1054
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:16,170
如果你知道你疯了  那你就没有疯
And if you know you're crazy, then you're not crazy.

1055
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:19,930
所以这让我非常非常生气
So that just makes me really, really mad.

1056
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:21,470
好吧
Okay.

1057
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:23,640
那我是谁
So, who am I?

1058
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:27,640
克里斯托·梅·克瑞西
Crystal May Creasey.

1059
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:31,730
出生于密西西比州的白叉镇
Born in Mississippi, Whites Crossing.

1060
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:32,960
在那长大
Fitting.

1061
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,570
12岁退学
Dropped out of school at 12,

1062
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:36,960
就是在你爸爸死于
right around the time your daddy was killed by the police

1063
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,960
警察突袭冰毒实验室后
when they raided the methamphetamine lab.

1064
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,530
你妈妈不久以后也服药过量  随他而去
Your mother joined him soon after that-- overdose.

1065
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,490
可能是爸爸制的最后一批
Probably the last batch of Daddy's stuff.

1066
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:47,500
真浪漫
Romantic.

1067
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:55,960
很多人都觉得烤奶酪应该用
You know, most people think that you should use cheddar

1068
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:59,970
切达芝士  但我用格鲁叶芝士
in a grilled cheese, but I use Gruyère.

1069
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:03,970
其他芝士融化后都没有这种感觉
Nothing else has that kind of melt.

1070
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:09,080
你母亲死后  你就到处打打零工
After your mom died, you bounced from part-time job to part-time job,

1071
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,230
辗转于福利院
to welfare and back.

1072
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:12,940
说实话  我都记不清有几次了
More times than I could count, honestly.

1073
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:17,190
唯一不变的是你每一份工作都干不长
The only consistency was your inability to stay employed.

1074
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,500
这没关系
Which is fine.

1075
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:22,880
这个国家属于那些没有受过教育和无知的人
I mean, this country belongs to the uneducated and ignorant

1076
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,700
也属于我
as much as it belongs to me.

1077
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:27,160
你失败  我们出钱
You fail, we pay.

1078
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:30,660
最终  你会被一头牛砸死
Eventually, a cow falls on your head

1079
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:32,720
或者在停车场里把自己一枪崩了
or you blow your brains out in a parking lot

1080
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:37,130
因为你终于意识到你的人生到底有多么浪费
because you finally realize what a waste your life truly was.

1081
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:39,340
但你不是  克里斯托
But not you, Crystal.

1082
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,320
你决定上网
You decided to go on the Internet

1083
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,840
开启你愚蠢的嘴巴
and run your stupid mouth.

1084
01:11:46,450 --> 01:11:49,450
13个月前  你用Justice4Yall这个名字
13 months ago, you posted this on a message board

1085
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:52,020
在留言板上写了这个
under the screen name Justice4Yall.

1086
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,980
我想确保...我没有弄错
I want to make sure I... I get it exactly right.

1087
01:11:58,170 --> 01:11:59,780
"这个女人去死吧
"Fuck this bitch.

1088
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:04,950
雅典娜·斯通杀死无辜的男女只为消遣
"Athena Stone murders innocent men and women for sport.

1089
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:07,620
证据都俱全了"
The evidence is all there."

1090
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:12,120
还写的是"具"全
T-h-e-i-r.

1091
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:15,330
"她的庄园  她的出行记录
"Her manor, her travel records.

1092
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:17,730
如果你还有所怀疑
"Oh, and in case you were still on the fence,

1093
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:21,130
她在短信里全部承认了"
she fucking admitted to it in a text message."

1094
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:26,180
"承认"还全都是大写
"Admitted" was all caps.

1095
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:31,070
你就这个反应吗
"Huh"? That's all you have to say for yourself?

1096
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:34,480
你绑架杀害这些人
Everybody you kidnapped and killed,

1097
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:38,370
就是因为他们把你和你朋友干的事
that's 'cause they busted you and your friends

1098
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:39,370
曝光在网络上吗
and put it on the Internet?

1099
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:41,030
没有人曝光我们
No one busted us.

1100
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:42,740
我们是在开玩笑
We were joking.

1101
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,630
但是你这无知的蠢蛋信了
But you ignorami took it literally.

1102
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:49,450
你真的相信我们会为了消遣而狩猎真人
You actually believed we were hunting human beings for sport.

1103
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,890
-但你就是啊  -什么
- But you are. - What?

1104
01:12:51,890 --> 01:12:53,300
为了消遣而狩猎真人
Hunting human beings for sport.

1105
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:54,970
-没有  -就是有
- No. - Oh, yeah.

1106
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:56,670
之前不是真的
It wasn't true.

1107
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,230
这里就是你的庄园  对吗
This is your manor, isn't it?

1108
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:03,860
这不是庄园
It's not a fucking manor.

1109
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:06,570
这是我在克罗地亚租了以后装潢的房子
It's a house I rented in Croatia and had decorated.

1110
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:07,820
好吧  但这里属于你
Okay, right, but it's yours,

1111
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:09,640
你在狩猎真人  所以...
and you're hunting people, so it's...

1112
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,350
就是真的
I mean, it's true.

1113
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:13,180
现在
Now.

1114
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:17,620
现在是真的  因为是被你们逼的
Now it's true because you made it true.

1115
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:19,830
你们这些人断章取义
You people, you take anything you want,

1116
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:21,750
曲解成符合你们
and you twist it around until it fits

1117
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:24,650
落后世界观的意思
into your backwards fucking worldview.

1118
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:28,950
你希望这是真的  所以你决定这就是真的
You wanted it to be true, so you decided it was.

1119
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:32,870
这就是你的想法
This was your idea.

1120
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:36,710
好吧...
Well...

1121
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:40,380
不是我的想法
not my idea.

1122
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,590
我不想破坏你的烤芝士大演讲  但是...
Ooh, I did not want to mess up your big grilled-cheese speech, but...

1123
01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:48,930
你完蛋了  女士
oh, you done fucked up, lady.

1124
01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:54,060
你找错克里斯托了
See, you got the wrong Crystal.

1125
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:58,060
我们那里还有一个克里斯托·梅·克瑞西
There's another Crystal May Creasey back home.

1126
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:01,900
不过她的中间名比我多一个E
But she spells "May" with an "E."

1127
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,650
我有时候会收到给她的邮件
Hey, I get her mail sometimes.

1128
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:09,300
我爸爸的确是个混蛋
And my dad's an asshole,

1129
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,950
但我觉得他应该不会制毒
but I don't think he ever did drugs.

1130
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:13,830
我妈妈...
And my mom...

1131
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:20,540
她还活着
...she's alive, too.

1132
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:25,310
我们能给她打个电话吗
Can we call her?

1133
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:26,770
-我们给她打个电话吧  -不
- Let's call her right now. - No.

1134
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:27,650
-把手机给我  -不可能
- Give me the phone. - No way.

1135
01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:29,150
-我给她打电话  -我看上去很蠢吗
- I'll call her up. - Do I look fucking stupid?

1136
01:14:29,150 --> 01:14:31,050
好吧  我给你号码  你来打
Fine. I'll give you her number, and you can call.

1137
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:32,680
不可能
That's not gonna happen.

1138
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:36,910
你其实并不在乎真相  对吗
Hoo, you don't really care about the truth, do you?

1139
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:37,980
我当然在乎
Of course I do.

1140
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:41,690
唯一的区别就是  我是对的
The only difference is I'm right.

1141
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,360
也许吧
Hey, maybe.

1142
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,110
也许不是
Maybe not.

1143
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:53,260
我要继续听贝多芬
Now, do I have to keep listening to Beethoven,

1144
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:55,330
还是说我们能直接开始
or can we fucking get on with it?

1145
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:27,480
真不错
That was good.

1146
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,110
不
No!

1147
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:21,620
克里斯托
Hey, Crystal.

1148
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:25,630
该死
Fuck!

1149
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:30,730
你需要枪吗  贱人
You need a gun now, bitch?!

1150
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:32,220
你这是作弊
That's fucking cheating!

1151
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:02,250
去你妈的
Fuck you!

1152
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,310
等一下
One second.

1153
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,380
不要再撞玻璃了
No more glass!

1154
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,350
我扎中你了
I got you.

1155
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:56,840
好吧
Okay.

1156
01:20:12,490 --> 01:20:13,850
我也扎中你了
I got you, too.

1157
01:20:17,210 --> 01:20:18,940
我能问你一个问题吗
Hey, can I ask you a question?

1158
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:27,870
你为什么叫我雪球
Why did you call me Snowball?

1159
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:30,500
是一个比喻
It's a reference.

1160
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:34,080
乔治·奥威尔的《动物农场》
To George Orwell's Animal Farm.

1161
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:37,420
它是一头猪
He's a pig.

1162
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:41,760
但为什么我是雪球
Yeah, but why am I Snowball?

1163
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,550
雪球是一个理想家
Snowball is an idealist.

1164
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:50,700
它...它想让这个世界变得更好
He... he wants to make the world a better place.

1165
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:54,600
所以其他猪会编造关于它的谎言
That's why the other pigs make up lies about him,

1166
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:56,770
把它扔给敌人
turn him into the enemy.

1167
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:01,570
我觉得你才应该是雪球
I think you should be Snowball.

1168
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:05,860
你读过《动物农场》
You read Animal Farm?

1169
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:08,780
是的  女士
Yes, ma'am, I did.

1170
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,500
我能...
Can I...

1171
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:16,710
问你一个问题吗
ask you a question?

1172
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:22,090
你是Justice4Yall
Are you Justice4Yall?

1173
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:25,300
拜托
Come on.

1174
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,800
我们都要死了
We're both dead.

1175
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:29,760
告诉我
Just tell me.

1176
01:21:30,450 --> 01:21:32,600
我抓对了克里斯托  对吗
I got the right Crystal, didn't I?

1177
01:21:35,410 --> 01:21:38,480
不  女士  你没有
No, ma'am, you did not.

1178
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,070
你好
Hey there.

1179
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:38,990
该死
Oh, shit.

1180
01:23:38,990 --> 01:23:39,810
那些...
The, uh...

1181
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:44,860
雇你们的混蛋想杀我
assholes you work for tried to kill me,

1182
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:47,440
于是我把他们都杀了
so I killed them instead.

1183
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:49,860
我现在想要回家
Now I want to go home.

1184
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:53,490
有问题吗
That gonna be a problem?

1185
01:23:54,470 --> 01:23:55,720
当然没有  女士
Certainly not, ma'am.

1186
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:56,370
没有
No.

1187
01:23:57,510 --> 01:23:59,370
要...要我给您倒一杯酒吗
May I... may I pour that for you?

1188
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:00,790
好
Yeah.

1189
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:14,190
要来点吃的吗  我们有上好的鱼子酱
How about a snack? We have fantastic caviar.

1190
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:15,430
-是奥斯特拉...  -好
- It's osetra... - Yeah.

1191
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:17,060
没问题
You got it.

1192
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:27,940
你吃过鱼子酱吗
You ever had caviar?

1193
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,530
不  我没有  我应该不能吃这些
No, I-I don't... I don't think I'm really allowed to.

1194
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:33,820
你现在可以了  坐下吧
Well, you are now. Have a seat.

1195
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:37,330
来挖一勺
Dig in.

1196
01:24:47,810 --> 01:24:48,840
味道怎么样
H-how is it?

1197
01:24:53,650 --> 01:24:56,300
真是太棒了
It's fucking great.
