One, two, three.

8
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,790
- 恭喜你  - 什么？
- Well, congratulations.  - Excuse me?

9
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,810
- 你妥妥的是三项精彩大奖之一的中奖者  - 什么？
- You're a guaranteed winner of one of three fabulous prizes.  - What?

10
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,120
- 你以前中过大奖吗？ - 没，从来没有
- Have you won anything major before?  - No, never.

11
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,730
- 那么你现在中了  - 哦，天啊
- Well, you have now.  - Oh, my God.

12
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,400
- 你是在开玩笑吗？ - 不是，已经确认了
- Are you kidding?  - No, it's confirmed.

13
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,600
你确定吗？好啊，我赢了什么？
Are you sure? Okay, what did I win?

14
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,210
要么是雪佛兰开拓者，或是巴黎
Either the Chevy Blazer, the Paris...

15
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,300
- 你家有滤水器吗？ - 水龙头过滤器？不，先生，我没有
- Do you have a water filtration system?  - A faucet filter? No, sir. I don 't.

16
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,770
- 你看报纸或者看电视吗？ - 有时候会
- Do you read the papers or watch TV?  - Sometimes, yeah.

17
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,910
那你就应该看过我们公司的广告
Well, then you've probably seen our advertisements.

18
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,620
正如我说过的，埃里克，政府会要你为奖品交税
As I said Erik, the government is gonna make you pay a tax on the prize.

19
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,690
但如果你购买华特生两千型滤水器
But if you buy the Waterson 2000 water filtration system...

20
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,850
奖品就可以申报成销售支出，那你就不用交税
...the prize gets recorded as a sales expense, and you don't pay any tax.

21
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,730
- 很划算，对吗？ - 没错
- Good deal, huh?  - Yeah.

22
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,030
- 没错  - 然后我还能得到巴黎旅游？
- Yeah.  - And then I get the trip to Paris?

23
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,590
你一定会得到三项大奖之一
You're guaranteed one of those three prizes.

24
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,770
我要一个快递到你家去，你给他一张支票
I'm gonna have a courier come to your house. You're gonna give him a check.

25
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,580
他回到我这里，我们会决定你获得哪一个奖品
He's gonna come to me and we'll decide which one of those prizes you get.

26
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,710
明白这个流程吗？
See how that works?

27
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,910
- 我得付多少钱？ - 相当于三百九十八美元
- How much do I pay?  - Three hundred ninety-eight dollars even.

28
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,240
- 你在商店买得花两倍价钱  - 我需要和我丈夫说说
- You'd pay twice that in stores.  - I need to speak to my husband.

29
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,820
知道吗，艾琳？我的主管刚走进我办公室，他极愿意和你聊聊
You know what, Irene? My supervisor just stepped into my office, and he would love to talk to you.

30
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,830
你能稍等一下吗？谢了，艾琳
Can you hold just a sec? Thanks, Irene.

31
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,920
- 早安  - 是哪一位？
- Good morning.  - Who says so?

32
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,460
艾琳·费斯克，她想先跟她丈夫谈一下
Irene Fisk. She wants to talk to her husband first.

33
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,270
费斯克太太，约翰·古休，地区副总裁
Mrs. Fisk, John Goodhew, regional vice president.

34
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,130
恭喜，你希望要哪一个奖品？
Congratulations. Which prize are you hoping for?

35
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,410
- 哦，巴黎  - 要是我也会选这个
- Oh, Paris.  - That would be my choice too.

36
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:41,780
我们从来没去过
We've never been.

37
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,750
[5个孙子]
我们从来没去过
We've never been.

38
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,300
[5个孙子]
我的同事告诉我说你有五个孙子？哇
My associate tells me you have five grandkids? Wow.

39
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,740
我的同事告诉我说你有五个孙子？哇
My associate tells me you have five grandkids? Wow.

40
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,150
我理解这事你想先和丈夫商量一下
I understand you'd like to speak to your husband first about this.

41
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,450
我理解原因
I can understand why.

42
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,480
但事情是这样的，艾琳，我的秘书今天下午生小孩了
But the thing is, Irene, my secretary is having a baby this afternoon.

43
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,590
这办公室里所有人都要赶到医院去
Everyone at the office is about to head to the hospital.

44
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,830
那真是太好了
Well, that's wonderful.

45
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,400
所以，我确认下你的地址，我就能交给我们的快递服务
Now, let me confirm your address so I can get it to our courier service.

46
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,630
好吧
All right.

47
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,700
嘿
Hey

48
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,330
抱歉抱歉
Sorry, sorry.

49
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,000
午饭有何想法？
Any thoughts on lunch?

50
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,870
香辣墨鱼？
Spicy calamari?

51
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,040
泰国菜？
Thai food?

52
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,540
俾格米土著
Pygmies.

53
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,880
欧提斯，嘘，嘘
Otis, hush, hush.

54
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,020
有什么事吗？
Can I help you?

55
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,340
- 卡洛琳·谢弗？ - 对
- Carolyn Schaffer?  - Yes?

56
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:05,390
我是凯威探员，这是柯尔探员，我们是联邦交易委员会的
I'm Agent Kellaway. This is Agent Cole. We're from the Federal Trade Commission.

57
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,830
很抱歉打扰你，可以的话，我们想问你几个问题
Sorry to disturb you. We'd like to ask you a few questions if we could.

58
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,160
- 没出什么事吧？ - 我们希望如此，夫人
- Is everything all right?  - We hope so, ma'am

59
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,400
谢弗太太，你能不能告诉我们那个人在电话里的确切说辞？
Mrs. Schaffer, can you tell us exactly what the man said on the phone?

60
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,770
他说有个比赛活动，而我赢得了奖品
He said that there'd been a contest, and I had won a prize.

61
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,100
说下星期会举行摸彩，而我会赢得
There'd be a drawing next week, and I'd win...

62
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,990
要么是雪佛兰开拓者，或是钻石项链
...either a Chevy Blazer, a diamond necklace...

63
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,880
或者游意大利还是法国，我不记得了
...or a trip to Italy or France. I don't remember.

64
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:33,190
还说只要我买一个他们的滤水器，我就可以不用缴税
And that if I bought one of their filtration things, I wouldn't have to pay the tax.

65
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,520
- 老天，卡洛琳  - 我想给你个惊喜
- Jesus, Carolyn.  - I wanted to surprise you.

66
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,890
我很遗憾告诉你，夫人，你什么奖品都不会拿到
I'm sorry to tell you this, ma'am, but you won't be receiving any prize.

67
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,560
而且我很遗憾地告诉你是欺诈受害者
And I'm sorry to tell you that you've been the victim of fraud.

68
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,960
欧提斯，不要吵了
Otis, knock it off.

69
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,600
这不是世上最新的诈欺行为
It's not the newest swindle in the world.

70
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,910
他们先拿假东西引诱你，然后再卖给你不值钱的东西
They bait you with something bogus, then sell you something worthless.

71
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,240
你给他们多少钱，谢弗太太？
How much did you give them, Mrs. Schaffer?

72
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,140
七百美元
Seven hundred dollars.

73
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,550
- 这值多少？ - 任何五金店里，大约五十块钱
- What's it worth?  - At any hardware store, about 50 bucks.

74
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,740
老天，卡洛琳
Jesus, Carolyn.

75
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,910
不过我们碰见过有人付了两倍的价钱
But we've met people who paid twice what you did.

76
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,250
- 真的？ - 没错
- Really?  - Yeah.

77
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,920
你写了张支票吗，夫人？
You wrote a check, ma'am?

78
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,920
你邮寄给他们的吗？
Did you mail it to them?

79
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,020
不是，一个快递员来拿的
No, a courier picked it up.

80
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,770
怎么？
What?

81
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,640
如果他们利用邮政系统
Well, if they'd used the postal system...

82
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,830
那就是邮件诈欺，那我们就能去逮捕他们
it's mail fraud, and we can go after them.

83
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,600
否则，我们也做不了什么
Otherwise, there's not a lot we can do.

84
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,580
- 除非  - 除非什么？
- Unless...  - Unless what?

85
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,740
嗯，很多这样的疯子…
Well, a lot of these whack jobs...

86
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,840
他们为集团工作
they work in syndicates.

87
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,940
如果他们在别州兑现你的支票，就是联邦案件，我们能办
If they cashed your check out of state, it's federal we can act.

88
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,750
但是我们需要签字许可，你的和你银行的…
But we'd need a signed clearance from you from your bank...

89
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,650
我可以给你一张许可，只要能抓到这些狗娘养的
I'll give you one clearance if it will catch these sons of bitches.

90
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,900
- 你还有L-47表格吗？ - 有，也许在车里
- You have any more L-47s?  - Yeah, maybe in the car.

91
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,260
稍等一下
Wait a second.

92
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,960
有了，这里
Here we go. Here.

93
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,660
- 用我的笔  - 我有一支
- Use my pen.  - I got one.

94
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,030
好吧
Okay.

95
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,770
- 你把他放出去行吗？ - 喔，抱歉
- Would you let him out?  - Oh, sorry.

96
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,030
抱歉
Sorry.

97
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,310
走吧，这就对了
Here you go. That's right.

98
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,150
抱歉
Sorry.

99
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,490
我们所需要的，只是你的银行名字
All we need is the name of your bank...

100
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,980
你的帐号
...your account number...

101
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,420
还有你的签名，在下面
...and your signature down below.

102
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,660
- 要是运气好，这些家伙是业余的…  - 他还好吗？
- Any luck, these guys were amateurs...  - He all right?

103
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,470
好，他只是
Yeah, his...

104
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,700
- 在内华达州兑现支票  - 签在那里，你可以写上日期
...cashed your check in Nevada.  - Sign there. You can date it.

105
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,130
好了
There you go.

106
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,830
- 你还好吗？ - 他没事的
- You all right?  - He's fine.

107
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,370
- 非常感谢你俩  - 你想喝点水吗？
- Thanks for you both very much.  - Would you like some water?

108
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,790
没事的，我们走
Everything's fine. Let's go.

109
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,910
谢谢你们跑一趟
Thank you for coming.

110
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,320
你没吃药，对吧？
You didn't take your pills, did you?

111
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,560
他们让门开着，真是够了
They left the door open. It was bitchen!

112
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,760
不过是一扇开着的门，罗伊
It's just an open door, Roy.

113
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,660
这笔钱不多，但它能让我过一阵子了，差不多
Well, it's not a fortune, but it will keep me in diapers. Barely.

114
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,040
别看那些帘子，老兄，你应该知道的
Don't look at those drapes, man. You should've known.

115
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,470
昨晚又看到那个家伙了，恰克
Saw that guy again last night. Chuck.

116
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,670
我跟你说过的那人，这人有一个…
Guy I was telling you about. Guy with the...

117
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,010
有艘船
With the boat.

118
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,670
是的，弗莱切特，老兄，他可是条大鱼
Yeah, Frechette. Man, he's top-heavy.

119
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,980
- 老天，我到底…？ - 嘿，别说那句
- Jesus Christ, what am l...?  - Hey, don't say that.

120
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,750
- 别说什么？ - 你知道的
- Don't say what?  - You know what.

121
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,390
别说就是了
Just don't say it.

122
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,120
这可是大钱，罗伊
It's real money, Roy

123
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,320
如果真是大钱，那就得玩长期的，我不做长期的
If it's real money, it's long con. I don't do long con.

124
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,060
你最近没干过
You haven't done it lately.

125
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,730
别算我，弗兰克
Without me, Frank.

126
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,730
好吧
Okay.

127
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,670
我只是喜欢能够…
I'd just like to be able to...

128
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,440
你知道，时不时地带个姑娘去些好地方
You know, take a girl someplace nice once in a while.

129
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,230
这你还要另外付钱吗？
You have to pay extra for that?

130
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,150
- 嗨  - 嗨
- Hi.  - Hi.

131
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,460
三、四、五、六

132
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,920
八包泰瑞顿烟
...eight packs of Tareyton.

133
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,500
三十六块，找五十
That's 36. Out of 50.

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,430
三七、三八、三九、四十，加上一十
Thirty-seven, 38, 39, 40 and 10

五十，谢谢
Is 50. Thank you.

136
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,770
下一个
Next.

137
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,770
这座城…
This town

138
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,770
是一座孤独之城
Is a lonely town

139
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,970
不是孤单之城
Not the only town

140
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,970
我喜欢这座城
I like it this town

141
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,770
这座城…
This town

142
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,470
能成就你
Is a make you town

143
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,470
或能毁了你
Or a break you town

144
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,470
带你堕落
bring you down town

145
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,280
（病人念咒呢）
Do no, do a, tray

146
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,980
俾格米土著
Oh, pygmies.

147
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,930
嗨，我是罗伊·沃勒，请接曼库索医生
Yeah, hi, this is Roy Waller calling for Dr. Mancuso.

148
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,550
- 他搬家了  - 什么？
- He moved.  - What?

149
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,050
他不住这里了，老兄
He doesn 't live here anymore, man.

150
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,240
- 你说什么“搬家”？ - 他走了
- What do you mean, "moved"?  - He's gone. He's get down.

151
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,280
- 你在唬弄我，他去哪里了？ - 他搬回东部去了
- You're shitting me. Where'd he go?  - He moved back east.

152
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,850
- 你啥意思，回东部？ - 他还欠我房租呢，老兄
- What you mean back east?  - He owes me back rent, man.

153
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,510
给我给联络方…喂？喂？
Give me a contact... Hello? Hello?

154
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,950
如果您需要打电话，请挂断之后再试一次
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.

155
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,050
罗伊，是我，法兰基
Roy, it's me. It's Frankie.

156
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,060
别这样，接电话，我知道挺难的，但快点吧
Come on, pick it up. I know it's tough, but come on.

157
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,400
罗伊，我是迪米特里，我那天晚上在“狂怒”俱乐部见过你
Roy, this is Dmitri. I met you at that club Rage the other night.

158
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,630
我真的很喜欢你的皮衣还有
I really liked your leather and...

159
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,840
好了啦，快点，接电话接电话接电话
All right, come on. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up.

160
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,670
罗伊，别这样，老兄，快接
Roy, come on, man. Come on.

161
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,940
罗伊，我一个人在这小办公室里好寂寞
Roy, it's lonely in this little office all by myself.

162
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,840
罗伊，赶紧的
Roy, come on.

163
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:18,020
罗伊，我不想烦你，只是…嗯，我快死了，罗伊
Roy, I wouldn't bother you, but... Well, I'm dying, Roy.

164
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,560
是我的脾脏
It's my spleen.

165
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,030
我都感觉不到我的拇指
I can't feel my thumbs.

166
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,970
喂？
Hello.

167
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,570
罗伊，接电话，老兄
Roy, answer the phone, man.

168
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,010
我整个晚上都在看环球电视台，结果他们只说西班牙话
I've been watching Univision all night, and all they speak is Spanish.

169
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,310
搞什么啊？
What's going on?

170
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,510
说真格的，我要跟你谈谈，我想我出疹子了
But seriously, I want to talk to you because I think I've developed a rash.

171
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,060
别这样，老兄，快啦，你要急死我啊
Come on, man. Come on, you're killing me.

172
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,790
罗伊，别这样，什么鬼？我觉得自己像个小妞
Roy, come on, what the hell? I feel like a chick.

173
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,260
好吧，够了，我过来了
All right, that's it. I'm coming over.

174
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,570
罗伊？
Roy?

175
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,070
罗伊？好，我看到了
Roy? Okay, I see that.

176
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,300
我看…我看见你了，我知道你在
I see... I saw you. I know you're there.

177
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,140
快点，罗伊，真的，老兄
Come on, Roy. Really, man.

178
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,150
一、二、三
One, two, three.

179
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,050
把你鞋子脱掉
Take your shoes off.

180
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,490
- 什么？干嘛？ - 脱了鞋子，不然就不要进来
- What? Why?  - Take your shoes off, or you don't come in.

181
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,230
你没吃药，对不对？
You didn't take your pills, did you?

182
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,780
- 一、二、三  - 我正在脱
- One, two, three.  - I'm taking them off.

183
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,230
罗伊，别这样啦，我正在脱鞋，给我点时间
Roy, come on, man. I'm taking the shoes off. Give me a break over here.

184
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,490
好吧
Okay.

185
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,260
哦，上帝啊，那是什么味道？
Jesus Christ. Oh, God, what is that smell?

186
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,100
搞什么，你被清洁先生攻击了？
What, did you get attacked by Mr. Clean?

187
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,700
- 一、二、三  - 你得开扇窗户，伙计
- One, two, three.  - You gotta open a window, buddy.

188
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,610
- 别，别打开窗子  - 好，窗户关了
- No! No windows.  - Okay. Windows are closed.

189
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,170
窗户关了
Windows are closed.

190
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,340
你在找什么，蠢蛋？
You looking for something, sucker?

191
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,730
对，我的合伙人，你见到他了吗？
Yeah, my partner. Have you seen him?

192
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,380
他已经失踪大半个礼拜了，又高又帅
He's been missing most of the week. Tall good looking guy.

193
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,380
嘿，你可不可以小心地毯？你的食物都洒出来了
Hey, would you watch the rug? You're spilling food...

194
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,060
- 你没把鞋子脱掉  - 好，我这就把鞋子脱掉
- You didn't take your shoes off.  - Okay, I'm taking the shoes off.

195
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,120
好了，伙计，我这就脱
Okay, buddy. I'm taking them off.

196
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,820
看？脱掉了，鞋子脱了，好吧？
See? They're off. The shoes are off, okay?

197
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,330
捡起来了
Here you go.

198
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,700
哦，老兄，你真糟糕，你有没有吃药？
Oh, man, you are bad. Did you take your pills?

199
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,420
我把它们冲进水管里了，不小心
I spilled them down the drain by accident.

200
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,910
哦，罗伊，得了，老兄
Oh, Roy, come on, man

201
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,270
- 你给曼库索打电话了吗？ - 搬家了
- Did you call Mancuso?  - Moved.

202
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,810
搬家了…你是在唬我吧
Moved...You gotta be shitting me.

203
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,210
我就是这么说
That's what I said.

204
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,470
好，有了
Okay, here we go.

205
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,570
快点，来啊
Hurry. Come on.

206
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,650
来啊，走吧，快点，没事的
Come on, let's go. Come on. It's okay.

207
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,090
我要你呼吸，可以吗？只要一直呼吸
I want you to breathe, okay? Just keep breathing.

208
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,450
呼吸，很好
Breathe. Okay.

209
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,100
- 鞋子  - 好，好，鞋子，在这里
- Shoes  - Okay. Okay, shoes are... There you go.

210
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,320
- 你去清理食物  - 什么？
- You got food...  - What?

211
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:41,660
好，食物没了，我捡起所有的食物，行了吧？
Okay, food is gone. I'm picking up all the food, okay?

212
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,630
听我说，罗伊，你在听吗？
Listen to me, Roy. You listening?

213
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:49,240
我打几个电话，我婶婶看过一个精神医生，在她离婚后
I'm gonna make a couple of calls. My aunt saw this shrink after her divorce.

214
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,940
- 他真的帮到她了，他是好人  - 弗兰克
- He really helped her. He's a good guy.  - Frank...

215
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,210
嘿，罗伊，你得去看医生，明白？
Hey, Roy. You need to see someone. Okay?

216
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,810
别以为我这么做只是为了你
Don't think I'm doing this just for you.

217
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,650
你知道，你有钱，你可以退休了，我还有车贷呢，老兄
You know, you got money. You can retire. I got car payments, man.

218
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,780
我不需要合伙人这样子：
I don't need a partner who's like:

219
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,660
我内心与你同在，但现在就得这么办，我必须…
My heart goes out to you, but this is it now. I gotta make some...

220
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,200
你打完以后能不能擦干净？
Would you wipe that off when you're done with it?

221
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,230
擦话筒，把它擦干净
Wipe the receiver. Just wipe it off.

222
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,630
好，怎么样？你喜欢这样吗？
Okay. How's that? You like that?

223
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,270
怎么样？
How's that?

224
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,700
好啦，对不起，好吧
Okay, I'm sorry. Okay.

225
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,720
[哈里斯·克莱恩医生 医学博士]

226
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,810
你介意我把腿翘起来吗？这样我的背会舒服点
Do you mind if I put them up? It helps my back.

227
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,080
- 请便  - 谢了
- Go ahead.  - Thanks.

228
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,180
那么，你是洁癖之类的，罗伊
Well, you're something of a clean slate, Roy.

229
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,220
他们写着你在服药，但你不知道是哪种药物
They says you were on medication, but you don't know what kind.

230
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:11,120
对，没错，对，是一些粉红色的小药片
Yeah, okay, good. Yeah, they were these little pink tablets.

231
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,590
我觉得上面写着“CRC”，差不多那样
I think it said "CRC" on them. Something like that.

232
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,030
你是非法取得的？
You were getting them illegally?

233
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,230
是的，我是非法获得的，那又怎样？
Yes, I was getting them illegally. So what?

234
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,370
为什么呢？
Why?

235
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,690
那样我就不必告诉你们这些人了
So I wouldn't have to talk to somebody like you.

236
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,900
你知道它们是什么吗？
Do you know what they were?

237
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,670
知道
Yes.

238
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:27,200
照你吃的那种剂量，我得说你能坐直还真是走运了
At that dosage you've been taken, I'd say you're lucky to be sitting up straight.

239
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,530
好极了，你可以多给我一点吗？
That's great. Can you get me some more of them?

240
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,280
你确实说到了重点
You certainly get to the point.

241
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,640
而你绕开了，那么，你能不能给我药呢？
And you skirt it. So, can you get me the pills or not?

242
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,740
可以
Yes.

243
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,920
那么，咱们就把处方笺填一填吧
Well, then let's get that prescription pad out.

244
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,990
罗伊，通常我不会开出药方，除非我先跟病人聊过
Roy, usually I don't prescribe medicine unless I had a little chatted with the patient first.

245
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,380
如果你倾向于反对，这次会谈将非常简短
If you're inclined against that, this session will be quite brief.

246
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,930
你愿意跟我说说是什么在困扰你吗？
Would you like to tell me what's been bothering you?

247
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:21,290
我不喜欢待在户外，这我知道是叫“旷野恐惧症”，对吗？
I don't like being outdoors, which I know is called "agoraphobia." Right?

248
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,960
不准确，不过，没错
Incorrectly. But, yes.

249
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,770
- 还有吗？ - 灰尘，特别是在线条周围的
- Anything else?  - Dirt. Especially around moldings.

250
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,930
我不喜欢人家的鞋踩在我的地毯上
I don't like when people put shoes on my carpet.

251
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:36,130
显然，我经常抽搐，我发觉这非常令人沮丧，往轻了说
Obviously, I have a lot of tics. I find that very frustrating to say at least.

252
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,170
某些特定的事情令我分神，让我觉得恶心得想吐
Certain things distract me, make me feel sick to my stomach.

253
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,610
这种分神影响你近来的工作吗？
Have these distractions affected your work of late?

254
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,690
还有你的个人关系？
And your personal relationships?

255
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,690
什么个人关系？
What personal relationships?

256
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,560
你上一段是在什么时候，你知道，个人关系
When was the last time you were in one, you know, a relationship.

257
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,660
和女人吗？
With a woman?

258
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,530
- 很久以前了  - 五年？
- A long time ago. Five years?

259
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,370
- 十年？ - 继续，老兄
- Ten years?  - Keep going, man.

260
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,600
她叫什么名字？
What was her name?

261
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,430
海瑟
Heather.

262
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,910
你们结婚了吗？
Were you married?

263
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,770
孩子？
Kids?

264
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,500
也许
Maybe.

265
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,210
你没再见过她？
You haven't seen her since?

266
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,520
瞧，她走时带着黑眼圈，我打的，还有肚子里的种子
Look, she left me with a black eye, which I gave her, and a bun in the oven...

267
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,620
可能是任何人的，所以，不，我没见过她
...which might've come from anyone. So, no, I haven't.

268
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,730
瞧，医生，我上星期二整天盯着我地毯上的纤维
Look, doc, I spent last Tuesday watching fibers on my carpet.

269
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,690
我看着我的地毯的整段时间里，我在担心自己可能吐出来
And the whole time I was watching my carpet, I was worrying I might vomit.

270
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,500
整段时间我都在想
And the whole time I was thinking

271
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,200
“我是个成年人，我应该知道自己脑袋里是怎么回事”
"I'm a grown man. I should know what goes on in my head."

272
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,740
这事我想得越多
The more I thought about it...

273
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,520
就越觉得应该轰出自己的脑浆，一了百了
...the more I realized I should blow my brains out and end it all.

274
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,610
但后来我想，当我…我想到要轰出自己的脑浆
But then I thought, when I...if I thought more about blowing my brains out...

275
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,570
我就开始担心我该死的地毯会怎么样
...I started worrying about what that would do to my goddamn carpet.

276
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,570
明白？所以…
Okay? So...

277
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,320
那天还算是好的了，医生
That was a good day, doc.

278
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,890
我只想你给我一些药丸，让我凑合过日子
And I just want you to give me some pills and let me get on with my life.

279
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,410
- 罗伊  - 干嘛？
- Roy.  - What?

280
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,630
他就给你了，在办公室里？
He just gave them to you at the office?

281
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,040
他说这是新药，普利发什么的
He said they were new. Prefex something-or-other.

282
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,970
- 你感觉好些了？ - 一点点
- You feel better?  - A little.

283
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,840
你要开始干活了吗？
You want to work soon?

284
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,950
你觉得你可以控制那个…
Think you can you control the...?

285
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,450
- 什么？ - 没事
- What?  - Nothing.

286
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,600
- 请问是哪个城市？ - 林地山市，加州
- What city, please?  - Woodland Hills, California.

287
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,970
- 姓名，先生？ - 芬顿，海瑟
- Name, sir?  - Fenton, Heather.

288
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,740
- 你能拼一下吗？ - F、E、N
- Can you spell that?  - F-E-N...

289
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,840
令人忧郁
Came blue and in

290
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,440
越洋而来
from across the sea

291
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,940
在那边徘徊
It lingered there

292
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,940
轻触你的头发
to touch your hair

293
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,940
你与我同行
and you walk with me

294
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,140
整个夏天
All summer long

295
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,940
我们唱了一支歌
we sang a song

296
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,500
后来我们漫步
and then we stroll

297
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:21,770
嗨，如果是你打来，那这就是我，请在哔一声之后留言
Hi. If that's you, then this is me. So leave a message after the beep.

298
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,970
- 喂，我是…  - 喂？？
- Hello, this is...  - Hello?

299
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,580
那个，你知道，我们常常吵架
Well, you know, we fought a lot.

300
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,710
吵什么？
About what?

301
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,710
你想呢？那时候我难得清醒
What do you got? I wasn't sober a lot then.

302
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,820
你现在清醒吗？
Are you now?

303
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,190
所以，有些夜晚，她就没回家
So some nights, she just didn't come home.

304
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,660
她怀孕两个月了才告诉我
She was pregnant two months before she even told me about it.

305
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,730
哦，你经常想起她吗？
Yeah. Do you think about her much?

306
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,970
你知道的，本来会怎样，本来该怎样
You know, what could have been, what might have been.

307
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,510
- 还有那孩子？ - 如果有孩子的话
- And the baby?  - If there's a baby.

308
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,340
- 你会想吗？ - 有时会，很少
- Do you think about that?  - Sometimes. Rarely.

309
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,010
你知道，比如我要是看见一辆校车或是…
You know, like, if I see a school bus or...

310
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,110
我会想“那些孩子里有没有小罗伊”？
I'll wonder, "Is one of those kids Roy Jr.?"

311
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:10,210
他，如果是男孩，现在应该多大了？
He, if he's a he, would be how old now?

312
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,200
他会有十四岁
He'd be 14.

313
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,260
十四岁，准备成为男人了
Fourteen, ready to be a man.

314
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,130
是啊，如果是男孩的话
Yeah. If he's a he.

315
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,350
如果他存在
If he is at all.

316
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,180
恭喜你，你买到了一个星期的药量
Congratulations. You bought yourself a week's worth.

317
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,640
谢了
Thanks.

318
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,910
听着，医生
Listen, doc...

319
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,750
你知道有什么办法…
...do you know of a way...

320
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,220
只是为了搞清楚，你知道的…
...just to find out, you know...

321
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,260
一个人打电话给前妻又没什么错
There's nothing wrong with a man telephoning his ex-wife.

322
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:52,970
我昨晚试过了，可是我一个词也说不出来
I tried that last night, and I couldn't say a word.

323
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,760
你能打电话给她吗？
So could you call her?

324
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,230
- 我不知道，罗伊，我  - 拜托，只是为了搞清楚
- I don't know, Roy. I...  - Please. It's just to find out.

325
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,580
- 现在？ - 不，等我…我走了以后
- Now?  - No, when I...after I'm gone.

326
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,880
你方便的时候
When you can.

327
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,980
- 好吧  - 太棒了
- Okay.  - That's great.

328
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,350
谢谢你
Thank you.

329
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,490
那我星期二再见你？
So I'm gonna see you on Tuesday?

330
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,590
嗯…为什么？我是说，我有药
Well... Why? I mean, I have the meds.

331
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,560
那么，我看你来决定吧
Well, I guess that's your call.

332
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,460
- 好吧  - 保重
- Okay.  - Take care.

333
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,750
哈罗？
Hello.

334
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,010
罗伊？我是克莱恩医生，我…
Roy? This is Dr. Klein. I...

335
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,610
- 喂？ - 嘿
- Hello?  - Hey.

336
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,750
听着，我刚和海瑟通完电话
Listen, I just got off the phone with Heather.

337
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,620
我们聊得很愉快
We had a very nice conversation.

338
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,230
- 她想跟我说话吗？ - 不，她不想
- Does she want to speak with me?  - No, she doesn 't.

339
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,600
我很遗憾，她不知道这可能对你的治疗有帮助
I'm sorry. She didn't understand it might help with your therapy.

340
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,170
你告诉她我在治疗
You told her I was in therapy.

341
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:06,070
不，我说我是精神科医生，我不能撒谎，罗伊，所以…
No, I told her I'm a psychiatrist. I can't lie, Roy. So...

342
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,710
- 不过安吉拉想跟你谈谈  - 谁？
- Angela wants to talk to you though.  - Who?

343
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,670
安吉拉，你的女儿
Angela, your daughter.

344
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:14,510
她知道你是她爸爸，说她真的想见你
She knows you're her father and says she really wants to meet you.

345
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,250
该死
Shit.

346
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,480
嘿
Hey.

347
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,390
- 安吉拉？ - 你是罗伊？
- Angela?  - You Roy?

348
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,470
没错
Yeah.

349
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,270
- 你十四岁了？ - 是的
- So you're 14?  - Yep.

350
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,480
你什么时候出来的？
So when did you get out?

351
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,640
- 什么？ - 出狱
- What?  - Of prison.

352
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,950
我从没坐过牢
I've never been in prison.

353
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,550
是你妈告诉你的？
Did your mom tell you that?

354
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,590
一开始她跟我说你死了
At first she told me you were dead.

355
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,030
后来又说你死了最好
Then she said you might as well be.

356
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,700
我没死，我做古董行的
I'm not dead. I'm in antiques.

357
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,740
是啊，那个医生就是这么说的，在电话里
Yeah, that's what the doctor said on the phone.

358
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,630
他说这话的时候，妈妈就开始笑
When he said that, Mom started to laugh.

359
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,440
你饿吗？
You hungry?

360
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,120
不介意吃点东西吧？
Do you mind eating?

361
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,510
只因为我待在室内感觉会好些
It's just I'd feel better somewhere indoors.

362
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,080
待在户外有时会让我不舒服
I get uncomfortable sometimes being outside.

363
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,220
- 真的？ - 是的
- Really?  - Yeah.

364
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,400
- 你在瞪我  - 对不起
- You're staring.  - I'm sorry.

365
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,800
没事，我也常常这样
It's okay. I used to do it too.

366
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:00,830
对着你的照片，看自己是不是遗传了你的鼻子，你的眼睛
Looked at your picture, see if I got your nose, your eyes.

367
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,800
妈总说我运气好，只遗传到你的手肘
Mom used to say I got lucky and only got your elbows.

368
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,550
我以为你肚子不饿
Thought you weren't hungry.

369
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,480
如果你湿了鞋，不如干脆下河游泳
If you're gonna get wet, might as well go swimming.

370
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,650
那么，你是在上学，对吗？
So you're in school, right?

371
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,050
现在不用，暑假
Not now. It's summer.

372
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,760
哦，对，是这样的
Oh, yeah. Okay, that's right.

373
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,330
上学真的很重要
School is really important.

374
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,230
如果有什么事可以再来一遍，我一定会更用功读书
If I had anything to do over again, I would've worked harder in school.

375
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,570
你退学了？
You drop out?

376
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,370
你就是这样成了罪犯？
That how you ended up a criminal?

377
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,510
我来付就好了，麦克
I'll take it, Mike.

378
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:42,310
没事的，你知道，不管你做什么
It's okay, you know. Whatever you do.

379
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,340
每个人一生中都做过坏事
Everybody's done something bad in their life.

380
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,300
我是卖古董的
I'm in antiques.

381
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,620
如果你以它为职业，那只不过是一堆事情串在一起
If you make it a career, it's just a bunch of something strung together.

382
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,050
别说屁话，好吗？我不是罪犯，抱歉
Cut the shit, Okay? I'm not a criminal. I'm sorry.

383
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:56,500
什么？你用那个字眼？屁话？
What? What was that word you used? Shit?

384
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,230
嘿，那个…
Hey, that...

385
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,300
你不该这样子说话
You're not supposed to talk like that.

386
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,000

- 我只是…我摆东西都有固定位置  - 好吧
- I just... I have things a certain way.  - Okay.

389
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:32,290
等等，那是她的车在车道上
Wait. That's her car in the driveway.

390
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,130
你得停在这里，停车
You gotta stop here. Stop!

391
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,740
也许有时间我们可以去打保龄球
Maybe we could go bowling sometime.

392
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,070
这是我的私人线路
This is my private line.

393
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,050
生日那天妈妈给我的
My mom got it for my birthday...

394
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,850
因为我朋友凯莉老在半夜以后打电话
because my friend Carrie kept calling after midnight.

395
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,540
还你
Here you go.

396

Go.

399
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,620
有什么比家人更重要？
What's more important than family?

400
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,980
然后，还有什么比净化你家人喝的水更重要？
Then what could be more important than purifying the water your family drinks?

Mr. Schlickling, can you hold on just one moment? Thank you.

403
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,100
怎么了？
What?

404
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,030
你怎么了？换了洗发精还是什么？
What's going on with you? You switch shampoos or something?

405
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,570
那些药片起作用了？
Those pills working?

406
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:51,980
是啊，好，我很高兴咱俩有一个人是快乐的
Yeah. All right. Well, I'm glad one of us is happy.

407
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,780
你觉得我们能从那个家伙身上榨出多少钱？
How much you think we can take that guy for?

408
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:57,510
- 恰克，有船的那个家伙  - 你是认真的？
- Chuck, with the boat.  - You serious?

409
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,150
我琢磨我欠你一份人情
I figure I owe you one.

410
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,080
老兄，这太棒了
Man, that's great!

411
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:06,750
谢利…里克先生？嗨，抱歉，你考虑太久了，没奖品给你
Mr. Schlick-licker? Hi, I'm sorry. You waited too long. No prize for you.

412
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,690
帅呆了，老兄
That's awesome, man!

413
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,520

Sorry.

416
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:23,110

422
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,220
我不知道，他来自道尼市
I don't know. He's from Downey.

423
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,020
他没有后台，对吗？
He's not connected, is he?

424
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,560
没有没有，他跟帮派，就像这样：
No, no. He and the mob, they're like this:

425
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,730
这王八蛋甚至没给小费
Son of a bitch didn't even tip.

426
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:50,130
我粗粗算过，至少可以刮他三万美金
I figure, on short notice, he could scratch up at least 30 grand.

427
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,670
不止
More.

428
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:55,970
我们用“牙买加变换”，他认识你，所以你当绳子，我当内应
We'll pull the Jamaican switch. He knows you, so you're rope. I'm inside.

你觉得他懂不懂一点国际金融？

430
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,780
你在低语吗？
Are you whispering?

431
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,710
- 干嘛低语？ - 我有吗？

437
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:22,190
英镑对美金的话…
When it's sterling versus dollars and...

438
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:29,030
对有些人而言，钱就是…
For some people, money is...

439
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,640
钱是一部没有字幕的外语片
Money is a foreign film without subtitles.

440
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,770
- 弗兰克  - 你要在哪里碰面，帅哥？

我得挂了

444
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,600
还记得我吗？
Remember me?

445
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,040
你刚好来附近吗？
You just in the neighborhood?

446
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:13,040
搭公车，我可以进去吗？
Took the bus. Think I could come in a sec?

447
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:17,040
- 一、二、三  - 真不赖
- One, two, three.  - Nice!

448
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,810
不错，你这地方
It's nice, your place.

449
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,110
你能不能小心地毯，拜托？
Could you watch the carpet, please?

450
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,090
对不起
Sorry.

451
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,390
能不能请你脱掉鞋子？
Could you please take your shoes off?

452
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,090
好，不好意思
Oh, yeah, sorry.

453
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,930
发生什么事了？
So, what's going on?

454
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:38,470
妈妈和我吵了一架，隔一段时间就会有一次
Mom and I had sort of a fight. Happens once in a while.

455
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,610
我通常会离家一两天，等她冷静
I usually take off for a day or two to let her calm down.

456
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,770
离家出走？
Take off?

457
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,640
通常我就去凯莉家…只是她度假去了
Normally, I go to Carrie's......only she's on vacation.

458
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:49,310
我就想，我们上回聊得还算愉快
And I thought, since we seemed to hit it off so well last time...

459
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,940
我可以…我可以睡你的沙发
I could...I could sleep on your couch.

460
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,810
你要待在这里？
You want to stay here?

461
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:58,980
对啊，作为回报，我可以帮你打扫还是什么的
Well, I could pay you back by cleaning up or something.

462
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:02,420
- 你戴那个是要读书吗？你的眼镜？ - 什么？
- Do you wear those to read? Your glasses?  - What?

463
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,690
你这样看起来好老气
They make you kind of old.

464
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,090
哦，不是，这是为了…
Oh, no, these are for...

465
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,260
我得走了！有一个重要的业务会议
I gotta go! I got a big business meeting.

466
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,600
- 这么晚了？ - 古董，是不等人的
- This late?  - Antiques, they wait for no man.

467
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,450
我留你一个人在这不要紧吧？
Is it all right if I leave you here alone?

468
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,910
当然，我看电视就行了
Sure, I can just watch TV.

469
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,240
你没电视？
You don't have a TV?

470
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,150
你居然没电视？
Seriously? You don't have a TV?

471
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,790
那里有沙发，如果你要坐的话
There's a couch, if you want to sit.

472
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,550
或是那边，只要你愿意，或者沙发
Or over there, if you prefer. Or the couch.

473
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,500
要不要我回来路上给你带点什么？
Do you want me to pick you up something on the way back?

474
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:41,330
- 比如，什么好呢，冰淇淋，对吗？ - 好啊
- Like, what is it, ice cream, right?  - Sure.

巧克力，好，现在听好…
Chocolate, yeah. Okay, now listen...

478
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:54,740
不要，不要给任何人开门，好吗？
...don't, don't open the door for anybody, all right?

479
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,740
好
Okay

480
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,290
一、二、三

- Bob, good to see you!  - Arden, hope I didn't keep you.

486
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,790
在那里，他没注意到你来了
Over there. He missed you coming in.

487
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,360
什…什么？

488
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,090
在那里，他没注意到你来了
Over there. He missed you coming in.

489
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:24,140
嗨，凯特，来杯啤酒行吗？海尼根？
Hey, Kate! Can I get a beer? A Heinie?

我说过你会喜欢这里的
I told you you were gonna like it here.

493
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,050
不会吧
No way!

494
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,400
酒来了，甜心

00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:57,090
- 鞋子真不错，姑娘  - 谢了，宝贝

00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,770
嗨，恰克，我不知道你在这

I gotta do a little business, you mind if...?

502
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,920
当然，鲍勃，我不是有意…抱歉，我会…
Sure, Bob. I didn't mean to...Sorry. I'll be...

- Nice meeting you. I'll be over here.  - Great.

504
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,660
鱼已经上钩了
That's fish in a barrel.

505
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,130
他伤自尊了，你准备好了吗？
He's piqued. You good to go?

506
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,540
- 教皇会在木头上拉屎吗？ - 说“好”就行

00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:11,570
十三、十四、十五，你孩子来过夜？
Thirteen, 14, 15. You got kids overnight?

513
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:50,080
罗伊？妈妈为什么离开你？
Roy? Why did Mom leave you?

514
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:53,380
这个你得问她了
Well, you'd have to ask her that.

515
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:57,550
问过了，她说她不想提这件事
I did. She said she didn't wanna talk about it.

516
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,760
还臭骂了你一顿
Called you names.

517
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,590
所以我们才会吵架
That's why we got in a fight.

518
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,130
她说你是坏人
She said you were a bad guy.

519
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,430
你看起来不像坏人
You don't seem like a bad guy.

520
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,030
这正是我干得好的地方
That's what makes me good at it.

521
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,040
反正，我不觉得你是坏人
Well, I don't think you're a bad guy.

522
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,920
晚安
Good night.

523
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,780
晚安
Good night.

524
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,580
里面有人
Someone's in here!

525
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:03,420
我觉得这不可接受，我觉得不可接受
I think it's disrespectful. I just think it's disrespectful.

526
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:13,970
- 嘿，快点  - 一、二、三
- Hey, come on.  - One, two, three.

527
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:17,670
真希望你在场，我把他牵进来了，老兄
I wish you could've been there. I reeled him in, man.

528
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,270
- 哈利路亚！你藏了个小妞在家啊？ - 你在干嘛啊？
- Hallelujah! You got a chick in there?  - What are you doing?

529
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,400
慌乱什么呀？
What's the hubbub?

530
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,810
你一离开那里，他就走下吧台凳，他上钩了
The second you left the place, he was off his barstool. He's in.

531
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,450
- 他上钩了，他想今晚会面  - 好吧
- He's in. He wants to meet tonight.  - All right.

532
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,210
推到明天
Push it till tomorrow.

533
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:35,510
先让他的贪心发挥下想象力
Let his greed meet his imagination.

534
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,180
早安
Morning.

535
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,190
早安
Good morning.

536
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,030
我给你做了鸡蛋
I made you eggs.

537
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,190
可以
That's okay.

538
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,230
早先来的那个家伙是谁？
So who was that guy who came by earlier?

539
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,460
生意伙伴
Business associate.

540
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,900
他叫什么名字？
Well, what was his name?

541
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:58,810
弗兰克
Frank.

542
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,210
你怎么会不想让他看到我？
How come you didn't want him to see me?

543
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,440
我不是不想让他看到你…
It's not that I don't want him to see you...

544
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:07,210
你不觉得早餐应该吃鸡蛋吗？健康的东西
Don't you think you should eat eggs for breakfast? Something healthy.

545
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:08,910
我不喜欢鸡蛋
I don't like eggs.

546
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:12,420
反正你这里只有金枪鱼，一大堆金枪鱼
Anyways, all you've got here is tuna. Lots of tuna.

547
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,760
还有一盒电视餐
And one TV dinner?

548
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:19,190
电视餐是不错，你也得有电视配才行啊
TV dinners are cool. You should get the TV to go with them.

549
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,630
我喜欢金枪鱼
I like tuna fish.

550
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,540
嗨，妈
Hi, Mom.

551
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,440
不要
No.

552
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,040
不要
No.

553
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:36,240
如果我是又怎样？那又怎样？他是我老爸
So what if I am? So? He's my father.

554
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:40,040
我不在乎，我不在乎！
Well, I don't care. I don't care!

555
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,960
如果我想的话我会的
Well, I will if I want!

556
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,680
不，我知道
No. I know.

557
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,520
好，我答应你
Okay, I promise.

558
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,390
好，拜
Okay, bye.

559
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,690
她生气了？
Is she mad?

560
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,360
是气我，不是你
At me, not you.

561
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:03,200
- 她说她要报警  - 哦，天啊
- She said she was gonna call the police.  - Oh, God.

562
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,770
哦，天啊
Oh, God.

563
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,970
但现在她只要我及时回去上暑期班
But now she just wants me home in time for summer school.

564
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,940
什么时候开课？
When's that start?

565
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,080
星期一
Monday.

566
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,550
今天是星期四
Today's Thursday.

567
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:17,890
没关系的，对吧？
That's okay, isn't it?

568
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:29,230
三，四
Three, four.

569
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,670
用力吐气，很好，非常好
Let it out. Good, very good.

570
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,830
你的地毯上有污点
You've got stains on your carpet.

571
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:38,070
你就是在想这个事儿，我地毯上的污点？
Is that what you were thinking about, stains on my carpet?

572
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,570
可以坐起来了
You can sit up.

573
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,110
是的，地毯上的污渍…
Yeah, carpet stains...

574
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,410
还有个十四岁少女，我几乎不认识，住在我家里
...and that I have a 14-year-old girl I barely know living in my house.

575
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:50,150
相信我，他们没那么难办，小孩
Trust me, they're not so difficult, kids.

576
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:52,680
通常，你要确保他们吃蔬菜
Mostly, you have to make sure they eat their vegetables...

577
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:55,850
别熬夜太晚，别看太多电视
...don't stay up too late, don't watch too much TV.

578
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:59,760
然后，试着尽量诚实和开放地面对他们
Otherwise, just try to be as honest and open with them as possible.

579
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,830
- 尽量诚实和开放  - 对吧？
- Honest and open with them as possible.  - Right?

580
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,130
对
Right!

581
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,550
第三台需要支票检查
I need a check okay on three.

582
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:23,380
经理请到第三台批准支票
Manager for a check okay on three, please.

583
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:25,720
那一台排队较短
The line for that one's shorter.

584
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:27,990
不要，这台比较好
No, this one's better.

585
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:34,560
五磅苹果装需要检查价格
We need a price check on a five-pound bag of Red Delicious.

586
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:37,970
老爸，快点，快点
Dad, hurry! Hurry!

587
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,130
俾格米土著
Pygmies!

588
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:41,670
意大利面，我们要做意大利面
Spaghetti. We're making spaghetti.

589
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,440
是是，欢乐时光，欢乐时光
Yeah. Happy times. Happy times.

590
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:50,810
来了
Here it comes.

591
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,980
你知道…意大利的厨师们
You know the...the chefs in Italy...

592
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,820
他们说，如果你把面条扔出去黏得住就表示熟了
they say the spaghetti's ready if you throw it and it sticks.

593
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,850
啤酒
Beer.

594
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,690
干杯
Cheers.

595
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,330
我说不好
I don't know.

596
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:13,100
- 没有浇酱汁吗？ - 这是哎哟哟意大利面
- No sauce to go over it?  - It's spaghetti alio olio!

597
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:15,170
还有罗勒叶子在里面
And it's got basil leaves in it.

598
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,870
看到叶子没？
See the leaves?

599
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:22,850
好好享受吧
Enjoy it.

600
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,690
- 华特斯？ - 沃勒，不用找了

A client's opening an account to bridge the pound and Euro. I gotta hold his hand.

605
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,410
能不能请你把这个弄热一点？
Would you please heat this up?

606
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,650
- 这么糟糕啊？ - 就是啊
- That bad?  - Yeah.

607
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:06,050
对有些老乡来说，钱就像是一部没有字幕的外语片
For some folks, money is a foreign film without subtitles.

608
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,160
- 好了，谈正事吧  - 谈正事吧
- Anyway, to the business at hand.  - To the business at hand.

609
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:13,770
我有个规矩，恰克，简单就是安全
I have one rule, Chuck. Simple is safe.

610
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:16,730
我会尽量少跟你讲我以及我做的事
I'll tell you as little as possible about me and what I do...

611
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:21,070
但会尽量多讲我们要做的事情，让你感觉舒适
...but as much as I need to to make you comfortable with what we're doing.

612
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,500
我们要做什么？
What are we doing?

613
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:31,280
五千英镑，在银行汇兑部门工作的好处
Five thousand pounds sterling. A perk of working in exchange at a bank.

614
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,640
- 这是谁的？ - 不是哪个人的
- Whose is it?  - No one's particular

615
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:36,980
没算进去的钱，浮在帐簿上的一层奶油
Just money unaccounted for, floating on top of the books like a layer of cream.

616
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,050
而他就把它刮下来
And he just scoops it off.

617
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,390
嗯，比那个…鲍勃
Well, it's a little more... Bob!

618
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,160
比那要复杂一点，但再说一次，简单就是安全
It's a little more complicated than that, but again, simple is safe.

619
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:46,900
你为什么不自己留起来？
Why not keep the money yourself?

620
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:51,440
作为银行雇员，想要兑换货币，都会留下记录还会被质问
As a bank employee...any attempt to change currency is recorded and questioned.

621
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,900
鲍勃就有记录
Bob has a record.

622
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:56,340
而你，在另一方面，没人会眨下眼
You, on the other hand, no one bats an eye.

623
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:58,980
现在，我希望你能给我点东西
Now, I hope you have something for me.

624
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,640
- 五千块，美金  - 恭喜你
- Five grand, American.  - Congratulations.

625
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:07,220
- 根据今天的汇率你刚赚了  - 两千五百六十七美元，从互联网上查的
- At today's exchange rate you made...  - $2567. Looked it up on the Internet.

626
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:08,480
他反应真快
He's fast.

627
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:12,950
互联网这东西，是种时尚，我就搞不懂
That Internet thing, that's a fad. I can't figure it out.

628
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,030
我也不行，但我女儿是行家
Well, neither can I, but my daughter's a wiz.

629
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:17,460
- 怎么，你有个女儿？ - 两个，十五岁和十二岁
- What? You have a daughter?  - Two. Fifteen and 12.

630
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:20,330
- 真不错，我女儿十四岁  - 一场暴乱，对吗？
- Wonderful, I have a 14-year-old.  - It's a riot, huh?

631
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,230
小小的胸罩就挂在浴帘杆上
Little training bras hanging from the shower rods.

632
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,370
对啊，而且什么都有股口香糖味
Yeah, and everything smells like gum.

633
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,410
你怎么让他们出门的？我女儿整天都待在家里
How do you get them outside? Because mine sits at home all day.

634
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,240
- 夏天是最糟糕的  - 对
- Summer is the worst. The worst.  - Yeah

635
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:33,570
- 真是疯了，真是狂野  - 他学得真像
- It's crazy. It's wild.  - He sounds just like him.

636
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:37,080
我问你个事，亚顿，你一次最多可以捞多少？
Let me ask you something, Arden. How much could you do this for?

637
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:39,480
按规矩，我们从来不超过一万
Well, as a rule, we never go north of 10.

638
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:41,250
你手边有多少钱？
How much could you get your hands on?

639
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,590
- 很多  - 那好
- A lot.  - All right.

640
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,490
- 一言为定  - 合作愉快
- Put it there.  - Let's play ball.

641
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,260
- 恰克，宝贝，让我也尝点甜头啊  - 好
- Chucky, baby, give me some sugar.  - Yeah.

642
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:53,330
- 待会见？ - 和平，两根手指头
- See you later?  - Peace. Two fingers.

643
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:55,500
和平？
Peace?

644
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,530
- 浑蛋  - 没给小费？
- Asshole.  - Didn't tip him?

645
00:47:58,530 --> 00:47:59,230
又来了
Do it again

646
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,500
- 停车票卡  - 是的，他是个混球
- Tickets, please.  - Yeah, he's a jackass.

647
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,300
再见，混球
See you, jackass.

648
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:07,840
老兄，我看我们一会儿就花了两千块
Man, I thought we were out 2 grand there for a second.

649
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,710
你要赚钱，就得先花钱
You gotta spend money if you wanna make money.

650
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:12,480
对，你得先赚才有得花，兄弟
Yeah, you gotta make it to spend it. Brother.

651
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:14,210
“什么都有股口香糖味”
"Everything smells like gum"?

652
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,210
那是怎么回事？
What was that about?

653
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:21,020
带你去看更好点
It's easier if I show you.

654
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,860
安吉拉？
Angela?

655
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,890
安吉拉，我回来了
Angela, I'm back.

656
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,800
安吉拉，弗兰克来了
Angela, Frank's here!

657
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:33,000
嘿
Hey.

658
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:36,040
安吉拉？
Angela?

659
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,140
她不在，一定是回她妈那里去了
She's not here. She must have gone back to her mom's.

660
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:44,980
这个辣妹希拉里说“我还单身，宝贝”
This teenybopper Hillary says, "I am single, baby."

661
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,910
- 她通常都去哪里？ - 我不知道
- Where does she usually go?  - I don't know.

662
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:50,980
这样不好，罗伊，对你对我们都不好
This is no good, Roy. It's no good for you or us.

663
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,760
这和我们一点关系都没有
It's got nothing to do with us.

664
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:53,890
嘿
Hey!

665
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:55,120
俾格米土著
Pygmies.

666
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,320
是啊
Yeah.

667
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,260
- 这就是坏消息，老兄  - 你没必要这样看待此事
- This is bad news, man.  - You don't have to put it like that.

668
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,650
- 你去哪里了？ - 没去哪
- Where have you been?  - Nowhere.

669
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,650
好吧，你上哪里去了？
Okay. Where did you go?

670
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:01,390
我只是出去了，我去游戏场，半英里远而已
I just went out. I went to the arcade. It's like a half a mile away.

671
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,020
这里好闷，闻着像是来苏水
It's stuffy in here. It smells like Lysol.

672
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,920
你到底跑去哪里了？
Where the hell were you?

673
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,590
我现在就要知道，不然我就打电话给你妈
I wanna know right now or I'm calling your mother!

674
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,370
我刚告诉你了，我去游戏场
I just told you. I went to the arcade.

675
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,060
你干嘛偷偷摸摸的从后门进来？
Why did you sneak back in?

676
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:17,580
我就是这样出门的，我没有钥匙锁门
That's how I left. I didn't have keys to lock the door.

677
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,370
哦，那你没看到我的车吗？
So you didn't see my car?

678
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:22,080
天哪，你比老妈还烦
Jeez, you're worse than Mom.

679
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:27,680
安吉拉，听好，我很高兴见到你，真的，但是我有工作
Angela, listen, I'm glad I met you, I'm glad we met, I really am, but I've got a business...

680
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:31,980
我有伙伴，而且我的东西有一定的规矩，就这样！
...and I've got a partner and I've got things a certain way, and that's it!

681
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,680
所以，你知道，我想最好…
So, you know, I think it'd be better...

682
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,260
对于你，最重要的是，我明早就送你回家
...for you, most of all, if tomorrow morning I took you back home.

683
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,600
- 我做错了什么？ - 什么都没有
- What did I do wrong?  - You didn't do anything wrong.

684
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:46,900
我只是出去一趟！天啊！我没喝酒也没嗑药
I just went out! God, I didn't even... I didn't drink, I didn't get high!

685
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:49,910
更没从你那只笨狗里拿半毛钱
I didn't take any money from your stupid dog!

686
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:53,910
怎样，你从没听说过银行吗？
What, you never heard of a bank?

687
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:00,080
你所做的是错的，还有
That is wrong what you did, and...

688
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,520
你太爱管闲事，还有
...you're a Nosy Parker, and...

689
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:05,850
女孩子家不应该这么野
And that's no way for a young lady to behave!

690
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,950
你真丢脸
Shame on you!

691
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:22,830
安吉拉？
Angela?

692
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:25,540
宝贝？
Sweetheart?

693
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,440
- 我不是要把你赶走  - 我不想待的地方就不待
- I wasn't kicking you out.  - I won't stay where I'm not wanted!

694
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,880
- 我没有不要你  - 骗人
- It's not that I don't want you.  - Fooled me.

695
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:34,580
- 闹够了没有？ - 没有，让我走
- Will you stop?  - Don't! Let me go!

696
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,430
你只是不想让我回去告诉妈说，她没看错你
You don't want me going home to Mom thinking she was right all along!

697
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:39,930
住手
Stop!

698
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:43,930
你和她那些男朋友没两样
You're just like one of her boyfriends!

699
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,400
我只是你们为了对付她而必须处理的东西
I'm just something you have to deal with in order to screw her!

700
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:51,700
- 拜托，你知道不是这样  - 甚至他们会告诉我说自己是做什么的
- Please, you know that's not true.  - Even they tell me what they do for a living!

701
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:57,100
对啊，古董商总是把大笔现金藏在家里，和枪放在一起
Oh yeah, antiques dealers always keep large stacks of cash in their homes right next to their guns.

702
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,240
好，好，行了吧？对不起，只不过…
Okay. Okay. All right? I'm sorry. It's just...

703
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:05,140
我不是
I'm not...

704
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,380
我不懂怎么做一个爸爸，行吗？你知道吗？
I'm not very good at being a dad. Okay? You know? All right?

705
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,290
我连自己都搞不定
I barely get by being me.

706
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,750
- 宝贝，拜托  - 不要
- Come on, sweetheart, please...  - Don't!

707
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:18,260
跟我回家吧，我们再叫个大比萨来吃
Come on back home with me, and we can get a big pizza again.

708
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:21,990
你可以整个周末都待在这里，只要你愿意，行吗？
You can stay the whole weekend if you want, all right?

709
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:28,760
你怎么会有枪？
Why do you have a gun?

710
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,210
预防万一
In case.

711
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:38,810
万一什么？
In case what?

712
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:45,390
这很难解释
It's hard to explain.

713
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,670
沃勒，不用找了
Waller. Keep the change.

714
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,830
- 屁话！ - 不
- Bullshit!  - Nope.

715
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,870
不是屁话，注意你的餐桌语言
No bullshit. And watch your language at the table.

716
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,470
- 你是个骗子？ - 是行骗艺术家
- You're a con man?  - Con artist.

717
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:07,470
老千，火柴人，窝囊废，随你怎么叫
A flimflam man, matchstick man, loser. Whatever you want to call it.

718
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:08,910
那个家伙，弗兰克呢？
And that guy, Frank?

719
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,520
他是我的伙伴，我的徒弟
He's my partner. My protege

720
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:14,920
- 教我几招吧  - 什么？
- Teach me something.  - What?

721
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:17,180
- 教我怎么骗人  - 你在开玩笑
- Teach me something, a con.  - You're funny.

722
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,420
不是，好嘛，真的！教教我
No, come on, really! Teach me something.

723
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:24,830
- 我什么也不会教你  - 为什么？
- I'm not teaching you anything.  - Why not?

724
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,430
因为你是一个聪明，天真，漂亮的女孩
Because you're a bright, innocent, beautiful girl...

725
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,570
我不想象其他事情一样搞砸这事
...and I'm not gonna screw that up like everything else.

726
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,830
真的？
Really?

727
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:36,410
- 什么？ - 你真的那么想？
- What?  - You think that?

728
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,670
我很漂亮？
That I'm beautiful?

729
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,470
不是
No.

730
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,150
那为什么不教我？因为没赚头？
Then why won't you? Because crime doesn't pay?

731
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,350
不是，有赚头，只是没那么多
No, it does. It does. Just not very well.

732
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:50,680
- 你看起来干得不错  - 我没有
- You seem to be doing okay.  - I'm not.

733
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,920
相信我，我做的事并不好玩
Believe me, it's no fun doing what I do.

734
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:56,960
一直以来就是从无辜群众那里偷钱罢了
All the time it's stealing from people who don't deserve it.

735
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:59,890
老人家，胖子，寂寞的人
Old people, fat people. Lonely.

736
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,260
很多时候，让我觉得很厌恶
A lot of the time, I feel sick about it.

737
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:06,970
那你为什么要做？
Then why do you do it?

738
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:20,550
我才不像你想的那样天真呢，我和男生做过些事情
I'm not as innocent as you think. I've done stuff with boys.

739
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:24,980
我和男生做过些事情，要是我告诉你
I've done stuff with boys, if I told you...

740
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,290
- 你会吐在这里的  - 那就别讲
- you'd throw up right here.  - Then don't tell me.

741
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:30,260
- 那你教我  - 不！最终决定
- Then teach me something!  - No! Final.

742
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:35,730
去年的圣诞舞会，我和一个叫乔什·沃德的男孩一起去的
At the Christmas dance last year, I went with this boy Josh Ward.

743
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,130
- 他很帅，我真的真的喜欢他  - 我没在听
- He's cute, and I really really liked him.  - I'm not listening.

744
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:42,840
舞会结束后，我们去凯莉家，我们上了楼
After the dance, we went to Carrie's, and we went upstairs

745
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:44,340
然后他把我压倒在床上
and he pushed me against the bed...

746
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:46,310
- 没听  - 然后他的手
- Not listening!  - ...and he took his hand...

747
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,340
- 不！好了！我就教你一招  - 真的？
- No! All right. I'll show you one thing!  - You will?

748
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,650
谢谢你，谢谢
Thank you, thank you!

749
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:54,340
- 好啦，行了  - 谢谢你
- All right, okay...  - Thank you!

750
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:59,460
但你以后绝不能再干，而且要忘了它，同意吗？
But then you're never gonna do it again, and you're gonna forget it. Agreed?

751
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:03,190
圣母玛利亚
Holy Mary.

752
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:06,020
规则一：永远不要在自己家附近下手
Rule number one: Never work near where you live.

753
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,190
不要乱搞…
Don't shit...

754
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:11,130
规则二：什么也别写下来
Rule number two: Don't write anything down.

755
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:21,670
好了，我要你待在车里，行吗？
All right, I want you to stay in the car, okay?

756
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:26,980
嘿！你待在车里行吗？
Hey! Would you stay in the car?

757
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,200
[昨天的中奖号码 6 18 30 49 60]

758
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:47,060
我要签二十二期的乐透彩
I'd like to play this for the drawing on the 22nd.

759
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,510
你知道同一个月里出现相同号码的机率有多低？
You know the odds of the same numbers hitting in the same month? Same numbers hitting in ever?

760
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,510
相同号码有史以来的几率？
Same numbers hitting in ever?

761
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,480
所以我才改了一个号码
Well, that's why I changed one.

762
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:03,390
你这是在浪费钱
You're wasting your dollar.

763
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,580
嘿，你是他的财务顾问吗？不是
Hey. You his financial adviser? No.

764
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:08,560
你只是个便利商店的收银员
You're a cashier at a convenience store.

765
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,560
收下他的钱把二十二期彩券给他
Take his dollar and give him a ticket on the 22nd.

766
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:15,600
- 你有这个架势了  - 我生来如此
- You're ready for this.  - I was born ready.

767
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:19,030
真高兴我错过了那一天
Glad I missed that day.

768
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:28,740
好了，这场游戏里需要了解最重要的事情
Okay, the most important thing to understand about this game is...

769
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,550
有百分之九十都是不确定因素
...ninety percent of it is variable.

770
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,450
无论多好的计划，你几乎总是会遇到状况
No matter how good a plan is, you almost always get thrown a curve.

771
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:37,750
所以你一定要有弹性，要会随机应变
So you gotta be flexible, prepared to roll with anything.

772
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,190
- 我明白  - 就这两件事
- I'll do it.  - Just the 2.

773
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,960
然而，你能够控制的一件事，就是你的目标是谁
The one thing you can control, though, is who your mark is.

774
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:45,990
永远别跟那些不买你要卖的东西的人玩
Never play someone who isn't buying what you're selling.

775
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,760
你在想“老爸，我在卖什么呢”？
You're thinking, "Dady, dady, what am I selling?"

776
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,590
好了，你就是要推销自己
Well, what you're selling is you.

777
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:50,630
越老越好
And the older the better.

778
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:54,430
要提防夫妻，你不能让任何人跟目标讲悄悄话，除了你
Beware of couples. You don't want anyone whispering in your mark's ear, but you.

779
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:59,700
还有，以上帝的名义，你得确定你要骗的人不是在骗你
For God's sake, make sure the person you're conning isn't conning you.

780
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:02,870
就是这样，好了，我们来找个冤大头吧
That's good. All right. Let's go kick some butt.

781
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,150
- 这有人用吗？ - 没有
- This taken?  - No.

782
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:11,890
你确定？你衣服好多
You sure? You've got a lot.

783
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:15,730
这没什么，你应该看看打少棒赛时的我
This is nothing. You ought to catch me during Little League season.

784
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,000
三个儿子
Three boys.

785
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,260
他们可爱吗？
Any of them cute?

786
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:24,200
赛门差不多你这年纪，不过你都猜不到，他太皮了
Simon's about your age. Though you'd never guess. He's so hyper.

787
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:28,140
- 我要去买汽水，你需要什么吗？ - 不了，谢谢
- I'm gonna get a soda. Want anything?  - No, thanks. Honey.

788
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:35,650
哦，宝贝，你掉了东西
Oh, honey. You dropped something.

789
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,440
- 不是我的  - 你确定？
- Not mine.  - You sure?

790
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,020
要满十八岁才能玩
You gotta be 18 to play.

791
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,920
看来是某个人不小心把它给洗了
Looks like someone put it through the wash by accident.

792
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:49,760
昨天的号码，看起来是第二个
Yesterday's drawing. That looks like the second.

793
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,870
也许是哪个废物
Probably a loser.

794
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:55,530
是啊
Yeah.

795
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,450
我们至少应该看看它有没有中
We should at least see if it hit.

796
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:21,860
抱歉，先生，我们能不能借一下你的报纸？
Excuse me, sir. Can we borrow your paper for a sec?

797
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:25,050
- 我们想查一下中奖号码  - 行，没问题
- We're just looking for lottery results.  - Yeah, okay.

798
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:27,530
都会版，对吧？给你
Metro, isn't it? Here.

799
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,030
- 谢了  - 别客气
- Thanks.  - Yeah.

800
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,500
让我们看一下，在这里，好了，开始了？
Let's see. There it is. Okay, ready?

801
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:37,540
- 六、十八、三十、四九  - 等等，六、十八，然后呢？
- Six, 18, 30, 49...  - Wait. Six, 18, what?

802
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:40,910
抱歉，三十、四九、六十
Sorry. Thirty, 49, 60.

803
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:44,170
- 差了一号  - 哦，开玩笑吧
- Missed by one.  - Oh, you're joking!

804
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:47,850
- 我生活的写照  - 我也是
- Story of my life.  - Mine too.

805
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:51,020
- 中了吗？ - 五中四，你能相信吗？
- Any luck?  - Four out of five. Can you believe that?

806
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:53,460
五中四？那就有五分之四的奖金
Four out of five? Four out of five pays.

807
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:54,990
- 有吗？ - 当然，对啊
- It does?  - Sure, yeah.

808
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,530
打背面的电话号码问问看
Call the number on the back of the ticket.

809
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:00,390
谢谢
Well, thanks!

810
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:11,240
- 这样，谢谢你，非常感谢  - 他们怎么说？
- Well, thank you. Thank you very much.  - What did they say?

811
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:17,310
我们中了六百块
We won $600!

812
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:21,780
- 天了噜！ - 圣母！六百块！
- Holy shit!  - Holy moly! Six hundred dollars!

813
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,110
中奖二人组
Couple of winners.

814
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:29,920
那女人说我们只要拿去核实，他们就会把支票寄过来
The woman said we just take it down for verification, and they'll mail me a check.

815
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:33,030
我们应该给你妈妈打电话，我们一起去领奖
We should call your mom and we can all go down together.

816
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,290
- 没关系啦，我该回家了  - 不，不，不
- It's okay, I'm supposed to be home.  - No, no, no.

817
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:39,200
我们五五分账
We're in this 50-50.

818
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,580
好女孩
Good girl.

819
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:54,380
避开了摄像头
Watch the cameras.

820
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:00,120
就是这样
That's it.

821
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,960
三百块
Three hundred dollars.

822
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:08,420
不要在投币机里一次花光，回家后把它藏好
Don't spend it all at the coin-op. Hide it when you get home.

823
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,020
- 我还可以吗？ - 你做得…
- Did I do good?  - You did...

824
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,590
你做得非常好，非常，非常，非常好
You did very good. Very, very, very good.

825
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:33,980
看吧？老妈错了，我不只遗传到你的手肘
See? Mom was wrong. I didn't just get your elbows.

826
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:38,350
- 嗯，最后一件事  - 是什么？
- Well, there's one last thing.  - What?

827
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:41,160
- 我要你把钱还给她  - 什么？
- I want you to give her the money back.  - What?

828
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:45,400
我是说我会教你怎么骗人，但我可没说我会让你玩真的
I told you I'd teach you a con, I didn't say I'd let you get away with it.

829
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:48,730
那我要怎么说啊？
What am I supposed to say?

830
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:52,640
从你刚才的表演看来，我确信你会想出办法的
Judging by that last performance, I'm sure you'll think of something.

831
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,440
这实在太…
This is so...

832
01:00:55,610 --> 01:01:00,860
安吉拉，如果我让你得逞，我就不是个负责任的父亲，去吧
Angela, I would not be a responsible father if I let you get away with this. Let's go!

833
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:10,530
我说，这很怪，两周前，这不过是段陈年往事
I mean, it's strange. Two weeks ago, this was ancient history.

834
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,720
现在，突然间…
Now, all of a sudden...

835
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,490
我有了个女儿！
...I have a daughter!

836
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:19,170
而我并没有被吓坏，这是好事，对吧？
And I'm not scared shitless. That's good, isn't it?

837
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:22,140
- 你无论如何感受都可以，罗伊  - 没错
- It's however you feel about it, Roy.  - Yeah.

838
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:25,580
是的，这太棒了
Yes, it's wonderful.

839
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:30,310
别太照字面意思理解，但你关上门很长时间了
Don't take this too literally, but you've been closing doors for a long time.

840
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,450
这是好事，见到你开始打开一点
It's good to see you start opening some again.

841
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,180
怎么了？
What?

842
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:39,520
我带着安吉拉跟我过周末，卖一样东西
I took Angela along with me over the weekend, selling a piece.

843
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,960
而我的工作有时候…
And sometimes in my business...

844
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:47,660
你不得不给某样东西定个价，而它一文不值
...you have to create a value for something which really isn't there.

845
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:52,330
有些人说这叫推销，但别的人则叫它…
Some people call it sales, but other people call it...

846
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:55,600
- 骗人  - 没错，这有点…
- Lying.  - Right. Which is a little...

847
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:59,210
我当时不确定安吉拉会如何应对，但她心领神会
I wasn't sure how Angela would go for it, but she took right to it.

848
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,080
如鱼得水，她心领神会，她甚至还帮了忙
Like a duck to water. She took right to it. She even helped out.

849
01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:04,380
你知道，这个十四岁的女孩
You know, this 14-year-old girl...

850
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:08,420
和我一起操纵那些人
...working these people with me.

851
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:10,420
操纵他们，医生
Working them, doc.

852
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:14,890
你后悔了吗？向她暴露这些？让她看见你的这一面？
Do you regret it? Exposing her to that? Her seeing that side of you?

853
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:19,330
那个嘛，你知道，这有点…这让我觉得…我有点…
Well, you know, it was a little...It made me feel... I was a little...

854
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:21,260
我真的喜欢这样
I really liked it.

855
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,660
我真的喜欢，那是我俩度过的最好时光
I really did. It was the best time we've had together.

856
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,900
好
Right.

857
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,450
- 了不起的杯子把戏  - 你喜欢吗？
- Fabulous cup trick.  - You like that?

858
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,410
他要带钱飞到开曼群岛去，害怕自己会被抢
He wants to fly the money to the Caymans. Afraid he might get robbed.

859
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:22,250
像是有人会抢他一样，他什么时候的航班？
As if somebody would do that. When's his flight?

860
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:24,020
星期五，你怎么想的？
Friday. What do you think?

861
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,320
关于什么？这帽子吗？
About what? The hat?

862
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,320
[德怀特·尤卡姆：乡村歌手]
帽子边有点德怀特·尤卡姆，你说呢？
It's a little Dwight Yoakam around the edges. Is this what you say?

863
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,490
[德怀特·尤卡姆：乡村歌手]
- 你在引人注意  - 对，但小妞们买账
- You're calling attention to yourself.  - Yeah, but the chicks dig it.

864
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,430
- 你在引人注意  - 小妞们买账
- You're calling attention to yourself.  - Chicks dig it.

865
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,400
那么你想在哪呢？
So where do you think?

866
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:35,600
你打算在哪里下手？
Where do you want to do it?

867
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,140
那里
There.

868
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:57,820
我在这里，他坐那里
I'm here. He sits there.

869
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:00,200
背对吧台
Back to the bar.

870
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:03,030
背对吧台，这很重要
Back to the bar. It's important.

871
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,930
否则，我们就吹了
Otherwise, we blow it off.

872
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,160
好
Okay.

873
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,240
- 谁来干呢？ - 厄尼
- Who's it going to be?  - Ernie.

874
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:13,270
游民厄尼？
Hobo Ernie?

875
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:15,340
对，流浪汉厄尼
Yeah, homeless Ernie.

876
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:18,580
他有点…他有点夸张，不是吗？
He's a little...he's a little over the top, isn't he?

877
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:21,080
就五十块钱，你知道，便宜到顶了
For 50 bucks, you know, it's a hell of a bargain.

878
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:23,240
好吧好吧
Okay, okay.

879
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:25,110
- 现在只有一个问题  - 什么？
- There's only one problem.  - What?

880
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:28,210
我想我爱上你了
I think I'm in love with you.

881
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:30,980
- 我们要发财了  - 别这样
- We're gonna be rich.  - Do not do that.

882
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:33,150
真让人尴尬，快停下
That's embarrassing. Just stop.

883
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:36,460
- 让你兴奋了吗？ - 不，没让我兴奋，停下
- Does it turn you on?  - No, it does not turn me on. Stop.

884
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:37,660
你能…？
Can you...?

885
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:39,990
拿去
Here you go.

886
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:45,070
- 你那个可爱的小女孩呢？ - 她回她妈家去了
- Where's that cute little girl of yours?  - She went home to her mom's.

887
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,300
暑期班
Summer school.

888
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,140
她很可爱
She's a cute one.

889
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:52,110
她不在一定很寂寞
Must be lonesome without her.

890
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:55,150
- 明天见  - 好
- See you tomorrow.  - Okay.

891
01:04:57,420 --> 01:05:00,410
- 你是凯西，对吗？ - 是的
- It's Kathy, right?  - Yeah.

892
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:05,380
- 我叫罗伊  - 嗨，罗伊
- I'm Roy.  - Hi, Roy.

893
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:10,960
- 你好吗？ - 我很好
- How are you?  - I'm doing all right.

894
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:16,800
嗨，老爸，是我，我只是想打声招呼
Hi, Dad, it's me. I just wanted to say hi.

895
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:21,370
暑期辅导有些烂，所以我星期三中午出来
Summer school sort of sucks. Okay, so I get out at noon on Wednesday.

896
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:25,210
愿意的话我在门口跟你见面，好了，拜拜
I'll meet you out in front if you want. Okay. Bye.

897
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,220
嗨，老爸，是我，我只是想打声招呼
Hi, Dad, it's me. I just wanted to say hi.

898
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:05,150
- 变态佬  - 上车
- Pervert.  - Get in the car.

899
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:08,150
你今天想做什么，小女孩？
What would you like to do today, little girl?

900
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,820
- 妈要我在晚餐前回家  - 你晚饭前能回家
- Mom wants me home by dinner.  - You'll be back by dinner.

901
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:12,120
你想做什么？
What would you like to do?

902
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,150
怎样？
What?

903
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:34,950
- 我赢定了  - 哦，是吗？
- I own you.  - Oh, yeah?

904
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:38,750
咱们得走着瞧
We'll just have to see about that.

905
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:49,090
让我露两手，在台湾学到的给你瞧瞧
Let me show you a little something I learned in Taiwan.

906
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:57,100
- 怎样？ - 老爸
- What?  - Dad...

907
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:59,640
关于这游戏你要了解的第一件事是：
...the first thing you need to understand about this game is...

908
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:03,230
你出手十次有九次是洗沟
...is 90 percent of it is knocking down at least one pin.

909
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:05,170
哦，是那样吗？是那样吗？
Oh, is that right? Is that right?

910
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:11,450
不是吧！
Not now!

911
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:17,050
- 你要我帮你打吗？ - 好啊，我只要几分钟
- You want me to bowl for you?  - Yeah, I'll just be a couple of minutes.

912
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:19,290
- 你没问题吧？ - 没事
- You'll be all right?  - Yeah.

913
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:20,460
好
All right.

914
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:24,360
最好是很重要的事情，我跟女儿在一起呢
This better be pretty important. I'm with my daughter

915
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:26,260
- 坏消息，他改期了  - 什么？
- It's bad news. He bumped it up.  - What?

916
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:28,740
- 他改期了，我们得今天动手  - 我以为是星期五
- He bumped it up. We gotta do it today.  - I thought it was Friday.

917
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:30,900
我也以为是星期五，可是他改了
I thought it was Friday too, but he changed it.

918
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:32,600
- 我们现在就得动手  - 跟他讲啊
- We gotta do it now.  - Tell him!

919
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:35,570
我要跟他讲什么，罗伊？我们不能延期
What am I gonna tell him, Roy? We can't postpone it.

920
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:39,510
他要去开曼群岛一个月，我们必须马上动手，否则就失败了
He's leaving for the Caymans for a month. We've gotta do it now. Or we're gonna loss it.

921
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:43,350
看，没时间了，我得去拿钱，我得换装，我得找厄尼…
Look, there's no time. I gotta get the money, I gotta get changed, I gotta get Ernie...

922
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,080
我知道，我知道，可我们没有选择
I know, I know. But we got no choice.

923
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,920
他几点的班机？
What time is his flight?

924
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:49,720
罗伊
Roy.

925
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,630
- 罗伊？ - 该死
- Roy?  - Shit.

926
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:57,260
轮到你了
Your turn.

927
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:03,200
对不起，我得送你回家了
I'm sorry, I gotta take you home.

928
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:07,990
不行，我不行，来不及了，我都不能送你回家
I can't. I just can't. I can't do this. There's no time. I can't even take you home.

929
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,100
- 你要我自己去搭公车吗？ - 不不，该死！
- Do you want me to take the bus?  - No, no. Shit!

930
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:13,380
是工作吗？
Is it a job?

931
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:15,850
我帮得上忙吗？
Can I help?

932
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:21,590
上车
Get in.

933
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:27,690
我以为你说过，你把钱存在那只狗里面
I thought you said that kept your money in the dog.

934
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:31,800
那只是我的存钱罐，好了，我要你在这里等着
That's just my piggy bank. All right, I want you to wait here.

935
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,930
- 要开保险箱，拜托  - 没问题
- Hi, safety deposit box, please.  - Of course.

936
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:49,820
我要开三六六号的保险箱
I'd like to access safety deposit box 366.

937
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,050
签名还有密码，请
Signature and pass code, please.

938
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:58,790
- 我为什么不能看？ - 因为这是秘密
- Why can't I see?  - Because it's secret.

939
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,690
那她为什么就可以？
Then why does she get to?

940
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:04,530
我能给我的账户增加一个访问签名吗？
Can I add an access signature to my account, please?

941
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,220
当然
Certainly.

942
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:14,670
- 在这里和这里签名  - 签吧
- Sign here and here.  - Do it.

943
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,370
现在，不管是什么我都可以拿了吗？
Now can I get into the whatever-it-is?

944
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:19,270
不行，你没有密码
No, you don't have the pass code.

945
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:22,980
- 那我什么时候会有？ - 你知道，等我死了
- When do I get that?  - You know, when I'm dead.

946
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:24,980
你在这里等着
You wait here.

947
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:26,880
我认真的
I mean it.

948
01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:33,290
- 小间？ - 不，不要小间
- Booth?  - No! No! No booth!

949
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:52,170
- 那么里面有多少钱？ - 我说过了
- So how much is in there?  - I told you.

950
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:54,080
不，那里面！
No, in there!

951
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:55,840
三十万？
Three hundred thousand?

952
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:57,610
五十万？
Five hundred thousand?

953
01:09:57,790 --> 01:09:58,780
一百万？
A million?

954
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:03,490
哦，我的天啊！你怎么会有这么多钱？
Oh, my God! How did you get that money?

955
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:05,420
我干这行已经很久了
I've been doing this a long time.

956
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:09,290
你为什么不？你为什么不住到夏威夷去？
Why aren't you...? Why don't you go live in Hawaii?

957
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,660
- 你为什么不把夏威夷买下来？ - 我跟你说过，我不喜欢户外
- Why don't you go buy Hawaii?  - I told you. I don't like the outdoors.

958
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:19,630
好，你知道怎么做，对吧？离我们远远的
Okay, you know what to do, right? Keep real far away from us.

959
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:22,800
- 出了任何事，你就离开那里  - 好
- Anything goes off, you get out of there.  - Yeah.

960
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:27,250
把结婚金戒指递给我，宝贝
Hand me a gold wedding ring, sweetheart.

961
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:29,680
谢谢，它仍然让我显老？
Thank you. These still make me look old?

962
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:32,050
又老又有钱
Old and rich.

963
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:34,580
好了，你记得暗号，对吧？
Okay, you remember your cue, right?

964
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:38,060
- 这就是暗号，然后你就来  - 我知道
- That's your cue. Then you enter.  - I know.

965
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:40,190
好，咱们干吧
Okay, let's do this.

966
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:53,030
预防万一，收下它，好吧？
And just in case, take this, will you?

967
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:57,650
别再紧张我了，我还什么都还没做呢
Stop worrying about me. I'm barely even doing anything.

968
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:16,420
我跟她一起出去，但后来我却焦头烂额
I went out with her, but afterwards I was pretty toasted.

969
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,570
- 她有姐妹吗？ - 我不知道
- Does she have any sisters?  - I don't know.

970
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,610
- 亚顿，你还好吗？ - 我的背，我昨晚扭伤了
- Arden, you okay?  - It's my back. I strained it last night.

971
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:36,710
- 哦，老兄，我跟你说过，你得练瑜珈  - 我当时是在练瑜珈
- Oh, man. I told you, you gotta do yoga.  - I was doing yoga.

972
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,890
你介意我坐这里吗？椅背会让我舒服点
Do you mind if I sit there? The high back helps.

973
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,960
- 完全不  - 谢了
- Not at all.  - Thank you.

974
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:50,130
哦，天啊
Oh, Lord.

975
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:56,760
- 你们两个好吗？ - 好极了，谁先来？
- How are both of you?  - Fabulous. So who goes first?

976
01:11:57,510 --> 01:12:00,970
我猜是女士优先，女王先于本·富兰克林
I suppose ladies do. The queen before Ben Franklin.

977
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,220
- 这是八万？ - 没错
- That's 80,000?  - Yeah.

978
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:16,390
看着比我想像中少很多
Looks like a lot less than I thought.

979
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:19,390
总是这样，总是这样
It always does. It always does.

980
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:23,130
抱歉，我得查点一下
Sorry. I had to check.

981
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,330
只要你不介意
As long as you don't mind.

982
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:28,770
不不，还信不过你吗？
No, no. Do your worst.

983
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,610
你数过了？
It's been counted?

984
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:40,080
先生们，看来我们成交了
Gentlemen, looks like we have a trade.

985
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:42,380
- 天佑美国  - 我热爱的土地
- God bless America.  - Land that I love.

986
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:46,080
好好享受开曼岛，别晒太多太阳
Enjoy the Caymans, and don't get too much sun.

987
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:49,880
得了，我二十一岁了！我的身分证在行李里
Come on, I'm 21! My ID is in my luggage!

988
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:53,290
我的飞机半小时后才起飞，给我…
My plane doesn't leave for 30 minutes, give me...

989
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:57,820
别碰我！你敢碰我，我就把这个地方的所有杯子都砸烂
Don't touch me! You touch me, I'll break every glass in this place!

990
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:02,030
嘿，机场酒保！
Hey, airport bartender!

991
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:06,500
希望她不是我一个航班的
Hope she's not on my flight.

992
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,770
说到这，时间差不多了
Speaking of which, it's about that time.

993
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:12,380
那么，谁先走？
So who goes first?

994
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:16,540
你先，你站起来把新皮箱一起带走
You do. You just get up and take your new briefcase with you.

995
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:19,410
我走的时候，把我的新运动包带走
When I leave, I'll take my new gym bag.

996
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,950
- 简单就是安全  - 简单就是安全
- Simple is safe.  - Simple is safe.

997
01:13:23,530 --> 01:13:25,550
各位
Guys.

998
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:27,630
- 一路平安  - 谢了
- Have a safe flight.  - Thank you.

999
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,990
- 保重，恰克  - 有机会再合作
- Take care, Chuck!  - Let's do it again sometime.

1000
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:31,720
一言为定
You have my word on that.

1001
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:35,530
- 跟他去，送他去登机  - 跟他走什么？
- Go with him. Walk him to the plane.  - Walk him to the what?

1002
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:38,210
- 送他去登机！ - 他们不会让你过安检的
- Walk him to the plane!  - They won't let you to the security check.

1003
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:41,410
那就送他到安检那里，快点，快去！
Then walk him to the security check. Now. Go. Now!

1004
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,790
你看见吧台那个化了妆的老娘们了吗？
Did you see that old chick at the bar with the makeup?

1005
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:05,760
- 对，我看见了  - 我摔杯子时，差点把她给吓死了
- Yeah, I saw her.  - She almost died ...when I threw that glass....

1006
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:07,940
- 怎么样了？你拿下他了？ - 对
- So, what happened? You take him?  - Yeah.

1007
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:09,670
整八万？
The whole 80?

1008
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:13,430
我老爸妙手空空
My dad's a smooth operator!

1009
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:19,510
爸，我想过了，我们呢该把钱还回去，我会觉得好点
Dad, I thought about it. We should give the money back. I'd feel better.

1010
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,810
开玩笑的
Just kidding.

1011
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:24,350
- 我可以分一份吗？ - 去跟弗兰克分
- Do I get a cut?  - Ask Frank for his.

1012
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:25,510
老爸
Dad! Dad!

1013
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:29,020
下车！你这个下流的骗子！出来！
Get out of the car, you lousy, two-bit con! Get out!

1014
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:32,020
- 给我下车  - 你在干嘛啊？
- Get out of the car!  - What are you doing?

1015
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,590
还我的钱来！还我的钱来！
Give me my money! Give me my money!

1016
01:14:36,230 --> 01:14:38,860
- 你这个卑鄙的小人  - 把车窗摇起来
- You stinking little runt!  - Roll up the window!

1017
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:41,590
还我的钱来，你这浑蛋！卑鄙…小…
Give me my money, you bitch! Stinking, little...

1018
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:43,360
- 趴下来  - 把钱还给我
- Get down!  - Give me my money!

1019
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:44,840
摇起车窗！
Roll up the window!

1020
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:46,840
你这坨屎！
You piece of shit!

1021
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,490
该死的！
Goddamn it!

1022
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:08,690
在这种情况下，保持冷静非常重要
In this situation, it's very important to remain calm.

1023
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,360
对不起
I'm so sorry.

1024
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:16,600
- 哪一边？哪一边？ - 中间那个！中间那个
- Which one? Which one?  - The middle one! The middle one.

1025
01:15:16,770 --> 01:15:17,900
这个也行
Or this one.

1026
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:20,560
那个，那个
That one! That one!

1027
01:15:22,410 --> 01:15:24,810
快点，快点，快点！
Come on, come on! Come on!

1028
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:28,150
- 行了  - 可以给我收据吗？
- Here you go.  - Can I get a receipt?

1029
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,870
- 好，可以给你一张  - 快点
- I can get you one.  - Let's go!

1030
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,310
我买个汉堡也要收据
I want a hamburger I'll take a receipt...

1031
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:33,610
你连吃个汉堡都要收据？
You saved a receipt for a hamburger?

1032
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:34,810
快点
Come on!

1033
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:38,690
- 我能理解，先生  - 深呼吸，深呼吸
- I understand that, sir.  - Just breathe. Breathe.

1034
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:41,260
可以节税，祝你愉快，谢谢
Save that tax. Have a great day. Thank you.

1035
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,600
不用找了，好吗？
Keep the change, okay?

1036
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:47,090
- 不，先生，我们不允许收小费  - 这是一点心意
- No, sir. We're not allowed to accept gratuity.  - It's kindness.

1037
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:51,210
谢谢好意，可是我们不准收，请收下找零
Thanks for being kind, but we're not allowed. Please, take the change.

1038
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:53,000
那就快点
Let's go, come on!

1039
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:56,080
- 五、六、七、八  - 快点，他追来了
- Five, 6, 7, 8...  - Hurry, he's coming!

- ...9, 10, 11, 12...  - He's coming!

1041
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:02,510
- 你失心疯了？ - 先生！不好意思！
- Are you out of your mind?  - Sir! Excuse me!

1042
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:39,440
你待在车里
You stay in the car.

1043
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:42,750
怎么怎么，怎么了？
What what what? What's wrong?

1044
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:44,650
待在车里
Stay in the car!

1045
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,750
嗨，小可爱
Hi, cutie-pie.

1046
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,370
- 你从哪里弄来…？ - 你做了什么？
- Where did you get the...?  - What did you do?

1047
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:01,630
我说了…
I told you...

1048
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:04,970
我说要送他去登机！你有送他去登机吗？
I said walk him to the plane! Did you walk him to the plane?

1049
01:17:05,150 --> 01:17:07,580
我说过，安检，没机票到不了登机口
I told you, the security. You can't get to the gate without a ticket!

1050
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:10,350
那你亲眼看见他过安检了吗？
Did you see him go through security...?

1051
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:16,920
我女儿今天就在现场！
My daughter was there today!

1052
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:18,590
嘿，又不是我把她拉进来的
Hey, hey, I'm not the one who pimped her...

1053
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:19,560
什么，什么？
What? What?

1054
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,760
我说又不是我让她淌这趟浑水的
I said I'm not the one who pimped her into the fucking grift!

1055
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:25,070
别跟我说是我给她带来危险，是她给我们带来危险！
And don't tell me I'm the one who put her at risk. She put us at risk!

1056
01:17:25,070 --> 01:17:28,030
- 怎么说？ - 要是他去找警察呢，老兄？
- How?  - What if he goes to the cops, man?

1057
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,400
- 他不会，他们从不会  - 要是他会呢？
- He won't. They never do.  - What if he does?

1058
01:17:30,570 --> 01:17:35,740
那他就得解释，带着一个装八万块钱的公事包干嘛
He'd have to explain what he's doing with a briefcase ...with $80,000 cash in it...

1059
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:38,280
还有去开曼的机票，明白？
...and a ticket to the Caymans, okay?

1060
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:42,820
我们没有案底，我们是安全的
We're not on the books. We're safe.

1061
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:44,950
我知道我们是，那她呢？
I know we are. What about her?

1062
01:17:45,690 --> 01:17:50,850
- 安吉拉从来没被逮过  - 你并不知道，你并不知道
Angela's never been arrested, all right?  You don't know that. You don't know that.

1063
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:06,530
关掉
Turn it off.

1064
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:08,780
好了，告诉他，安吉拉
All right, tell him, Angela.

1065
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:10,980
咱们说清楚，告诉他你没有前科
Let's get this over with. Tell him you're clean.

1066
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:14,140
你从来没被逮过，对吗？
You've never been arrested, have you?

1067
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:20,980
太赞了，太棒了
That's terrific. That's great.

1068
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,450
真是漂亮
That's beautiful.

1069

弗兰克
Frank

1070
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:31,260
钱在这里，打电话给我
Here's the money. Give me a call.

1071
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:33,830
耶稣基督
Jesus Christ.

1072
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:42,980
十四岁，你十四岁！你怎么有时间被捕呢？
You're 14! When did you have time to get arrested?

1073
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,210
有一次我买口香糖忘记付钱了，就这
I forgot to pay for a pack of gum once. That's it.

1074
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:50,580
哦，那他们就为了一包口香糖报警？
So they called the cops on you over a pack of gum?

1075
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:51,880
还有别的事
And some other stuff.

1076
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:56,350
我可能和保安起了冲突…
I might have put up a fuss when security...

1077
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,750
安吉拉
Angela!

1078
01:18:58,330 --> 01:18:59,880
那个警卫骚扰我
The guard was groping me.

1079
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:03,690
他抓着我的胸部，我还能怎么办？
He was grabbing at my chest. What was I supposed to do?

1080
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:07,830
- 多久以前的事？ - 去年
- How long ago?  - Last year.

1081
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,030
他们给你照相了？印指模了？
They photographed you? They printed you?

1082
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:16,130
把脚移开
Move your leg.

1083
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:34,720
你知道吗，我整个八月都有空，我本来想我可以去找你
You know, I have all of August off. I was thinking I could come visit you.

1084
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,790
我们还可以去旅行
We could take a trip, even.

1085
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:40,520
到了九月，是学校的父亲参观日，有些无聊，不过…
In September is fathers' visiting day at school. It's kind of lame, but...

1086
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:45,740
嗯，接下来的几个月我都不在
Yeah, well, I'll be gone for the next couple of months.

1087
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:48,670
弗兰克和我得出城去工作，所以
Frank and I have some out-of-town work, so...

1088
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:58,680
- 那你觉得什么时候能回来？ - 我不知道，实际上
- When do you think you'll be back?  - I don't know, actually.

1089
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:04,850
- 或许等你回来后…  - 好了，听好
- Maybe when you get back...  - Okay, look.

1090
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:07,290
你碍着我们了，懂吗？
You're getting in the way, okay?

1091
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:12,330
你知道，弗兰克和我是搭档，而他说你得走路
You know, Frank and I are partners, and he says you're gone.

1092
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,370
那你就得走路
So you're gone.

1093
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:18,800
我以为或许能行得通，可是不行，不行
I thought maybe it could work out, but it can't. It doesn't.

1094
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:22,210
- 快点  - 我不舒服
- Come on.  - I feel sick.

1095
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:25,610
快点下车，快点，走吧
Just get out of the car. Let's go. Come on. Go!

1096

- 我不要走  - 走
- I don't want to go.  - Go!

1097
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,480
安吉拉，快走，下车，快点
Angela, move. Get out of the car. Come on.

1098
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:33,620

走
Go!

1100
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:38,690
也不要再打电话给我，懂吗？不准
And don't ever call me again, okay? Don't.

1101
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:48,230
那是什么？
What's that?

1102
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:49,960
那是什么？
What's that?

1103
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:52,700
我在机场买给你的
I got it for you at the airport.

1104
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:55,040
我付了钱的

- Why did you even call me?  - Okay, Angila, I'm sorry.

- 为什么？ - 安吉，我很抱歉，我很抱歉
- Why did you?  - Angie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

来吧，回车上来，对不起，行吗？
Come on. Come on back in the car. Come on. I'm sorry, okay?

1108

对不起
I'm sorry.

1109
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:13,460
你不是坏人，你知道，只是你也不算很好
You're not a bad guy, you're just not a very good one.

1110
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,380

抱歉，他不在，威利医生有空，你愿意我帮你接他吗？
I'm sorry. He's unavailable. Dr. Wiley is on call if you'd like me to page him.

1124
01:22:39,110 --> 01:22:42,050
那很好，不过，我必须跟克莱恩谈
That's very good, but actually, I gotta talk to Klein.

1125
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:44,720
有什么办法可以联络上他吗？
Is there a way I can get ahold of him?

01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:21,950
该死！我记不得了，哦，普利发还是什么的
Dam it! I can't remember... Prefex something.

1147
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:24,780
我很抱歉，先生，没有处方笺，我什么也不能做
I'm sorry, sir. Without a prescription, there's nothing I can do.

1148
01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:29,850
可是我有包装，所以我显然是被允许拿药的
But I have the packet, so I'm clearly allowed to have them.

1149
01:24:29,850 --> 01:24:32,780
我只需要四、五颗，让我撑过这个周末
I need four or five of them to cover me for the weekend.

1150
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:35,120
- 让我看看  - 谢谢
- Let me see it.  - Thank you.

1151
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:37,090
我很抱歉，先生
And I am sorry, sir.

1152
01:24:37,670 --> 01:24:39,530
- 这些是营养补充剂  - 什么？
- These are supplements.  - What?

1153
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,800
- 这里面是营养补充剂，先生  - 不，不，不
- This packet contains supplements, sir.  - No, no, no.

1154
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:45,260
是医生给我的，它们是普利发
My doctor gave those to me. They're Prefex.

1155
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,910
- 它们是营养补充剂，先生  - 胡说，老兄！普利发
- They're supplements, sir  - Bullshit, man! Prefex.

1156
01:24:48,910 --> 01:24:50,610
- 萨普利芬  - 普利发
- Supplifem.  - Prefex!

1157
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:52,910
- 在第四排，先生  - 普利发
- Aisle four, sir.  - Prefex!

1158
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:54,750
你叫警卫了吗？
Did you call security?

1159
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:09,320
[萨普利芬 大豆蛋白 更年期补充剂]

1160
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,230
你给我的就是这个？
Did you give me this?

1161
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:13,390
- 是的  - 为什么？
- Yes.  - Why?

1162
01:25:13,570 --> 01:25:17,970
- 因为你没必要吃药  - 看看我，我糟透了
- Because you don't need medication.  - Look at me, I'm a mess.

1163
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:21,700
同意，不过你上星期还好，你也…
Agreed. But you weren't a mess last week, and you weren't on...

1164
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:24,280
不需要普利发
...Prefexall then either.

1165
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:27,110
我有新消息，你的神经症状没什么
I have news for you. Your neurosis is small-time.

1166
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:31,810
没什么？你是哪门子的？你他妈的庸医！
Small-time? What are you a...? You fucking quack!

1167
01:25:31,990 --> 01:25:33,750
你的良心就另当别论了
Your conscience is another story.

1168
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:37,380
我问你个问题，如果要转行，你会干什么？
Let me ask a question. What would you do if you had to change careers?

1169
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:40,320
什么，要是我不当古董经纪？
What, if I wasn't an antiques broker?

1170
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:41,920
要是你不当罪犯
If you weren't a criminal.

1171
01:25:42,930 --> 01:25:46,500
我放过脚的是一只十八世纪安妮王后的脚凳，罗伊
That's an 18th century Queen Anne footstool I've had my feet on, Roy.

1172
01:25:46,670 --> 01:25:50,330
曾经有电脑工程师跟我说过它多么好
I've had computer programmers tell me what a nice piece it is.

1173
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:53,570
我才不是什么罪犯
I'm not a criminal.

1174
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:55,970
我是行骗艺术家
I'm a con artist.

1175
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:59,610
- 区别是？ - 钱是他们给我的
- The difference being?  - They give me their money.

1176
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:01,150
真是合理的说法，罗伊
That's a nice rationalization, Roy

1177
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:05,250
我搞的人都是出于贪心和缺点才让我得手
I never took anybody who didn't let me out of greed or weakness.

1178
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:07,850
而且我从不
And I never...

1179
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:09,320
使用暴力
...used violence.

1180
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:14,230
你是说你给这一行树立了榜样？
Would you say then you set an example in your trade?

1181
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,190
当之无愧
You bet I do.

1182
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:19,960
可是你现在得给另一个人树立榜样
But now you have to set an example for someone else.

1183
01:26:20,270 --> 01:26:22,200
她还好吗？
How is she?

1184
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:24,000
安吉拉
Angela.

1185
01:26:24,570 --> 01:26:26,400
她很好
She's fine.

1186
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:28,200
她回她妈那儿了
She went back to her mom's.

1187
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,410
你跟她谈过吗？
Have you spoken to her?

1188
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:33,350
为什么不？
Why not?

1189
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:37,680
我们一定要讨论这件事吗？
Do we have to talk about this?

1190
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:40,180
你们为什么不谈谈？
Why haven't you spoken?

1191
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:41,210
因为…
Because...

1192
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:43,410
她恨我
she hates me.

1193
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:45,690
你怎么认为她恨你呢？
Why do you think she hates you?

1194
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,460
因为
Because...

1195
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,940
因为我搞砸了
Because I screwed it up.

1196
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:02,200
哦，老天，我失去了我的小姑娘了
Oh, God. I lost my little girl.

1197
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:05,880
我失去我的小姑娘
I lost my little girl.

1198
01:27:35,810 --> 01:27:37,680
我很高兴…
I'm happy to...

1199
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:41,910
我去见过一个律师
I went to see a lawyer.

1200
01:27:44,290 --> 01:27:47,020
他的专业是监护权
He specializes in custody suits.

1201
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:48,750
那一类事情
That sort of thing.

1202
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:54,290
比如父母一方想要孩子的共同监护权
Like when one parent wants to get joint custody of the child.

1203
01:27:55,930 --> 01:27:58,420
你必须做一些事情
There are things you have to do...

1204
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,070
提出书面文件
...file some paperwork...

1205
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:05,270
验血，面对一个法官
...blood tests, go before a judge.

1206
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:10,840
一开始只有周末和一些假日见面
It would only be for weekends and some holidays to start.

1207
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:16,180
不过我必须得做许多改变
But I'd have to make a lot of changes.

1208
01:28:16,350 --> 01:28:21,850
其中之一，我的谋生手段必须停手
For one thing, I'd have to stop doing what I do for a living.

1209
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:32,220
宝贝，对不起，我应该先问你的
Honey, I'm sorry. I should have asked you first.

1210
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,030
你愿意试试看吗？
Will you try? Please?

1211
01:28:40,910 --> 01:28:43,970
是的，我会试试看
Yes, I'll try, honey.

1212
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:45,270
我会的
I'll try.

1213
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:05,790
从什么时候？
When?

1214
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:07,560
就现在
As of now.

1215
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,910
你得做你必须做的
You gotta do what you gotta do.

1216
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:18,410
遗憾失去了你
I'm sorry to lose you.

1217
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:21,240
你不要那四万块？
You don't want the 40 G's?

1218
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:24,210
留着吧，就当成是临别礼物
Keep it. Consider it a parting gift.

1219
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:30,250
那我们应该多多分手
We should part more often.

1220
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:34,420
我说过我爱你吗？
Did I tell you I love you?

1221
01:29:35,330 --> 01:29:37,390
是，我也爱你
Yeah, I love you back.

1222
01:29:38,030 --> 01:29:40,390
- 遵守  - 遵守
- Comply  - Comply

1223
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:49,170
总有一天，我要把你灌醉
One of these days, I'm gonna get you drunk.

1224
01:29:56,150 --> 01:29:59,750
我觉得这事我应该告诉你妈妈，让她知道我的打算
You know I think I should tell your mom about this. Let her know what I'm doing.

1225
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:01,510
- 你的葬礼  - 我知道
- Your funeral.  - I know.

1226
01:30:01,690 --> 01:30:05,130
不过，我想她应该从我这里听到
But I think she should hear it from me.

1227
01:30:05,290 --> 01:30:07,060
你觉得呢？
What do you think?

1228
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:09,890
没错
Yeah.

1229
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:11,960
那好
Okay.

1230
01:30:12,330 --> 01:30:14,930
- 我好期待  - 我们可以养只狗
- I'm excited about this.  - We could get a dog.

1231
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,960
- 德国牧羊犬或是拉不拉多  - 狗不是很脏吗？
- Either a German shepherd or a Lab.  - They're messy, aren't they?

1232
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:20,770
我们可以训练它啊
We could train it.

1233
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:23,140
- 取名为弗兰克  - 好名字
- Name it Frank.  - That's a good name.

1234
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:25,440
小姐（西班牙语）
Senorita

1235
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:28,510
不错
That's nice.

1236
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:31,740
小姐（西班牙语）
Senorita

1237
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:36,810
- 给你，小姐  - 谢谢
- For you, senorita.  - Thank you.

1238
01:30:44,370 --> 01:30:45,660
我们去跳舞
Let's dance.

1239
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:21,300
什么意思？“我家就是你家”？
What is it, "my house is your house"?

1240
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,430
弗兰克
Frank!

1241
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:26,330
退后
Get back.

1242
01:31:26,610 --> 01:31:28,170
哈啰？罗伊
Hello, Roy.

1243
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:31,710
- 嗨，小可爱  - 回你房间等着，宝贝
- Hiya, sunshine.  - Go wait in your room, honey.

1244
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:34,050
她留下，她跟你们一样牵涉
Let her stay. She's in this as much as you are.

1245
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:37,780
安吉拉，对吧？
It's Angela, right?

1246
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:40,580
你的档案照可比不上你
Your mug shot doesn't do you justice.

1247
01:31:40,950 --> 01:31:42,280
想坐下吗？
You wanna sit down?

1248
01:31:42,290 --> 01:31:46,060
- 如果你敢靠近她  - 别装硬汉，罗伊，我可是在你家
- If you come anywhere near her...  - Don't play tough. I'm in your home.

1249
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:48,460
罗伊，对不起，老兄
Roy, I'm sorry, man.

1250
01:31:48,630 --> 01:31:49,820
闭嘴
Shut up!

1251
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,530
你怎么找到我的？
How did you find me?

1252
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:58,000
我没有
I didn't.

1253
01:31:58,170 --> 01:32:01,230
我找到了她，真真切切
I found her in black and white.

1254
01:32:01,410 --> 01:32:05,370
机场保安摄像头，罗伊，它们正拍到她了
Airport security cameras, Roy, they got a nice look at her.

1255
01:32:05,450 --> 01:32:06,870
真是粗心
That was sloppy.

1256
01:32:07,050 --> 01:32:10,480
- 候机室并没有摄像头  - 是没有
- There were no cameras in the lounge.  - No.

1257
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:14,850
礼品店里有
There were in the gift shop.

1258
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:17,850
我这一行，在警局里有几个朋友
In my business, it pays to have a few friends on the force.

1259
01:32:17,930 --> 01:32:19,420
你的小姑娘在他们的档案里
Your little girl's in their books.

1260
01:32:19,890 --> 01:32:23,490
你的前妻并不知道不该给我你的地址
Your ex-wife doesn't know well enough not to give out your home address.

1261
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:26,130
我们只会被所爱的人伤害，呃？
We only hurt the ones we love, huh?

1262
01:32:29,740 --> 01:32:31,500
你的脸色苍白得像鬼，罗伊
You look white as a ghost, Roy.

1263
01:32:31,710 --> 01:32:34,400
我不想要你昏过去，你得先还债
I don't want you to pass out before you make your first payment.

1264
01:32:34,410 --> 01:32:36,940
先办正事，把你从我这儿拿的钱还来
First things first, let's have the money you took from me.

1265
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:40,040
- 我没有  - 那就先从你有的开始
- I don't have it.  - Well, let's start with what you do have!

1266
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:44,340
- 我有四千块，可能  - 在哪？
- Four thousand, maybe.  - Where?

1267
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:47,620
那只狗
The dog.

1268
01:32:47,790 --> 01:32:48,690
站住！
Stop!

1269
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:50,890
让她去拿，你跟我待在一起
Let her get it. You stay here with me.

1270
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,490
没事的，宝贝，去吧
It's okay. It's okay, honey, go.

1271
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:55,800
跑，安吉拉，快跑
Run, Angela! Run!

1272
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:57,600
你跑，老爸现在就死！
You run, and Daddy's dead right now!

1273
01:32:57,670 --> 01:32:59,190
好，好
Okay, okay.

1274
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:04,100
接下来，你以后赚的钱我都要分一半
Next, I get half of whatever you make from now on.

1275
01:33:04,270 --> 01:33:06,310
否则，我就给我的警察朋友打电话
If not, I call those cop friends of mine

1276
01:33:06,370 --> 01:33:08,630
你的小姑娘到十八岁就去坐牢吧
your little girl goes to juvy till she's 18.

1277
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:10,540
我退出了，我收手不干了
I'm out. I'm done with this.

1278
01:33:10,550 --> 01:33:12,440
你还没收手，罗伊
You're not done, Roy.

1279
01:33:12,950 --> 01:33:15,250
你都没沾湿鞋子呢
You haven't even gotten your feet wet.

1280
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,210
弗兰克还没收手，对吧，弗兰克？
Frank's not done, are you, Frank?

1281
01:33:17,210 --> 01:33:18,410
你收手了，弗兰克？
You done, Frank?

1282
01:33:18,450 --> 01:33:19,820
他可没有
He's not done.

1283
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:23,910
安吉拉，不，把枪放下，宝贝
Angela, no. Put the gun down, sweetheart

1284
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:25,620
- 打他  - 安静，弗兰克
- Shoot him.  - Quiet, Frank.

1285
01:33:25,790 --> 01:33:28,490
安吉拉，行了，安吉拉
Angela, okay. Angela. Angela.

1286
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:31,060
把枪放下，宝贝，不要…我来处理
Put it down, sweetheart. Don't... I'll take care of this.

1287
01:33:31,230 --> 01:33:33,620
- 我要你走  - 知道怎么用那个吗？
- I want you to go.  - Know how to use that?

1288
01:33:33,630 --> 01:33:35,590
- 别越弄越糟  - 开枪打他
- Don't make it worse!  - Shoot him!

1289
01:33:35,770 --> 01:33:37,070
该死，开枪打他！
Goddamn it, shoot him!

1290
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:40,800
好了，好了
Okay, okay.

1291
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:44,970
哦，不会吧，哦，天啊
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, God.

1292
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:02,850
哦，天啊
Oh, God.

1293
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:09,770
- 哦，天啊  - 哦，该死，罗伊
- Oh, God!  - Oh, shit, Roy.

1294
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:12,160
他撑不过去的
He ain't gonna make it.

1295
01:34:13,970 --> 01:34:16,000
好了，好了，好了
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1296
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:36,960
你知道七棕榈汽车旅馆在哪吗？
You know where the Seven Palms Motel is?

1297
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:40,660
- 在十五号公路上  - 好，去那开个房间
- It's out at the 15.  - Okay, get a room there.

1298
01:34:40,830 --> 01:34:44,570
要一楼的，万一你要从后门出去，在那里等我
Ground floor, if you have to go out the back. Wait there for me.

1299
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:45,910
要是你没来呢？
What if you don't show?

1300
01:34:46,070 --> 01:34:49,840
就带她去她妈妈那里，然后往南开永远别回来
Take her to her mother's, and drive south and never come back.

1301
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:51,780
那你要干什么呢？
What are you gonna do?

1302
01:34:51,850 --> 01:34:53,910
我要送他去医院
I'm gonna take him to the hospital.

1303
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:55,640
安吉拉，宝贝
Angela, sweetheart.

1304
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:58,940
听我说，弗兰克会带你离开这里，好吗？
Listen to me. Frank will get you out of here, all right?

1305
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:02,680
他会带你离开这里，我过一两天就去找你
He's gonna get you out of here, and I will see you in a day or two.

1306
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:07,020
- 不会有事的，我保证  - 爸，我只是想
- Everything will be all right, I promise.  - Dad, I was just trying to...

1307
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:10,450
我知道，我知道，听着，我知道
I know, I know. Listen to me. Listen, I know, I know.

1308
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:12,320
你没有开枪，好吗？
You didn't shoot him, all right?

1309
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:14,930
明白吗？是我开枪的，是我
Do you understand? I shot him. I did.

1310
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,970
- 是不是这样，弗兰克？ - 没错，罗伊
- Isn't that right, Frank?  - Right, Roy.

1311
01:35:17,140 --> 01:35:18,970
好了，你好好等着就行，宝贝
All right, so you just sit tight, honey.

1312
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:22,740
而且我想要你知道，我很抱歉
And I want you to know that I'm sorry.

1313
01:35:22,910 --> 01:35:25,240
对不起让你失望了
I'm sorry I let you down.

1314
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:28,910
好了，弗兰克
Okay, Frank.

1315
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:31,110
- 快走吧  - 好
- Go, okay?  - Okay.

1316
01:35:31,490 --> 01:35:33,690
- 我说真的  - 罗伊，对不起，老兄
- I'm serious.  - Roy, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.

1317
01:35:33,850 --> 01:35:36,650
- 没关系  - 我真的很抱歉
- All right. All right.  - I'm really sorry.

1318
01:36:27,940 --> 01:36:29,770
你没事了
You're okay, man.

1319
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:33,050
- 他没事了  - 霍夫曼护士请到小儿科
- He's okay.  - Nurse Hoffman to Pediatrics.

1320
01:36:33,210 --> 01:36:36,670
- 霍夫曼护士请至小儿科  - 早安，罗伊，你觉得怎么样？
- Nurse Hoffman to Pediatrics.  - Good morning, Roy. How do you feel?

1321
01:36:36,850 --> 01:36:38,280
冷
Cold.

1322
01:36:39,290 --> 01:36:40,620
慢慢来，好吗？
Take it slow, will you?

1323
01:36:40,990 --> 01:36:43,520
我是比绍普探员，这是赫特探员
I'm Detective Bishop. This is Detective Holt.

1324
01:36:43,690 --> 01:36:46,130
医生马上就来了
The doctor will be in in a second.

1325
01:36:46,290 --> 01:36:49,030
那晚你被理了个相当不错的发型，罗伊
You were given a pretty close haircut the other night, Roy.

1326
01:36:49,290 --> 01:36:50,730
严重脑震荡
Bad concussion.

1327
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:54,990
你还算走运，罗伊，我们希望恰克也走运
You got lucky, Roy. I wish we could say the same for Chuck.

1328
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:57,570
我被捕了吗？
Am I under arrest?

1329
01:36:57,740 --> 01:37:02,270
你有权利保持缄默，你所说的一切可能…不拉不拉…
Well, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and may be...

1330
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:04,340
我都听见了
I heard it all.

1331
01:37:06,150 --> 01:37:08,140
罗伊，弗兰克在哪里？
Roy, where's Frank?

1332
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:12,010
- 谁？ - 弗兰克·莫瑟，你的搭档
- Who?  - Frank Mercer. Your partner.

1333
01:37:12,390 --> 01:37:15,820
我们搜过你家和他家，没有多少是我们不知道的
We've been spending time at your places.- There's not a lot we don't know.

1334
01:37:15,990 --> 01:37:18,480
我更喜欢你家，干净
I like your place better. Clean.

1335
01:37:19,090 --> 01:37:20,990
他在哪里？
Where is he?

1336
01:37:23,430 --> 01:37:26,990
好吧，那这样吧？
Okay, then how about this?

1337
01:37:27,670 --> 01:37:28,990
安吉拉在哪？
Where's Angela?

1338
01:37:29,170 --> 01:37:32,530
因为她不在切斯特大道四百一十五号
Because she's not at 415 Chester Ave.

1339
01:37:32,710 --> 01:37:34,870
她妈妈都快抓狂了
Her mother's near hysterical.

1340
01:37:37,510 --> 01:37:38,640
是我开的枪
I shot him.

1341
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:40,610
我开枪打了恰克
I shot Chuck.

1342
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:43,010
你确定吗？
You sure about that?

1343
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:47,880
因为恰克没挺过来，我们发现他趴在你的车道上
Because Chuck didn't make it. We found him facedown in your driveway.

1344
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:52,290
真是倒霉，不过我告诉你，还有更糟糕的
It's not good, but I'm telling you, it could still get a lot worse.

1345
01:37:52,690 --> 01:37:57,720
哎哟喂，我们从你的点三八上采到的指纹有些小
Alas, the print we took off your .38 was just a little small.

1346
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:59,100
那么她在哪？
So where is she?

1347
01:37:59,700 --> 01:38:01,620
我要见我的医生
I wanna see my doctor.

1348
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:03,600
我们说过，医生马上就来了
Like we said, the doctor will be here in a second.

1349
01:38:03,620 --> 01:38:05,200
不，我的精神科医生
No, my doctor, my shrink.

1350
01:38:05,370 --> 01:38:08,800
你们让我见他，你们想知道的我都告诉你们
You let me see him, and I'll tell you everything you wanna know.

1351
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:13,110
他电话号码是？
What's his number?

1352
01:38:21,050 --> 01:38:22,780
哈罗，罗伊
Hello, Roy.

1353
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:25,480
- 嘿，医生  - 嗨
- Hey, doc.  - Hi.

1354
01:38:25,660 --> 01:38:28,690
我们能不能有点私人空间？
Can we have a little privacy?

1355
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,320
事情不是这么办的
That's not the way it works.

1356
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:34,500
我不是应该有医患隐私特权什么的吗？
Don't I have doctor-patient privileges, rights, something?

1357
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,330
是的，技术上说，他没错
Yeah, technically, he's right.

1358
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:39,530
那样会牵涉到你可能讲出些基于机密信息的证言
That refers to testimony you might give based on confidential information.

1359
01:38:39,610 --> 01:38:41,630
没有哪个特权说我必须让你们独处
There's no privilege says I gotta leave you two alone.

1360
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:45,100
或者，如果你想要我知道的信息，就有
Or, there is if you want what I know.

1361
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:50,420
五分钟
Five minutes.

1362
01:38:51,850 --> 01:38:54,180
罗伊，出什么事了？他们说…
Roy, what happened? They told...

1363
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:59,250
好了，听着，安吉拉有麻烦了
Okay, listen. Angela is in trouble.

1364
01:38:59,430 --> 01:39:02,420
如果我不帮她，她就得坐牢了
If I don't help her, she will go to jail.

1365
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:04,160
拜托你帮我救救她
So please help me help her.

1366
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:05,560
我不能做犯法的事
I can't do anything illegal.

1367
01:39:05,630 --> 01:39:08,870
- 带累她你也有份  - 别转移责任，罗伊
- You got her into this too.  - Don't transfer responsibility, Roy.

1368
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:12,230
帮我打个电话就好了，行吗？求求你？
Just make a phone call for me, all right? Please?

1369
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:13,640
好吧
All right.

1370
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:16,410
打电话到贝克尔斯菲的七棕榈汽车旅馆
Check out Seven Palms Motel in Bakersfield.

1371
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:22,880
像是巨型蟋蟀的叫声
It's like a giant cricket.

1372
01:39:25,890 --> 01:39:27,380
然后呢？
And then what?

1373
01:39:27,550 --> 01:39:29,890
我叫过你把那机器关掉，对吗？
I asked you to turn the machine off, right?

1374
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:34,320
你告诉安吉拉密码，然后叫她写下来
Tell Angela the pass code, and then you tell her to write it down.

1375
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:36,990
- 密码？ - 你出去时他们会搜你的身
- Pass code?  - They'll search you on your way out.

1376
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:41,900
- 对  - 是五四三N七九四二
- Right.  - It's 543N7942.

1377
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:43,970
- 五九…  - 医生
- 59...  - Doc!

1378
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:46,900
哦，对不起
Oh, I'm sorry.

1379
01:39:47,070 --> 01:39:50,940
五四三N七九四二，跟我重念一遍，重念
543N7942. Say it back to me. Say it back.

1380
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:53,840
那是五四三N七五四二
So it's 543N7542.

1381
01:39:54,010 --> 01:39:55,910
不，是N七九四二
No, N7942.

1382
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:58,420
N，诺曼的“N”，七九四二
N, Norman, 7942.

1383
01:39:58,590 --> 01:40:01,650
- 你只要办到这个就行  - 五四三N七九四二
- That's all you have to do.  - 543N7942.

1384
01:40:01,820 --> 01:40:03,850
五四三N七九四二
543N7942.

1385
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:05,820
谢谢你，医生
Thank you, doc.

1386
01:40:07,290 --> 01:40:09,760
她不会有事的
She's gonna be okay.

1387
01:40:09,930 --> 01:40:11,920
安吉拉不会有事的
Angela's gonna be all right.

1388
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,160
嘿，哈罗？
Hey, hello?

1389
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:23,340
嘿，你们谁来开一下空调啊？
Hey, can you guys put the air conditioning on?

1390
01:40:23,710 --> 01:40:25,770
很热
It's hot.

1391
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:31,950
叫什么来着？比绍普？比绍普！
What is it? Bishop? Bishop!

1392
01:40:36,690 --> 01:40:40,460
警探们，你们能不能让这里…
Detectives, can you make it a little...

1393
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:43,190
凉快点？
...cooler in here?

1394
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,020
[罗伊的]

1395
01:41:28,910 --> 01:41:33,070
亲爱的罗伊，你可能非常沮丧，我不怪你
Dear Roy, you're probably pretty upset. I don 't blame you.

1396
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:38,080
我懂的东西大多是你教的，所以我实在不应该这么对你的
You taught me most of what I know, so I suppose I owe you better than this.

1397
01:41:38,450 --> 01:41:42,520
但你总是跟我说如果逮到大机会，我应该抓住它
But you always told me if I ever got a shot at a big score, I should take it.

1398
01:41:42,790 --> 01:41:44,580
所以我就这么办了
And that's what I did.

1399
01:41:50,430 --> 01:41:52,420
出租车
Taxi!

1400
01:41:52,730 --> 01:41:53,860
对不起
Sorry, sorry!

1401
01:41:54,030 --> 01:41:57,940
很抱歉打破你的头，还有其它的一切
Sorry about the sap on the head, by the way, and for everything else.

1402
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:04,440
你总说我们这样的人，承受不起对自己所做的事后悔
You always said guys like us can 't afford to have regrets about what we do.

1403
01:42:04,710 --> 01:42:09,210
这我来说有点为难，不过我会调整的
That's gonna be a little harder for me, but I'll manage.

1404
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:13,280
哦，不，我告诉她我是精神科医生，我不能说谎，罗伊
Well, no, I told her I'm a psychiatrist. I can 't lie, Roy.

1405
01:42:19,730 --> 01:42:22,390
嘿，嘿嘿，老兄
Hey, hey, hey, hey, pal!

1406
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:33,970
如果这话能让你好受点：你是我见过最棒的
If it makes any difference, you're the best I ever saw.

1407
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:37,740
我再也找不到更好的搭档了，现在我也不需要了
I'd never find a better partner, and now I won 't have to.

1408
01:42:37,910 --> 01:42:39,240
我爱你，老兄
I love you, man.

1409
01:42:39,710 --> 01:42:41,640
弗兰克
Frank.

1410
01:42:53,230 --> 01:42:56,160
今天要小间吗，沃勒先生？
Booth today, Mr. Waller?

1411
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:11,300
附注：希望你喜欢这份礼物
P.S. Enjoy the gift.

1412
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:13,870
[爱你，弗兰克]
附注：希望你喜欢这份礼物
P.S. Enjoy the gift.

1413
01:43:20,690 --> 01:43:23,620
她说你是个坏人
She said you were a bad guy.

1414
01:43:24,290 --> 01:43:27,120
你看起来不像坏人
You don 't seem like a bad guy.

1415
01:43:28,630 --> 01:43:31,500
我不觉得你是个坏人
Well, I don 't think you're a bad guy.

1416
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:51,320
罗伊？
Roy?

1417
01:43:51,490 --> 01:43:53,150
海瑟
Heather.

1418
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:03,400
她…
She's...

1419
01:44:05,730 --> 01:44:07,760
她不在这里，对吗？
She's not here, is she?

1420
01:44:08,740 --> 01:44:11,900
- 什么？ - 安吉拉
- What?  - Angela.

1421
01:44:12,070 --> 01:44:14,340
谁？什么？
Who? What?

1422
01:44:14,510 --> 01:44:16,600
罗伊，你在说什么？
Roy, what are you talking about?

1423
01:44:16,910 --> 01:44:20,740
孩子，你当时快生孩子了
The baby. You were gonna have a baby.

1424
01:44:20,910 --> 01:44:23,180
你是为这件事来的吗？
That's why you're here?

1425
01:44:23,350 --> 01:44:25,250
你当时怀孕了
You were pregnant.

1426
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:29,220
那时候你怀孕了！你怀孕了
You were pregnant! You were. You were pregnant.

1427
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:31,580
我流产了
I lost it.

1428
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:51,610
罗伊，你还好吗？
Roy, you okay?

1429
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:59,110
是，我没事
Yeah, I'm okay.

1430
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:05,120
[一年后]

1431
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:11,830
我失陪一下
Excuse me one second.

1432
01:45:15,970 --> 01:45:18,440
- 嘿，老板  - 罗伊，有生意上门了
- Hey, boss.  - Roy, another live one.

1433
01:45:19,810 --> 01:45:20,930
好的
All right.

1434
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:31,650
午安
Afternoon.

1435
01:45:31,820 --> 01:45:34,310
- 你好吗？ - 有什么我可以效劳的？
- How you doing?  - Can I help you find anything?

1436
01:45:34,490 --> 01:45:37,950
对，我想买地毯
Yeah, I need a carpet.

1437
01:45:38,830 --> 01:45:43,960
- 要铺在家里的吗？ - 是要铺在秘书的办公室
- For your home?  - For my secretary's office.

1438
01:45:44,130 --> 01:45:46,160
不，是要铺在公寓里的
No, it's for my apartment.

1439
01:45:46,830 --> 01:45:49,030
- 只有一个房间  - 大地方？
- All one room of it.  - Big place?

1440
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:52,200
- 算是吧  - 那你有中意的颜色吗？
- Oh, yeah.  - All right, well, you have a color in mind?

1441
01:45:52,470 --> 01:45:55,970
我有中意的价钱，便宜
I have a price in mind. Cheap.

1442
01:45:56,140 --> 01:45:58,990
好，你要求不多，你不知道自己想要什么…
Okay, so you don't need much, you don't know what you want...

1443
01:45:59,010 --> 01:46:00,210
只要价钱别太高就好
but no price is too low.

1444
01:46:00,410 --> 01:46:01,450
差不多是
That's about me.

1445
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:04,580
你是我的完美顾客，我们到余料堆里找找
You are my perfect customer. Let's dig into the remnants.

1446
01:46:04,750 --> 01:46:09,420
等等，我女朋友对我们的需求比我了解一点
Wait, wait, wait. My girlfriend knows a bit better than I do what we need.

1447
01:46:09,790 --> 01:46:10,950
嘿，宝贝
Hey, sweetie.

1448
01:46:14,130 --> 01:46:16,030
她来了
There she is.

1449
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,520
哦，我…
Oh, I...

1450
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:38,220
我觉得我们应该找颜色暗点的，因为有狗
I think we should go with the dark because of the dog.

1451
01:46:38,390 --> 01:46:41,220
哦，对，说得没错，我们刚养了只狗
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Fair enough. We just got a dog.

1452
01:46:41,390 --> 01:46:43,860
让我猜猜，是拉不拉多犬
Let me guess, a Lab.

1453
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:45,820
德国牧羊犬，不过
German shepherd, but...

1454
01:46:45,990 --> 01:46:47,760
我下一个就要猜它
My next guess.

1455
01:46:51,260 --> 01:46:53,260
有没有，比如…
There's no, like...

1456
01:46:53,430 --> 01:46:58,000
我不知道，狗喜欢的特殊地毯，有吗？
...I don't know, special carpet that dogs like, is there?

1457
01:47:04,910 --> 01:47:08,610
有，有，我们叫阿斯特洛夫尼龙
Yeah, yeah. We call it AstroTurf.

1458
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:12,280
来吧，余料在商店的后部
Come on, remnants are in the back of the store.

1459
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:19,560
你们刚刚才住在一起？
You folks just move in together?

1460
01:47:19,730 --> 01:47:21,790
对，三星期前
Yeah, three weeks ago.

1461
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:24,590
- 重要的一步  - 我喜欢这个
- Big step.  - I kind of like this one.

1462
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:28,760
对，选得好，颜色深你都注意不到污渍
Yeah, that's a nice choice. So dark you barely notice stains.

1463
01:47:28,940 --> 01:47:30,530
你喜欢？
You like it?

1464
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:32,430
多少钱？
How much is it?

1465
01:47:32,610 --> 01:47:37,470
牌价是七十五块，不过我可以折百分之二十，只要你付现金
Well, the sticker says 75, but I can knock 20 percent off if you pay cash.

1466
01:47:40,750 --> 01:47:44,310
我们的生活安排，我付房租，她买地毯
This is our living arrangement. I pay rent. She buys the carpets.

1467
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:46,180
- 糟糕  - 怎么了？
- Shit.  - What's up?

1468
01:47:46,350 --> 01:47:48,410
我想我把钱包留在…
I think I left my wallet...

1469
01:47:48,590 --> 01:47:51,520
对，我把钱包留在车子里了
Yeah, I left my wallet in the car.

1470
01:47:51,690 --> 01:47:54,160
- 你可以去拿吗？ - 好
- Do you think you could go get it?  - Yeah.

1471
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:57,090
我这就回来
I'll be right back.

1472
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:05,600
谢谢你什么也没说
Thanks for not saying anything.

1473
01:48:15,150 --> 01:48:17,810
你在这里做多久了？
How long have you worked here?

1474
01:48:18,590 --> 01:48:20,580
一阵子了
A while.

1475
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:26,150
那么，怎么，你正在钓这家伙？
So, what, you working this guy?

1476
01:48:26,330 --> 01:48:27,820
不是
No.

1477
01:48:27,990 --> 01:48:29,990
不不不，我退休了
No, no. No, I'm retired.

1478
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:33,390
那次是…一次性的
That was a one-time deal.

1479
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,060
没开玩笑？你很…
No kidding? You were...

1480
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:38,730
厉害
...good.

1481
01:48:39,540 --> 01:48:41,670
我有个好老师
I had a good teacher.

1482
01:48:43,180 --> 01:48:45,640
- 老师们  - 我有点惊讶会在这里遇见你
- Teachers.  - I'm kind of surprised to see you here.

1483
01:48:45,710 --> 01:48:47,650
我琢磨你早就去了…
I figured you would have moved out to...

1484
01:48:48,510 --> 01:48:51,350
说不好，夏威夷？
I don't know, Hawaii.

1485
01:48:53,850 --> 01:48:58,650
分钱的时候我有些上当了，你了解弗兰克的
I kind of got screwed on my cut. You know Frank.

1486
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:05,530
常在河边走，哪能不湿鞋，对吗？
You're gonna go swimming, you're gonna get wet, right?

1487
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:08,670
你的发型变了
You changed your hair.

1488
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:10,760
看起来像成年人
Makes you look grown-up.

1489
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:14,060
我是成年人
I am grown-up.

1490
01:49:16,310 --> 01:49:18,680
你总是穿成这样出门吗？
You always go out dressed like this?

1491
01:49:20,650 --> 01:49:22,880
有时候
Sometimes.

1492
01:49:23,050 --> 01:49:24,780
干嘛，你要罚我跪吗？
Why, you gonna ground me?

1493
01:49:26,390 --> 01:49:28,510
抱歉
Sorry.

1494
01:49:34,230 --> 01:49:36,490
我也很抱歉
I'm sorry too...

1495
01:49:39,170 --> 01:49:41,830
如果可以补偿的话
...if it's any consolation.

1496
01:49:46,410 --> 01:49:48,140
你生我气吗？
You mad at me?

1497
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:53,500
你并没有拿走
You didn't take it.

1498
01:49:53,950 --> 01:49:55,840
是我给你的
I gave it to you.

1499
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:59,610
这种看法有意思
It's a funny way of looking at it.

1500
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:05,190
我现在看事情的角度不同了
Well, I see things differently now.

1501
01:50:14,170 --> 01:50:16,260
你喜欢这个人？
So you like this guy?

1502
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:19,600
是的，他很疼我
Yeah, he's sweet to me.

1503
01:50:19,970 --> 01:50:22,430
我是在保龄球馆认识他的
I met him at a bowling alley.

1504
01:50:27,050 --> 01:50:29,310
我们有过美好时光，对吗？
We had a good time, didn't we?

1505
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:33,080
对，有过
Yeah, we did.

1506
01:50:38,790 --> 01:50:40,860
- 谢了，伙计  - 就放这里
- Thanks, buddy.  - Right here.

1507
01:50:44,130 --> 01:50:46,690
- 我来把它绑紧  - 很高兴见到你，罗伊
- Let me tie it off.  - It's good to see you, Roy.

1508
01:50:47,070 --> 01:50:49,260
我也很高兴见到你
It's good to see you too.

1509
01:50:57,140 --> 01:50:59,270
你不想知道我的名字吗？
Don't you wanna know my name?

1510
01:50:59,650 --> 01:51:01,710
我知道你的名字
I know your name.

1511
01:51:05,420 --> 01:51:07,580
回头见，老爸
I'll see you, Dad.

1512
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:33,170
嗨
Hi.

1513
01:51:34,610 --> 01:51:36,410
一共是三十六块五，先生
That'll be 36.50, sir.
