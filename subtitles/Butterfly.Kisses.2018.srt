00:00:42,707 --> 00:00:46,009
我叫索菲亚·克兰 今天是2004年3月3日
My name is Sophia Crane. It's March 3rd, 2004.

3
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:49,211
我是一个电影系学生 这是我的毕业论文
I'm a film student and this is my senior thesis.

4
00:00:49,213 --> 00:00:51,714
我不知道我还能活多久
I don't know how much longer I'm going to be alive,

5
00:00:51,716 --> 00:00:53,683
所以我请求找到这个人
so I ask whoever find this,

6
00:00:53,685 --> 00:00:55,351
请把这个最后情景的前后两部分
please apply the first and second halves

7
00:00:55,353 --> 00:00:58,890
分别剪辑到我的电影开头和结尾
of this final interview to the beginning and end of my film.

8
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:01,958
我不知道该怎么做
I don't know where to make the cut.

9
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,960
这是一个偷窥狂的故事
This is the story of Peeping Tom

10
00:01:03,962 --> 00:01:05,965
以及我是如何寻找他的
and how I went looking for him.

11
00:01:06,932 --> 00:01:09,734
请把这个给我父母看看
Please show this to my parents.

12
00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:14,336
我不知道我还能坚持多久不眨眼
I don't know how much longer I can go without blinking.

13
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:20,680
早上好 伙计们 进来吧
Morning, fellas. Come on in.

14
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,979
这就是我告诉你们的那所房子
So, this is the house I was telling you about.

15
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:25,817
这是我老丈人的家
This is my in-laws' house.

16
00:01:27,486 --> 00:01:33,823
我们只知道 似乎是在1970年到75年间建造的
The information that we have on it, it seems to have been built around 1970-75,

17
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:37,726
除了这个 我找不到其他的信息
I can't really find any information other than that,

18
00:01:37,728 --> 00:01:40,665
但是在地下室
but down here in the basement

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,401
巴特就是在这找到的
is where Bart found it.

20
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:47,936
我来开灯 为了做这次的展示
I'll turn the light on. Now, I have repositioned it

21
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:51,707
我把它的位置重新调整了 你等我下
for presentation purposes so, if you'll bear with me...

22
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:54,978
在这 我去把它挖出来
Here, just going to go and dig it out.

23
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,216
现在如果你能看见我 它就在这下面
Right now if you can see me, it was right under here.

24
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:05,224
是这个盒子 过来 我给你看
It was this... box. Come over here, I'll show it to you.

25
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:10,393
写着别看
Don't watch, huh.

26
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:16,131
很诡异 但所有恐怖片不都是这么开始的吗?
Pretty eerie, but isn't that how all good horror movies start?

27
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:19,938
一个小秘密 一个小谜语
A little mystery, a little riddle.

28
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:24,941
我丈夫最近退休了
Well, my husband recently retired,

29
00:02:24,943 --> 00:02:28,344
我想 在感恩节前
we find this beautiful house that we both loved

30
00:02:28,346 --> 00:02:32,347
我们都找到了喜欢的漂亮房子
and I guess it was just before Thanksgiving.

31
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,719
我丈夫去了地下室 做了男人该做的事
My husband went down in the basement, did what guys do, you know,

32
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:39,788
检查锅炉 检查空调 检查过滤器 诸如此类的事情
check the boiler, check the air conditioning, play with the filters, things like that.

33
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,860
他发现这个盒子里装满了磁带
He found this box full of tapes.

34
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:48,064
他觉得加文可以把它们用在工作上
She thought that Gavin could use them for work,

35
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:52,469
因为他做婚礼录像
because he does wedding videos and

36
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:56,439
她想也许他可以用磁带录像 或者别的什么 为了省钱嘛
she thought maybe he can tape over them, or something, like to save money,

37
00:02:56,441 --> 00:03:00,410
但是现在有迷你摄像机了 所以我们不再用了
but there are mini DVs so we don't really use them anymore.

38
00:03:00,412 --> 00:03:05,084
我想也许加文可以看看这些磁带的内容
You know, I thought maybe Gavin can take a look at them, see what's on them,

39
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:12,290
搞一个小项目 让他保持对电影的兴奋
something as like a little project to keep him interested and excited about film.

40
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:17,427
我第一次看到的是
And the very first one that I picked up says:

41
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:19,129
最终解决方案
Final Solution.

42
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:21,096
这是我看的第一部
Alright, that's the first one I watched,

43
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:23,968
我是说 我怎么可能不看这样的东西呢?
I mean, how could you not watch anything like that, right?

44
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:29,873
那么最终解决方案这盒磁带上说的什么？
So what happened on the tape Final Solution, what did you see?

45
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:35,210
一个年轻的姑娘称自己是电影系学生索菲亚·克兰
A young lady identifies herself as Sophia Crane, a film student.

46
00:03:35,212 --> 00:03:38,381
太巧合 我是电影专业 她也是电影专业
Total coincidence, as a film major, film major,

47
00:03:38,383 --> 00:03:41,854
所以我们已经有些联系了 很不错
so already we're simpatico, which is great.

48
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:46,523
她对学校的项目很不高兴 她有一点压力
She's upset about the school project, she's stressed out a little bit,

49
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:50,393
然后在那之后变得有点沮丧 有点奇怪
and then it got a little upsetting after that and a little bit weird.

50
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:53,996
而且还变得暴力 我现在不想探讨那些内容
Some violence, some things that I don't really wanna say right now,

51
00:03:53,998 --> 00:03:56,098
我们不能一次性都透露完了
we don't what to give it all away.

52
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,000
但是我们只能说我必须在那之后
But let's just say that I had to watch

53
00:03:58,002 --> 00:04:01,203
马上看完接下来的40盘磁带
about the next 40 tapes immediately after that.

54
00:04:01,205 --> 00:04:06,008
我做的第一件事就是给我们卖房子的前房主打电话
First thing I did was, of course, call the previous owner that we bought the house from,

55
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,012
在语音信箱里留言说 我找到了一个盒子
left voicemail messages saying that I found a box,

56
00:04:09,014 --> 00:04:10,880
找到了一些可能是他们的东西
found something that probably belongs to them.

57
00:04:10,882 --> 00:04:12,548
我没有收到他们的回复
I never heard back from them,

58
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,485
最后电话号码也变空号了
and then eventually the phone number was just unlisted.

59
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:20,957
但是这些镜头从来没有在你岳父母的家里取景
But the footage never actually takes place in your in-laws' house.

60
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,596
没有 这是另一个有趣的事了 让我变得很兴奋
No, it doesn't, and that's another kind of fun, clinky dink about this whole thing.

61
00:04:27,598 --> 00:04:30,168
那你打算对这个房子怎么办呢？
What are you doing in regards to the home?

62
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,870
卖掉它
Selling it.

63
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:35,538
在第一盘磁带之后
After the first tape,

64
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,440
我看到的下一盘磁带叫做 粗略编辑
the next tape that I saw there was called Rough Edit.

65
00:04:38,442 --> 00:04:41,444
一切看起来都很好 在街上有采访
Everything looks really good, there is interviews on the street,

66
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:46,916
非常顺畅 大约十分钟后 情况变得非常不稳定
really nice flow, and then after about ten minutes it gets really choppy.

67
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:49,319
里面大约有40盘磁带
And it's about 40 or so tapes in here,

68
00:04:49,321 --> 00:04:52,322
他们忙得没时间剪辑
so it's like they got too busy to cut it together and they just kept

69
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:55,895
不停地拍啊拍 拍啊拍 不知道什么时候停下来
filming and filming and filming and they didn't really know when to stop.

70
00:04:56,595 --> 00:05:02,130
- 你做了什么? - 作为一名优秀的电影制作人
- So what did you do? - Well, being a good filmmaker

71
00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:05,468
我剪辑好他们的视频 完成了电影拍摄
as I am, I took their film and I finished it.

72
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,173
我自己编辑的
I edited it together myself, I took their film

73
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:12,474
我把他们的电影做成我的电影 现在它完成了
and made it my film, so now it's finished,

74
00:05:12,476 --> 00:05:15,480
现在的样子才是它本身应该是的样子
now it's completed the way that it should have been.

75
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:20,949
你看到了完整版的影片之后 你是怎么想的?
And what did you think when you saw it all in sequence?

76
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:27,190
在那之后的几天
Well, I didn't really sleep

77
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:30,862
我都没有睡好
for a couple of days after that.

78
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:47,980
在我身后是伊尔切斯特隧道 巴尔的摩-俄亥俄铁路源发地 该死 再来一次
Behind me stands the Ilchester tunnel, home to the B&O... Shit, again.

79
00:05:48,646 --> 00:05:50,081
开始了吗？
Are we rolling?

80
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:56,452
对我来说 它看起来...
Well, I mean, to me it looks it...

81
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:14,036
在我身后的是伊尔切斯特隧道 一个多世纪以来一直是巴铁的路段
Behind me stands the Ilchester tunnel, a thruway for the B&O Railroad for over a century.

82
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:19,074
但在过去的80年里 对当地居民来说 这已经变得更加危险
But for the past 80 years, for local residents, it has become something far more sinister.

83
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:20,409
它变成了...
It's become home to...

84
00:06:20,411 --> 00:06:22,411
- 偷窥狂 - 偷窥狂
- Peeping Tom. - Peeping Tom.

85
00:06:22,413 --> 00:06:25,315
- 眨眼的人 - 眨眼先生
- The Blink Man. - Mr. Blink.

86
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:27,149
- 偷窥狂汤姆 - 偷窥狂汤姆
- Peeping Tom. - Peeping Tom.

87
00:06:27,151 --> 00:06:29,485
- 那个眨眼的人 - 伊尔切斯特性骚扰者
- The Blink Man. - The Ilchester The Molester.

88
00:06:29,487 --> 00:06:30,687
隧道人
The Tunnel Guy?

89
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,555
- 偷窥狂 - 老色鬼
- Peeping Tom. - Old Blinky.

90
00:06:32,557 --> 00:06:34,389
你们以前见过他吗？
Alright, so you guys have ever seen him before?

91
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:36,291
除非我现在是鬼 否则没见过
Unless I'm a ghost right now, then no!

92
00:06:36,293 --> 00:06:38,428
如果我看见他 我就死定了
If I saw him, I'd be dead.

93
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,197
我认识一个人 跟我差不多大
Yes, I did know this one fellow around my age,

94
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:46,601
大概64 65岁 他看到了眨眼的人
this is back around 64-65 or so, he saw The Blink Man.

95
00:06:46,603 --> 00:06:50,173
- 他怎么了？ - 嗯 他死了
- What happened to him? - Well, he died.

96
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:53,743
偷窥狂汤姆是一种你可以召唤的生物
Peeping Tom is the kind of creature that you can summon up,

97
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:58,348
有一种仪式 青少年朝圣什么的 午夜的公路旅行
so there is a ritual, those teen pilgrimages, you know, the midnight road trip,

98
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,317
午夜时分 你出现在隧道的尽头
you show up at the trestle end of the tunnel at midnight

99
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:07,423
你必须盯着这条隧道 看整整一个小时
and you have to stare down this tunnel, looking at the end for a full hour.

100
00:07:07,425 --> 00:07:09,726
如果你能做到这一点 不眨眼
And if you can do this without blinking,

101
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:14,663
偷窥狂汤姆就会从阴影中走出来 出现在你面前
Peeping Tom comes out of the shadows and materializes in front of you.

102
00:07:14,665 --> 00:07:19,267
他是一种超自然生物 被称为颤抖鬼
Now he's the class of supernatural creature called a Flimmern-Geist.

103
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:22,738
德国炼金术士在16世纪发明了这个术语
German alchemists came up with this term in the 1500s

104
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,375
指的是你在眼角看到的东西
for that thing, that you see in the corner of your eyes

105
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:30,346
但当你环顾四周 发现什么都没有
and when you look around to see it, there's nothing there.

106
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:32,180
偷窥狂汤姆实际上
Peeping Tom is a Flimmern-Geist

107
00:07:32,182 --> 00:07:35,084
是你可以看到的一个颤抖鬼
that you can actually bring into view.

108
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:37,753
- 嗯 他又高又黑 - 皮包骨头
- Well, he's tall, dark coat. - Skinny.

109
00:07:37,755 --> 00:07:39,454
- 高帽子 - 吓人的大眼睛
- Top hat. - Big scary eyes.

110
00:07:39,456 --> 00:07:41,324
大多数时候我听说他只是个影子
Mostly I've heard that he's just a shadow,

111
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:44,293
因为他就像你的周边视觉
'cause he's like in your peripheral vision.

112
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:46,529
瞬间在那里 然后不在那里 然后又在那里
Instantly there, then not there, then there again.

113
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:48,731
有个小妞 几年前
There was this one chick, in particular,

114
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:51,500
她在这条路上的一所学校上学
a few years ago, she went to the school right down the road.

115
00:07:51,502 --> 00:07:54,370
她和她的朋友们走到隧道轨道上
Her and her friends went up to the tunnel rail

116
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:59,108
他们开始凝视 她是唯一一个可以凝视那么久的人 因为你得不眨眼凝视
and they started staring down, she was the only one who could stare for... you have to stare

117
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,243
- 一个小时 - 一个小时
- for an hour. - For an hour.

118
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:02,110
奇怪的是
The twist is that

119
00:08:02,112 --> 00:08:05,281
一旦你看到了他 就无法无视他
once you've seen him, you can't unsee him.

120
00:08:05,283 --> 00:08:09,351
每次你眨眼的时候 他就会更近一些
Every time you blink, he's a little bit closer

121
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:14,423
每次你眨眼 他就会越来越近 直到他的脸出现在你的面前
and he comes closer and closer each time you blink until he's right in your face.

122
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:16,659
他听起来很可怕 他做了什么？
He sounds scary, what does he do?

123
00:08:16,661 --> 00:08:18,094
- 得到你 - 得到你
- Gets you. - Gets you.

124
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:19,228
现在你已经证明了
And now you've already proved

125
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,562
你可以很长一段时间都睁着眼
that you can keep your eyes open

126
00:08:20,564 --> 00:08:22,164
不闭上
for a long time,

127
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,699
那就是召唤他的方法
because that's how you conjure him up.

128
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:25,401
当他出现的时候
When he's right up there,

129
00:08:25,403 --> 00:08:27,402
死亡就在眼前的那种诱惑让你无法抗拒
the temptation is death staring you in the face,

130
00:08:27,404 --> 00:08:29,337
你要尽一切可能避开他
you do anything you can to avoid him.

131
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:31,139
但是他有一个诡计
But he's got a trick up his sleeve,

132
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:32,574
他有很长的睫毛
he has very long eyelashes

133
00:08:32,576 --> 00:08:35,143
你知道吧 你对小婴儿会这么做
and you know that thing that you do with babies,

134
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:37,213
在他们面前这样弄一弄 他也会这样对你
to give them a little, he does that,

135
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:41,349
然后你就忍不住了 眨眼了 我们怎么叫的...
and then you can't help it, you blink. What do we call that...

136
00:08:41,351 --> 00:08:43,419
我能展示一下吗 鬼...
Can I show it, like... Butterfly...

137
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:45,555
...鬼眨眼
...butterfly kisses.

138
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:47,623
我很确定 其实也说不好
I'm pretty sure there's only, I don't know,

139
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:51,426
世界上只有几个人
a couple of people in the world, period,

140
00:08:51,428 --> 00:08:54,229
可以直盯一个小时
that can stare for an hour straight.

141
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:57,733
好像是世界纪录还是什么 是不是一小时
I think the world record, I don't even know if the world record is an hour.

142
00:08:57,735 --> 00:09:03,305
我想纪录大概是30分钟 40分钟
I think the record is probably maybe 30 minutes, 40 minutes.

143
00:09:03,307 --> 00:09:05,407
盯着一样东西不眨眼10到15分钟真的很难
It's really hard to stare at something without blinking

144
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:09,277
这对大多数人来说真的很难
for even 10 or 15 minutes. It will be really difficult for most people.

145
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,682
当然了 没有任何纪录 人民忙于死亡而无暇报道
Well, of course, there's no record of it. People too busy dying to report it.

146
00:09:13,684 --> 00:09:18,186
即使你坚持了那么长时间 我的意思是你的视力会变得很模糊
Even if you made it out to that long, I mean the vision will be quite blurred and, again,

147
00:09:18,188 --> 00:09:21,357
我怎么强调都不过分 疼痛会非常折磨人
you know, I can't emphasize enough, the pain would be excruciating.

148
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:26,462
就像所有最棒的民间传说和都市传说一样
As with all the best folklore and urban legends,

149
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:30,266
你无法核实其中的任何细节
you can't really verify any of the details in this.

150
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:32,368
这种事总是发生在朋友的朋友身上
It's always happened to a friend of a friend.

151
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:37,473
我哥哥的朋友过去常讲他叔叔给他讲的故事
My brother's friend used to tell the story that his uncle told him.

152
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:40,575
过了一会儿 他们吓坏了 跑掉了
And they got freaked out after a while and they ran away

153
00:09:40,577 --> 00:09:42,744
但她在那里呆了整整一个小时
but she did stay there the whole hour.

154
00:09:42,746 --> 00:09:45,348
大约一个月后 他们发现他的尸体
Like a month later they found his body

155
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,315
漂在帕塔普斯科河上
floating in the Patapsco River.

156
00:09:47,317 --> 00:09:48,884
最后她试着往窗外看
She ended up trying to look out a window,

157
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:50,652
她试着通过直视太阳...
she tried to burn out her eyes...

158
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:52,488
烧掉她的眼睛
By looking at the sun.

159
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,290
虽然她看不见他
Even though she couldn't see him,

160
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:55,892
但他仍然存在
his presence was still there

161
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:58,361
所以她 你知道 她一直在想 她会眨眼
so she, you know, she thought the whole time, she gets blinks,

162
00:09:58,363 --> 00:09:59,695
总是会眨的 但是她...
she ended up blinking, but she...

163
00:09:59,697 --> 00:10:01,664
她能打败偷窥狂汤姆吗？
Can she beat Peeping Tom?

164
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,536
- 不过 不能作弊 - 不能欺骗偷窥狂汤姆
- Can't cheat, though. - Can't cheat Peeping Tom.

165
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:08,403
我认为这是在
You know, I think you'd be pushing the limits, I think,

166
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:10,739
挑战人类解剖学和生理学的极限
of the human anatomy and physiology,

167
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:13,242
但也许这毕竟是可能的
but maybe that's possible.

168
00:10:13,244 --> 00:10:14,776
很明显 从他给我分享的经历来讲
Obviously, from he shared with me,

169
00:10:14,778 --> 00:10:17,582
如果这是真的 那可真是个很糟糕的主意
that would be a terrible idea, if that's for real.

170
00:10:18,515 --> 00:10:20,815
缺乏证据并不是缺乏信念的原因
Absence of proof hasn't caused absence of belief.

171
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:23,752
伊彻斯特隧道仍然是青少年深夜出没的地方
Ilchester tunnel is still a late night hang out for teenagers

172
00:10:23,754 --> 00:10:26,254
也是兄弟会欺辱的热门场所
and a popular spot for fraternity hazing.

173
00:10:26,256 --> 00:10:31,662
这是一个经常有人去 但显然很少完成的挑战 直到现在
It's a dare often attempted, but apparently seldom completed. Until now.

174
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:35,531
午夜时分 你出现在隧道尽头
You show up at the trestle end of the tunnel at midnight...

175
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:37,733
磁带上的数据显示
The metadata on the tapes

176
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:41,671
这段视频拍摄于
show that it was filmed between February 14th

177
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:45,241
2004年2月14日至3月3日之间
and March 3rd of 2004.

178
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:50,378
我回去看了看当地所有的大学
OK, so I went back and I looked at all of the local colleges,

179
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,617
我打了电话 我走进镇上的每一所大学
I called, I walked into every college in town,

180
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:58,554
给他们看了索菲亚的照片 给他们看了费德曼的照片
showed them pictures of Sophia, showed them pictures of Feldman.

181
00:10:58,556 --> 00:11:01,958
没有任何信息 你根本搞不定这些人
No information. You can't get past these people at all.

182
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,896
没有记录显示沃尔夫博士的任何信息 据称她是他们的导师
There's no record of a doctor Wolfe who's supposedly their professor,

183
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:12,401
也没有迹象表明索菲亚和费德曼
there's no indication that the Peeping Tom specialist that Sophia and Feldman

184
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:16,305
登门拜访的那位偷窥狂专家真实存在
go and speak to in his home even exists,

185
00:11:16,307 --> 00:11:20,709
而那个亚裔美国人 我相信他应该是个眼科专家
an Asian American man, I believe he's supposed to be an eye specialist.

186
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:24,347
数据库中没有信息显示该人的存在
There's no title cards to show that this person even exists.

187
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:29,719
我分析了他们 反复观察他们
I analyzed them, and I watched them repeatedly, I looked back on

188
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:33,656
我回顾了每一个我能找到的与这些人匹配的事件
every incident reported I could find that would have matched

189
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:38,460
但我找不到任何匹配的
any of these people, and I can't find anything that matches up.

190
00:11:38,462 --> 00:11:42,797
我的看法是 他可能只是碰巧发现了一些学生电影
My hunch would say he probably found either some student films

191
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,736
或者有人自己制作恐怖电影 或者其他什么
or just somebody making her own horror movie or something like that.

192
00:11:46,738 --> 00:11:51,339
没有剪辑 没有重拍 没有要求采取行动
There's no cuts, there's no retakes, there's no calling for action,

193
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:54,443
除了电影的前两分钟
aside from the first two minutes of the movie,

194
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:58,917
索菲亚显然是在自己导演
where Sophia is obviously directing herself,

195
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:04,489
绝对没有证据表明有人在指挥他们
there's absolutely no evidence to suggest that somebody is directing them.

196
00:12:05,322 --> 00:12:10,358
我已经盯着它看了六个月了
I've been staring at it for the better part of six months right now.

197
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,628
我相信这百分之百是事实
I believe it's 100% genuine.

198
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,031
看起来像是旧片重制罢了
It looks like found footage.

199
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:16,364
- 电影   - 对
- Movie. - Alright.

200
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:18,033
旧片重制 我是说
Found footage, I mean,

201
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:19,969
这到底是什么意思呢？
what does that really mean?

202
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:21,804
我有找到什么录像吗？
Did I find the footage?

203
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:24,339
是有人交给我这些东西然后我再展示？ 如果是的话
Was it handed to me and then am I presenting it again? Yes.

204
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:25,907
那确实叫做旧片重制
That would be considered found footage,

205
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:27,877
但就恐怖电影来说
but as far as putting a horror movie together,

206
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,378
我真的不认为...
I don't really think that there's any...

207
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,814
我是一个优秀的电影制作人
I'm a, I'm a real filmmaker.

208
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:33,916
我们不会制作恐怖电影
OK, so we're not gonna be making horror movies.

209
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:37,652
我们做的是去揭示一些神秘事物的真相
We're gonna try to reveal the truth of something

210
00:12:37,654 --> 00:12:41,525
或者从中发现一些东西
that's a mystery or kind of get something out of it.

211
00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:45,761
当你制作的电影
When you make a film that is presenting itself

212
00:12:45,763 --> 00:12:48,763
呈现的不过是一个粗略剪辑的片段时
as roughly cut together found footage,

213
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:52,734
你可以为任何有问题的地方找借口
you are building in your excuse for anything that's wrong with it.

214
00:12:52,736 --> 00:12:57,506
伙计们 这是我们找到的录像 我们只是在展示
Uh, hey folks, this is the footage we found, we're just presenting it, yeah.

215
00:12:57,508 --> 00:13:01,410
相机到处晃动 不是因为我们不知道如何保持手持相机的稳定
The camera jiggles all over the place, not because we didn't know how to hold

216
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:05,480
而是因为这些在森林里迷路的孩子
a hand-held camera steady, but because these were kids lost in the woods

217
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:07,483
变得越来越害怕
getting more and more scared all the time.

218
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:09,785
我认为 如果这是第一部
I think what would make it more real,

219
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:12,821
没有被划分到任何一种类型去的电影的话
would be if it were the first one out there

220
00:13:12,823 --> 00:13:15,557
会让它更真实
and they were not following a certain genre.

221
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,826
就低预算水平来说确实不错
It works on a low-budget level

222
00:13:17,828 --> 00:13:20,698
而低预算也正是该类电影出现的主要原因
and that's the primary reason for, I think, for doing it.

223
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:25,901
所以我的观点是 要么约克先生自己自导自演了这一切
So my hunch is either Mr. York was doing that himself

224
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:29,037
试图获得一些证据 让它看起来更真实
and trying to get some credence to this and make it look legitimate,

225
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:35,643
要么他只是运行别人的项目 然后他们把它发出来
or he just run somebody else's project and they send it through.

226
00:13:35,645 --> 00:13:40,449
我们都很清楚 他找不到学生
Just so we're all clear, the reason that he can't find the students,

227
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:42,417
老师 眼科医生的原因
the teachers, the eye doctor...

228
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:44,719
我认为他们是演员
I believe they're actors.

229
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:47,623
你会意识到 除了评论家们给你的作品打上“欺骗性”标签之外
You realize that the first thing that critics will accuse you of,

230
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,657
他们可能还会指责你自己伪造了这部电影
after gullibility, is faking the film yourself.

231
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:53,796
当然 当然 这就是为什么没有人会相信
Of course, of course, and that's why nobody would believe this.

232
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:55,664
因为发现这部未完成的电影的人
Because it's a pretty big coincidence

233
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,432
恰好是电影制作人
that the person who finds the unfinished film

234
00:13:57,434 --> 00:13:58,901
这是一个很大的巧合
just happens to be a filmmaker.

235
00:13:58,903 --> 00:14:01,536
当然 反对者会这么说因为他们的工作就是
Right, sure, and the naysayers are gonna say that

236
00:14:01,538 --> 00:14:03,607
给别人提各种反对意见
because that's what they do, they naysay.

237
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:09,778
嗯 我不知道这是真的还是假的 但没关系
Hum, I don't know if it's real or not, but it doesn't really matter,

238
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,647
因为他对这是真的很兴奋 所以
because he's excited about it being real, so...

239
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:18,921
我们会把这段录像带给城里所有能找到的专业人士
We're gonna take this footage to every professional in town that we can find,

240
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:23,792
流言终结者协会 我们会去电台
ghosthunters, mythbusters, we're going to go to the radio stations,

241
00:14:23,794 --> 00:14:29,898
我们要去电视台 我们要播放录像
we're going to the TV stations, we're going to show the footage and we're gonna saturate

242
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,167
我们会用这些信息充斥整个电影市场
the market with this information.

243
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:36,638
如果你的计划是证明这段视频的真实性
If your plan is to try to present this as being 100% authentic,

244
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,042
为什么你不直接带上原始片段 马上召开一个新闻发布会呢？
why are you not simply taking the footage forward and calling a press conference right now?

245
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:46,549
你为什么要把视频处理好 为什么要把声效做好呢？
Why are you planning to have the video cleaned up, why are you looking to have the sound done?

246
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:52,054
你知道 我们需要尽我们所能地呈现最好的版本
Well, I mean, you know, we need to present the best possible version of this thing as we can,

247
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:56,995
然后我们要向世界证明偷窥汤姆的所在
then we're gonna prove to the world that Peeping Tom exists.

248
00:14:58,162 --> 00:15:00,766
相机不会说谎
The camera doesn't lie.

249
00:15:05,202 --> 00:15:11,675
我是梅尔·萨姆纳 19岁 政治学专业学生 凝视比赛冠军
Mel Sumner, 19, PolySci major and staring contest champion.

250
00:15:12,677 --> 00:15:14,810
好了 伙计 这后面是伊尔切斯特隧道
Alright, dude, so right down there is Ilchester tunnel

251
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:17,079
我们会让你站在那边的高架上
and we're gonna have you standing right over there

252
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:20,682
从12点开始 持续一个小时
on the other of the trestle, starting at 12 for an hour.

253
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:22,818
那么 我到底该看什么？
Well, how the hell am I supposed to see at the end of that?

254
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,186
你们别担心
Y'all, just don't worry about it.

255
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:27,623
- 你准备好了吗？ - 是的 开始吧
- You ready? - Yes, let's stare at it.

256
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:33,932
好吧 离午夜还有10秒 开始
Alright, ten seconds to midnight starting... now.

257
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:39,167
- 感觉怎么样？ - 太催眠了
- What's it feels like? - It's so hypnotic!

258
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:42,537
你真的看不到那的任何东西
You literally, you can't really see anything down there.

259
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:43,707
我能看到
I can see.

260
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:49,714
这太可怕了 就像隧道也在盯着我一样
That's so creepy, it's like the tunnel's like staring right back at me.

261
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:54,916
这有点像终极凝视比赛 你知道的
This is kind of like the ultimate staring contest, you know, like...

262
00:15:54,918 --> 00:16:00,024
即使我赢了 我也不能再眨眼了
even if I win, I can never really blink again.

263
00:16:00,857 --> 00:16:03,057
我们有多少时间？
How much, how much time we're at?

264
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:05,261
- 加油 伙计 - 你能行的 伙计
- Come on, dude! - You got it, man!

265
00:16:05,263 --> 00:16:06,862
别和我说话
Please stop talking to me.

266
00:16:06,864 --> 00:16:09,567
- 索菲亚 闭嘴         - 别说话了
- Sophia, shut up. - Stop talking.

267
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,072
你没事吧？
You're alright?

268
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,076
妈的 我的天
Fuck! Oh, God!

269
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:27,215
你为什么想要数码相机？
Why do you want Handycam?

270
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:29,685
我们用我们的好相机来纪录这个
We're using our good camera to document this,

271
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:31,156
我想要拍下那个 好吗？
I wanna be able to document that, OK?

272
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:36,324
你知道这段录像和你想象的完全不一样 对吧？
You realize the footage will come nowhere close to matching up, right?

273
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:39,663
这是纪录片 伙计 不一定要完全一样
It's documentary, dude, it doesn't have to match.

274
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:43,031
我不理会你刚才说的话
I'm gonna ignore that you just said that.

275
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:48,304
我们现在要做的是设置这个摄像头
So, what we're doing now is we set up this camera,

276
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:50,672
我要从午夜开始在隧道里拍摄
I'm gonna shoot it down the tunnel

277
00:16:50,674 --> 00:16:53,041
一直到凌晨1点
starting right at midnight, it's gonna go all the way to 1:00 a.m.

278
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:55,611
- 好吧 - 现在它将取代人眼
- Yeah. - Now this will take the place

279
00:16:55,613 --> 00:16:58,647
它不会眨眼
of a human eye and it will not blink,

280
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:02,050
它会一直运行 希望就在凌晨1点
it will constantly run and hopefully right at 1:00 a.m.,

281
00:17:02,052 --> 00:17:06,525
就像传说中的 偷窥狂汤姆会出现
as the legend says, Peeping Tom will show up

282
00:17:07,357 --> 00:17:09,892
对我的相机进行鬼眨眼
and butterfly kiss my camera.

283
00:17:09,894 --> 00:17:11,826
听着 尽管我很讨厌这么说
Look, as much as I hate to say this

284
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:13,696
但我认为这样做可能真的不行
I think this actually has a really good shot of working

285
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:15,797
因为什么来着...？
before you let this go to your head

286
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:18,232
镜头就是一双眼睛 不是吗？
simply because a lens is like an eye, OK?

287
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:23,238
- 快门 我们好了  - 快门？
- The shutter, we're good, OK? - The shutter?

288
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,074
是快门 从技术层面来说
Yes, I think the shutter. Well, technically...

289
00:17:26,076 --> 00:17:28,076
这不过是相机的一个部件
That's the only part of the camera...

290
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,582
从技术上讲 这就相当于人眨眼 你说啥？
Technically, that would be blinking. The what?

291
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:39,787
好了 伙计 我们马上就开始了
Alright, man, we're coming up on it.

292
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:41,757
- 几点了？ - 你准备好了吗？
- What's the time? - You ready?

293
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,225
几点了？
What's the time?

294
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:44,325
我们还有十秒钟的时间
We've got ten more seconds

295
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:46,362
现在开始
starting now.

296
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:48,396
十   九...
Ten, nine...

297
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:50,699
眨眼先生 看到什么了吗？
Come on, Mr. Blink, See anything?

298
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:53,837
- 没有 没看到  - 继续
- No, nothing. - Come on!

299
00:17:54,971 --> 00:17:58,175
现在 时间到了
And, now!

300
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,344
看到什么了吗？
See anything?

301
00:18:02,346 --> 00:18:04,082
别关相机 你看到什么了吗？
Don't kill it! You see anything?

302
00:18:05,215 --> 00:18:07,282
你看到什么了吗？
Do you see anything?

303
00:18:07,284 --> 00:18:10,121
费德曼 回答我的问题 你看的什么了吗？
Feldman, answer my question, do you see anything?

304
00:18:10,988 --> 00:18:13,825
不要关相机 给他点时间
Do not kill the camera, just give him a second to...

305
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:16,660
妈的
Fuck!

306
00:18:18,461 --> 00:18:23,731
...你住的地方 但是如果我要整理的话 得把这里清理一下
...that you live in, but if I'm gonna be here to yada yada, clean this up a little bit,

307
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:27,271
这些磁带 我能不能弄个盒子
I mean, as far as the tapes go, can I make like a box, like the...

308
00:18:28,204 --> 00:18:30,905
- 好的  - 你拿一个鞋盒 或者...
- OK. - You got a shoe box , or...

309
00:18:30,907 --> 00:18:32,841
我们改天再来解决这个问题
We'll just work on this another day.

310
00:18:32,843 --> 00:18:35,747
我们有后备计划吗？
Do we have a backup plan here?

311
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:41,449
伙计 伙计 伙计 你看到了吗？
Dude, dude, dude, dude! Are you seeing that?

312
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:42,785
我看到什么了吗？
Am I seeing what?

313
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:44,219
费德曼 看这里
Feldman, look right there!

314
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:46,421
费德曼 看这里
Feldman, look right there!

315
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:48,225
- 我知道 - 你看见了吗？
- Yeah! I know. - Do you see that?

316
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:52,861
什么？ 是在那里还是...
What? Was that there or...

317
00:18:52,863 --> 00:18:54,796
你看到了吗？那是什么鬼东西？
Do you see that? What the fuck is that?

318
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:57,865
- 我没加上去  - 你是认真的吗？
- I didn't add it! - Are you serious?

319
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:00,302
- 哦 我的天哪 我想...  - 天哪
- Oh, my gosh, I think... - Holy shit!

320
00:19:00,304 --> 00:19:02,970
有没有什么办法能让它更亮一点
Is there any way that you can brighten this, like whatsoever.

321
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:07,008
是啊 是啊 虽然成果可能不咋地 但是我能做到
Yeah, yeah, I mean it's gonna look like hell, but no, I can do it.

322
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,911
好吧 你想让我现在就拿相机吗？
OK, do you want me to take the camera right now?

323
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:10,478
我要把灯打开
So, I'm bringing up the light.

324
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,150
酷 酷 打开吧
Cool, cool, do it!

325
00:19:15,986 --> 00:19:17,920
- 天哪 伙计 - 对了
- Gosh, dude! - Bang!

326
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:19,287
就他妈的在那儿
Right fucking there!

327
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:21,724
那正好是报时时间
That was right on the hour mark.

328
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:23,324
放大 放大
Zoom in, zoom in.

329
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:25,960
好了 这是我能做到的最接近的了
Alright, this is the closest I can get with that,

330
00:19:25,962 --> 00:19:27,962
还能看到那个鬼东西 准备好了吗？
and like still be able to see shit, so you ready?

331
00:19:27,964 --> 00:19:31,201
好了 好了 开始吧
Alright, alright, go, go!

332
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:35,205
-天哪 - 哦 我的天哪
- Holy shit! - Oh, my gosh!

333
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:38,407
看看那个混蛋
Look at that motherfucker!

334
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:40,209
你在跟我开玩笑
You're kidding me!

335
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:42,777
五分钟前 一切都结束了
Like five minutes ago, this is all over,

336
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:45,113
但是我们看到了偷窥狂汤姆
but we have Peeping Tom here!

337
00:19:45,115 --> 00:19:47,985
- 我们他妈的看到了他 伙计 - 哦 我的天哪
- We fucking got him, man! - Oh my gosh!

338
00:19:49,953 --> 00:19:56,225
我看不出有任何迹象表明它是伪造的 或者说...
I don't see any signs that it was faked, in the sense that like it was...

339
00:19:56,227 --> 00:19:58,826
看不出有人用电脑技术加入了一些东西
like someone went in with a computer and added something,

340
00:19:58,828 --> 00:20:01,830
没有什么东西可以明确地指出
like there's nothing in there that I can definitively point to and say:

341
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:02,965
好吧 这是假的
"OK, this is a fake."

342
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:04,866
所以 我想说的是
So, I would go with that,

343
00:20:04,868 --> 00:20:06,501
与此同时 你也知道
at the same time, you know,

344
00:20:06,503 --> 00:20:07,969
这是一个很小的视频
it's a small little video,

345
00:20:07,971 --> 00:20:09,371
没有太多的细节
there's not a lot of detail,

346
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:11,940
所以我对这两种说法都不太确定
so I'm hesitant to commit either way,

347
00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:14,776
但是我 如果...
but I, if it was...

348
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:17,813
如果有什么东西在那里  实况可能正是展示的这样
if something were there, it would probably look like that.

349
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:20,516
就这个镜头而言
You were convinced that that would just

350
00:20:20,518 --> 00:20:26,455
敢肯定的是 这是自然光线下的结果 而不是对特定镜头的操纵
be natural lighting, no manipulation as far as that particular shot is concerned.

351
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:31,125
我不相信任何事 这当然是可能的
Well, I'm not convinced of anything, it's certainly plausible.

352
00:20:31,127 --> 00:20:32,928
对 但你不排除这种可能性
Right, but you're not ruling it out.

353
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,395
我不能指着任何东西说
I can't point to anything and say:

354
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:35,831
这是假的
"This makes is a fake."

355
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,431
可能是一个人 穿着衣服
It could be a guy, dressed up,

356
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:39,301
也许是站在后面了
standing up in the back maybe,

357
00:20:39,303 --> 00:20:42,403
可能是一场恶作剧
like, you know, it could be a practical kind of hoax,

358
00:20:42,405 --> 00:20:45,574
可能是有人拿这个片段用电脑加工了
like someone could have taken this and in a computer,

359
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:48,442
操纵画面什么的
it's gone and manipulated it.

360
00:20:48,444 --> 00:20:53,181
镜头等同于眼睛的这个想法可不行
The idea of the technological equivalent of the actual eye,

361
00:20:53,183 --> 00:20:56,818
眼睛是人类有机体的一部分
which is actually a part of the human organism,

362
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,923
至于人类的大脑 将照相机作为与之真正等同的东西
and the human mind, the idea of using a camera as a real equivalent of that,

363
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:06,562
形而上的等同物的想法 让我觉得很难接受
metaphysical equivalent, strikes me as... I have a hard time with that.

364
00:21:06,564 --> 00:21:11,035
我不知道 伙计 你 我是说我们坐在这里试图解释鬼魂 所以
I don't know, man, you, I mean we're sitting here trying to explain spirits, so...

365
00:21:11,602 --> 00:21:14,303
如果你想理性地讨论一下
If you want to have a rational conversation about ghosts

366
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:18,373
鬼怪和半兽人与摄像技术的区别 我不太确定适不适合
and goblins versus camera technology, I'm not really sure.

367
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,909
我们在哪里？我们要做什么？
So, where are we? What are we doing?

368
00:21:20,911 --> 00:21:23,545
我们现在在马里兰州格伦伯尼的一个兴趣小组
We are at the VFW in Glen Burnie, Maryland,

369
00:21:23,547 --> 00:21:28,984
我要去给一群超自然现象调查人员
and I'm gonna go and present some of the footage to an assembled group

370
00:21:28,986 --> 00:21:34,926
展示一些视频 在这里找一些盟友
of paranormal investigators, ghosthunters and get some allies here.

371
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:38,192
今晚的重头戏是什么？
What's the end game here tonight?

372
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:41,263
重头戏就是当我们做新闻发布会的时候
Well, the end game is that when we do the press conference,

373
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:44,432
我可以让几个人站在我旁边说
I can have a handful of these people standing beside me saying:

374
00:21:44,434 --> 00:21:46,034
镜头是真实的
"Footage is real,

375
00:21:46,036 --> 00:21:48,069
我们支持你 加文 我们相信你
we're behind you, Gavin, we believe you!"

376
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:52,240
然后他们 我想大概有10000人左右 所以
And then they... I think they reach some 10,000 people or something, so...

377
00:21:52,242 --> 00:21:55,477
我们的脸书页面有超过8000个粉丝
Our Facebook page has over 8,000 likes

378
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:58,479
其中大多数人喜欢超自然现象
and most of those people

379
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:02,551
有些人想登上我们的脸书主页
are into the paranormal or they want to be on our Facebook page.

380
00:22:02,553 --> 00:22:07,655
我可以把帖子放在那里让别人看
So, yes, I could put it out there for others to see.

381
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:11,226
我们来展示偷窥狂汤姆来到隧道的镜头
We're just gonna show the image of Peeping Tom coming up to the tunnel.

382
00:22:11,228 --> 00:22:14,595
给他们看鬼魂的话为什么不把全部证据都展示出来？
Why are you only showing the ghost and apparently the ghost proofs?

383
00:22:14,597 --> 00:22:16,297
只需要那一个镜头就足够了
Just that one shot.

384
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:18,400
我认为他们不需要任何其他信息
I don't think they need any of the other information,

385
00:22:18,402 --> 00:22:20,602
我认为现在我们只是想确定
I think right now we're just trying to determine whether

386
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:24,273
偷窥狂汤姆是否是一个真实的存在
or not Peeping Tom is a real entity and the story about

387
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:29,111
以及索菲亚和其他人的故事及真实情况 大家对这个感兴趣的
Sophia and the big guns and on the actual what happened. I think you want to see that.

388
00:22:29,113 --> 00:22:32,113
你们和我能想到的唯一合理的解释
The only plausible explanation that you folks could think

389
00:22:32,115 --> 00:22:34,216
以及我想到的第一件事
and myself and the first thing I thought of

390
00:22:34,218 --> 00:22:36,117
是这一定是一个穿西装的人
was this has got to be a guy in a suit,

391
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:38,253
这是一个站在隧道尽头的人
this is somebody standing there at the end of the tunnel,

392
00:22:38,255 --> 00:22:41,023
他们在玩一个恶作剧 是吗？
they're playing a practical joke, OK?

393
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:45,526
然而 这个理论的错误之处在于
The thing that this bunks that theory however is the fact that the metadata

394
00:22:45,528 --> 00:22:48,162
两个摄像头上的元数据都显示那里没有其他人
on both cameras say that there was no one else there.

395
00:22:48,164 --> 00:22:51,603
一个摄像头拍另一个摄像头 我们有证据证明
One camera films the other camera, we've got proof of both of that

396
00:22:52,403 --> 00:22:55,036
这两个摄像头都打开了 这是回放时发生的事情
it turned on, this is what happens when they played it back.

397
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,073
现在你需要引起每个人的兴趣 我们要让他们开始议论
Right now you just want to pick everybody's interest, we're gonna get them to talk,

398
00:22:58,075 --> 00:23:01,575
谁是偷窥狂汤姆 隧道又是怎么回事？要充斥你的大脑
"Who's Peeping Tom, the tunnel?" Right here in your mind. Just phew!

399
00:23:01,577 --> 00:23:03,378
你们怎么看他的展示
Gonna get it so he showed you.

400
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,546
在他向我们展示更多之前 我们不能确定
Until he shows us more, we just don't know.

401
00:23:05,548 --> 00:23:09,551
- 说得对 - 我们相信有这种可能性
- Right! - We believe there's a possibility,

402
00:23:09,553 --> 00:23:10,622
但我们需要更多的证据
but we need more evidence.

403
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:18,994
接下来的一步将会是沃尔夫的重大发现
Saying everything else for, you know, that next big steps will be wolf's surprise.

404
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:22,064
可能会有更好的结果
It'll probably work out a lot better too.

405
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:24,065
你可以看到我看到的
So you know, you can see what I saw.

406
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:26,601
我们已经开始的旅程
I mean the journey that we've already been on.

407
00:23:26,603 --> 00:23:28,603
你不能说这是不可能的
You can't tell that this isn't gonna be the shot,

408
00:23:28,605 --> 00:23:33,674
这是加文的机会 这也是我第二次机会
this is Gavin's chance, this is my second chance to make it.

409
00:23:33,676 --> 00:23:35,242
财富和荣耀
Fortune and glory!

410
00:23:35,244 --> 00:23:36,611
让我们回顾一下
Let's go back a little bit,

411
00:23:36,613 --> 00:23:38,580
让我们以电影制作人的身份来谈谈你的看法吧
let's talk about you as a filmmaker.

412
00:23:38,582 --> 00:23:41,016
你上学是为了拍电影？
You went to school for filmmaking?

413
00:23:41,018 --> 00:23:44,018
是的 我没有学位 这就是我想告诉大家的
Yeah, my non-degree, that's what I like to tell everybody it was.

414
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,655
他做过很多婚礼视频 你知道 有结婚季
He does a lot of weddings, so, you know, there's wedding season

415
00:23:47,657 --> 00:23:53,061
淡季的时候收入就有点不稳定了
and then in the off season it's kind of a little bit more spotty.

416
00:23:53,063 --> 00:23:55,263
随着时间的流逝
And then as the years went by,

417
00:23:55,265 --> 00:24:01,335
这成为了一种支付账单的方式 同时也让自己相信自己是一名电影制作人
it became a way to pay the bills and to still convince myself that I'm a filmmaker.

418
00:24:01,337 --> 00:24:05,507
现在 这只是一种支付账单的方式
Now, it's just a way to pay the bills.

419
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:09,012
现在不是结婚季吗？
Isn't this wedding season right now?

420
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,382
现在是七月
Yeah, it's July.

421
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:16,086
对不起 我不想让任何人难堪 但是
I'm sorry, I don't want to embarrass anybody, but it...

422
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,992
她总是风风火火的 总是来借钱
She's always hectic, she's always happened to come and borrow money and,

423
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:26,795
这也不让我烦恼 这也是我们来这里的目的
and that doesn't bother me, that's what we're here for, right,

424
00:24:26,797 --> 00:24:30,097
确保一切都是...
to make sure that everything's...

425
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:32,566
确保我们可以帮忙 一切都顺利
We can help out. Everything's OK.

426
00:24:32,568 --> 00:24:36,771
加文知道你有去别处寻求帮助吗？
Does Gavin know that you're getting help?

427
00:24:36,773 --> 00:24:39,708
反正我寻求的所谓帮助
I mean it's not so much help

428
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:44,645
也不是很多 所以没有提过
that it needs to be discussed or whatever.

429
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:47,516
我问你一个问题 你要拍他们的电影
So, let me ask you a question, you're taking their film

430
00:24:47,518 --> 00:24:49,817
and you're trying to show it to the world,

431
00:24:49,819 --> 00:24:53,154
但是你为什么不像我一样干我正在做的事情吗？
but why aren't you making this movie that I'm making right now?

432
00:24:53,156 --> 00:24:56,690
你为什么不拍一部自己的电影
Why aren't you doing a film of your own essentially rather than just,

433
00:24:56,692 --> 00:24:58,794
而不是把别人的拍完？
you know, taking somebody else's and finishing it?

434
00:24:58,796 --> 00:25:01,696
如果我这么做 没人会相信的 好吗？
Nobody would believe this if I did it, OK?

435
00:25:01,698 --> 00:25:05,132
没人会相信一部关于我寻找素材
Nobody's gonna believe a documentary about me finding footage

436
00:25:05,134 --> 00:25:07,169
并将其组合起来而且为此四处奔波的纪录片
and putting it together and running around.

437
00:25:07,171 --> 00:25:10,404
这就是我们需要你的原因 这就是你来这里讲述这个故事的原因
That's why we need you, that's why you're here to tell the story.

438
00:25:10,406 --> 00:25:17,481
因为如果观众不相信这段录像 那么你的境遇也和我一样了
Because if the audience doesn't believe the footage, then you're in the same exact place.

439
00:25:20,284 --> 00:25:23,388
进来
Come in!

440
00:25:25,521 --> 00:25:27,255
伙计们
Fellas!

441
00:25:27,257 --> 00:25:30,092
- 我是加文 你好吗？ - 你好吗？加文·约克
- Gavin, how are you doing? - How are you? Gavin York.

442
00:25:30,094 --> 00:25:31,293
我想要确保
I want to make sure

443
00:25:31,295 --> 00:25:32,827
这是经过深思熟虑的
that this is well thought out,

444
00:25:32,829 --> 00:25:34,662
我们会认真对待
put together with a lot of care.

445
00:25:34,664 --> 00:25:37,298
我们从事这个行业是因为我们喜欢娱乐大众
We're in this business because we like to entertain,

446
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,669
是因为我们想赚钱 明白吗？
but we're in this business because we want to make money, OK?

447
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:44,271
我理解 这是一种旧片重制的镜头风格
It's found footage, I understand, it's a found footage style.

448
00:25:44,273 --> 00:25:50,447
好吧 但这是真实的 我确实找到了素材
Well, it's real. As in "It's found footage, because I found the footage."

449
00:25:52,182 --> 00:25:54,216
- 好的   - 真的是我找到的
- OK. - I actually found it.

450
00:25:54,218 --> 00:25:55,717
- 好的  - 好吧
- Right. - OK.

451
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:57,719
但你明白为什么它看起来可疑对吧
But you understand why it looks suspicious

452
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:59,720
因为你不只是单纯把原始镜头放在那里
that rather than just putting the footage out there,

453
00:25:59,722 --> 00:26:03,658
你已经把它处理过了 混合过了
you are having it cleaned up and mixed

454
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,192
并且发行了出来
for theatrical release.

455
00:26:05,194 --> 00:26:06,728
但是谁会知道呢？
But who is gonna know that?

456
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,395
而你现在把它当电影看
You're treating it right now like a movie.

457
00:26:08,397 --> 00:26:10,231
但你为什么不能两者兼得呢？
But why can't you treat it both?

458
00:26:10,233 --> 00:26:11,900
处理原始材料有点与这些视频的
Cleaning it up kind of defeats the purpose

459
00:26:11,902 --> 00:26:14,568
粗糙质感这一初衷违背了
of it being this gritty found footage found in a basement.

460
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,571
我的意思是 我并不是真的想四处跑然后说
I guess, I mean I'm not really trying

461
00:26:16,573 --> 00:26:19,207
嘿 看看它有多粗糙
to walk around and say, "Hey, look how gritty it is!"

462
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:20,609
这是你的项目
It's your project.

463
00:26:20,611 --> 00:26:22,477
一切都归结于如何去做
It all comes down to how to approach it

464
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:24,478
当我们决定好的时候
and when we figure out how we're gonna approach it,

465
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,180
我们可以帮你做预算
then we can help you budget for it.

466
00:26:26,182 --> 00:26:27,815
- 当然 - 我知道这是个问题
- Sure. - I understand that

467
00:26:27,817 --> 00:26:30,751
我知道这不是很有趣
that's a concern. I understand that it isn't so fun.

468
00:26:30,753 --> 00:26:33,854
- 是的 但是关于那个 - 在这个项目中
- Yeah, yeah, but about that... - In the project...

469
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,259
说实话 你能负担得起多少？
Realistically, how much can you afford?

470
00:26:39,229 --> 00:26:41,863
实际上 我什么也买不起
Realistically, I can't afford anything.

471
00:26:41,865 --> 00:26:47,635
这对我们来说是一个从底层突破的机会
This is an opportunity for us to get in like on the ground floor.

472
00:26:47,637 --> 00:26:52,507
这是一个转折点 当你看的时候 你就会知道
This is a game changer. When you watch it, you will know.

473
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:54,508
你想让它们被这么操作
You're trying to get them to do this...

474
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,912
基本是免费 没有人工
For free, for zero, for a piece of the pie.

475
00:26:57,914 --> 00:27:01,716
我们都知道这些对话经常发生
We all know these conversations happen all the time and in the reality of it is that,

476
00:27:01,718 --> 00:27:05,420
而事实上 作为一项业务
as a business, there's got to be some kind of

477
00:27:05,422 --> 00:27:07,889
必须有某种对我们有效的流程 好让我们付得起电费
process that works for us that keeps our lights on

478
00:27:07,891 --> 00:27:09,360
- 是这个理 - 哦 当然 当然
- so to speak. - Oh, sure, sure.

479
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:12,459
如果我必须付钱
If I have to pay,

480
00:27:12,461 --> 00:27:18,266
我愿意付1500美元
I'm willing to go maybe $1,500.

481
00:27:18,268 --> 00:27:20,235
我们大概会卖
We could probably do about

482
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:24,405
2000美元 但之后只能吃拉面了
$2,000, but then it's gonna be a lot of ramen noodles.

483
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:30,946
大多数服务都涵盖了各种内容 即使是独立电影的收益也是10%到20%
Most features that get full packages, even on an indie rate are anywhere from like 10 to 20.

484
00:27:30,948 --> 00:27:37,388
不谈成这件事我是不会离开的
I can't leave here without them agreeing to do this.

485
00:27:38,689 --> 00:27:41,288
好吧 费德曼 让我来谈 好吗？
Alright, Feldman, just let me do the talking, OK?

486
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,824
- 没问题 - 谢谢
- Sure! - Cool! Thank you!

487
00:27:46,563 --> 00:27:48,830
- 嗨 沃尔夫导师？ - 克兰小姐
- Hey, Dr. Wolfe? - Miss Crane.

488
00:27:48,832 --> 00:27:51,632
嘿 我知道我来的时候太早了
Hey, I know it's first thing early in the morning and everything,

489
00:27:51,634 --> 00:27:53,735
但是我们有一些很棒的
but we have something really awesome

490
00:27:53,737 --> 00:27:55,903
纪录片要给你看 如果你能够...
to show you for the documentary and it would be great...

491
00:27:55,905 --> 00:27:59,341
哇哦 费德曼先生 相机是怎么回事？
Wow, wow. Mr. Feldman, what's with the camera?

492
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:00,976
我来说 费德曼
I got this, Feldman.

493
00:28:00,978 --> 00:28:02,710
实际上是为了纪录片
It's actually for the documentary.

494
00:28:02,712 --> 00:28:05,513
我们要给你们看一些东西
There's actually something that we need to show you.

495
00:28:05,515 --> 00:28:07,649
嘿 费德曼 你在放吗？
Hey, Feldman, are you rolling?

496
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:08,719
是的
Yeah.

497
00:28:09,786 --> 00:28:11,452
这一切只是发生在五秒钟内
All this will become very clear in five seconds,

498
00:28:11,454 --> 00:28:13,555
但我们把整个过程都纪录下来了
but we are documenting this entire process.

499
00:28:13,557 --> 00:28:15,726
就在凌晨1点发生的
So, right at 1 a.m. this is what happened.

500
00:28:19,462 --> 00:28:22,396
- 嗯 - 如何？
- Hmm. - So?

501
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:24,565
- 做得好 - 你怎么看？
- Nicely done! - What do you think?

502
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:27,469
这个特效很好 你们做的不错
An excellent effect! You guys have done a good job!

503
00:28:27,471 --> 00:28:30,604
不 沃尔夫博士 这不是做的效果 这是真的
No, Dr. Wolfe, this is not an effect, this is for real!

504
00:28:30,606 --> 00:28:32,507
你之前和我说的不是这么回事
This is not the project we talked about,

505
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:34,342
但是你现在手上的材料不错
but you've got a nice premise here,

506
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:35,910
你可以再好好加把劲加点别的
you've got something you can work with,

507
00:28:35,912 --> 00:28:38,313
把它变成一部非常出色的恐怖片
you can turn this into a very sweet horror film.

508
00:28:38,315 --> 00:28:39,948
- 我们 - 等一下 好吗？
- We... - Just one second, OK?

509
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,350
我的相机快没电了
My camera it's about run out of batteries.

510
00:28:42,352 --> 00:28:44,753
好的 请把相机拿过来 这是灰色数据 沃尔夫博士
OK, get the camera, please. OK, this is grey data, Dr. Wolfe.

511
00:28:44,755 --> 00:28:48,492
我们现在需要你的建议 好吗？
We need your advising right now, OK? This...

512
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,760
你想拍的这部心理剧
...psychodrama you're trying to do here

513
00:28:52,762 --> 00:28:55,764
我尊重你 你想要有创意
and I respect, you're trying to be creative and all,

514
00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:58,632
但我对你拍我感到很不舒服
but I'm very uncomfortable with you filming me.

515
00:28:58,634 --> 00:29:00,669
我们根本没时间去做什么特效
There would not have been enough time to put all these

516
00:29:00,671 --> 00:29:02,671
或者其他什么的
enhancements in it and everything else.

517
00:29:02,673 --> 00:29:05,073
这家伙也不懂什么技术
This guy doesn't know what the hell he's doing.

518
00:29:05,075 --> 00:29:06,908
费德曼 五分钟再回来吧
Take five, Feldman.

519
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,510
听着 我不会拿我的好名声冒险
Look, I would not put my good name on the line.

520
00:29:09,512 --> 00:29:12,380
从你离开隧道的那一刻起
Did you have that tape in your hands

521
00:29:12,382 --> 00:29:16,750
你每天24小时都拿着那盘带子吗？
24/7 from the moment that you walked away from that tunnel?

522
00:29:16,752 --> 00:29:20,322
费德曼是个懒鬼 他六年的学业计划已经进行到了第七年了
Feldman is a slacker, he's in the seventh year of his six-year plan

523
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:23,525
但他是一个天才 你知道吗？
to get through school and, you know what? He's a genius.

524
00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:25,392
在拿相机做事时
He's a genius when it comes to the camera

525
00:29:25,394 --> 00:29:26,760
他就是一个天才
and doing things with it.

526
00:29:26,762 --> 00:29:28,830
我给民俗通先生打了电话
Well, I called Mr. Folklore

527
00:29:28,832 --> 00:29:30,398
在他的电话上留了言
and left a message on his machine,

528
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,066
所以我想我们应该
so I guess we should

529
00:29:32,068 --> 00:29:33,003
先和他谈谈
have talked to him first.

530
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,071
我们为什么不现在就去找他呢？
Well, why don't we just go talk to him now?

531
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:38,539
我不能理解的是 有人怎么看了一眼这段录像
My big thing is how did anybody look at that footage

532
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:40,074
就说它不是真的？
and say that it's not real?

533
00:29:40,076 --> 00:29:44,645
我也是这样想啊 我们自己都还在消化
That's what I'm saying. Obviously, we're still learning.

534
00:29:44,647 --> 00:29:46,650
这东西根本就没办法造假
Like, you just can't fake that.

535
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:52,586
- 快啊  - 有回答吗？
- Come on! - Anything?

536
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:53,955
- 没有 - 那可太棒了
- No! - Awesome!

537
00:29:53,957 --> 00:29:56,360
我去旁边看看
I'm gonna check the side.

538
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:02,796
老实说 我觉得爬进他的窗户有点怪 但是
Honestly, I feel a little weird about creeping in his window, but...

539
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,433
他自己就是个怪咖 我敢说你爬他的窗根本不算什么
This is a folklore guy, I'm sure this is the least creepy thing about it.

540
00:30:06,435 --> 00:30:08,135
嗯
Yeah.

541
00:30:08,137 --> 00:30:09,874
- 有发现吗？ - 没有
- Anything? - No!

542
00:30:12,142 --> 00:30:14,912
该死 现在怎么办？
Shit! Now what?

543
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,581
1527号？
1527?

544
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:23,718
哦 是这个 是这个 就在这
Oh, this is it, this is it, right here.

545
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,323
各位 就是这所房子
You guys, this is the house.

546
00:30:27,022 --> 00:30:28,792
哦 天哪
Oh, my God.

547
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:32,494
就像在梦里一样 我不敢相信我们真的在这里
Just like being in a dream, I can't believe we're actually here.

548
00:30:32,496 --> 00:30:37,766
毫无疑问 我的整个写作生涯都是围绕这些“古怪系列”小说来的
It was undoubtedly through the Weird books that I have worked on for a good...

549
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:43,004
我花了7-8年的时间写了这一系列“怪异”丛书
It was about 7-8 years I was working on this series of Weird books

550
00:30:43,006 --> 00:30:45,940
当然宾夕法尼亚州和马里兰州的那几本
and certainly in Pennsylvania and Maryland,

551
00:30:45,942 --> 00:30:48,476
是我最出名的作品
this is what I'm best known for.

552
00:30:52,516 --> 00:30:54,582
- 雷克先生 - 约克先生
- Mr. Lake! - Mr. York!

553
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:55,917
- 叫我加文 拜托了 - 加文
- Call me, Gavin, please! - Gavin.

554
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,852
这是摄制组和大家
This is the camera crew and everybody!

555
00:30:57,854 --> 00:30:59,019
嗨  来吧
Hi! Come on...

556
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:00,488
别理他们
Just don't pay them any mind,

557
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,756
他们会做他们该做的事
they're just gonna do their thing.

558
00:31:01,758 --> 00:31:04,159
- 好的 - 这个地方真棒
- OK. - This place is great!

559
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:06,728
我得告诉你 这太刺激了
I have to tell you, this is an absolute thrill,

560
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,730
我研究这个房子已经六个月了
it's been about six months I've been studying this place.

561
00:31:09,732 --> 00:31:12,033
哇  这太不寻常了
Wow, that's kind of unusual!

562
00:31:12,035 --> 00:31:13,971
就在这里 就是这个
Right here, this is it!

563
00:31:14,904 --> 00:31:19,073
就是这里  就是你当年做采访的地方
This is it, this is the spot where you gave your interview.

564
00:31:19,075 --> 00:31:21,508
- 我依稀记得 - 十年前
- I vaguely remember it. - Ten years ago!

565
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:25,747
是啊 我家里很少有工作人员
Yeah! I don't often have crews in my house.

566
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:28,149
加文在脸书上给我发了一条信息
Yeah, Gavin sent me a message on Facebook

567
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:31,819
他告诉我他找到了我的一个片段
and he told me that he found small footage of me,

568
00:31:31,821 --> 00:31:33,755
所以我很想看录像
so I'm kind of interested to see the footage.

569
00:31:33,757 --> 00:31:35,757
睁大你的眼睛
Keep your eyes open

570
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:37,792
很长一段时间 就是这样召唤他的
for a long time because that's how you conjure him up.

571
00:31:37,794 --> 00:31:39,661
当他在那里的时候.
When he's right up there,

572
00:31:39,663 --> 00:31:41,528
死亡就在眼前的那种诱惑让你无法抗拒的
the temptation is dead staring you in the face,

573
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,800
你要尽一切可能避开他
you do anything you can to avoid him.

574
00:31:50,473 --> 00:31:52,172
门铃不错 费德曼
Nice doorbell, Feldman.

575
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:04,552
等一下 为什么我们要在这里拍摄
OK, wait a minute. Why are we doing it here

576
00:32:04,554 --> 00:32:06,120
而不是在我的家里拍摄？
and not at my house with the rest of the footage?

577
00:32:06,122 --> 00:32:08,122
因为我不想把摄像机从电视上拔下来
Because I don't want to unplug the camera from the TV

578
00:32:08,124 --> 00:32:10,557
我不想拔下任何东西 我不想错过一切
and I don't want to unplug anything, I can't lose,

579
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,927
我不想离开 上次我们在你的电脑上操作的时候
I don't want to go away. The last time we did it on your computer,

580
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:15,997
带子就在我相机里头 现在拿出来了
we had the tapes in my camera, now it's in this,

581
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:17,765
你就让我好好干活吧
just let me do my thing right now, OK?

582
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:19,534
我把时间码写下来了
I got the time codes written down.

583
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:21,005
好吧 你在作什么？
OK, but what are you doing?

584
00:32:23,973 --> 00:32:25,576
我得让你看一看
I just gotta show you.

585
00:32:29,712 --> 00:32:32,680
我得说这对我来说是一种享受
I gotta say this is a real treat for me.

586
00:32:32,682 --> 00:32:36,183
你不知道你的出镜对我的影片来说
You don't have any idea how much you validate

587
00:32:36,185 --> 00:32:38,786
是多么有说服力 真的很有
what I'm working on right now, which is really great.

588
00:32:38,788 --> 00:32:40,787
把它戴起来
Just feed this up through your chain.

589
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:43,790
告诉我你在这部纪录片中扮演的角色
So tell me about your role in the documentary.

590
00:32:43,792 --> 00:32:45,860
哦 就是跑龙套的
Oh, it was, it was minimal.

591
00:32:45,862 --> 00:32:50,632
那两个人来了 他们和我取得了联系
The two people came, they got in touch with me, they came around

592
00:32:50,634 --> 00:32:55,737
我们在这里待了一个小时左右 然后他们 然后他们就离开了
and, yeah, we were here for an hour or so and then they, then they moved on.

593
00:32:55,739 --> 00:32:57,271
那是我最后一次见到他们 就一次
That was the last I saw them, just once.

594
00:32:57,273 --> 00:33:00,741
索菲亚 费德曼 他们是怎么和你联系上的？
Sophia, Feldman. How did they get in touch with you?

595
00:33:00,743 --> 00:33:06,213
电子邮件 还是电话？ 他们给你打电话了吗 还是他们是朋友的朋友什么的？
Email, was it phone, did they call you, did somebody, friend of a friend?

596
00:33:06,215 --> 00:33:08,650
我要告诉你真相 我不记得了
I'm gonna tell you the truth, I don't remember.

597
00:33:08,652 --> 00:33:10,084
那是十年前的事了
It was a decade ago.

598
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:13,220
当你和我联系时 我...
When you got in touch with me, I was...

599
00:33:13,222 --> 00:33:17,659
我查了我的电子邮件纪录 没有发现任何东西
I searched my email archives and didn't find anything there,

600
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:21,895
如果是电话联系的 你知道 我不存电话纪录
if it was the phone, then, you know, I don't keep phone records.

601
00:33:21,897 --> 00:33:25,600
那么 偷窥狂汤姆未被编写进《古怪的马里兰》 是什么原因吗？
So, is there a reason why Peeping Tom was excluded from Weird Maryland,

602
00:33:25,602 --> 00:33:30,037
很明显 伊尔切斯特隧道就在马里兰 有什么原因不写它吗？
obviously the Ilchester tunnel is in Maryland, any reason not to include it?

603
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:37,045
它只是不是什么大的故事 我个人觉得这件事
It just wasn't as strong a story, I had that kind of a vibe about it that felt more like

604
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:39,814
更像是灵异事件 而不是民间传说
what we call fakelore rather than folklore.

605
00:33:39,816 --> 00:33:42,784
- 好吧  - 我有很多故事可讲
- OK. - I have a lot more stories

606
00:33:42,786 --> 00:33:44,084
比我能写下的要多
than I have pages to...

607
00:33:44,086 --> 00:33:45,788
那么我们来谈谈录像的事
Alright, let's talk about the footage.

608
00:33:46,323 --> 00:33:50,658
我没有参与 你知道 我只是看了几集
I wasn't a part of it, you know, I just watched it for a few...

609
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,693
当然 作为专家
Sure, but as an expert,

610
00:33:52,695 --> 00:33:58,165
如果你愿意的话 我们可以来做一次权威的学术演讲
let's get an authoritative kind of dissertation on that, if you will.

611
00:33:58,167 --> 00:34:04,072
在隧道的尽头那个 呃...
That thing at the end of the tunnel with the...

612
00:34:04,074 --> 00:34:07,208
- 偷窥狂汤姆 - 偷窥狂汤姆现身
- Peeping Tom. - Peeping Tom coming in,

613
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,844
确实是一个非常震撼的画面
it was a very striking image,

614
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:12,146
它是一个标志性的形象
it was iconic, it was an iconic image.

615
00:34:12,148 --> 00:34:15,853
很可怕 那之后的事情呢？
Pretty scary. What about what happened next?

616
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,291
接下来要拍摄吗？
Are you rolling on this, right?

617
00:34:23,293 --> 00:34:25,126
-  是的  - 好的
- Yeah. - Alright.

618
00:34:25,128 --> 00:34:26,961
你想给我看什么？
What are you trying to show me?

619
00:34:26,963 --> 00:34:28,695
- 请你就看 - 好的
- Just watch. - OK.

620
00:34:28,697 --> 00:34:30,097
那里 你看到了吗？
There, did you see it?

621
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:31,965
好的 不 我在找什么？
OK, no. What am I looking for?

622
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:33,369
- 我要倒回去 - 好的
- I'm gonna rewind. - OK.

623
00:34:34,771 --> 00:34:38,271
好吧 往左边的楼顶后面看
Alright. Look in the back on top of the building on the left.

624
00:34:38,273 --> 00:34:40,008
那里 那里
There, there!

625
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,242
就像一只巨大的鸟 对吧？
OK, so it's like a giant bird, right?

626
00:34:42,244 --> 00:34:45,045
不是 不是一只大鸟
No, it's not a giant bird.

627
00:34:45,047 --> 00:34:46,680
好吧 那是什么？
OK, what is it?

628
00:34:46,682 --> 00:34:48,018
你认为它是什么？
What do you think it is?

629
00:34:49,284 --> 00:34:51,251
当我去换电池的时候 我发现了
When I go to change the battery and I turn out and there!

630
00:34:51,253 --> 00:34:53,220
- 我到底要看什么？ 那里
- Where am I looking? - There!

631
00:34:53,222 --> 00:34:55,356
就在那儿 在风管旁边
Right there, next to the air duct.

632
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:56,758
等一下
Wait a minute.

633
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,159
记住那个地方
But remember the spot.

634
00:34:58,161 --> 00:34:59,726
我要继续了
I'm gonna go forward.

635
00:34:59,728 --> 00:35:01,929
我记得 我们把它关掉了
I remember, we turned it off and...

636
00:35:01,931 --> 00:35:04,766
好的 等一下 伙计
OK, wait a minute, dude...

637
00:35:04,768 --> 00:35:07,300
让我理一理
This is as far as I've got.

638
00:35:07,302 --> 00:35:09,269
好吧 来吧 给我看看其他的片段
OK, come on, show me the other footage.

639
00:35:09,271 --> 00:35:12,240
- 好吧 - 你让我有点兴奋
- Alright, well... - You got me a little excited.

640
00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:14,075
哦 我在开车 车在跑
Oh, I'm running, run, run.

641
00:35:14,077 --> 00:35:15,709
- 你看到了吗？ - 没有
- Did you see that? - No!

642
00:35:15,711 --> 00:35:16,878
好的 等等 等等
OK, OK, wait, wait!

643
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,713
放 放 好了
Play, play, alright.

644
00:35:18,715 --> 00:35:20,815
准备好 准备好 就在那里
Get ready, ready, right there!

645
00:35:20,817 --> 00:35:22,282
- 哦 该死 - 哦 该死
- Oh, shit! - Oh, shit!

646
00:35:22,284 --> 00:35:23,851
倒带 倒带
Rewind, rewind!

647
00:35:23,853 --> 00:35:25,722
准备好 别眨眼
Ready, don't blink!

648
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:29,057
- 这里 看到了吗？  - 对
- Here! There, see that? - That's right.

649
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:32,025
- 看到了吧 - 按下暂停
- Got it! - Press pause!

650
00:35:32,027 --> 00:35:33,695
- 暂停 - 找到了
- Pause. - Bingo!

651
00:35:33,697 --> 00:35:35,162
哦 就在这
Oh, right there.

652
00:35:35,164 --> 00:35:37,398
哦 天哪 伙计 这就是他妈的眨眼人
Oh, my gosh, dude, it's fucking Blinkman!

653
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,900
问题是眨眼的人不是我们
Yeah, the thing is we're not the ones blinking,

654
00:35:39,902 --> 00:35:41,802
是摄像机在眨眼
it's the camera that's blinking,

655
00:35:41,804 --> 00:35:43,704
所以每次我切换新镜头的时候 他都在那里
so every time I'm making a new clip, he's there.

656
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:46,976
是的  等一下
Yeah, wait a minute!

657
00:35:47,976 --> 00:35:52,447
每次我们打开或者关闭相机 相机都会“眨一次眼"
Every single time we turn the camera on and off and it blinks,

658
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:55,786
他越来越近了
he's almost, he's getting closer.

659
00:35:57,753 --> 00:36:01,255
我不知道我参与了这样一部电影
Well, I had no idea I was being involved with a film

660
00:36:01,257 --> 00:36:04,492
有点吓人 结构很好
of that kind, it was kind of scary, it was well constructed.

661
00:36:04,494 --> 00:36:08,829
我们刚才看到的...你的观点是这个录像是假的
So that was, so what we just watched, your opinion is that it's fake.

662
00:36:08,831 --> 00:36:12,800
不存在偷窥狂汤姆 他们在隧道里什么也没发现是吧
That there's no Peeping Tom, there's no, they didn't find anything in that tunnel.

663
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:14,101
- 是啊  - 就没了？
- Yeah. - This is all?

664
00:36:14,103 --> 00:36:16,838
- 看起来 - 不够古怪是吗？
- It looked like... - All non-weird.

665
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,373
- 这是... - 所以没有被写进你的书里
- It's... - It didn't make your book.

666
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:21,309
我只是想弄明白
What I'm just trying to figure out is...

667
00:36:21,311 --> 00:36:23,945
这两个人 这是两个人
Two human beings, alright, these are two people,

668
00:36:23,947 --> 00:36:25,682
你是他们唯一的联络人
you are the only link

669
00:36:27,384 --> 00:36:30,952
证明他们的存在 我打电话给你 向你解释你有多重要
to them even existing and I called you, I explained to you how important you were.

670
00:36:30,954 --> 00:36:35,789
但在我看来 你并没有像我想的那么认真
It just seems to me that you're not taking it as seriously as I thought you would.

671
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:37,224
作为一个受人尊敬的作家 你的做法一点都不严谨
As an esteemed author would.

672
00:36:37,226 --> 00:36:38,959
你不以为然
You're kind of brushing it off a little bit,

673
00:36:38,961 --> 00:36:40,494
你住在这么远的地方
you live all the way out here,

674
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:43,231
远离任何人能找到你的地方
far away from anybody to be able to track you down.

675
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:46,099
在他们拜访你并与你探讨过这件事之后
You don't have emails conveniently right after,

676
00:36:46,101 --> 00:36:49,336
你就再也不怎么回复邮件了 说什么“记不得了”
right after they came and talked to you. "I don't remember who it was.

677
00:36:49,338 --> 00:36:52,240
或者什么 经常换电话运营商
I had a phone line that've been bouncing my service back and forth."

678
00:36:52,242 --> 00:36:54,976
谁会这么做？ 没有人来回换运营商的
Who does that? Nobody bounces their service back and forth.

679
00:36:54,978 --> 00:36:56,878
先生 在我看来这里有什么阴谋
It just sounds to me like a lot of conjecture, sir.

680
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,983
你不会和他们的失踪有关系吧？
You wouldn't be involved in their disappearance, well then?

681
00:37:01,117 --> 00:37:04,351
- 太荒谬了 - 这就荒谬了吗？
- That's ridiculous! - Is it so ridiculous?

682
00:37:04,353 --> 00:37:09,389
因为它是 它是 我不知道 那是部纪录片
Because it's, it's... I don't know, that was a documentary!

683
00:37:09,391 --> 00:37:10,458
那是一部纪录片
It was a documentary.

684
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,858
你想说这个点子很愚蠢吗？
Were you gonna say stupid?

685
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,528
不 我没有说它愚蠢
No, I'm not gonna say stupid!

686
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,396
我能在你书里找到真真傻逼的内容
I can find stuff that's pretty stupid.

687
00:37:15,398 --> 00:37:17,164
我知道你的书享誉盛名
I mean, I know it's all that year, but...

688
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:18,532
这里面写的也确实不错
But it's well put together.

689
00:37:18,534 --> 00:37:20,034
我们能不拍了吗？
Look, can we cut this please?

690
00:37:20,036 --> 00:37:21,869
我不录了 不录了 对不起
I'm done, I'm done! Sorry!

691
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:23,804
- 你能离开吗？ - 不
- Would you like to leave, please? - No!

692
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:27,041
米勒的城堡 我只是不明白你为什么不...
Miller's castle, I just don't understand why you're not...

693
00:37:27,043 --> 00:37:29,577
我只是想让你们回答这些人是否存在
I just want you to answer whether or not these people

694
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:33,481
我可以离开这里 我可以证明这一切
exist or not. I can get out of here, I can validate this whole thing.

695
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:35,416
- 我不拍了 不拍了 - 对我来说
- I'm done, I'm done! - Just seem awfully enough

696
00:37:35,418 --> 00:37:37,820
- 只是太奇怪了  - 请把这个关掉
- weird to me! - Turn this thing off, please!

697
00:37:38,554 --> 00:37:40,188
所以我只不过是要找到他
So all he ought to fucking do...

698
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,289
回答两个该死的问题
was to answer two goddamn questions.

699
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:46,427
一 他知道索菲亚和费德曼是谁吗？
"Did he know who Sophie and Feldman were?" And:

700
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:50,063
二 他们是来拍假恐怖片的
"Were they coming to make a fake horror movie

701
00:37:50,065 --> 00:37:54,601
还是来拍真正的纪实电影的
or were they're legitimate documentarian filmmakers,

702
00:37:54,603 --> 00:37:57,875
去证实或者反驳一些...
looking to prove or disprove...?"

703
00:37:59,275 --> 00:38:00,778
妈的
Fuck!

704
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,931
嗨  小伙子 你好吗？
Hi buddy, how are you doing?

705
00:38:23,365 --> 00:38:26,068
你想给你爸爸一个拥抱吗？ 我很想你哦
You want to give your dad a hug? I missed you!

706
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:30,340
你呆在屋里 看到下雨了吗？
Did you stay inside, did you see the rain?

707
00:38:31,907 --> 00:38:33,608
能给我一个拥抱吗？
Can I get a hug, please?

708
00:38:42,385 --> 00:38:44,054
结果如何？
How did it go?

709
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:47,090
事情进行得不顺利 这是肯定的
It didn't go well, that's for sure.

710
00:38:49,092 --> 00:38:50,394
你为什么用我的电脑？
Why're you using my computer?

711
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,362
为什么是你的电脑？
Why is it your computer?

712
00:38:54,264 --> 00:38:56,329
我所有的工作内容都在上面
It's got all my work on it!

713
00:38:56,331 --> 00:38:59,599
我开始用这部电脑做财务
I've started the computer to do our finances.

714
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:01,003
好吧
OK!

715
00:39:02,237 --> 00:39:05,842
- 好的  - 聊聊？
- Alright! - Talk?

716
00:39:07,076 --> 00:39:09,146
我们现在就在聊啊
We're talking right now.

717
00:39:13,148 --> 00:39:18,151
你知道这些家伙会一直跟拍的 梅尔 那些八卦新闻就是这么出来的
You know these guys are following me around, Mel, sometimes the story comes out.

718
00:39:18,153 --> 00:39:22,059
我们进去 走吧 我们谈谈
Let's go in here. Come on, we'll talk. Come on!

719
00:39:23,492 --> 00:39:24,994
我们又收到了一封信
We had another letter.

720
00:39:27,963 --> 00:39:29,866
- 银行来的 - 好吧
- From the bank. - OK.

721
00:39:32,135 --> 00:39:34,635
- 关于我们的房子 - 好吧
- About our house. - Well, just take

722
00:39:34,637 --> 00:39:37,137
- 那就取点存款吧  - 我们没有存款
- the money out of savings. - We don't have savings!

723
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:40,206
那我们在感恩节讨论的预算呢？
What about the budget that we talked about on Thanksgiving?

724
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:42,409
然后就来了你电影的事
Yeah, and then your movie happened.

725
00:39:42,411 --> 00:39:46,646
我的电影 听着 这一切最终都是值得的
My movie. Listen, it's all gonna be worth it in the end,

726
00:39:46,648 --> 00:39:51,217
只要这一成功 就不用再干婚礼拍摄工作了
as soon as this hits, no more wedding jobs!

727
00:39:51,219 --> 00:39:53,621
这是必须要付出的代价
This is it, this is what it takes, OK?

728
00:39:53,623 --> 00:39:56,190
总会有一段艰难的时期 不是吗？
There's always gonna be a tough time, alright?

729
00:39:56,192 --> 00:40:01,028
想象一下 等我们赚到大钱了就可以悠闲地享受生活 看着儿子长大
Isn't it gonna be great if we can sit back and we can say, "Carter, what happened?"

730
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,965
卡特现在就需要钱来买新鞋子
Carter! Carter needs shoes.

731
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:07,300
这些人现在在这里 我不想再继续说下去了
These guys in here right now, I don't want to get into this anymore.

732
00:40:07,302 --> 00:40:10,137
- 好吗？ 我们说完了 -我们说完了
- Alright? We're done! - Yeah! We're done.

733
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:11,909
说完了
Done!

734
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:18,179
好吧 相机是一个测试项
OK, so the camera was a test subject

735
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:20,213
它整整一个小时都盯着看没有眨眼
and stared without blinking for the entire hour,

736
00:40:20,215 --> 00:40:22,983
根据传说 现在镜头能够看到偷窥狂汤姆
then according to the legend now sees Peeping Tom

737
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:25,186
每次相机眨眼 他就会离得更近
and every time it blinks, he gets closer.

738
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:27,054
换句话说 每次我们把它关掉
So, in other words, every time we turn it off

739
00:40:27,056 --> 00:40:29,055
然后打开 或者做一个新的剪辑
and then on, or make a new clip.

740
00:40:29,057 --> 00:40:32,325
没错 这是我们的结论 他现在在我们的相机里
Yeah. There's our thesis, he's in our camera.

741
00:40:32,327 --> 00:40:35,595
我的相机 是的 你知道 一开始他出现在隧道里
My camera, and yeah, you know, first he's there in the tunnel,

742
00:40:35,597 --> 00:40:37,597
当我们遇到我们的导师时他又在那里
and he was there again when we met our adviser,

743
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,566
当我们去看通俗作家时他又在那里
and again when we went to see the author,

744
00:40:39,568 --> 00:40:42,536
每一次 他都越来越近
and in each case, he got incrementally closer.

745
00:40:42,538 --> 00:40:48,242
但他仍然躲在视频小角落里 他在玩弄我们 因为这样没人会相信我们
But he's still hiding in the frame, he's making this a game, because no one will believe us,

746
00:40:48,244 --> 00:40:50,213
所以我们必须把他引出来
so we have to draw him out in the open.

747
00:40:52,248 --> 00:40:54,418
为什么我觉得你不像我这么兴奋？
Why I feel you're not as excited about this as I am?

748
00:40:55,717 --> 00:40:59,086
费德曼 假设这一切是真的
Feldman, assuming this all really happening...

749
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:00,621
已经发生了
It's really happening!

750
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:03,224
你知道这代表什么吗？
Do you realize what this means?

751
00:41:03,226 --> 00:41:06,096
这意味着我们现在在拍他
Yeah, it means we're filming him right now.

752
00:41:12,235 --> 00:41:13,800
好的 关了 关了
OK, hey, turn it off, turn it off.

753
00:41:13,802 --> 00:41:15,503
你怎么了？
Oh, what's your problem?

754
00:41:15,505 --> 00:41:17,505
我没怎么 我还是你的导演
My problem is that I'm still directing this

755
00:41:17,507 --> 00:41:19,440
直到我们弄清楚我们要做什么
and I don't want this camera on until we figure out

756
00:41:19,442 --> 00:41:21,474
我不想让摄像机开着 好吗？ 快关了
what we're gonna do, OK? Turn it off!

757
00:41:21,476 --> 00:41:26,079
好了 摄像机 那是什么？ 你听到了吗？
OK, so the camera's... what was that? Did you hear it?

758
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:27,148
是的
Yeah.

759
00:41:28,717 --> 00:41:31,418
听起来像是每段视频的开头都有
It sounds like it's at the beginning of each new clip.

760
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,519
这是一个数码
It's a digital...

761
00:41:32,521 --> 00:41:34,354
跟相机有关 伙计
Something to do with the camera, man,

762
00:41:34,356 --> 00:41:36,057
可能是相机出问题了
I mean it might be a messed up camera...

763
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:37,590
相机的问题
Something to do with the camera.

764
00:41:37,592 --> 00:41:39,559
好吧 费德曼 让我来说话 好吗？
Alright, Feldman, just let me do the talking, OK?

765
00:41:39,561 --> 00:41:42,563
隧道事件之后的每个片段都有
It's on every clip after the bridge

766
00:41:42,565 --> 00:41:45,699
所以我们要剪辑的有很多片段
section, so that's gonna be a lot of us going through every piece.

767
00:41:45,701 --> 00:41:48,202
等一下 隧道之后的每一段都有？
Wait a second, every one after the bridge?

768
00:41:48,204 --> 00:41:50,537
所以 偷窥狂汤姆一出现
So, as soon as Peeping Tom shows up,

769
00:41:50,539 --> 00:41:53,240
这个声音就同时出现 你是这个意思吗？
this sound shows up at the same time, is what you're saying.

770
00:41:57,146 --> 00:41:59,313
这有点疯狂 但是
This is a little crazy, but it,

771
00:41:59,315 --> 00:42:04,584
有点像莫斯电码
it kind of, kind of looks like Morse code.

772
00:42:04,586 --> 00:42:06,753
773为什么它只是在偷窥狂汤姆之后才出现？
Like, why would it only show up after the Peeping Tom?

773
00:42:06,755 --> 00:42:09,155
我不知道 是你把它记录下来的
I don't know, you're the one that's got it documented.

774
00:42:09,157 --> 00:42:11,157
我现在在问你的意见啊
I'm just asking you, as a better person.

775
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:13,427
- 纪录片摄制组而已... - 你认为
- Documentary crew... - What do you think

776
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:15,496
作为一个人你是怎么想的？为什么会这样呢？
as a human being? Why would that show up like...

777
00:42:15,498 --> 00:42:17,764
我不知道 这是你想让我们看到的
I don't know, it's something that you want us to see.

778
00:42:17,766 --> 00:42:20,800
我确实认为 不是你的错 也许不是你把它放进去的
I do think, it's not you, man, maybe it's not even that you put it in there,

779
00:42:20,802 --> 00:42:24,804
也许是这些人在拍这段录像的时候做的
maybe it's that these guys did when they shot this footage.

780
00:42:24,806 --> 00:42:26,609
不过 这有点太扯了
This is a little crazy, though.

781
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,411
他妈的 闭嘴
What the fuck, shut the fuck up!

782
00:42:30,413 --> 00:42:33,514
什么？
What?

783
00:42:33,516 --> 00:42:37,450
翻译出来是什么意思？说出来 大声说出来
What does it translate to? Say it out, say it out loud, please!

784
00:42:37,452 --> 00:42:39,854
- 它说：眨眼“  - 好吧 你们能帮我个忙吗？
- It says Blink. - Alright, can you guys do me

785
00:42:39,856 --> 00:42:41,655
你能看着相机吗？
a favor? Can you look at the camera?

786
00:42:41,657 --> 00:42:43,590
你做的很好
I believe that you've done a good job of...

787
00:42:43,592 --> 00:42:46,226
你能看着相机吗？我需要你鉴定一下
Can you look at the camera? I need you to authenticate this.

788
00:42:46,228 --> 00:42:48,295
- 我需要你的帮助 - 鉴定一下？
- I need your help. - Authenticate it?

789
00:42:48,297 --> 00:42:50,664
盯着镜头说
Just stare in the camera and

790
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:53,467
你刚刚找到了什么？
say what you just found for them.

791
00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:57,137
我觉得它完全是伪造的
I think it's completely faked.

792
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,608
不管是谁拍的
Whoever shot the footage,

793
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,876
这些人应该已经不在了
these people that supposedly aren't around anymore,

794
00:43:02,878 --> 00:43:05,479
他们显然故意把这个声音放进去了
they clearly put this sound in there.

795
00:43:05,481 --> 00:43:09,383
好吧 也许是他们干的 不管是谁
OK, so maybe they did it, to so whoever...

796
00:43:09,385 --> 00:43:12,452
然后那人把带子给了我 不管是谁找到了视频
So if the guy gives the tape... whoever finds the footage

797
00:43:12,454 --> 00:43:14,621
然后发现了这个莫尔斯电码
and then uncovers this Morse code

798
00:43:14,623 --> 00:43:17,724
或者这个每次都会出现的特定声音
or this specific sound that happens every time.

799
00:43:17,726 --> 00:43:20,327
这需要做很多工作 他们必须拍摄视频
That's a lot of work, they would have had to shot the footage,

800
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:22,695
卸载 编辑 然后把它放回DV磁带上
offload it, edit it and put it back on DV tapes.

801
00:43:22,697 --> 00:43:24,498
是的 好吧
Yeah, OK, well...

802
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,867
- 然后 然后 - 他也可以那样做
- And then, and then... - He could have done that too.

803
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:30,170
我们不知道 伙计 我们不知道这些磁带之前在哪里经历了什么
We don't know, man, we don't know where these tapes were before they came here.

804
00:43:30,172 --> 00:43:31,771
他来到这里 给我们讲了一个故事
He's coming here and he tells us a story,

805
00:43:31,773 --> 00:43:33,807
我们要么相信 要么不相信
then we either believe or we don't believe.

806
00:43:37,713 --> 00:43:39,682
眨眼测试 第一次
Blink test, take one.

807
00:43:44,853 --> 00:43:46,489
眨眼测试 第二次
Blink test, take two.

808
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:50,293
眨眼测试 第三次
Blink test, take three.

809
00:43:52,527 --> 00:43:54,795
眨眼测试 第三次
Blink test, take seven.

810
00:43:54,797 --> 00:43:56,829
眨眼测试 第十三次
Blink test, take 13.

811
00:43:56,831 --> 00:43:57,932
眨眼测试 第十九次
Blink test, take 19.

812
00:43:57,934 --> 00:43:59,465
眨眼测试 第二十五次
Blink test, take 25.

813
00:43:59,467 --> 00:44:01,467
眨眼测试 第三十二次
Blink test, take 32.

814
00:44:01,469 --> 00:44:03,139
眨眼测试 第四十次
Blink test, take 40.

815
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:10,411
我不相信这个视频是真的
I do not believe that this video is authentic.

816
00:44:10,413 --> 00:44:14,315
有一件事对我来说很可疑 那就是它总是出现又消失
One thing that's really suspicious to me is that it always appears

817
00:44:14,317 --> 00:44:18,755
要么在屏幕之外或者在某个东西后面
and disappears, like either off-screen or behind something.

818
00:44:20,822 --> 00:44:22,923
汽车经过的那个镜头
The one where the car goes past

819
00:44:22,925 --> 00:44:26,226
这只是另一种常见的把戏
like that's just like another really common trick

820
00:44:26,228 --> 00:44:29,563
这是常见的骗人视频里面的鬼把戏
to use to make a ghost disappear if you're hoaxing a video.

821
00:44:29,565 --> 00:44:31,632
关于眨眼测试
I guess here's two points about the blink test

822
00:44:31,634 --> 00:44:32,999
有两点看起来很可疑
that seemed very suspicious.

823
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:34,668
一个是
One is that

824
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,436
费德曼在每次他打开镜头的时候
Feldman steps in front of the camera

825
00:44:36,438 --> 00:44:38,238
都站在了镜头前面
every time he turned it on.

826
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,940
录像按钮在相机的背面
The record button's on the back of the camera

827
00:44:39,942 --> 00:44:41,941
这似乎是最方便的一种方式
and it just seems like a convenient way

828
00:44:41,943 --> 00:44:43,844
来呈现那个人的轮廓
to reveal the figure.

829
00:44:43,846 --> 00:44:45,311
他们好像
Like they...

830
00:44:45,313 --> 00:44:46,780
我知道制作成黑白风格
I know making it black and white

831
00:44:46,782 --> 00:44:49,316
是电影专业学生的风格选择
is a film student's stylistic choice,

832
00:44:49,318 --> 00:44:51,719
它确实能让特效加工的痕迹
but it certainly makes it easier

833
00:44:51,721 --> 00:44:55,224
变得不那么明显
to hide effects and hide manipulation.

834
00:44:56,592 --> 00:44:58,958
- 我们谈谈元数据 - 好的
- Let's talk about metadata. - OK.

835
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,863
好吧 元数据 有显示事件进展的时间戳
Alright, the metadata. There are timestamps that show the progression of events.

836
00:45:03,865 --> 00:45:05,499
这也是可以造假的
You can fake that.

837
00:45:05,501 --> 00:45:07,735
你现在是在指责我捏造了这一切
You're accusing me of faking this whole thing.

838
00:45:07,737 --> 00:45:10,838
听着 我不认识你 我不会那么说
Look, I don't know you, I'm not gonna say that...

839
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,606
不 但是你还是会收我的钱 你会的
No, but you'll take my money, you'll take my money, though.

840
00:45:13,608 --> 00:45:16,744
你花钱是为了听我的意见 我现在就在给你分享我的意见啊
For my opinion, which I'm giving you.

841
00:45:16,746 --> 00:45:21,882
但我们有幽灵组 不算太糟
But we got the ghost group which isn't too bad,

842
00:45:21,884 --> 00:45:25,351
看来他们是你最后的救命稻草了
It seems like they were sort of your last resort.

843
00:45:26,755 --> 00:45:27,887
他们是
They were,

844
00:45:27,889 --> 00:45:29,623
但是他们有很大的影响力
but they have a lot of reach

845
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:31,427
如果他们相信那些灵异球体
and if they believe in orbs...

846
00:45:32,628 --> 00:45:37,498
这事儿可比球体什么的更轰动 更真实、
I mean, this is certainly a lot bigger, more real than orbs.

847
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,932
各位 这就是我的今天
And there you have it, folks,

848
00:45:39,934 --> 00:45:45,371
为你们准备的片段
the footage, the found footage I've assembled for you today.

849
00:45:45,373 --> 00:45:48,775
在你们的帮助下 我们可以一起解开这个谜
With your help, we can figure out the mystery, together,

850
00:45:48,777 --> 00:45:51,780
因此你们在这个过程中
and that's why it's very, very crucial

851
00:45:53,715 --> 00:45:56,316
紧跟我的步伐至关重要
you know, that you follow me on this quest.

852
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:57,653
有问题吗？
Any questions?

853
00:46:03,492 --> 00:46:06,360
没有问题 我能指望你们的支持吗？请说 女士
No questions! Can I count on your support? Yes, ma'am.

854
00:46:06,362 --> 00:46:09,095
你不知道他们有没有请人伪造
You don't know that they didn't have somebody to do this,

855
00:46:09,097 --> 00:46:11,999
你不知道这些是不是真的 你不知道他们在做什么
you don't know if any of this is real, you don't know what they do...

856
00:46:12,001 --> 00:46:14,601
你说的对 女士 这就是我们今晚来这里的原因
You're right, ma'am, and that's why we're here this evening,

857
00:46:14,603 --> 00:46:16,070
因为如果我知道这是真的
because if I knew if it was real,

858
00:46:16,072 --> 00:46:17,503
那我就不需要你们了 伙计们
then I wouldn't need you, folks.

859
00:46:17,505 --> 00:46:18,671
如果他在隧道的尽头
If he's at the end of the tunnel

860
00:46:18,673 --> 00:46:20,340
而那些是铁路枕木
and those are railroad ties,

861
00:46:20,342 --> 00:46:21,809
他必须有六英尺宽
he'd have to be about six feet wide.

862
00:46:21,811 --> 00:46:22,943
六英尺宽
Six feet wide.

863
00:46:22,945 --> 00:46:24,744
视频里没有人
There's nobody in that video

864
00:46:24,746 --> 00:46:27,014
你可以找到并交谈的吗？
that you could find in public records to speak with?

865
00:46:27,016 --> 00:46:28,882
我确实找到了马特·莱克
I did find this Matt Lake,

866
00:46:28,884 --> 00:46:31,584
他是《古怪的马里兰》的作者
he's an author of a book called Weird Maryland,

867
00:46:31,586 --> 00:46:34,088
如果你想的话可以去找他 但我不建议
which you can pick up if you want to, I mean I don't recommend it.

868
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:37,557
我很难相信像我这样在你们面前做展示的人
I find it very hard to believe that people who come up in front of your group

869
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:39,392
竟会受到这样的盘问
constantly get grilled like this,

870
00:46:39,394 --> 00:46:42,528
我还以为你们都很相信这类事情呢
it seems to me that everybody be in, everybody be into it.

871
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:44,097
我想说的是 这足以让我们
I'd say this would be enough to warrant

872
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:47,400
对这个实验进行调差和再创造
an investigation and a recreation of the experiment.

873
00:46:47,402 --> 00:46:53,706
超自然群体需要的不仅仅是视觉证据
Paranormal groups need more than just a piece of visual evidence

874
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:56,976
从方法论上来说
to be able to methodologically

875
00:46:56,978 --> 00:46:59,112
去量化和限定一个事件
quantify and qualify an event.

876
00:46:59,114 --> 00:47:00,914
我们需要音频 我们需要...
We would need audio, we would need...

877
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:04,751
先生 先生 抛开那些花言巧语 我明白你的意思
Sir, sir, all the fancy words aside, I get what you're saying.

878
00:47:04,753 --> 00:47:07,588
我要你做的就是 要么相信 要么不相信
All I'm asking you to do, is either believe it or you don't

879
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:09,155
要么去调查 要么不去
and you want to go investigate it or you don't.

880
00:47:09,157 --> 00:47:11,691
我想知道你都吃些什么药？
I'd like to know what kind of medications that you take?

881
00:47:11,693 --> 00:47:13,760
我 女士 我认为这太粗鲁了
I, ma'am, I think that that's extremely rude

882
00:47:13,762 --> 00:47:16,028
我不认为这和那有任何关系
and I don't think that has any bearing on that.

883
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:19,499
我想问你在服用什么药物来问这些问题？
I'd like to ask you what medications you're on to ask such questions?

884
00:47:19,501 --> 00:47:21,534
要是你拍一部关于血腥玛丽的电影时
When you get a film on Bloody Mary,

885
00:47:21,536 --> 00:47:23,704
也许我们会考虑一下
maybe we'll think about it,

886
00:47:23,706 --> 00:47:26,606
但这是无稽之谈 我们不想和它扯上任何关系
but this is a crock and we want nothing to do with it.

887
00:47:26,608 --> 00:47:31,612
你所说的是追踪一个鬼魂 而我们并不打算加入你
And that's inspired ghost tracking. Now, we're not going out to investigate with you.

888
00:47:31,614 --> 00:47:36,416
我很确定你所谓的这个鬼魂追踪...
I'm pretty sure that inspired ghost tracking...

889
00:47:36,418 --> 00:47:39,153
这不会是你们最后一次听说我
This is not gonna be the last time that you hear about me.

890
00:47:39,155 --> 00:47:40,457
这是出口门吗？
Is this the exit door?

891
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:45,191
没有球 但谢谢你们 我很感激
No orbs out there, but thank you very much, I appreciate it.

892
00:47:45,193 --> 00:47:51,999
我相信你们以后会收到我的消息的
I'm sure that you'll be hearing from me in the future and yeah...

893
00:48:03,045 --> 00:48:04,547
请把相机关掉
Turn off the camera, please!

894
00:48:06,648 --> 00:48:08,751
我现在不想拍了
I don't want to deal with it right now.

895
00:48:10,085 --> 00:48:12,186
他就在那儿
And there he fucking is.

896
00:48:12,188 --> 00:48:14,787
现在 我们的问题是 每当我们移动相机的时候
Now, our problem is that any time that we moved the camera,

897
00:48:14,789 --> 00:48:17,691
不管我们是在移动相机 还是在车里或走路的时候
whether we were just moving the camera or we were in a car or walking,

898
00:48:17,693 --> 00:48:19,659
他都能在屏幕上跳来跳去 所以
he was able to flip in and out of the screen, so,

899
00:48:19,661 --> 00:48:21,061
我们无法追踪他
we couldn't keep track of him,

900
00:48:21,063 --> 00:48:23,063
但是如果我把相机留在它原来的位置
but if I leave the camera where it is,

901
00:48:23,065 --> 00:48:25,666
他就被困住了 我把它弄到我想要他呆的地方了
then he's stuck and I got it where I fucking want him!

902
00:48:25,668 --> 00:48:28,771
现在 我们真正需要的是 我们需要得到结果
Now, what we really need to get right now, is we need to get the ending.

903
00:48:29,905 --> 00:48:32,639
现在 对我来说 最符合逻辑的事情是
Now, the most logical thing for me to think of is, you know,

904
00:48:32,641 --> 00:48:34,744
我要用这个特写镜头来揭示惊天大秘密
it's the closeups as a grand reveal.

905
00:48:36,644 --> 00:48:38,648
你为什么用便携式摄像机拍我？
Why are you filming me with the Handycam?

906
00:48:43,652 --> 00:48:45,621
你怕我的相机
You're afraid of my camera.

907
00:48:46,554 --> 00:48:49,690
大导演 这一开始是你的主意
Well, that figures, I mean directors, you always had this vision and you think

908
00:48:49,692 --> 00:48:53,463
你也考虑过要如何去做,但是你对镜头记录下的一切,一点都拿不准
what you want to do with it, but behind the camera, you have no fucking idea!

909
00:48:54,262 --> 00:48:57,766
他走得越来越近 他不能再靠近了
He keeps on getting closer and that's where he needs to stay.

910
00:49:00,702 --> 00:49:03,806
他在我的相机上
He's on my camera!

911
00:49:09,945 --> 00:49:11,481
哦 该死
Oh, shit!

912
00:49:12,114 --> 00:49:13,715
哦 该死
Oh, shit!

913
00:49:16,552 --> 00:49:17,987
嘿  看
Hey, well, look...

914
00:49:19,855 --> 00:49:23,525
你拿着这些日记干什么？
What are you up to with all these journals here?

915
00:49:26,961 --> 00:49:27,996
等一下
Wait a minute.

916
00:49:31,867 --> 00:49:35,004
这是某种
That's some kind of

917
00:49:46,114 --> 00:49:50,552
好的 鬼眨眼 视频日记什么的 随便吧
OK, Butterfly Kisses, video diary, whatever, right.

918
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,887
我并不想指责费德曼做了什么
So, I don't really want to accuse Feldman of doing anything

919
00:49:54,889 --> 00:49:57,090
我也没有说他在撒谎 好吗？
and I'm not even saying that he's lying, OK?

920
00:49:57,092 --> 00:49:58,891
我真的很尊敬他
I really do respect him.

921
00:49:58,893 --> 00:50:01,628
但是在看了他的日记之后
But after reading his diary a little while ago,

922
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:04,231
他有所有的图表
and him having the diagrams of everything,

923
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:06,967
我只是想把这些记录下来留给子孙后代
I just want to record this for posterity and just

924
00:50:06,969 --> 00:50:12,673
确保每个人都知道我对整个事件有疑问 好吗？
make sure that everyone knows that I have my doubts about this entire project, OK?

925
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:14,941
现在 我对一切都心存疑虑
Right now, I have doubts about everything.

926
00:50:14,943 --> 00:50:17,043
老实说 还有比这更糟的吗？
Honestly, what could be worse?

927
00:50:17,045 --> 00:50:19,612
知道偷窥狂汤姆随时会来抓我
Knowing that Peeping Tom could come and get me at any moment

928
00:50:19,614 --> 00:50:22,182
或者只是因为这整件事被大家嘲笑
or just being humiliated by the entire thing,

929
00:50:22,184 --> 00:50:25,351
费德曼以后可以在学生电影节上展示这个
knowing that Feldman can show this at the student film festival

930
00:50:25,353 --> 00:50:27,920
而我什么都不是
and I look like a fucking ass!

931
00:50:27,922 --> 00:50:31,023
我只能听天由命了 希望那家伙不是在跟我开玩笑
I'm just gonna have to roll with it and hope the fella isn't fucking with me,

932
00:50:31,025 --> 00:50:33,360
因为我是真的开始相信了
like I'm really, really starting to believe.

933
00:50:44,172 --> 00:50:48,775
首先 你给了我录像
First off, you gave us the footage and we wanted to see

934
00:50:48,777 --> 00:50:50,679
我们想看看你删掉的东西
all of those things that you cut out.

935
00:50:52,614 --> 00:50:55,951
你能告诉我们《死去朋友的肖像》是什么吗？
Can you please tell us, can you tell us what Portraits of Dead Friends was?

936
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:03,956
我们最终赢得了学生电影节 最佳故事片奖
We actually ended up winning our student film festival, Best Feature Award for it.

937
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:07,693
两位电影制作人 索菲亚和费德曼拍摄过
The same two filmmakers, Sophia and Feldman, made a movie

938
00:51:07,695 --> 00:51:10,229
另一部叫《死去朋友的肖像》
called Portraits of Dead Friends in which they wanted to make

939
00:51:10,231 --> 00:51:12,099
他们想要制作一部关于已逝之人的电影
a film about people who were deceased,

940
00:51:12,101 --> 00:51:14,233
但是他们不想做些平凡的东西
but they didn't want to do the usual kind of, you know:

941
00:51:14,235 --> 00:51:17,371
"他是一个很棒的人 他出生在这样那样的地方"
"He was a wonderful person and he was born in such and such place."

942
00:51:17,373 --> 00:51:23,079
所以 他们转而去看那个人的讣告旁边的照片
So instead, they went to the photograph that appeared with the person's obituary.

943
00:51:24,179 --> 00:51:27,213
那和偷窥狂汤姆无关
Well, A. That has nothing to do with Peeping Tom.

944
00:51:27,215 --> 00:51:29,715
这和偷窥狂汤姆有关
It has everything to do with Peeping Tom!

945
00:51:29,717 --> 00:51:32,251
别谈这个话题 天哪
I didn't want you to bring that on, oh my gosh!

946
00:51:32,253 --> 00:51:34,253
我很高兴你笑了
I'm glad you laughed at it.

947
00:51:34,255 --> 00:51:36,956
- 我是说 我不擅长这个  - 你看起来还行
- I mean, I'm not good about it. - You seem pretty OK with it.

948
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:39,959
好吧 听着 那个姑娘的妹妹不想谈论她
Ok, look, the girl's sister didn't want to talk about her.

949
00:51:39,961 --> 00:51:45,932
这是一个非常好的故事 我们也找到了一个非常棒的演员 这很重要
It was a really good story, so we got a freaking actor in there, big deal.

950
00:51:45,934 --> 00:51:47,767
作为纪录片制片人
As documentary filmmakers,

951
00:51:47,769 --> 00:51:49,769
他们愿意让一个演员扮演一个人
they were willing to have an actor

952
00:51:49,771 --> 00:51:51,737
并因此获奖
play a person and accept award for it.

953
00:51:51,739 --> 00:51:53,139
当然
Sure.

954
00:51:53,141 --> 00:51:55,177
你认为《肖像》足够了吗？
Do you think Portraits was enough...

955
00:51:56,811 --> 00:52:00,046
- 不加入那个故事的元素？ - 你什么意思
- without that story? - What do you mean "Do you think

956
00:52:00,048 --> 00:52:01,847
你觉得画肖像就够了吗 是什么意思？
Portraits was enough without that story"?

957
00:52:01,849 --> 00:52:03,883
我们有五个故事 你在说什么故事？
There's five stories, what story?

958
00:52:03,885 --> 00:52:05,755
你知道我在说什么
You know what story I'm talking about.

959
00:52:07,056 --> 00:52:08,191
黛安娜的吗？
Diana's?

960
00:52:10,693 --> 00:52:14,293
就是我们...
The one that we, you know...

961
00:52:14,295 --> 00:52:17,764
我捉摸不透费德曼这个人 他有一点小情绪
I'm not sure about Feldman, he's got a bit of an attitude,

962
00:52:17,766 --> 00:52:21,068
因为他想当导演 他想当老大
because he wants to be the director, he wants to be the top dog.

963
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:24,804
也许他有一些怨恨的情绪
Maybe there was some resentment going on there.

964
00:52:24,806 --> 00:52:28,307
我找到了一段费德曼
I found a clip where Feldman

965
00:52:28,309 --> 00:52:33,246
说他没有获奖的片段 说全都是索菲亚一人的荣誉
is saying that he did not win an award, that it was just Sophia.

966
00:52:33,248 --> 00:52:36,816
你拿你的奖状做了什么？
What did you do with your award?

967
00:52:36,818 --> 00:52:38,318
我没有得到奖
I didn't get one.

968
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,320
等等 你什么意思 你没有得到？
Wait, what do you mean, you didn't get one?

969
00:52:41,322 --> 00:52:48,161
我是说 沃尔夫博士给你了 而且上面只有你的名字
I mean, Dr. Wolfe only gave it to you, and it only has your name on it!

970
00:52:48,163 --> 00:52:50,130
你是当真的吗？
Are you serious?

971
00:52:50,132 --> 00:52:54,800
费德曼有轻微的心理不平衡
Feldman turns out to have his own mildly unscrupulous streak,

972
00:52:54,802 --> 00:52:56,970
因为他开始建议
because he starts to suggest,

973
00:52:56,972 --> 00:52:59,472
我们可以做一些事情
there are things we could do

974
00:52:59,474 --> 00:53:02,811
如果我们得不到温控希望得到的形象
if we don't get the image that we're hoping to get.

975
00:53:04,947 --> 00:53:07,046
我们可以做一些事情
There's other things.

976
00:53:07,048 --> 00:53:09,851
比如加特效之类的？
Like what, like visual effects, kind of thing?

977
00:53:12,755 --> 00:53:14,454
就像这样
Something like that.

978
00:53:14,456 --> 00:53:18,258
所以我们至少有三种可能
So we have then at least three possibilities here.

979
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,994
有可能整件事都是真的
We have the possibility that this whole thing is real,

980
00:53:20,996 --> 00:53:22,963
他们拍到了偷窥狂汤姆的画面
that they caught the image of Peeping Tom.

981
00:53:22,965 --> 00:53:25,865
我们有可能他们两个聚在一起
We have the possibility of two of them got together,

982
00:53:25,867 --> 00:53:30,836
把这个看似可信的恶作剧拍成作品
to put together this largely plausible hoax

983
00:53:30,838 --> 00:53:35,141
也有可能他们两个其中一人恶搞了另一个人的作品
and we have the possibility that one of them put together a hoax on the other one.

984
00:53:35,143 --> 00:53:37,779
至少这三种可能性
At least those three possibilities.

985
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,780
我得说
I need to say...

986
00:53:40,782 --> 00:53:46,385
我最开始对他的印象是 他像一个在幕后默默无闻的人
I guess my initial prejudice was the slacker who was kind of quiet in the background,

987
00:53:46,387 --> 00:53:50,856
而且我认为他就是个未知因素 后来才发现原来他才是一切的主谋
was the X-factor, yeah, he was the instigator of the fiction

988
00:53:50,858 --> 00:53:53,159
鬼眨眼 视频日记一
Butterfly Kisses, video diary one.

989
00:53:53,161 --> 00:54:00,867
回想起来 我觉得索菲亚似乎更像是越界了
On reflection, it seems much more to me as though Sophia, she maybe crossed the line.

990
00:54:00,869 --> 00:54:05,371
你知道 当你在一个故事上投入了大量时间 而最后期限即将到来时
You know, when you've invested a lot of time in a story and the deadline's coming up,

991
00:54:05,373 --> 00:54:08,974
诱惑就来了 我怎样才能让这个故事变得警察呢？
the temptation is, yeah, how do I make this a good story?

992
00:54:08,976 --> 00:54:14,817
不幸的是 我不能证明偷窥狂汤姆只是一个演员和一顶帽子而已
Unfortunately I can't prove that Peeping Tom wasn't anything more than just an actor and a hat.

993
00:54:15,416 --> 00:54:19,020
这很糟糕 因为我不知道接下来要做什么
Which is kind of sucks, because I don't know what I'm gonna do from here.

994
00:54:21,123 --> 00:54:23,155
我想 我需要一个新的角度
I guess, I'm just gonna need a new angle.

995
00:54:23,157 --> 00:54:25,992
从那以后的一切
And then, everything from that that point onwards

996
00:54:25,994 --> 00:54:30,032
都是二人协作的产物
was a collaboration in this fiction.

997
00:54:34,068 --> 00:54:35,804
这与那个故事无关
It wasn't relevant to the story.

998
00:54:37,739 --> 00:54:39,807
那他们站在老伊斯特隧道的场景呢
What about the scene where they're standing in the old Ilchester Tunnel,

999
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:43,913
费德曼说 如果老实拍摄达不到目的的话
and Feldman is saying if this doesn't work with the camera looking through the tunnel,

1000
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,581
我们可以做一个特效
we could do a special effect.

1001
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:51,952
我认为他们只是绝望而已
I mean that's, I think that's desperate times and spitballing,

1002
00:54:51,954 --> 00:54:54,019
你知道 这只是说说而已 都是信口开河
you know, it's just talk, it's all loose talk.

1003
00:54:54,021 --> 00:54:56,055
当一个人想要 你知道
When someone wants, you know,

1004
00:54:56,057 --> 00:54:57,590
仅仅是说出他们的真相
just to speak their truth and to bring it out

1005
00:54:57,592 --> 00:55:00,193
并把它展示给其他人
to other people and to kind of have that position

1006
00:55:00,195 --> 00:55:03,429
一次来获得某种领导地位 名声和其他一切
of leadership and fame and everything else,

1007
00:55:03,431 --> 00:55:08,068
他们会专门选择一些特定的事情来支持自己的行为
they will cherry-pick certain things that support what they're doing.

1008
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:11,637
大脑并不是有意识地去挑选或无视某些真相
Your brain is not consciously cherry-picking,

1009
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:13,974
这更多是一种无意识的事情
it is more of an unconscious thing.

1010
00:55:13,976 --> 00:55:16,876
对于某人来说
So, it's very easy for someone,

1011
00:55:16,878 --> 00:55:19,079
当他们开始形成
as they're starting to get in

1012
00:55:19,081 --> 00:55:25,017
一种强迫性的行为或一种错觉
to, you know, kind of an obsessive behavior or a delusion is starting to be created

1013
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:30,090
他们此时如果看待所谓的证据以及那些重要信息
where the look at a piece of evidence and the things that highlight for them,

1014
00:55:30,092 --> 00:55:34,360
他们就会无意识地放大 而对于那些不重要的信息
they zoom and sink into the brain immediately and then the things that don't,

1015
00:55:34,362 --> 00:55:36,963
大脑会自动地把它们遗忘
the brain automatically kind of just

1016
00:55:36,965 --> 00:55:39,398
把他们遗忘 就像它们根本不存在一样
sections them off like they don't even exist.

1017
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:45,007
加文·约克决定把这些材料展现出来
Gavin York's decision to take that material out

1018
00:55:46,173 --> 00:55:50,010
这个行为表明他
suggests a manipulative,

1019
00:55:50,012 --> 00:55:53,280
有很强的操纵欲
a very strong manipulative intent on his part.

1020
00:55:53,282 --> 00:55:56,282
如果你手头上有这些素材
If you're working with all these elements, you can,

1021
00:55:56,284 --> 00:55:58,550
从新闻的角度来说 你可以构造
journalistically speaking, you can construct the...

1022
00:55:58,552 --> 00:56:03,289
你可以用任何你选择的素材来讲述这个故事
You run the story out of whatever footage you choose to put in there.

1023
00:56:03,291 --> 00:56:05,525
如果他把这些场景删除
If he took these scenes out,

1024
00:56:05,527 --> 00:56:10,329
他肯定有一个特别的理由
then he had a particular reason for doing it.

1025
00:56:10,331 --> 00:56:13,400
至于为什么他允许你将片段放回去
Why he's allowing you to put them back in

1026
00:56:13,402 --> 00:56:17,170
或者说利用它们 这背后的原因很有趣
or to utilize them in some way, It's interesting.

1027
00:56:17,172 --> 00:56:19,204
我是说 有 有 能再重复一遍吗？
I mean, there's, there's... Pardon?

1028
00:56:19,206 --> 00:56:22,075
- 他签署了一份声明 - 是的
- He signed a release. - Yeah.

1029
00:56:22,077 --> 00:56:23,575
他授权他人使用
He authorized the use of the footage

1030
00:56:23,577 --> 00:56:24,614
这部纪录片中的镜头
in this documentary.

1031
00:56:25,847 --> 00:56:27,280
有人说也许是
There, there are people who suggested that

1032
00:56:27,282 --> 00:56:30,083
也许加文自己也拍了这些东西
perhaps Gavin shot this himself.

1033
00:56:30,085 --> 00:56:31,717
你觉得那是
Do you feel that's...

1034
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:34,554
我认为那不是真的
I don't think that's true.

1035
00:56:34,556 --> 00:56:38,458
他什么时候会这么做呢？
Simply because, when would he have done it?

1036
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:42,162
我妈妈在地下室找到了磁带
I mean, my mom found the tapes in the basement, so...

1037
00:56:42,164 --> 00:56:45,401
你为什么有松下DVX100
Why do you own a Panasonic DVX100?

1038
00:56:48,436 --> 00:56:54,441
- 费德曼就是用这台相机拍的纪录片 - 好吧
- That's the camera that Feldman filmed the documentary on. - OK.

1039
00:56:54,443 --> 00:56:57,077
他们说他经常去旅行
They say he goes away on a lot of trips.

1040
00:56:57,079 --> 00:56:59,448
是的 他去婚礼举办地
Yeah, he goes where the weddings are.

1041
00:57:00,648 --> 00:57:02,918
钱是否全部匹配？
Does the money all match up?

1042
00:57:03,585 --> 00:57:05,121
基本上是
Usually!

1043
00:57:11,025 --> 00:57:12,527
停
Stop!

1044
00:57:17,699 --> 00:57:19,268
我要磁带
I want the tapes!

1045
00:57:35,317 --> 00:57:37,516
你的脸怎么了？
What happened to your face?

1046
00:57:37,518 --> 00:57:41,022
- 很痒 - 你有事吗？
- It itched. - Are you on something?

1047
00:57:42,356 --> 00:57:47,059
不  睫毛会勾到痒痒的地方
No, I thought the lashes would tick over the itch.

1048
00:57:47,061 --> 00:57:48,998
还有相机
And the camera,

1049
00:57:50,231 --> 00:57:52,298
我把它锁在地下室了
I locked it in the basement.

1050
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,236
我把电池扔了
I threw away the battery!

1051
00:57:55,237 --> 00:57:57,369
当我从睡梦中醒来 它又回来了
And when I woke up from sleeping, it was back.

1052
00:57:57,371 --> 00:58:02,175
它在拍我 他在拍我
It was taping me, he was taping me.

1053
00:58:02,177 --> 00:58:05,612
你以为是我按下了这个快门键吗？
Do you think it was me that pressed record for this?

1054
00:58:05,614 --> 00:58:11,684
不 他知道你要来 所以我才知道你要来
No, he knew you were coming, that's how I knew you were coming.

1055
00:58:11,686 --> 00:58:16,222
我要在他达到目的之前让这一切结束
I'm gonna get the ending that he aimed for before he does,

1056
00:58:16,224 --> 00:58:19,291
这一切都取决于你 磁带给你了
but then it's all on you, you got the tapes.

1057
00:58:19,293 --> 00:58:24,130
但我会把所有的镜头都拍下来 你要照你说的完成这部电影
But I'm gonna get all the footage, you finish this movie like you said you would!

1058
00:58:24,132 --> 00:58:25,467
还记得吗？
Remember?

1059
00:58:26,367 --> 00:58:28,371
那之后他就会去找你了
And then he's coming after you.

1060
00:58:29,737 --> 00:58:30,836
你是下一个
You're next.

1061
00:58:34,141 --> 00:58:36,144
但你会赢得另一个奖项
But you'll win another award!

1062
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:50,356

并且能够对其进行评论
and be able to make their own assessment of it.

1073
00:59:25,693 --> 00:59:27,594
我们要把它公之于众 所以
We're gonna get it out on the world, so...

1074
00:59:27,596 --> 00:59:29,896
24小时后会发生什么？
What's gonna happen after the 24 hours?

1075
00:59:29,898 --> 00:59:34,266
网站会被关闭 你再也看不到它了
The website's gonna be shut down, you're not gonna be able to see it anymore.

1076
00:59:34,268 --> 00:59:35,668
那你预计会发生什么？
What do you expect to happen then?

1077
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:39,304
从那以后电话会一直响个不停
The phone does never stop ringing after that.

1078
00:59:39,306 --> 00:59:40,874
所以你会把它卖给出价更高的人？
So you'll sell it to the highest bidder?

1079
00:59:40,876 --> 00:59:46,278
或者一个 你知道的 适度的 一个 是的
Or one, just, you know, moderate. One, so yeah, yeah.

1080
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,713
我不是要装模作样
I'm not trying to be a jerk,

1081
00:59:47,715 --> 00:59:49,749
我只是想知道怎样和蒂尔曼小姐说上话
I just want to find out how I can speak with

1082
00:59:49,751 --> 00:59:52,651
告诉她一些关于我周五
Miss Tillman and give her some information about

1083
00:59:52,653 --> 00:59:56,523
要参加的当地社区活动的消息
a local community event that I've got going on on Friday.

1084
00:59:58,492 --> 00:59:59,561
喂
Hello...

1085
01:00:03,697 --> 01:00:06,365

有多少家报纸
How many, how many newspapers in...

1087
01:00:08,869 --> 01:00:10,105
所有的
All of them.

1088
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:12,905
- 所有的？ - 所有的
- Already all? - All of them.

1089
01:00:12,907 --> 01:00:14,374
你还没明白吗？
And you see how it is?

1090
01:00:14,376 --> 01:00:15,742
你亲耳听到的
You heard it for yourself,

1091
01:00:15,744 --> 01:00:18,478
他们才不在乎呢 挂断 挂断
they don't give a shit! Hang up, hang up!

1092
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,382
我是说 除非你
I mean, unless you...

1093
01:00:21,782 --> 01:00:23,583
你认识什么人吗？
Do you know somebody?

1094
01:00:23,585 --> 01:00:25,653
你知道 我们不能介入
You know, we can't get involved.

1095
01:00:26,621 --> 01:00:28,521
我们必须待在相机的这一边
We have to stay on this side of the camera.

1096
01:00:28,523 --> 01:00:30,889
随你便 爱站在镜头的那边就站吧  伙计
Stay on that side of the camera if you want to, man.

1097
01:00:30,891 --> 01:00:36,662
我不知道你们为什么要坐在这里拍我 不参与进来
I mean, I don't know why you guys want to sit here and film me, and not get involved,

1098
01:00:36,664 --> 01:00:39,798
因为你们也是在浪费时间
because you're just wasting your time too.

1099
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:43,570
这部电影没有任何结局
There's no ending to this movie whatsoever.

1100
01:00:43,572 --> 01:00:45,537
你的电影有很棒的结局
You get an awesome ending for your movie,

1101
01:00:45,539 --> 01:00:47,639
我的电影也有很棒的结局
I get an awesome ending for my movie.

1102
01:00:47,641 --> 01:00:51,813
没人说谎 没人说假话 对吧？
Nobody's lying, nobody's saying anything fake, alright?

1103
01:00:52,813 --> 01:00:57,418
我只需要一个电话号码和一个名字
All I'm asking for is one telephone number and a name.

1104
01:00:58,652 --> 01:01:02,889
我们可以去找那个人 我们可以吧整个故事讲出来
And that we can go, and we can speak to that person and we can put this whole story out there.

1105
01:01:02,891 --> 01:01:04,360
我不认为
I don't think...

1106
01:01:06,293 --> 01:01:07,529
这是作弊
it's cheating

1107
01:01:08,563 --> 01:01:10,633
为了巨大的回报在所难免
if it's for the great reward.

1108
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,999
这里是华盛顿101 我是迈克·琼斯
It's DC 101, I'm Mike Jones and

1109
01:01:14,001 --> 01:01:15,767
在我们的演播室里
in studio today I've been talking about

1110
01:01:15,769 --> 01:01:18,371
关于《鬼眨眼》片段的话题已经进行了一周了
this found footage all week, Butterfly Kisses.

1111
01:01:18,373 --> 01:01:20,673
加文·约克 发现了这段录像的人
Gavin York, the guy that discovered this footage,

1112
01:01:20,675 --> 01:01:22,708
你们可以自己去看 如果你们还没有看的话
and you could see it for yourself, if you haven't yet,

1113
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:25,577
直到今晚午夜 在butterflykissesmovie.com上可以看到

我很好 谢谢
I'm doing great, thanks for...

1116
01:01:28,449 --> 01:01:29,849
我只是不明白
I just don't understand the deal

1117
01:01:29,851 --> 01:01:31,583
这家伙怎么了 伙计
with this guy, man,

1118
01:01:31,585 --> 01:01:34,519
你为什么要拍他 这对你有什么好处？
why are you filming him, what's in it for you with this?

1119
01:01:34,521 --> 01:01:36,588
这应该是
It's supposed to be

1120
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:40,260
一个非常棒的角色研究 事实证明确实如此
a really fantastic, fascinated character study. And then it is!

1121
01:01:40,262 --> 01:01:41,927
没有人愿意来
Nobody wants to come to...

1122
01:01:41,929 --> 01:01:44,463
因为之前已经做过很多次了
Because this has been done a thousand times before.

1123
01:01:44,465 --> 01:01:45,831
我们认为这是一个骗局
And we think it's a scam.

1124
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:47,833
不只是我 大家都是
I'm not the only one, it's everyone!

1125
01:01:47,835 --> 01:01:49,869
我知道 但这是我现在面临的问题
I know, but that's the problem that I've got right now,

1126
01:01:49,871 --> 01:01:51,903
我已经拍了好几个小时的录像
I've got hours and hours of footage that we've shot,

1127
01:01:51,905 --> 01:01:54,039
但是我们没有给这部纪录片一个结局
but we don't have an ending to this documentary.

1128
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,782
你给了我这个机会
And you give me this opportunity to...

1129
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:05,485
- 这是...   - 这太棒了
- This is the... - This is amazing!

1130
01:02:08,556 --> 01:02:10,555
没关系 我支持你
It's alright, I got your back.

1131
01:02:10,557 --> 01:02:15,360
- 只是不要...  - 好的
- Just don't... - Alright.

1132
01:02:15,362 --> 01:02:19,298
好的 我们看看人们怎么说 这是华盛顿101号 请8669 1号观众
Alright, well, we'll see what the people have to say, it's 8669 1 DC 101.

1133
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:20,800
嗨 DC101
Hi, DC 101!

1134
01:02:20,802 --> 01:02:22,802
你真的认为有人
Yeah, you actually think there's

1135
01:02:22,804 --> 01:02:25,641
会傻到相信这个鬼东西吗？
anyone stupid enough to fall for that?

1136
01:02:26,775 --> 01:02:30,342
视频质量糟透了 都是假的
The video quality sucks, it's all fake.

1137
01:02:30,344 --> 01:02:32,445
加文 你有什么要说的吗？
Gavin, do you have anything to say?

1138
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:36,349
这是2004年要解决的事了
Well, I mean, this would be something in 2004 to address with them!

1139
01:02:36,351 --> 01:02:39,751
不 伙计 可是现在不是2004年啊 你现在才做这些蠢事
No man, you totally didn't do this in 2004, you did this just now.

1140
01:02:39,753 --> 01:02:42,789
2004年我什么都没做没错 我现在才将影片汇集好
I didn't do anything in 2004, I just assembled it now.

1141
01:02:42,791 --> 01:02:44,523
我不想从任何事情中获利
I'm not trying to profit off anything.

1142
01:02:44,525 --> 01:02:46,059
你找过他们吗？
Have you looked for them?

1143
01:02:46,061 --> 01:02:47,459
把它带到警察局去...
Take it to the police...

1144
01:02:48,996 --> 01:02:50,862
你只要检查一下 那是假的
...just check it out, that's bogus.

1145
01:02:50,864 --> 01:02:53,333
加文 怀疑论无处不在
Gavin, skepticism is just everywhere.

1146
01:02:53,335 --> 01:02:56,034
- 是的 网络上有很多仇恨言论 - 一点点 一点点
- Yes, a lot of hatred out there. - A little bit, a little bit.

1147
01:02:56,036 --> 01:02:58,670
别浪费时间了 去探索一下你真正可能擅长的事情吧
Hang it up and find something else that you might be good at.

1148
01:02:58,672 --> 01:03:02,075
改变自己 因为你这是想从别人的死亡中获利
Change yourself, because you're trying to profit off of somebody's death.

1149
01:03:02,077 --> 01:03:05,043
你该不是真的认为人们会相信吧
You think that people are gonna fall for this.

1150
01:03:05,045 --> 01:03:07,045
这是个骗局
Showing a hoax it's...

1151
01:03:07,047 --> 01:03:09,749
我看那些垃圾的每一分每一秒都...
The second I spent watching that piece of...

1152
01:03:09,751 --> 01:03:11,483
你看起来像个瘾君子
You seem like a stoner...

1153
01:03:11,485 --> 01:03:12,952
无论哪个项目...
...whichever project...

1154
01:03:12,954 --> 01:03:14,954
这是错的 诅咒
...wrong about this, cursed...

1155
01:03:14,956 --> 01:03:16,389
不是真的
...not real.

1156
01:03:20,961 --> 01:03:22,795
你好 我DC101 你是谁？
Hello, DC 101, who's this?

1157
01:03:22,797 --> 01:03:23,829
史丹利
Stanley.

1158
01:03:23,831 --> 01:03:25,565
史丹利 你要对加文说什么？
Stan, what you gotta say to Gavin?

1159
01:03:30,704 --> 01:03:32,003
好吧 我告诉你
Alright, I'll tell you what.

1160
01:03:32,005 --> 01:03:33,405
我给他五分钟的时间
I'll give him five minutes

1161
01:03:33,407 --> 01:03:34,574
我想我找到一个人了
and I think I've got a guy,

1162
01:03:34,576 --> 01:03:36,441
我们可以让我的制作人打电话
we can get my producer to call.

1163
01:03:36,443 --> 01:03:38,543
会好起来的 看看会发生什么
It'll be good. See what happens.

1164
01:03:38,545 --> 01:03:40,612
对他有好处还是？
Good for him or?

1165
01:03:40,614 --> 01:03:43,051
这对我们都有好处
It'll be good for us.

1166
01:03:44,418 --> 01:03:47,787
加文 听着 我知道人们一直在喷你
Gavin, listen, I know people have been blasting you.

1167
01:03:47,789 --> 01:03:49,121
我想...
I want to...

1168
01:03:49,123 --> 01:03:51,557
这是我们一直在等的电话.
This is the call that we've been waiting for,

1169
01:03:51,559 --> 01:03:53,693
让我把他接过来
let me bring him on here.

1170
01:03:53,695 --> 01:03:55,961
- 你好 来电者 - 你好
- Hello, caller! - Yes.

1171
01:03:55,963 --> 01:03:57,729
嗨 让我给你介绍一下
Hi, let me introduce you.

1172
01:03:57,731 --> 01:04:01,501
加文 这是埃德·桑切斯 旧片重制的王牌制作人
Gavin, this is Ed Sanchez, the king of the found footage,

1173
01:04:01,503 --> 01:04:03,568
女巫布莱尔项目的导演
the director of the Blair Witch Project

1174
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:06,505
他打电话来谈论你的电影 鬼眨眼
who is calling to talk about your movie Butterfly Kisses!

1175
01:04:06,507 --> 01:04:07,907
艾德 你好吗 兄弟？
Ed, how you doing, brother?

1176
01:04:07,909 --> 01:04:09,608
我很好 伙计 最近怎么样？
I'm doing well, man how's it going?

1177
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:11,744
- 很好  - 下午好 我是你的大粉丝
- Good. - Good afternoon! Big, big fan!

1178
01:04:11,746 --> 01:04:13,612
我看过录像
I've seen the footage.

1179
01:04:13,614 --> 01:04:18,016
在我看来它并不完全是真的
You know, it doesn't look completely genuine to me.

1180
01:04:18,018 --> 01:04:22,155
我认为这其中涉及到一些表演 一些效果
You know, I think there's some acting involved, there's some effects involved,

1181
01:04:22,157 --> 01:04:25,657
我认为有点令人不安的是
and I think that it's kind of disturbing that he feels that

1182
01:04:25,659 --> 01:04:29,494
他觉得推广这段视频的唯一方法就是假装它是真实的
the only way to market this footage is to pretend it's real.

1183
01:04:29,496 --> 01:04:33,800
我只是不得不说出来 你知道吗？
So, you know, I just kind of had to speak out about it, you know?

1184
01:04:33,802 --> 01:04:35,802
我理解加文的想法 但是 你知道
I understand where Gavin's coming from,

1185
01:04:35,804 --> 01:04:38,204
他想要 你知道 他在努力
but, you know, he's trying to, you know,

1186
01:04:38,206 --> 01:04:40,807
进入这个行业 他想拍这部电影
get in the business, he's trying to make this film,

1187
01:04:40,809 --> 01:04:43,175
以前也有过这种事情 这是
but it's just been done before, it's a...

1188
01:04:43,177 --> 01:04:46,045
你这样做事为了在好莱坞开始你的职业生涯？
Did you do this to start your career in Hollywood?

1189
01:04:46,047 --> 01:04:48,815
这是你踢开那扇门的方式吗？
Is this your way of maybe kicking that door open?

1190
01:04:48,817 --> 01:04:51,918
我从12岁左右就开始拍电影了
I've been a filmmaker since I was about 12 years old.

1191
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,786
对 这就是为什么每个人都说
Right, that's why everyone's saying

1192
01:04:53,788 --> 01:04:57,990
这不是真正的电影
that this is not footage that is legitimate,

1193
01:04:57,992 --> 01:04:59,791
这是你在电脑上做出来的
that you created this on your computer.

1194
01:04:59,793 --> 01:05:01,193
我完全理解这一点
I completely understand that.

1195
01:05:01,195 --> 01:05:02,461
你拍过真正的电影
And you've made this your film.

1196
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,862
你是个专业人士
You're a professional.

1197
01:05:03,864 --> 01:05:05,664
我想问你 你能只用几个项目
Could you have made this on a computer at home

1198
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:06,798
就在家里的电脑上做出来这东西吗？
with just a few projects?

1199
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,467
至少对我来说 作为一名电影制作人
At least for me, as a filmmaker,

1200
01:05:08,469 --> 01:05:09,901
你可以看出有些东西
you can tell that there's some stuff

1201
01:05:09,903 --> 01:05:13,072
显然是被刻意加进去的
that is obviously, you know, manipulated.

1202
01:05:13,074 --> 01:05:14,941
有一些瞬间
There's like these moments of...

1203
01:05:14,943 --> 01:05:18,010
恰好在摄像机开着的时候 捕捉到一些场景
Where just the camera happens to be on, to capture a moment.

1204
01:05:18,012 --> 01:05:20,979
所有的旧片重制都是这么开始的
That's like a big thing of found footage is like.

1205
01:05:20,981 --> 01:05:25,016
当一些疯狂的事情发生的时候 摄像机正好开着
The camera happens to be on while something crazy's happening,

1206
01:05:25,018 --> 01:05:28,220
你知道 你只是在生活中没有那种运气
you know, you just don't have that kind of luck in life, you know.

1207
01:05:28,222 --> 01:05:31,958
这整个故事都是在一个鞋盒里找到的
The whole legend is that the footage is found in a shoebox

1208
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:36,561
有一些镜头专门拍摄了发现鞋盒的过程
and the footage carefully shows like oh, here's this shoebox

1209
01:05:36,563 --> 01:05:39,699
我们在这里找到的这个鞋盒 给摄像机看一下
that we found it in here, I'll show it in front of the camera,

1210
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:43,568
就像他们在刻意设置了鞋盒场景一样
which is like something that they're setting up the shoebox, you know.

1211
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:45,704
对我来说 这些都是
To me those are kind of, you know,

1212
01:05:45,706 --> 01:05:48,740
你正在戏剧性地摆设的迹象
signs that you're setting something up dramatically.

1213
01:05:48,742 --> 01:05:50,709
在电影里你会这样做
In a movie you do that, you know.

1214
01:05:50,711 --> 01:05:52,778
在我们的电影开始轰动之后
You know, after the initial buzz of our movie,

1215
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,579
我们从来没有假装那是真的
we never pretended that it was real.

1216
01:05:54,581 --> 01:05:56,949
我只是不相信他说的是真的
I just have a problem with him thinking that it's for real.

1217
01:05:56,951 --> 01:05:59,284
也许我觉得是他有问题
You know, maybe I think he has a problem.

1218
01:05:59,286 --> 01:06:02,854
艾德 如果这件事被发现
Ed, what are gonna be the consequences if this does come out

1219
01:06:02,856 --> 01:06:04,856
是加文编造的会有什么后果？
and it's found out that Gavin made this up?

1220
01:06:04,858 --> 01:06:06,791
你这样做实际上
You're just kind of really

1221
01:06:06,793 --> 01:06:08,793
是在破坏你的声誉
destroying your reputation with this,

1222
01:06:08,795 --> 01:06:10,595
因为最终会有人站出来
because eventually somebody's going to come out,

1223
01:06:10,597 --> 01:06:12,898
证明这不是真的
some proof is gonna come out that this is not real,

1224
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:17,103
你知道 人们会问你在想什么？
and, you know, people are gonna ask what were you thinking?

1225
01:06:17,105 --> 01:06:20,773
我现在想问的也是 他在想什么？
And I'm kind of asking that right now, what is he thinking?

1226
01:06:20,775 --> 01:06:23,775
坦白点说 你知道我的意思
You know, just fess up, you know what I mean or...

1227
01:06:23,777 --> 01:06:26,144
我尽量诚实的告诉你
I'm being about as honest as I can be about this.

1228
01:06:26,146 --> 01:06:28,079
好吧 随你怎么说
Alright, well, you say so.

1229
01:06:28,081 --> 01:06:31,751
感谢今天的嘉宾加文·约克 大家去看看他的网站吧

01:07:21,936 --> 01:07:22,971
嘿
Hey!

1234
01:07:29,043 --> 01:07:30,945
没关系的
It's alright!

1235
01:07:32,679 --> 01:07:34,148
她妈妈开了个账户
Her mom set up an account.

1236
01:07:35,182 --> 01:07:37,818
为卡特开的
For Carter and

1237
01:07:38,853 --> 01:07:41,088
他们都投入了资金
they were putting money into it.

1238
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:48,963
但我把所有的钱都花在了电影上
And I took all the money and I spent it on the movie.

1239
01:07:51,865 --> 01:07:53,701
她是怎么知道的？
How did she find out?

1240
01:07:57,771 --> 01:08:02,878
她想去取一笔钱
She wanted to go and take out a sum.

1241
01:08:19,961 --> 01:08:21,760
今天上午当局报告
Authorities report that the strange death

1242
01:08:21,762 --> 01:08:23,062
一名当地男子的离奇死亡
of a local man leaves more questions

1243
01:08:23,064 --> 01:08:24,763
给人民留下了不少疑惑
than answers this morning.

1244
01:08:24,765 --> 01:08:26,298
朋友们说 电影专业的学生
Friends say that Feldman,

1245
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,701
费德曼最近行为怪异
a film student, had been acting strangely.

1246
01:08:28,703 --> 01:08:30,902
是啊 他一直在拍这部电影
Yeah, he's been making this movie with this...

1247
01:08:34,442 --> 01:08:37,375
尸体躺在地上 摔得粉碎
The body was lying on floor, smashed to pieces.

1248
01:08:37,377 --> 01:08:40,979
费德曼的尸体是在厨房水槽下面的橱柜里找到的
Feldman's body had been found in the cabinet, under the kitchen sink.

1249
01:08:40,981 --> 01:08:44,450
这个生物来了
This creature is coming and...

1250
01:08:44,452 --> 01:08:47,852
目前 当局正在等待尸检报告
At this time, authorities await results of an autopsy.

1251
01:09:02,804 --> 01:09:06,839
希望我们今晚能和他拍一些镜头
Hopefully we have a record with him this evening and, you know,

1252
01:09:06,841 --> 01:09:10,776
弄清楚他去了哪里 如果他给我们打电话就最好 很明显
figure out where he's been, if he's giving us a call, obviously we're,

1253
01:09:10,778 --> 01:09:15,313
我们是来这里拍摄的 我们只是在为子孙后代
you know, we're showing up there to shoot, we're just filming this for posterity

1254
01:09:15,315 --> 01:09:17,184
- 拍摄这个的  - 是的
- at this point. - Yeah.

1255
01:09:18,219 --> 01:09:21,286
说实话 我不认为我们会在这方面花太多时间
I don't really think we're gonna use much about this, to be honest.

1256
01:09:21,288 --> 01:09:24,158
当然 我同意
Sure, I agree!

1257
01:09:36,938 --> 01:09:40,740
你要我继续讲下去 这样我们就
You want me to keep rolling on this so that we have...

1258
01:09:40,742 --> 01:09:42,340
随便做些什么吧
Just whatever you do.

1259
01:09:42,342 --> 01:09:44,375
我没剩多少电池了
I don't have a lot of battery left.

1260
01:09:44,377 --> 01:09:46,180
如果你是对的 好吧
If you're right about it. Alright!

1261
01:09:47,247 --> 01:09:49,083
加文

1262
01:09:51,786 --> 01:09:53,288
嘿 加文
Hey, Gavin!

1263
01:09:57,425 --> 01:09:59,027

Gavin!

1264
01:10:01,229 --> 01:10:03,329
我先不录了
I'm gonna stop recording for a second.

1265
01:10:03,331 --> 01:10:05,164
不 不 继续
No, no, just keep it rolling.

1266
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:07,031
不 我们在这里录什么？
No, what are we recording here?

1267
01:10:07,033 --> 01:10:09,168
这什么都不是 我不...
We're not doing anything, I don't...

1268
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:11,269
去跟他谈谈 伙计 这有点
Go talk to him or something, man, this is getting...

1269
01:10:11,271 --> 01:10:13,772
我甚至不知道该对他说什么
I don't even know what to say to him!

1270
01:10:13,774 --> 01:10:16,210
我不知道 艾瑞克 你是导演
I don't know, Erik, you're the director!

1271
01:10:21,548 --> 01:10:22,583
加文
Gavin!

1272
01:10:24,118 --> 01:10:26,755
听着 伙计 如果你不跟我们说话 我们帮不了你
Look, buddy, we can't help you if you don't talk to us.

1273
01:10:27,822 --> 01:10:29,522
这不是...
It's not...

1274
01:10:29,524 --> 01:10:31,960
不只是他在靠近你
Just when he gets closer to you...

1275
01:10:33,528 --> 01:10:35,197
更重要的是你在靠近他
It's when you get closer to him...

1276
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:40,366
等等 你在说什么？
Wait, what are you talking about?

1277
01:10:40,368 --> 01:10:42,204
鬼眨眼
Butterfly kisses!

1278
01:10:45,038 --> 01:10:48,139
我们得帮帮他 说真的
We need to help this guy, seriously.

1279
01:10:48,141 --> 01:10:52,279
我们打电话给他老婆
We call, we call his wife!

1280
01:10:53,314 --> 01:10:58,284
我们没有她的电话号码 她换了电话号码 我不知道她的新号码是多少
We don't have her number. She changed her number. I don't know what her new number is.

1281
01:10:58,286 --> 01:11:02,888
她的岳母呢？ 不知道她的名字
What about his, what about his mom-in-law? Whatever her name was.

1282
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:04,322
我没有她的电话号码
I never had her number.

1283
01:11:04,324 --> 01:11:05,523
它通过阿米莉亚
It worked through Amelia,

1284
01:11:05,525 --> 01:11:07,026
卖掉房子的
and the house is sold,

1285
01:11:07,028 --> 01:11:08,764
所以我不知道如何找到她
so I don't even know how to find her.

1286
01:11:10,163 --> 01:11:12,430
我不知道 我是说 我不是...
I don't know, I mean, I'm not...

1287
01:11:12,432 --> 01:11:15,267
我们应该拍一部关于他的电影
We're supposed to make it a movie about him,

1288
01:11:15,269 --> 01:11:19,905
我说不好这是不是我们的职责 但是我们毕竟不是他的家人
and I don't know how much, if this is our responsibility, we're not, not his family.

1289
01:11:19,907 --> 01:11:21,874
现在是我们的责任了...
It is our responsibility now, we've...

1290
01:11:21,876 --> 01:11:23,008
我们和他一起到今天这个地步的
We've taken him this far,

1291
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:24,309
我们在一些事情上
we've kind of screwed him over

1292
01:11:24,311 --> 01:11:25,611
耍了他
on a couple things!

1293
01:11:25,613 --> 01:11:27,045
我们没有骗过他 肯尼
We haven't screwed him over, Kenny!

1294
01:11:27,047 --> 01:11:28,446
但是DC101那件事是下了套的
But, DC 101 was total set up.

1295
01:11:28,448 --> 01:11:31,250
DC101 他同意了
DC 101 who's not a total set up, he agreed to it.

1296
01:11:31,252 --> 01:11:35,888
他不知道你要叫艾德·桑切斯给他打电话
He didn't know you were gonna have Ed Sanchez call him. Come on!

1297
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:38,324
我没有让他在直播中失败
I did not put him on the air to fail,

1298
01:11:38,326 --> 01:11:40,159
我们给了他选择
we gave him that option.

1299
01:11:40,161 --> 01:11:42,894
听着 这是互斥互利的 我们 我们...
Look, it was mutually exclusive, mutually beneficial. We, we...

1300
01:11:42,896 --> 01:11:47,066
我们需要一个电影的结尾 他需要一个公共论坛来发言
We needed an end to the movie, and he needed a public forum through which to speak.

1301
01:11:47,068 --> 01:11:49,000
我们同意的
We agreed on this.

1302
01:11:49,002 --> 01:11:50,902
这怎么 这怎么是我的错？
How is that, how is that my fault?

1303
01:11:50,904 --> 01:11:53,405
- 你们这些人都说 - 为了你的电影你毁了他的生活
- You guys, all said... - You ruin his life for your movie,

1304
01:11:53,407 --> 01:11:54,940
这么说如何？
how about that?

1305
01:11:54,942 --> 01:11:56,342
从什么时候开始我的电影
At what point did this become my movie

1306
01:11:56,344 --> 01:11:58,143
毁了别人的生活？
and this became I ruin somebody's life?

1307
01:11:58,145 --> 01:12:01,080
伙计 你逼得他继续的
Man, you just keep pushing him. You keep...

1308
01:12:01,082 --> 01:12:03,549
那为什么你们这些家伙
Why do you guys, why do you guys keep showing up

1309
01:12:03,551 --> 01:12:06,117
为什么你们一直带着装备出现在镜头前 为什么要一直参与其中呢？
with the gear and shooting, what we're doing then?

1310
01:12:06,119 --> 01:12:09,420
如果你道德感真有这么强
If you're so, if you have such moral issues with it,

1311
01:12:09,422 --> 01:12:11,223
你为什么他妈的在这里？
why are you fucking here?

1312
01:12:11,225 --> 01:12:13,358
- 那是谁？  - 什么？
- Who's that? - What?

1313
01:12:15,363 --> 01:12:17,228
有人跑过铁轨
Somebody's running across the tracks.

1314
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:19,264
- 来吧 伙计们 - 该死
- Come on, guys. - Shit!

1315
01:12:22,502 --> 01:12:25,169
相机在哪里？他拿了相机吗？
Where is the camera? Did he take the camera?

1316
01:12:32,979 --> 01:12:34,248
伙计们 慢点
Guys, slow down.

1317
01:12:39,587 --> 01:12:43,391
- 他真的去那儿吗？ -我才不进去
- Did he seriously go in there? - I'm not going in there.

1318
01:12:47,028 --> 01:12:49,661
伙计们 相机电池快没电了
Guys! The camera battery is getting low!

1319
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,696
我们必须在这里做出决定
We have to make a decision here.

1320
01:12:51,698 --> 01:12:53,197
加文
Gavin!

1321
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:54,967
埃里克 照相机快关机了
The camera is about to die, Erik!

1322
01:12:54,969 --> 01:12:56,238
我们在做什么？
What are we doing?

1323
01:12:57,971 --> 01:13:00,004
- 那是什么？ - 什么？
- What is that? - What?

1324
01:13:00,006 --> 01:13:02,309
- 那他妈的是谁？  - 加文
- Who the fuck is that? - Gavin!

1325
01:13:03,109 --> 01:13:05,544
- 你看见了吗？  - 就在那儿
- Did you see? - It's right there.

1326
01:13:05,546 --> 01:13:08,414
- 你看到什么了吗？ - 我什么都没看见
- Did you see anything? - I don't see anything!

1327
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:11,282
就在他妈的隧道的尽头 那他妈的是什么？
It's right in fucking the end of the tunnel! What the fuck is...?

1328
01:13:14,488 --> 01:13:16,958
费德曼死的那天晚上寄来的
Feldman sent this the night that he died.

1329
01:13:17,524 --> 01:13:21,593
如你所见 他详细说明了他所谓的最终计划
As you can see, he details out what he called the final plan.

1330
01:13:21,595 --> 01:13:25,164
最后 他只能眨三次眼了 所以他把相机对着镜子
At the end, he only had three blinks left, so he set the camera up

1331
01:13:25,166 --> 01:13:29,434
这样他就能看到两边的情况 身前身后都可以
into a mirror, so he covered both sides, the front and the back of himself.

1332
01:13:29,436 --> 01:13:32,039
他在镜子前蹲下来
He crouched down in front of the mirror

1333
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:36,508
准备好锤子 这样在他最后的一眨眼功夫
and had this hammer ready, so that on his final blink

1334
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:42,317
他就可以阻止 他可以阻止他找到他 他至少是这么认为的
he could stop, he could stop him from getting him, so he thought...

1335
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:47,686
费德曼死了之后 他的父母让我帮他收拾他的所有东西
Feldman's parents let me go over and go through everything when

1336
01:13:47,688 --> 01:13:52,624
因为毕竟最后是我们俩一起在弄这个项目
Feldman had passed, because we were working on the project together.

1337
01:13:52,626 --> 01:13:58,062
我拿到了摄像机里最后的带子
I was able to get this tape which was in the camera, up until the end.

1338
01:13:58,064 --> 01:14:01,467
正如所看到的那样 这个带子被打碎了 而且磁带还没有卷起来
As you can see, it's all cracked up and the tape was unspooled,

1339
01:14:01,469 --> 01:14:05,070
但我还是把它修好了
but I was actually able to put it back together.

1340
01:14:05,072 --> 01:14:07,074
花了几天时间
It took a few days,

1341
01:14:08,009 --> 01:14:09,607
但我做到了
but I did it.

1342
01:14:09,609 --> 01:14:12,510
唯一能播放的是最后一段
The only thing that would play, was the last clip,

1343
01:14:12,512 --> 01:14:15,350
没关系 因为费德曼很聪明
and that's OK, because Feldman was smart.

1344
01:14:16,117 --> 01:14:18,450
他还准备了这个
He also had this.

1345
01:14:50,384 --> 01:14:51,250
啊
Ah!

1346
01:15:28,756 --> 01:15:33,791
好的 安迪 鉴于摄像机已经开拍了
Alright, so Andy, for the benefit of the camera, can you please,

1347
01:15:33,793 --> 01:15:37,131
你能告诉我你在邮件里给我发了什么吗？
can you please tell me what you sent me in the email?

1348
01:15:37,765 --> 01:15:41,834
我发现的是
Well, what I found was,

1349
01:15:41,836 --> 01:15:47,238
你可以看到偷窥狂汤姆突然起身
if you look when Peeping Tom is jumping up,

1350
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:51,179
抓住了费德曼
like jumping up to grab Feldman...

1351
01:15:52,712 --> 01:15:57,085
如果你看他的眼睛 实际上他的眼睛里有一个图像
If you look in his eye, there's actually an image in his eye.

1352
01:15:58,185 --> 01:16:03,254
起初 我以为这是伊尔切斯特隧道的画面
At first, I thought it was the shot of the, like the Ilchester tunnel,

1353
01:16:03,256 --> 01:16:07,860
我以为这是他之前出现在镜头里的
like I thought it was like a frame grab from the video

1354
01:16:07,862 --> 01:16:10,595
画面的粘贴
where he appeared, but

1355
01:16:10,597 --> 01:16:12,263
但实际上不是的 正好相反
I actually think it's the other way around,

1356
01:16:12,265 --> 01:16:15,400
这其实是偷窥狂汤姆视角
like it's what Peeping Tom saw

1357
01:16:15,402 --> 01:16:16,802
当偷窥狂汤姆出现的时候
when Peeping Tom appeared

1358
01:16:16,804 --> 01:16:19,470
他往隧道另一头看去
so he's looking through the tunnel

1359
01:16:19,472 --> 01:16:23,342
你可以看到摄像机发出的光
and... you see the lights from that camera

1360
01:16:23,344 --> 01:16:27,448
再往外看就和火车桥一样
and beyond that is like the train bridge.

1361
01:16:28,215 --> 01:16:32,483
好的 这是他的视角
OK, so this, this is his POV

1362
01:16:32,485 --> 01:16:36,554
看到了克兰和费德曼在夜间拍摄他...
of Crane and Feldman filming him the night...

1363
01:16:36,556 --> 01:16:40,094
这是偷窥狂汤姆的视角 没错
It's Peeping Tom's point of view, yeah.

1364
01:16:43,697 --> 01:16:45,632
哇 啊...
Wow, ah...

1365
01:16:46,432 --> 01:16:48,933
这是它原本的声音
So this is what it sounds like by itself.

1366
01:16:50,703 --> 01:16:53,237
你不一定能看出
You wouldn't necessarily be able to tell

1367
01:16:53,239 --> 01:16:54,473
这是莫斯电码
that that's Morse code,

1368
01:16:54,475 --> 01:16:55,941
但你可以从他的波幅看出
but you can see that it looks

1369
01:16:55,943 --> 01:16:57,543
这就是莫斯电码
a hell of a lot like it.

1370
01:16:57,545 --> 01:17:00,512
所以 上次我们和加文一起工作的时候
So, we, last time we were working with Gavin,

1371
01:17:00,514 --> 01:17:02,647
有一些关于声音的争论
there was kind of some debate over the sound

1372
01:17:02,649 --> 01:17:04,516
我们在大桥片段之后的每个片段的
that we found at the beginning of...

1373
01:17:04,518 --> 01:17:08,887
开头都发现了声音
seems like each clip after the bridge footage.

1374
01:17:08,889 --> 01:17:14,192
使用这个来自iZotope的合成器采样器Iris
Using this synthesizer sampler from iZotope, called Iris,

1375
01:17:14,194 --> 01:17:18,530
原理是你可以给它输入声音
you can basically feed it the sound and it'll map out the frequencies

1376
01:17:18,532 --> 01:17:22,237
它会直观地绘制出声音的频率和振幅
and amplitude of the sound visually.

1377
01:17:25,872 --> 01:17:28,773
当我把你们叫来的时候
So, when I called you guys in here, I was actually

1378
01:17:28,775 --> 01:17:31,943
我其实在想加文应该也在场的
thinking that Gavin would be in here, as well.

1379
01:17:31,945 --> 01:17:35,347
他是导演 我本以为他会想看的
He's the director and yeah, I would have thought he would want to see this,

1380
01:17:35,349 --> 01:17:38,450
这太疯狂了 有点像在证实自己的影片真实性 但是
it's pretty crazy, kind of validates him, but...

1381
01:17:38,452 --> 01:17:40,588
加文已经失踪9天了
Gavin have been missing for nine days.

1382
01:17:41,555 --> 01:17:42,624
哈！
Huh!

1383
01:17:44,291 --> 01:17:48,227
好吧 你准备好了吗？
Alright, so, OK. Are you rolling?

1384
01:17:48,229 --> 01:17:50,262
- 是的  - 好的 在我离开之前
- Yeah! - OK, so, on the way over here,

1385
01:17:50,264 --> 01:17:54,633
这是加文寄来的
before I left this arrived in the mail, this is from Gavin.

1386
01:17:54,635 --> 01:17:56,968
我没有打开它 因为我想等到
I have not opened it up because I wanted to wait until

1387
01:17:56,970 --> 01:17:59,303
我们在镜头前打开它 准备好了吗？
we do this on camera. Ready?

1388
01:17:59,305 --> 01:18:02,342
- 是的  - 好的 好的
- Yeah. - OK. Alright.

1389
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:04,445
DV摄像头
DVCAM.

1390
01:18:07,648 --> 01:18:10,585
- 那是什么？ - 天哪
- What is that? - Holy shit!

1391
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,855
这是...
This is, this is...

1392
01:18:15,855 --> 01:18:18,656
索菲亚·克兰 这是那些片段
Sophia Crane, this is from the found footage.

1393
01:18:18,658 --> 01:18:22,229
这是费德曼寄给她的包裹
This is the package that Feldman sent her.

1394
01:18:27,001 --> 01:18:28,603
不是吧
No kidding!

1395
01:18:29,869 --> 01:18:31,736
这是...
This is...

1396
01:18:31,738 --> 01:18:35,339
好吧 要么这是道具,要么就是
OK, alright, look, either this is a prop or...

1397
01:18:35,341 --> 01:18:37,411
哦 妈的 他怎么得到这个的？
Oh, fuck, how did he get this?

1398
01:18:38,511 --> 01:18:43,382
这是索菲亚后来发现的东西
Because that was the... and then the stuff that Sophia found with the, you know,

1399
01:18:43,384 --> 01:18:45,851
她说这是故事板 概念艺术之类的
she was like storyboard, storyboard, concept art.

1400
01:18:45,853 --> 01:18:48,519
- 这一定是假的 - 从哪来的？
- This is gotta be fake. - Where is it coming from?

1401
01:18:48,521 --> 01:18:51,322
- 我不知道  - 我觉得是加文自己弄的
- I don't know. - I thought it was Gavin.

1402
01:18:51,324 --> 01:18:53,525
地图上都没有什么葛林公司
Gingo Corp's not even showing up on the map,

1403
01:18:53,527 --> 01:18:55,727
在马里兰哪里都找不到 倒是有一个格林格法庭
anywhere in Maryland, there's a Gringo Court!

1404
01:18:55,729 --> 01:18:56,827
巧了
Coincidentally.

1405
01:18:56,829 --> 01:18:58,629
该不是写错了吧
Of course, it's the Ginkgo Court.

1406
01:18:58,631 --> 01:19:00,999
什么是他妈的格林格？
What the fuck is Gringo? Because...

1407
01:19:01,001 --> 01:19:04,835
嘿 听着 有时候社区的名字是会变的 街道名也会更改
Hey, look, I mean, sometimes they change communities, they change the street names...

1408
01:19:04,837 --> 01:19:06,707
- 还有别的吗？ - 是的
- Is anything else in there? - Yeah.

1409
01:19:08,509 --> 01:19:14,812
看 这是他的日记 也许能告诉我们他过去两周在做什么
See, here's his journal, so maybe it tells what he's been doing for the past two weeks.

1410
01:19:14,814 --> 01:19:16,416
我不知道
I don't know.

1411
01:19:19,052 --> 01:19:21,553
这是一个汽车旅馆的钥匙卡
This is a motel key card.

1412
01:19:21,555 --> 01:19:24,488
- 你们开拍了吗？ - 是的
- Are you rolling? - Yeah.

1413
01:19:29,962 --> 01:19:34,066
妈的 怎么回事？
A lot of survey by... Fucking, what's going on?

1414
01:19:34,068 --> 01:19:35,570
加文
Gavin!

1415
01:19:38,604 --> 01:19:40,942
管理人员还在吗？
Is the management guys still...

1416
01:19:41,908 --> 01:19:45,811
好 我们进去吧 我认为我们不应该在这里拍摄
Good, let's go in! I don't think we should record in here.

1417
01:19:45,813 --> 01:19:48,080
我们不算非法入室吧？
We're not breaking in, are we?

1418
01:19:48,082 --> 01:19:50,081
嗯
Yeah, right.

1419
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:52,351
哦 该死
Oh, shit!

1420
01:19:52,353 --> 01:19:54,385
加文
Gavin!

1421
01:19:54,387 --> 01:19:57,054
天哪 这样不好 这是什么鬼东西
Jesus, it's not good! The hell is this?

1422
01:19:57,056 --> 01:19:58,623
- 肯尼 肯尼 - 怎么？
- Kenny, Kenny! - What?

1423
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:02,093
- 摄像机开着的  - 天哪
- The GoPro's on. - Jesus!

1424
01:20:02,095 --> 01:20:04,795
你觉得他在干什么？ 这他妈的是什么？
What you think he's doing? What the fuck is this?

1425
01:20:04,797 --> 01:20:06,430
录下来
Recording it.

1426
01:20:06,432 --> 01:20:08,770
这是他的相机 里面没有内存卡
Here's his camera, there's no card inside it.

1427
01:20:10,703 --> 01:20:13,875
有人看到松下DVX吗？
Does anybody see the Panasonic, the DVX?

1428
01:20:15,975 --> 01:20:17,478
磁带？
The tapes?

1429
01:20:19,046 --> 01:20:20,845
一切都好吗？
Everything OK?

1430
01:20:20,847 --> 01:20:24,883
好的 把这个放进车里 我们要把这个带走
OK, cool. Put this in the car, we'll take these with us.

1431
01:20:24,885 --> 01:20:26,651
- 该死 - 好吧
- Shit! - OK.

1432
01:20:26,653 --> 01:20:30,821
他妈的 伙计 我们离开这里 我们走 我们走
Fuck, dude! Let's get out of here! Let's go, let's go!

1433
01:20:30,823 --> 01:20:33,090
怎么了？
What's wrong?

1434
01:20:33,092 --> 01:20:35,527
我不知道 真的
I don't know, seriously!

1435
01:20:35,529 --> 01:20:37,562
哦 他妈的  伙计
Oh, fuck, dude!

1436
01:20:37,564 --> 01:20:39,600
怎么了 伙计 里面是什么？
What is it, man, what's in there?

1437
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,704
我们不如从头开始说吧
I suggest to start from the beginning with what happened.

1438
01:20:44,738 --> 01:20:47,742
我们正在制作一部纪录片
OK, so, we're making a documentary.

1439
01:20:48,574 --> 01:20:49,876
那个开着吗？
Is that on?

1440
01:20:51,145 --> 01:20:52,910
你在录吗？
Are you recording it?

1441
01:20:52,912 --> 01:20:55,546
- 是的 -好吧
- Yes. - OK.

1442
01:20:55,548 --> 01:20:56,915
继续
Go ahead.

1443
01:20:56,917 --> 01:20:59,821
我们正在拍一部关于
We're making a documentary about

1444
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:02,454
四折的纪录片
the deceased.

1445
01:21:11,597 --> 01:21:13,432
卡尔 录像呢？
Carl, where's the footage?

1446
01:21:13,434 --> 01:21:15,500
磁带在哪？
Where are the tapes?

1447
01:21:15,502 --> 01:21:16,971
在我车里
In my car.

1448
01:21:18,704 --> 01:21:21,807
我们是否应该向警方展示一下
Do you think, should we show the police

1449
01:21:21,809 --> 01:21:24,009
我们拍摄的内容和其他的东西呢？
the footage on the camera and everything?

1450
01:21:24,011 --> 01:21:25,177
- 不 不 - 为什么不？
- No, no. - Why not?

1451
01:21:25,179 --> 01:21:26,510
他们可能会把它拿走
They might take it away.

1452
01:21:26,512 --> 01:21:27,912
他们会把磁带拿走的
They'll take the tapes,

1453
01:21:27,914 --> 01:21:30,051
他们想要磁带 他们需要磁带
they want the tapes, they need the tapes.

1454
01:21:30,984 --> 01:21:33,117
带子 听着 鞋盒里的带子
The tapes, look, the tapes in the shoebox

1455
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:35,719
和这里发生的事 一点关系都没有
have absolutely nothing to do with what happened here.

1456
01:21:35,721 --> 01:21:39,057
与它无关 我们已经有了真实的场景 我们可以使用录像
Nothing to do with it, and we already have a real scene, we can use the footage.

1457
01:21:39,059 --> 01:21:41,660
我说的是我们刚刚拍的镜头
I'm talking about the footage on my camera that we just shot,

1458
01:21:41,662 --> 01:21:43,061
我们不应该把它给警察看吗？
shouldn't we show that to the police?

1459
01:21:43,063 --> 01:21:44,763
是的 但是 如果我们向警方证明
Yeah, but, if we show that to the police

1460
01:21:44,765 --> 01:21:46,498
它会显示卡尔发现了这些磁带
it'll show that Carl found the tapes

1461
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,801
然后他们会拿走磁带的
and then they'll take the tapes.

1462
01:21:50,203 --> 01:21:54,071
你觉得他在做什么 那个迷你摄像机还有其他摄像机什么的
What do you think he was doing, all the GoPros and all the camera stuff, like, what...

1463
01:21:54,073 --> 01:21:57,808
我不住地 我认为更重要的问题是谁拿走了这些内存卡
I don't know, I think the more important question is who took the cards?

1464
01:21:57,810 --> 01:22:00,044
谁？ 卡不在相机里
Who? They're not in the cameras...

1465
01:22:00,046 --> 01:22:04,081
- 十年后我们就会知道了  - 什么？
- So we'll find out in ten years! - What?

1466
01:22:04,083 --> 01:22:06,487
十年后录像就会被他人找到
That's when the footage will be found!

1467
01:22:10,724 --> 01:22:13,191
我昨晚很早就睡了
I went to bed early last night.

1468
01:22:13,193 --> 01:22:17,228
我太累了 就像你生病前一样
I was so tired, kind of like you are right before you're getting sick.

1469
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:21,700
我梦见我走到隧道里 我凝视着
I dreamt I went to the tunnel and I was staring down,

1470
01:22:21,702 --> 01:22:23,003
就在午夜
right at midnight.

1471
01:22:24,238 --> 01:22:27,775
每个人都说它很难 但我认为很容易
Everyone says it's so hard, but I thought it was so easy.

1472
01:22:29,877 --> 01:22:32,544
然后我盯了一个小时
And when I stared for an hour,

1473
01:22:32,546 --> 01:22:33,681
他出现了
he appeared

1474
01:22:34,782 --> 01:22:38,586
然后我醒了 我意识到这不是一个梦
and then I woke up and I realized it wasn't a dream!

1475
01:22:39,552 --> 01:22:41,588
它离我家有十英里远
It's ten miles from my house

1476
01:22:42,855 --> 01:22:44,992
我不知道我是怎么到那儿的
and I don't know how I got there!

1477
01:22:46,827 --> 01:22:49,527
好吧 我来和你讲讲这条隧道
Alright, I'll tell you about this tunnel...

1478
01:22:49,529 --> 01:22:50,965
哦 妈的
Oh, fuck!

1479
01:22:52,466 --> 01:22:56,735
老实说 这不是我们想要的结果
Let's be honest here, this is not what we thought this was going to be,

1480
01:22:56,737 --> 01:22:59,937
我们现在是想要探寻真相
and now we're trying to make something out of it.

1481
01:22:59,939 --> 01:23:04,742
听着 不是所有的纪录片都一定要有什么结果的
Listen, not all documentaries, not all projects come together.

1482
01:23:04,744 --> 01:23:09,281
这就是其中一个例子 没能成功的例子
This is one of those examples, it just didn't, it didn't pan out.

1483
01:23:09,283 --> 01:23:12,887
所以你的意思是我们要对眼前这个精彩的故事视而不见吗？
So you're saying we don't have a compelling story to cut together here, we don't have...

1484
01:23:13,886 --> 01:23:19,657
这个故事没有尽头 我们只是傻傻地站在铁轨上罢了
There's, there's no end to this story other than us standing here on the tracks.

1485
01:23:19,659 --> 01:23:23,628
这个故事没有结局 因为这只是个开始
There's no end of this story because it's all, this is the beginning.

1486
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:25,196
- 你明白吗？ - 什么？
- You understand? - What?

1487
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:27,031
我们有带子 对吧？
We have the tapes, right?

1488
01:23:27,033 --> 01:23:29,166
然后未知工作室发现了音频的事情 是吧？
Then there's what Studio Unknown found, OK?

1489
01:23:29,168 --> 01:23:31,736
他们发现了那个声音异常
They found that sound anomaly.

1490
01:23:31,738 --> 01:23:33,905
我们没有加进去 加文也没有
We didn't put that there, Gavin didn't put that there.

1491
01:23:33,907 --> 01:23:38,343
沃德罗发现了哪个镜头 眼睛里的倒映
With what Wardlaw found, OK, with the reflection in the eye,

1492
01:23:38,345 --> 01:23:40,911
我们也可以选择把纪录片投放出去
and I don't know we put this documentary out there

1493
01:23:40,913 --> 01:23:42,947
其他人可以把它带到下一个阶段
and other people can take it to the next step!

1494
01:23:42,949 --> 01:23:45,717
- 这仅仅是个开始  - 你在自相矛盾
- This is just the beginning. - You're contradicting yourself!

1495
01:23:45,719 --> 01:23:49,153
- 我没有自相矛盾 - 你刚才说
- I'm not contradicting myself! - You just said we're not trying

1496
01:23:49,155 --> 01:23:52,190
我们不是要像真实的故事那样呈现我们 现在你却要像这样呈现
to present us like a real story, and now you are trying to present it like this.

1497
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:56,827
我试着像真实故事一样讲述加文·约克的遭遇
I am trying to present this like the real story of what happened to Gavin York.

1498
01:23:56,829 --> 01:23:58,897
因为我们想要讲述加文的故事
And because we're trying to tell Gavin's story,

1499
01:23:58,899 --> 01:24:02,800
其中包含的这些因素是他故事的一部分
these component factors that are included in there are part of his story,

1500
01:24:02,802 --> 01:24:04,068
他身上发生的事情的一部分
part of what happened to him.

1501
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:05,202
我不是说这是真的
I'm not saying it's real,

1502
01:24:05,204 --> 01:24:06,804
我只是说
I'm just saying that

1503
01:24:06,806 --> 01:24:11,076
什么样的白痴才会无视这个
what kind of a fucking idiot just drops it!

1504
01:24:11,078 --> 01:24:14,048
埃里克 那你相信那个眨眼人是真的吗？
Erik, do you believe that the Blinkman is real?

1505
01:24:32,765 --> 01:24:36,267
我叫索菲亚·克兰 今天是2004年3月3日
My name is Sophia Crane. It's March 3rd, 2004.

1506
01:24:36,269 --> 01:24:39,370
我是一个电影系学生 这是我的毕业论文
I'm a film student and this is my senior thesis.

1507
01:24:39,372 --> 01:24:41,772
我不知道我还能活多久
I don't know how much longer I'm going to be alive,

1508
01:24:41,774 --> 01:24:43,273
所以我请求找到这个的人
so I ask whoever find this,

1509
01:24:43,275 --> 01:24:45,710
请把这次最后片段
please apply the first and second halves

1510
01:24:45,712 --> 01:24:47,111
前半段和后半段
of this final interview

1511
01:24:47,113 --> 01:24:49,347
拼接到我的电影的开头和结局
to the beginning and end of my film.

1512
01:24:49,349 --> 01:24:51,351
我不知道该去哪里弄
I don't know where to make the cut.

1513
01:24:52,185 --> 01:24:56,057
这是偷窥狂汤姆的故事 以及我去寻找他的故事
This is the story of Peeping Tom and how I went looking for him.

1514
01:24:56,957 --> 01:24:59,760
请把这个给我的父母看
Please show this to my parents.

1515
01:25:01,127 --> 01:25:04,428
我不知道我还能坚持多久不眨眼
I don't know how much longer I can go without blinking,

1516
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:07,699
但我想我找到了打败他的方法
but I think I found a way to beat him.

1517
01:25:07,701 --> 01:25:10,268
那个盯着太阳看的女孩只是失去了视力
The girl who stared into the sun

1518
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:14,104
她还得眨眼睛
she only lost her sight, she still had to blink.

1519
01:25:14,106 --> 01:25:15,940
每个人都不得不眨眼
Everyone blinks.

1520
01:25:15,942 --> 01:25:19,980
他就在这里 戏谑我 我要尝试最后一招
It's right here, taunting me, try one last thing.

1521
01:25:35,095 --> 01:25:37,461
他们说你骗不了偷窥狂汤姆
They say you can't cheat Peeping Tom.

1522
01:25:37,463 --> 01:25:40,900
但是我想我找到了在他的游戏中打败他的方法
But I think I found the way to beat him at his own game!
