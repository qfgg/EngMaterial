Okay. My turn, my turn. Um, I got one.

16
00:00:53,150 --> 00:01:02,500
{\an8}里维克的店
家庭娱乐中心

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,810
很好  但是你这次
Great, but can you make it

18
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,350
能不能想个稍微有挑战性的东西
a little more challenging this time?

19
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,380
好了  来猜猜这个
Okay. Check this out.

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,320
小眼睛滴溜溜
I spy with my little eye...

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,790
这个东西是黄色的
something yellow...

22
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,190
它是圆形的  还喜欢吃豆子
and round, and it eats dots.

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,630
认真的吗  拉尔夫
Seriously, Ralph?

24
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,170
对啊  真的  你肯定猜不到
Yeah, seriously. You're never gonna get it.

25
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,600
很显然  是吃豆人
Well, obviously, it's Pac-Man.

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,170
不  那...
No, that's not...

27
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,610
哪里明显了
Why is that obvious?

28
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,600
{\an8}超级酒保

29
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,470
黄色圆形又爱吃豆子的
Name one other thing in this whole arcade

30
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,810
整个街机游戏里找不出第二个了
that is yellow and round and eats dots.

31
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,310
我就可以找出两个
I can name two things.

32
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,510
吃豆人妈妈和吃豆人宝宝
Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man.

33
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,480
我原谅你了
Boom! I accept your apology.

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,680
好吧  你说得对  但是答案是吃豆人吗
Yeah, you're right. Okay. But was it Pac-Man?

35
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,590
对  被你猜到了
Yeah, you got me.

36
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,620
我就知道  好吧  轮到我了
Knew it. All right, riddle me this...

37
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,330
你觉得桑吉夫做了蜜蜡脱毛吗
do you or do you not think that Zangief waxes?

38
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,260
不可能  瞧他这样  毛还是浓密得跟雪怪似的
No way. Look at the guy. He looks like a yeti.

39
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,630
我说不好
I don't know.

40
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,670
要说仅仅是他的胸毛
I mean, if the fur were confined to his chest,

41
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,830
我也许同意你的说法
I might agree...

42
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,370
但是看看从他靴子里
but look at those two very specific

43
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,800
探出来的
tuffets of shin hair...

44
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,340
那两撮小腿毛
poking out of his boots.

45
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,370
这不是偶然  拉尔夫  他去脱毛了
That does not just happen, Ralph. That is a choice.

46
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,340
你说得非常对  小鬼
You're totally right, kid.

47
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,640
他的其他地方都像婴儿一样光滑
He's baby smooth everywhere else.

48
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,650
我说完了
I rest my case.

49
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,320
我震惊了
My mind is blown!

50
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,720
我们去喝根汁汽水吧
Let's go get a root beer.

{\an8}超级酒保

00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:16,240
{\an8}根汁汽水

53
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,890
让我来瞧瞧你的本事  小鬼
Okay, let's see what you got, kid.

54
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,560
不错  好了
Nice one. Okay.

55
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,290
我胃里上来了
I think I got one in the chamber.

56
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,260
-真恶心  -谢谢
- Gross. - Thank you.

57
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,530
想溜进创去玩儿吗
Hey, wanna sneak into Tron?

58
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,370
那个游戏不是有病毒吗
Doesn't that game have a virus?

59
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,840
没有  他们肯定修复了
No. I'm sure they fixed it.

60
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,170
我要打破我的速度纪录
I'm gonna beat my speed record!

61
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,680
等等我
Hey, wait for me!

62
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,960
{\an8}危险
被感染区域
不要进入

63
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,850
拉尔夫
Ralph.

64
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,390
在
Yeah?

65
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,560
我觉得他们没有修复游戏
I don't think they fixed the game.

66
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,630
是啊
Uh... No.

67
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,630
救命
Help!

68
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,900
创
Hey, Tron!

69
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,700
小创
Tronny!

70
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,740
{\an8}创

71
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,440
创小子
Tronny boy!

72
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,440
救命
Help!

73
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,770
你有没有意识到
Do you realize

74
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,470
基本上我们就是0和1组成的代码
we're basically just, like, zeroes and ones...

75
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,240
就像是漂浮在宇宙里的小小尘埃
floating around the universe like tiny specks of dust?

76
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,610
我们的存在
Like, doesn't the very nature

77
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,380
会不会让你想知道
of our existence make you wonder...

78
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,720
生命里会不会有比这更多的东西
if there's more to life than this?

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,590
我的生活这么完美  我为什么要想
Why would I wonder if there's more to life

80
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,820
生命里还有没有比这更多的东西呢
when the life I got is perfect?

81
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,460
我是说  是啊  表面上的确如此
I mean, sure. Doesn't look so hot on paper.

82
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,430
我只是一个在街机里
I'm just a bad guy from some old video game

83
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,390
{\an8}快手阿修

84
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,590
破坏大楼的坏蛋
who wrecks a building.

85
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,230
过去的27年里
And yeah, for 27 years,

86
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,530
我没有一个朋友
I was a total zero without any friends.

87
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,600
但是现在  我有了一个死党
But now, I got a best friend...

88
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,870
而她恰好是
who just happens to be

89
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,740
整个街机厅里最酷的小鬼
the coolest kid in the whole arcade.

90
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,740
谢了  伙计
Aw, thanks, pal.

91
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,740
看
Watch this.

92
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,910
全垒打
Home run!

93
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,450
好了  我们去看日出吧
All right, let's go watch the sunrise.

94
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,810
你真的认为你的生活中
Are you really saying

95
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,920
没有任何一件事
there's not one single, solitary thing...

96
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,990
是你想要改变的吗
about your life that you would change?

97
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,990
想想看
Well, think about it.

98
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,920
你和我整晚都在偷懒
You and me get to goof off all night long.

99
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,560
里维克出现了  我们就开始上班工作了
Litwak shows up, we go to work, we put in our hours.

100
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,930
然后游戏厅关门了
Then the arcade closes

101
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,930
我们又可以偷懒了
and we get to do it all over again.

102
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,630
我只想改变一件事
The only thing I might do different in that scenario...

103
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,670
我们不用去上班
would be not having to go to work.

104
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,470
除此之外  我什么都不想改变
Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing

105
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,910
日出呢
Hey, where'd our sunrise go?

106
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,950
给你插上插头吧
All right, let's get you plugged in.

107
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,850
那是插电警告
That's a plug-in alert.

108
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,350
里维克已经很久没加入新游戏了
Litwak hasn't plugged in a new game in forever.

109
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,520
-我们去看看是什么游戏  -好
- Let's go see what it is! - Yeah!

110
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,620
借过  让一下  有点紧急情况
Excuse us. Excuse us. Minor emergency.

111
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,860
阿修  卡尔霍  什么游戏接进来了
Hey, Felix, Calhoun, what's getting plugged in?

112
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,490
拉尔夫  索尼克觉得
Well, Ralph, Sonic thinks

113
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,560
是一款新的弹球游戏
it's gonna be a new pinball machine.

114
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,060
你觉得呢  亲爱的
What do you think, lady love?

115
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,700
我跟你赌五分钱  这是一台血压机
I'll bet you a shiny nickel it's a blood pressure machine.

116
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,800
孩子们都喜欢那些东西
Kids love those things.

117
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,540
拜托要是赛车游戏  拜托要是赛车游戏
Please be a racing game. Please be a racing game.

118
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,370
拜托要是赛车游戏
Please be a racing game.

119
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,480
这是念"五仙"  还是"五险"
"Whiffee"? Or, "Wifey"?

120
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:49,750
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}音似wiffle[威浮]和wife[老婆]

121
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,750
不是威浮球就是结婚游戏
Well, it's either wiffle ball, or an arranged marriage game.

122
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,480
这个词念"无线"  拉尔夫
It's actually pronounced "Wi-Fi," Ralph.

123
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,650
对  我就是这么念的
Yeah, that's what I said.

124
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,380
无线就是互联网
And Wi-Fi is the Internet...

125
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,650
它是一个线上社区
which is an online community

126
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,820
人类在里面购物
where human beings go to shop...

127
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,660
玩游戏  还有社交
and play games and socialize.

128
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,420
真好玩
Ooh, fun!

129
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,830
不  一点都不好玩
Oh, no, it is not.

130
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,060
上面写了"无线"
That sign right there says "Wi-Fi."

131
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,530
但是其实应该叫"死线"
What it should say is "Die-Fi."

132
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,770
开个小玩笑
That's a little humor there.

133
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,870
不过说真的  互联网没什么好笑的
But seriously, the Internet is nothing to laugh at.

134
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,640
这是个新的  与众不同的玩意儿
It is new, it is different,

135
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,070
我们应该害怕它才对
and therefore we should fear it.

136
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,480
所以看在上帝的份上  不要进去  开始工作吧
So keep out, for Pete's sake, and get to work.

137
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,580
游戏厅就要开门了
The arcade's about to open.

138
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,450
角色们  我们终于有了一个新游戏
Figures, we finally get something new plugged in...

139
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,380
但是却连进都不能进
and we're not even allowed to go in there.

140
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,350
一点也不公平
Totally not fair.

141
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,920
要是有一个新的赛车游戏就太酷了
A new racing game would've been cool.

142
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,960
你的游戏出问题了吗
Something wrong with your game?

143
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,520
不  没有
No, no.

144
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,930
只是所有的奖励关卡都解锁了
It's just every bonus level's been unlocked.

145
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,930
我知道每条近道
I know every shortcut.

146
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,700
哪怕只是一条新赛道  我都会激动得要命
Man, I'd kill for even just a new track.

147
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,600
新赛道  你已经有三条赛道了
New track? You already got, like, three choices.

148
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,940
我知道  可是你就不希望
Yeah, I know, but don't you ever wish

149
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,370
你的游戏里会有
something new and different...

150
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,700
一点新的  不同的东西吗
would happen in your game?

151
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,770
不
Nope.

152
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,880
真的吗  那我保留不同意见[同意分歧]
Really? Well, agree to disagree.

153
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,740
等等  我不想要分歧
Wait, I don't wanna disagree.

154
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,450
不  不是  这只是一种花哨的说法
No, no. It's just a fancy way to say

155
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,950
意思是我们不必争论谁是谁非
we don't have to argue about it.

156
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,780
我们在争论  我不想争论
We're arguing? I don't wanna argue.

157
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,490
放轻松  别小题大做了
Relax. Stop making it a thing.

158
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,120
去工作吧  晚上见  臭家伙
Go to work. I'll see you tonight, stench vessel.

159
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,090
好
All right.

160
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,770
她想要新赛道  我就给她一条
She wants a new track, I'll give her a new track.

161
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,060
{\an8}零钱

162
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,940
来吧  纳菲莎  我们来玩糖果竞速
Come on, Nafisa! Let's play Sugar Rush!

163
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,770
选凡妮洛普  斯瓦蒂
Pick Vanellope, Swati.

164
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,510
她拥有最棒的超能力
She's got the best superpower.

165
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,910
对  小故障  我喜欢她
Yeah, the glitch. I love her.

166
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,910
车手们
Drivers,

167
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,150
发动引擎
start your engines.

168
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,020
你今天要输了  公主
You're gonna lose today, Princess.

169
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,150
好吧  虽然我是个公主  太妃塔
While, yes, I am technically a princess, Taffyta...

170
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,160
我更希望你把我当做普普通通的凡妮洛普
I'd rather you just think of me as plain old Vanellope...

171
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,660
一个要干翻你的赛车手
the racer who's about to kick your butt.

172
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,560
三  二  一  出发
Three, two, one, go!

173
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,600
不好意思  不好意思  借过
And pardon me, excuse me, coming through.

174
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,810
一  二  三个口香糖球  正好
And one, two, three gumballs right on cue.

175
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,780
我太喜欢她的故障了
Yeah, I love it when she glitches.

176
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,860
抱歉  我睡着了
Excuse me. I must have fallen asleep.

177
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,990
真好玩  我赢了
Oh, fun. I'm winning.

178
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,800
凡妮洛普大幅领先
Vanellope takes a huge lead.

179
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,430
谁也跟不上她
No one's gonna catch her now.

180
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,170
她会喜欢的
She's gonna love this.

181
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,110
正好赶上
Right on time.

182
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,510
{\an8}终点

183
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,710
什么
What?

184
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,680
"想要新鲜的
"Looking for something new...

185
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,140
{\an8}想要新鲜的

186
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,190
{\an8}与众不同的东西吗

187
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,470
{\an8}那就试试这条赛道

188
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,980
与众不同的东西吗
and different?

189
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,050
那就试试这条赛道
then take this track."

190
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,090
拉尔夫  你这家伙
Oh, Ralph, you old son-of-a-gun.

191
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,560
要我说我还有时间绕道一会儿
I'd say I got a little time for a detour.

192
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,860
瞧  我解锁了新赛道
Hey, look, I think I unlocked a new track.

193
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,630
从没见过的新赛道
Never seen that before.

194
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,820
{\an8}石子路

195
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,070
太棒啦
This is awesome!

196
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,240
谢了  拉尔夫
Hey, thanks, Ralph!

197
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,040
不用谢
You're welcome!

198
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,810
回赛道上去  斯瓦蒂
Get back up on the track, Swati.

199
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,170
你要输了
You're going to lose.

200
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,640
不行  感觉它自己在驾驶
I can't. It's like it's driving itself.

201
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,300
{\an8}热软糖坑

202
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,750
这东西出什么毛病了
What is wrong with this thing?

203
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,090
什么
What?

204
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,030
不  不
No, no!

205
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,530
小鬼
Kid!

206
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,910
不  不不不
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

207
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,870
小鬼  小鬼
Kid! Kid!

208
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,610
小鬼  真对不起  你还好吧
Oh, kid, I'm so sorry, are you okay?

209
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,610
天哪
Oh, my gosh.

210
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,050
这条赛道太棒啦
What an amazing track!

211
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,880
谢谢你  拉尔夫  谢谢谢谢谢谢
Thank you, Ralph! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

212
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,220
不用谢
You're welcome!

213
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,790
我非常认真地履行我作为你的英雄的职责
You know I take my duty as your hero very seriously.

214
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,950
慢着
Wait a minute.

215
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,860
                [音似duty]You took a serious doody where?

216
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,290
凡妮洛普  快上来
Vanellope, get up here.

217
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,930
我们有麻烦了
We have a situation.

218
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,130
里维克先生  凡妮洛普车手刚才没反应了
Mr. Litwak, the Vanellope racer wasn't working...

219
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,100
我觉得我可能转方向盘太用力了
and I think maybe I turned the wheel too hard.

220
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,940
真对不起
I'm real sorry.

221
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,270
没关系  斯瓦蒂
It's okay, Swati.

222
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,140
我可以很容易地把它装回去
I think I can get it back on there pretty easy.

223
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,640
-你都干了些什么  拉尔夫  -没什么
- What did you do, Ralph? - Nothing.

224
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,740
别怪他
Leave him alone.

225
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,680
他只是想让比赛更刺激
He was just trying to make the game more exciting.

226
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,680
对  别紧张  太妃塔  里维克会修好的
Yeah, why don't you relax, Taffyta? Litwak will fix it.

227
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,680
好了  你...
All right, on you...

228
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,620
好吧  这也不是问题
Okay. Still not a problem.

229
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,820
只要订购新的就行了
He'll just order a new part.

230
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,090
我想订购一个新的
Well, I'd order a new part...

231
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,790
但是糖果竞速的制造公司
but the company that made Sugar Rush

232
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,960
已经停业很久了
went out of business years ago.

233
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,830
我去网上找找一个试试
I can try to find one on the Internet.

234
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,930
-好主意  -我也试试
- Good idea. - Oh, me too.

235
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,700
祝你们好运  那就像是大海捞针
Good luck, that'll be like finding a needle in a...

236
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,230
找到了  易贝网上有一个
I found one! On eBay!

237
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,970
真的吗  真厉害
Really? How about that?

238
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,170
瞧  那几个孩子搞定了
See? Those kids have it under control.

239
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,210
他们要在易小子网上买方向盘
They're just gonna get another wheel from the eboy.

240
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,730
{\an8}糖果竞速  方向盘
复古电子游戏  仅剩一件
200美元 免运费

241
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,010
这是在开玩笑吗  多少钱
Are you kidding me? How much?

242
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,310
比这台机子一年赚的钱还多
That's more than this game makes in a year.

243
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,950
我也不想这么说
Aw, I hate to say it,

244
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,280
但是回收的人星期五会来...
but my salvage guy is coming on Friday...

245
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,080
也许是时候把糖果竞速拆掉卖了
and it might be time to sell Sugar Rush for parts.

246
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,150
他要去哪里
Where's he going?

247
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,820
里维克要把游戏拔了
Litwak's gonna unplug the game.

248
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,960
快离开这里  跑  快跑  快
Get out of here! Go, scram, let's go, run!

249
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,390
快快快  快跑
Go, run, run, run, run!

250
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,230
-快跑  -快跑
- Let's go! - Run!

251
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,970
让开
Gangway!

252
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,000
你听到了  让开
Yeah, you heard him, gangway!

253
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,140
停下  不要跑了
Stop it! No running!

254
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,040
老天在上  你们这些人为什么
What are you people doing out of your game,

255
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,210
跑出自己的游戏
for Peter's sake?

256
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,180
游戏厅已经开门了
The arcade is open!

257
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,980
糖果竞速要被拔了
Sugar Rush is getting unplugged.

258
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,060
{\an8}糖果竞速

259
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,060
-我们无家可归了  -对  我们无家可归了
- We're homeless! - Yeah, yeah, we're homeless!

260
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,690
我们要怎么办
Oh, what are we going to do?

261
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,100
你们都冷静一下  冷静  控制一下自己
Y'all, calm down, calm down. Get a hold of yourselves.

262
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,730
我不想失去游戏
I don't want to be gameless.

263
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,930
被拔了  老天啊
An unplugging. Good Lord.

264
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,040
自从太空侵略者下线以来  我还从没见过
I haven't seen this many gameless characters

265
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
这么多失去游戏的角色
since Space Invaders went down.

266
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,870
我们要住在哪里
Where are we gonna live?

267
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,240
游戏厅关门之前  我想你们可以待在这里
Well, you can stay here until the arcade closes, I guess...

268
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,780
然后我们再来想想
and then we'll figure out

269
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,680
要把你们放到哪里
where the heck we're gonna put you all.

270
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,900
好了
Okay.

271
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,100
我们来看看
Here we go.

272
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,370
我扫荡了吉恩的冰箱
I raided Gene's fridge.

273
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,770
好消息  他有个派
Good news, he's got pie.

274
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,270
我还从他那儿拿了一堆枕头什么的
Took a bunch of his pillows and junk, too.

275
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,710
我觉得我们可以在这里搭个堡垒  帐篷
I'm thinking we make a fort up here, or like a yurt.

276
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,410
或者我们可以用这些枕头...
Or we could take these pillows...

277
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,780
如果叠得好
If we stack them right,

278
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,880
我们可以用枕头叠一个小冰屋
we can make an igloo out of pillows.

279
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,050
枕头冰屋  冰屋  冰屋
Like a pillow igloo. Pigloo. Pigloo!

280
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,020
你觉得怎么样  小鬼
So what do you think, kid?

281
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,090
要搭堡垒  帐篷  还是显然最棒的  冰屋
Fort, yurt, or the obvious best choice, pigloo?

282
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,090
不敢相信我没有游戏了
I can't believe I don't have a game anymore.

283
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,260
那我  以后要怎么度过每天
I mean, like, what am I gonna do all day?

284
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,930
什么  你在开玩笑吗
What? Come on, are you kidding?

285
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,400
你只管睡觉  不用干活
You sleep in, you do no work,

286
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,800
每天晚上你还可以跟我一起去超级酒保
then you go to Tapper's with me every night.

287
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,770
这可不就是天堂吗
I've literally just described paradise.

288
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,770
可是我很爱我的游戏
But I loved my game.

289
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,740
得了
Oh, come on.

290
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,040
你之前还在抱怨赛道
You were just bellyaching about the tracks

291
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,210
都太简单了
being too easy.

292
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,380
可那不代表我不爱它
No, that doesn't mean I didn't love it.

293
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,120
没错  赛道是没什么新意
Yeah, sure, it was kind of predictable...

294
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,750
但是我还是没法预测比赛时会发生什么事
but still I never really knew what might happen in a race.

295
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,320
是那个  那种感觉
And it's that, it's that feeling,

296
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,290
不知道会发生什么的感觉
that not-knowing-what's- coming-next feeling.

297
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:15,360
是那种感觉  对我来说那才是生活
That's the stuff. That feels like life to me.

298
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,730
要是我不再是赛车手了  拉尔夫
And if I'm not a racer, Ralph...

299
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,100
那我是谁呢
what am I?

300
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,470
你是我最好的朋友
Well, you're my best friend.

301
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,900
那不够
That's not enough.

302
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,870
不  我只是...
No, I just...

303
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,850
对不起  我知道我表现得很奇怪
I'm sorry, I know I'm being weird.

304
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,450
也许我该一个人静一下
I think maybe I just need to be alone right now.

305
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,020
好吧
Okay.

306
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,490
那我一会儿去超级酒保找你
I'll meet you over at Tapper's in a little while, I guess.

307
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,230
如果你想去的话
If you want.

308
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,030
好了
All right, now...

309
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,300
我们给糖果竞速的小朋友们
we found some good homes

310
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,230
找了几个好住所
for so many of our chums from Sugar Rush...

311
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,000
我们希望你们中的一些人
and we're just hoping a few more of you

312
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,170
愿意打开家门
will open your doors...

313
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,170
打开心门来接纳他们
and your hearts to those in need.

314
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,970
那颗大大的绿橄榄
Well, I suppose that large green olive

315
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,810
和我家的装饰很相配
will fit in nicely with my decor.

316
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,040
我是酸豆糖
I'm a sour ball.

317
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,850
有得住就别挑了吧  你说呢
Well, beggars can't be choosers, can they?

318
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,380
跟我走吧  调味糖
Come along, condiment.

319
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,150
行吧
Mm-kay.

320
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,120
很好  那就只剩赛车手们了
Marvelous. That just leaves the racers.

321
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,520
我们  很讨人喜欢
We're, like, adorable.

322
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,290
那当然了
You sure are.

323
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,460
有人愿意吗
So, any takers?

324
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,170
有人吗
Anyone?

325
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,410
阿修  我知道我们从没谈过
Felix, I know we've never once talked about

326
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,370
组建家庭的事  但是...
having a family before, but...

327
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,280
感觉组建家庭就像是
I know, it feels like the kind of thing

328
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,840
直接一头扎进去
you just jump into with both feet...

329
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,580
没有计划的事
and nary a plan.

330
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,380
阿修和我来接纳她们吧
Felix and I will give them sanctuary.

331
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,920
我可以跟你们俩简单说句话吗
Can I get a quick word with you two?

332
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,320
听着  我明白
Look, I get it.

333
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,020
你们已经结婚六年了
You've been married six years,

334
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,430
想给生活添点调味料
you're looking to spice things up...

335
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,530
但是相信我  收养15个孩子
but trust me, adopting 15 children

336
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,360
可不是你们要的滋味
is the wrong kind of spice.

337
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,300
她们可都是野孩子
Those things are basically feral.

338
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,300
抱歉  先生  但是那几个孩子就是小羊羔
Pardon me, sir, but those youngsters are lambs.

339
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,110
迷失的小羊羔需要两个善良  有爱心的牧羊人
Lost little lambs in need of two kind, caring shepherds.

340
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,270
没错
That's right.

341
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,450
再说了  做父母能有多难
Besides, how hard can parenting be?

342
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,280
把孩子当做你最好的朋友
You treat the child like your best friend...

343
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,150
对他们有求必应
you give them everything they want...

344
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,580
给他们全部的爱
and you just love their little socks off.

345
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,950
对吗  亲亲
Right, Tammy?

346
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,520
当然了
Darn-tootin'.

347
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,360
你来抢啊
Come and get it.

348
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,430
你自己去找一根蜡烛玩儿
Get your own candle.

349
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,090
妈  你们的破电视
Hey, Mom, why does your lame TV

350
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,600
怎么只有一个频道
only have one channel?

351
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,470
我很不想说我提醒过你们...
Well, hate to say I told ya...

352
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,080
酒保
Hey, Tapper?

353
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,180
没有  拉尔夫  我没看见凡妮洛普
No, Ralph. I haven't seen Vanellope.

354
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,250
你30秒前刚问过我
Not since the last time you asked me 30 seconds ago.

355
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,490
抱歉  只是我很担心她
Sorry. I'm just worried about her.

356
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,560
她在不停地出故障  一副很没有安全感的样子
She's glitching like crazy, and acting super insecure.

357
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,590
还有  你听听  她说
Oh. And get this, she said...

358
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,100
和我做朋友对她来说还不够
being friends with me wasn't enough for her.

359
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,960
不够  我可是个很棒的朋友
Not enough? I'm a great friend!

360
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,630
对吗  酒保  对吧
Right, Tapper? Right?

361
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,000
抱歉  谁才是一副没有安全感的样子
I'm sorry. Who's acting insecure?

362
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,370
拉尔夫  别这样
Ralph, come on.

363
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,170
那孩子刚刚失去了她的游戏  让她清静会儿吧
The kid just lost her game. Give her a break.

364
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,280
你可算来啦
There you are... Oh.

365
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,380
拉尔夫
Hey, Ralph.

366
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,950
阿修  你什么时候也喝起根汁汽水了
Hey, Felix. Since when do you drink root beer?

367
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,180
今晚开始
Since tonight.

368
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,220
我懂  兄弟
Yeah, I hear you, buddy.

369
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,450
这杯本来是给凡妮洛普点的
Hey, listen. This one was supposed to be for Vanellope.

370
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,620
你喝了吧
I guess you can have it.

371
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,350
看起来她不会来了
Doesn't look like she's coming.

372
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,520
谢了
Thanks.

373
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,220
知道吗  我忍不住在想
You know, I can't help but think

374
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,430
这场闹剧其实
this whole mess is somehow...

375
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,130
有我的责任
partially my fault.

376
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,200
这就说得通了  本来我的生活完美无缺
It figures. Just when my life was perfect.

377
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,030
我的也是
Mine was, too.

378
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,440
但是现在我是15个孩子的爹了
But, hey, now I'm a father of 15.

379
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,040
真是天降的恩赐啊
Isn't that just a blessing?

380
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,350
慢着  你刚才说了什么  阿修
Wait. What'd you say, Felix?

381
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,550
真是天降的恩赐啊
Um, isn't that just a blessing?

382
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,150
不是  听起来很奇怪的那个
No, the weird sound thing.

383
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,620
咦噢天哪
Oh. Eeeee-oh-boy?

384
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,660
对  咦噢...
Yeah. Eee-oh...

385
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,020
抱歉  再说一遍
Sorry, say it again?

386
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,030
-咦噢天哪  -咦噢天哪
- Eeeee-oh-boy. - Eeeee-oh-boy!

387
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,160
-咦噢天哪  -咦天哪  再说一遍
- Eee-oh-boy! - Eee-boy! Say it again?

388
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,330
-咦噢天哪  -咦噢天哪
- Eeeee-oh-boy! - Eeeee-oh-boy.

389
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,670
-咦噢天哪  -易小子  易小子  易小子
- Eeeee-oh-boy... - Eboy! Eboy! Eboy!

390
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,770
-易小子  易小子  -易小子
- Eboy? Eboy? - Eboy.

391
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,500
没错
Yeah.

392
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,700
你在说什么  拉尔夫
Um, what are you getting at there, Ralph?

393
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,470
游戏厅的那个孩子
That kid out in the arcade

394
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,110
说网上可以买到方向盘配件
said there was a steering wheel part...

395
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,310
那个地方叫做易小子网还是...
on the Internet, it's something called eboy or...

396
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,710
易贝网  对  叫易贝网
eBay! That's it, it was eBay!

397
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,380
拉尔夫  你是想
Ralph, are you thinking about

398
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,720
去互联网里找那个配件吗
going to the Internet and finding that part?

399
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,850
只有找到那个配件
Getting that part's the only thing

400
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,750
才能修好游戏  也只有这样
that's gonna fix the game and that's the only thing

401
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,760
才能让凡妮洛普重新快乐起来
that's gonna make Vanellope happy again.

402
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,590
而且如果糖果竞速修好了
And if Sugar Rush is fixed,

403
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,720
那住在我家里的那些毁掉我理智的
all those lovable scamps living in my house...

404
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,130
可爱的小流氓
and destroying my sanity

405
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,560
就会再次拥有属于他们自己的家
will have homes of their own again!

406
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,670
拉尔夫  这是个重要的任务  一个崇高的使命
Ralph, this is an important mission. A noble mission!

407
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,670
我会照应好你的
I will cover for you.

408
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,600
谢了  兄弟
Thanks, pal.

409
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,270
拉尔夫  你的账单怎么办  根汁汽水的钱还没付
Ralph, what about your tab? You owe me for the root beer.

410
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,040
阿修会帮我付的
Oh, Felix is gonna cover for me.

411
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,440
各位  阿修请大家喝饮料
Drinks on the house, everybody! Felix is paying.

412
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,280
升龙拳
Shoryuken!

413
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,580
咦噢天哪
Eeeee-oh-boy.

414
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,460
拉尔夫  你怎么回事
Ralph, what is wrong with you?

415
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,790
准备好
Start churning butter

416
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,390
打点好行装  小妹儿
and put on your church shoes, little sister...

417
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,360
我们要出发了
'cause we're about to blast off!

418
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,570
你到底在说些什么
What are you even talking about?

419
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:20,640
我们要去互联网
Oh, we're going to the Internet.

420
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,570
什么
What?

421
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,400
没错  去找配件修好你的游戏

746
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,270
出售给出价最高的人
to the highest bidder. Ha-ha?

747
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,970
好吧  但是是这样的
Okay, but here's the thing...

748
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,040
我们需要好多好多钱
we need like a buttload of money.

749
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,480
你有没有能赚更多钱的物品
So, do you have any more lucrative items, maybe?

Thank you, buddy. You're such a nice guy.

754
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,290
四万元够赚钱了吗
Is $40,000 lucrative enough for you?

755
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,060
远远够了
It's more than enough.

756
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,990
我认识一个爱荷华州得梅因的人
I got a guy in Des Moines, Iowa...

757
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,900
愿意出四万买闪姐在一个
who will pay 40 grand for Shank's car...

758
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,600
叫屠戮赛车的游戏中用的车
from a game called Slaughter Race.

759
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,050
{\an8}闪姐的车  屠戮赛车

760
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,170
一辆赛车吗
A racing game?

761
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,140
没错  屠戮赛车是这里
That's right. Slaughter Race is the most popular

762
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,140
最火的线上赛车游戏
online racing game out there.

763
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,070
但是那非常危险
However, it is wicked dangerous.

764
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,480
我们不怕危险
We ain't afraid of danger.

765
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,480
这孩子是全世界最棒的赛车手
This kid's the best racer in the whole world.

766
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,510
我们绝对会给你搞到这辆车
We'll get you that car, no problemo.

769
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:40,420
{\an8}麦当劳得来速  踢掉篮子
24小时营业  麦当劳得来速

770
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:35,400
这个游戏真是太棒了
Okay, this game is kind of amazing.

771
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,200
细节部分处理得非常好
Meh, the attention to detail is pretty impressive.

772
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,300
我以前应该没有参加过
I don't think I've ever been in a game

773
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,540
有烟的游戏
with smog before.

774
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,670
-乖猫猫  乖猫猫  -慢着  慢着
- Nice kitty. Nice kitty. - Easy, boy. Easy.

775
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,650
我们赶紧找到闪姐的车离开这里吧
Let's just find Shank's car and get outta here.

776
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:55,450
同意
Agreed.

777
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,280
看  看
Look. Look.

778
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,160
在这里
There it is.

779
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,190
那辆车真是太棒了
That car is gorgeous.

780
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,160
难怪这么值钱
No wonder it's worth so much.

781
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,500
我的糖啊
Aw, sugar.

782
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,860
是玩家们  他们抢先一步
Players. They beat us to it.

783
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,300
连续玩了31小时
31 hours of continuous gameplay...

784
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,040
我们终于找到闪姐的车了
and we've finally found Shank's car.

785
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,970
来劫走这辆车吧
Let's jack this ride.

786
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,170
来吧  脏袜子  开始吧
Oh, yeah, DirtySocks, it's on.

787
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,180
吉姆  吉米
Jim! Jimmy?

788
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,080
你不会又在玩那个可怕的游戏了吧
You're not playing that horrible game again, are you?

789
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,310
没有  奶奶
No, Grandma!

790
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,650
我在做我的作业
I'm doing my homework.

791
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,180
好了  正如我所说
Okay, like I said...

792
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,620
来劫走这辆车吧
Let's jack this ride.

793
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,490
哎哟哟
Well, well, well.

794
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,500
山中无老虎  猴子称大王了
While the cat was away, these mice tried to play.

795
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,110
{\an3}闪姐
人称  公路女王

796
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,110
{\an7}技能  超快速度
         超级有型
         最爱武器  智慧

797
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,200
我觉得那可能是闪姐
Hey, I think that might be Shank.

798
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,700
听着  小猴子
Listen up, mice...

799
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,770
想动老虎座驾的人
anyone who tries to play with this cat's ride

800
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,280
都没有好下场
is gonna get got.

801
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,280
你完蛋了  闪姐
You're going down, Shank.

802
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,680
火仔  让这两个小子尝尝
Pyro. Give those punks the works.

803
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,190
非常乐意
With pleasure.

804
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,390
死于末路
End of the road!

805
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,560
该死  我们现在又要重头开始了
Gosh dang it! Now we gotta start all over.

806
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,130
拉尔夫  也许...
Ralph, maybe...

807
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,060
你要去哪里
Hey, where are you going?

808
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,230
我害怕
I am scared.

809
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,400
如果我们在这里被烧死了
If we get burned up in here,

810
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,700
那就完了  我们就死了  没了
that's it, we're dead, we're gone.

811
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,400
所以我觉得我们应该赶紧离开这里
So, I think we should get outta here right now.

812
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,240
不  等等  我有个主意
No, wait, wait. I have an idea.

813
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,740
闪姐
Hey, Shank?

814
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,310
怎么了  火仔
What's up, Pyro?

815
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,610
你有没有觉得我们对玩家有点
Um, do you ever reckon we're going a bit too hard

816
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,150
下手太重了
on the players?

817
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:38,180
说实在的  不觉得
Honestly, no, I don't.

818
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:42,190
当然了  我也同情像脏袜子537和宝贝拉姆林肯
Of course, I have empathy for players like DirtySocks537

819
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,190
这样的玩家
and BabeRaham_Linkin...

820
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,290
但如果我们让他们赢了
but if we just let them win,

821
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,590
那他们能得到什么教训呢
where's the life lesson? You know?

822
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,100
没错  但是火仔的意思是
Yeah, but to Pyro's point...

823
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,530
我是说  这些玩家那么努力来到这里
I mean, those players work so hard to get here.

824
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,300
我明白  小囚犯
I hear you, Felony...

825
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,470
但是你想象一下一个没有挑战的游戏
but imagine a game without challenges.

826
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,440
每一次都是预料之中的桥段
The same predictable thing every single time...

827
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,640
谁想要这样的
who wants that?

828
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,680
闪姐说得对
Shank's right.

829
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,750
我最近看了一段非常深刻的TED演讲
I just saw a really insightful TED talk...

830
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,780
我记不大清那家伙说了什么
and I can't really remember what the guy said.

831
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,820
重要的是他给我的感觉
It was more about how he made me feel.

832
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,320
但我觉得最终重点是
But I think, ultimately, the point was...

833
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,490
我尊重你们的旅途  伙计们
I honor your journeys, guys.

834
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,560
我们也尊重你的  屠夫小子
And we honor yours, Butcher Boy.

835
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,690
谢谢
Thank you.

836
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,690
闪姐
Hey, Shank,

837
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,490
你有没有想过如果真的有人得到你的车
did you ever wonder what it would be like...

838
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,360
我们会怎么样吗
if someone actually did get your car?

839
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,830
我只知道一件事
Well, I know one thing...

840
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,430
那个人必须得是强者中的强者
whoever does will have to be the best of the best.

841
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,110
日安  女士
Good day to you, madam.

842
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,310
你是谁
Who are you?

843
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:38,710
我是噪音管制所的
I'm here from the, uh, Department of Noise.

844
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,810
事实上  我们总部接到了
And the thing is, we've been getting some complaints

845
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,480
一些投诉
down at HQ.

846
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,420
接电话的是拉瑞
Uh, Larry's the one who takes the calls.

847
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,780
不管怎样  有人告诉拉瑞
Anyways, someone told Larry...

848
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,120
我们听到了很多
that we've been hearing a lot of

849
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,520
枪声和尖叫声
gun sounds and screaming sounds...

850
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,490
还有什么什么的  之类的
and what-have-you. That sort of thing.

851
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:53,790
这真是太棒了
Whoa! This is nice.

852
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:58,230
我怎么到现在才遇到你
Where have you been all my life?

853
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,330
所以我来查看一下
Uh, so I came to check on things.

854
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,900
抱歉  你刚刚说你是谁来着
Oh, I'm sorry, who did you say you were again?

855
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,370
我是拉瑞
Oh, I'm Larry?

856
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,300
你说是拉瑞接的电话
Uh, you said Larry took the call.

857
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,650
干得好  拉瑞
Good job, Larry!

858
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,150
没错  简直是风驰电掣
Yeah, worked like a charm!

859
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,360
这是在逗我吗  有人开走了闪姐的车吗
Are you kidding me? Someone got Shank's car?

860
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,230
我需要你的车  抱歉
And I need yours. Sorry.

861
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,530
我...我自己走
I'm just... I'm just gonna go.

862
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
今天真是我最惨的一天
This is the worst day of my life!

863
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,370
可惜我们这么快就要离开了
It's a shame we have to leave so soon.

864
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,910
这游戏真是太棒了
This game is cool.

865
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:42,940
赶紧带我们离开这里
Just get us out of here

866
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,210
把这辆车交给斯帕姆利  拿到钱
so we can get this car to Spamley and get paid.

867
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,450
没问题
No problem.

868
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,690
看看这家伙的势头
Look at this guy coming in hot.

869
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,700
敢惹公牛  小心牛角  小家伙
You mess with the bull, you get the horns, little girl!

870
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,880
你还是有价值的  屠夫小子
You still have value, Butcher Boy.

871
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,610
不  是那个闪姐
Oh, no! It's that Shank lady.

872
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,920
她看上去很生气
She looks upset.

873
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,220
别担心  我来甩掉她
Ah, don't worry, I'll lose her.

874
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,400
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

875
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,900
小鬼  回到路上  我的饼干要撒了
Kid, get back on the track. I'm gonna lose my cookies.

876
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,240
没有什么路  我想开到哪里都行
There is no track. I can drive anywhere.

877
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,920
小鬼  她就在我们后面
Oh, kid, she's coming up right behind us.

878
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,290
你好
Oh, hello!

879
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:02,290
我想你们手上有属于我的东西
I believe you have something of mine.

880
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,690
有种来拿吧
Yeah, come and get it.

881
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,740
小丫头挺会开啊
This girl can drive.

882
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,050
你能不能快点甩掉她
Would you hurry up and lose her?

883
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:33,960
我在努力
I'm trying!

884
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,860
抓稳了  大块头
Hang on, chumbo!

885
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,770
我不喜欢这样
I don't like this!

886
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,650
妈妈咪呀  这位女士真会开啊
Whoa! Mother Hubbard, this lady can really drive.

887
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,510
小鬼  火  你看到火了吗
Kid, fire! Do you see the fire?

888
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,680
死路  死路
Dead end! Dead end!

889
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,350
对我来说不是  再见  闪姐
Not for me. Bye-bye, Shanky.

890
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,760
这才对
That's the stuff.

891
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,860
好样的  小鬼
Good job, kid.

892
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,690
感觉我又找回自己了
Oh, yeah, I feel like me again.

893
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,700
径直冲向出口
One exit straight ahead.

894
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,550
你可别想这么轻松甩掉我
You're not gonna lose me that easy.

895
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,850
你怎么...
How did you...?

896
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,380
你最好还是看着点路
Uh, you might wanna keep your eyes on the road.

897
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,650
小鬼
Kid!

898
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:51,600
噪音管制所  从我的车上下来
Yo, Department of Noise, get out of my car!

899
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,030
天啊  我们怎么办
Oh, man, what are we gonna do?

900
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,930
你坐着别动  别慌
You just stay put, don't panic.

901
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,100
我去和她谈谈
I'm gonna talk to her.

902
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,640
拉尔夫  小心点
Ralph, be careful.

903
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,710
没事的  这是英雄该做的事
It's fine. This is what heroes do.

904
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,880
我的屁股卡住了
My bottom is stuck.

905
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,550
这辆车对大块头不友好
This car is not designed for a big boy.

906
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,420
可不是  你好
I'll tell you that. Hi.

907
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,920
你们真的觉得能这么轻松地偷我的车吗
You guys really thought you could just steal my car?

908
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,460
让我来告诉你接下来会发生什么事
Well, let me tell you what's gonna happen now.

909
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,060
不  等等  我们不是普通的偷车贼
No, wait, listen. We aren't normally car thieves.

910
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,560
我的这个朋友是一名糖果卡丁车赛车手
My friend here, she's a candy kart racer.

911
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,560
你真该看看她驾驶着
You should see her racing around

912
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,400
我们一起造的饼干快车
her sweet little track...

913
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,870
在她的糖果赛道上飙车的样子
in her cookie wafer car we built together.

914
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,710
事实上  她的完美小游戏崩溃了
And, well, the thing is, her perfect little game broke...

915
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,710
那都是我的错
and it was my fault...

916
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,880
我们是想要修好那个游戏
so we're here to try to fix it...

917
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,050
我们需要钱
and we need money to do that,

918
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,780
有人提出要雇我们
and someone was gonna pay us money...

919
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,480
-偷你的车...  -好吧  好吧
- to steal your car... - Okay, okay.

920
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,520
-于是我们答应了  -你别哭了
- ...and so we took it. - You can stop crying.

921
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,490
不过我要赞赏你对脆弱的完美表现
Though I do respect your wonderful display of vulnerability.

922
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:49,190
谢谢
Thank you.

923
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,090
我知道了  真的
I get it, I do.

924
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,630
对我们来说  友谊也意味着一切
Friendship is everything to us, too.

925
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,960
-对吧  伙计们  -没错  我们就是一家人
- Right, guys? - Word. We're like family.

926
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,800
那真是太棒了
That's really great.

927
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,800
那是说我们能开走你的车了吗
So, does this mean we can keep your car?

928
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,800
当然不行  但我想要帮你们
Absolutely not. But I do want to help.

929
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,970
你带了手机吗
Hey, you got your phone on you?

930
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:06,110
-你懂的  -我们来拍一段
- You know it. - Let's make a video.

931
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,210
火仔  用吹飞给这个大块头试试
Pyro, hit big boy with the blow and go.

932
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,480
非常乐意
I'd love to.

933
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,780
等等  什么是
Wait. What's the...?

934
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,580
你们干什么
What are you doing?

935
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,780
说点什么  你的第一反应
Say something, first thing that comes to your mind.

936
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,120
我要砸个稀巴烂
I'm gonna wreck it!

937
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,220
很好  好了  关掉
Good. All right. Turn it off.

938
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,600
你们这是干什么
What the heck did you do that for?

939
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:29,160
互联网上有很多比偷车更好的
There are much better ways to make money on the Internet

940
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,860
赚钱方法
than stealing cars...

941
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:34,030
比如成为优分享的明星
such as becoming a BuzzzTube star.

942
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,870
我应该知道那是什么吗
Am I supposed to know what that is?

943
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,110
拜托  人人都知道优分享
Oh, come on. Everybody knows BuzzzTube.

944
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,040
这可是著名的视频分享网站
It's the video-sharing site.

945
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,740
我在给你注册账号
I'm just starting your account...

946
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,080
好了
All right, there you go.

947
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,850
如果这段视频红了  你能赚一大笔钱
If this thing goes viral, you can make a lot of money.

948
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,950
我有个朋友  她叫赞姐
A friend of mine, chick named Yesss...

949
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,850
她是那里的首席算法
she's the head algorithm over there.

950
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,220
跟她说是我让你去的
Tell her I sent you.

951
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,690
赞姐会帮你牵线的
Yesss will hook you up.

952
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,890
你真是太好了
Wow, that's really nice of you.

953
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,860
我可不敢确定是不是该说她"好"
I'm not sure if "Nice" Is the right word.

954
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,760
谢谢你
Well, thank you.

955
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,130
我才应该谢谢你  小妹妹
I should be thanking you, little sister.

956
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,700
刚刚的赛车太好玩了
That race was fun.

957
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,140
再次谢谢你
Well, thank you again.

958
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,000
你知道...
Uh... You know...

959
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,900
既然我们在闲聊了  你刚刚用了什么招数
While we're talking shop, what move did you do

960
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,840
穿过了那个起火的隧道
to get through that tunnel of fire?

961
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,540
是漂移起跳加加速飘逸  还是...
Was it a power drift into a drift jump, maybe, or...?

962
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,080
也许吧
Maybe.

963
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,180
如果你想回来再赛一场
If you ever wanna come back for a rematch...

964
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,080
我很乐意再打败你一次
I'd be happy to kick your butt again.

965
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,280
再见
See you.

966
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,030
臭显摆
Show-off.

967
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,770
天啊  那地方真可怕
Man, oh, man, that place was scary.

{\an8}屠戮赛车
一旦加入  后果自负

969
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,940
我知道  好激动啊
I know. It was so exciting!

970
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,840
不  激动是会让你笑的
No, exciting is when you smile.

971
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,570
可怕是会让你加紧屁股的
Scary is when you clench your butt,

972
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,210
我的屁股现在还夹着呢
and my butt is still clenched.

973
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,250
拜托  难道你真的觉得
Oh, come on, are you honestly telling me...

974
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,580
那个闪姐不是你见过最酷的人吗
that Shank lady wasn't the coolest person you ever met?

975
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,090
酷  你说说她哪里酷了
Cool? Name one cool thing about her.

976
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,590
我想想  她看上去很酷  说话很酷
Um, let's see, she looks cool, she talks cool...

977
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,760
她开车很酷  发型很酷  车很酷
she drives cool, her hair is cool, her car is cool...

978
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,930
等等  你是说我的头发不酷吗
Wait a minute, are you saying my hair isn't cool?

979
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:09,160
什么  不  我只是说那游戏是另一个档次的
What? No! I'm just saying the game was next-level.

980
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,770
没有人会告诉你该怎么做  或者该去哪里
There was no one telling you what to do or where to go.

981
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:14,100
你要去哪里呢
Hey, just where do you think you're going?

982
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:13,970
{\an9}聚集你的社交网络

To BuzzzTube. It's this way.

984
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,270
不不不  我们要回去找斯帕姆利
No, no, no. We're going back to Spamley's.

985
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,270
他会给我们点简单的活
He can give us some easier loot to find.

986
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,110
不  我们得去找闪姐的朋友
No, we're supposed to see Shank's friend.

987
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,680
拜托  我一点都不信任那个闪姐
Oh, come on. I don't trust that Shank one bit.

988
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,880
-我信任  -我...
- Well, I do. - Well, I...

989
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,820
-你好  先生  -你是谁
- Hello, mister. - Who are you?

我是你友善的易贝提醒信使
I'm your friendly ebay alert messenger.

991
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,950
活生生的易小子
Huh. An actual eboy.

992
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,320
我只是来提醒你你的出价还有八小时过期
Just here to let you know your bid expires in eight hours.

993
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:40,630
八小时  谢谢你  易小子
Eight hours. Okay, thanks, eboy.

994
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,260
加油  杰克森
You got it, Jackson!

995
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:46,170
大块头  如果我们找斯帕姆利一点点赚钱
Chumbo, if we nickel-and-dime it with Spamley...

996
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:48,000
那得花上20年
it will take 20 years

997
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,770
才能凑够钱买方向盘
to make enough money to buy the wheel.

998
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:52,840
好吧  那就听你的
All right, fine. We'll do it your way.

999
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,670
但是我告诉你  去那个什么优分享
But I'm telling you right now, that BuzzzTube place

1000
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,980
绝对是个糟糕的主意
is a terrible idea.

1001
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:06,020
{\an8}心动系列

1002
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:06,820
天啊  这里有各种各样的视频
Man, there are all kinds of videos in here.

1003
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:06,020
{\an8}牛逼

1004
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,290
是啊  如果你喜欢小宝宝和猫咪的话
Yeah, if you like babies and cats.

1005
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:11,160
-看  那是你  -对
- Look, there's you! - Oh, yeah.

1006
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,660
我要砸个稀巴烂
I'm gonna wreck it!

1007
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,030
不知道这些小家伙
I wonder why those little guys

1008
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,800
为什么要给你的视频心心
are giving your video all those hearts?

1009
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,030
显然是因为他们爱我
Because obviously they love me.

1010
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,270
我就说来这里是个好主意
I told you this place was a good idea.

1011
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:24,140
是啊  臭屁虫
Yeah, sure you did, doof.

1012
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,710
我们要去找谁商量酬劳的事来着
Now, who we supposed to see about getting paid again?

1013
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:30,010
首席算法  她叫赞姐
The head algorithm. Her name is Yesss.

1014
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:32,050
不要  不要  不要
No. No. No.

1015
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,320
毫无新意  老套
Uninspired, cliched...

1016
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,220
优兔上已经有这个了
Ugh! YouTube's got this one.

1017
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,920
楚巴卡老爹  认真的吗
Chewbacca Dad? Really?

1018
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,160
没错  就像楚巴卡老妈  只不过是老爹
Yeah, it's like Chewbacca Mom, but it's a daddy.

1019
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,690
不要
No!

1020
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:47,790
你好  你是首席酸发吗
Heyo! Are you the head of Al Gore?

1021
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,700
我是优分享的首席算法
I am the head algorithm of BuzzzTube...

1022
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,400
也就是说是网络上
which means I curate the content...

1023
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,270
最火的视频分享网站的馆长
at the Internet's most popular video-sharing site.

1024
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,040
也就是说我没时间
Which means, I don't have time to trifle...

1025
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,670
和每一个不穿鞋子大口喘气  贸贸然
with every shoeless, mouth-breathing hobo

1026
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,940
闯进我办公室的流浪汉闲扯
that trundles into my office.

1027
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,340
叫保安  可能仔
Call security, Maybe.

1028
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:07,050
好的  但是  赞姐  这就是那个吹叶机男
Yes. But, Yesss, this is the leaf blower guy.

1029
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:08,220
谁
Who?

1030
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,850
那个下巴乱鼓的家伙
The man with the undulating jowls.

1031
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,250
所以呢
So?

1032
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:13,720
他的视频有一百三十万颗心
His video has 1.3 million hearts.

1033
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:17,920
你为什么不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me

1034
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,890
眼前这位可是一位大天才
I was in the presence of a genius?

1035
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,330
给他来杯喝的
Grab him a drink.

1036
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:22,930
但是那个叫闪姐的女士
Yeah, this lady named Shank...

1037
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,230
这段视频是她拍的
she actually made the video.

1038
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,400
是她要我们来找你的
She's the one who told us to come see you.

1039
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,740
难怪你的视频这么潮
No wonder your video's so dope.

1040
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,370
闪姐是真的很酷
Shank is for real cool.

1041
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:31,740
对吧
Right?

1042
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,110
她才不是
She is not.

1043
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,080
我才是那个得到爱心的酷家伙
I'm the cool one getting all the hearts.

1044
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,080
没错  大宝贝
Well, that's right, you big baby.

1045
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,110
没错
Yeah.

1046
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,280
你刚刚说你叫什么来着
Um, what'd you say your name was?

1047
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,950
拉尔夫  破坏王拉尔夫
Ralph, Wreck-It Ralph.

1048
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:46,220
破坏王拉尔夫  你红了
Well, Wreck-It Ralph, you are trending!

1049
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:50,220
这些是给你的  爱心  爱心  爱心
And these are for you. Hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts.

1050
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,830
-爱心  爱心  爱心  -爱心  爱心
- Hearts, hearts, hearts! - Hearts, hearts, hearts!

1051
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:52,960
没错  爱心
Yes! Hearts!

1052
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,970
虽然我不想破坏
Uh, not to buzzkill the lovefest

1053
00:44:57,970 --> 00:44:59,730
你们之间浓郁的爱意
you guys got going on here...

1054
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,300
但是闪姐好像告诉我们
but Shank kinda told us that

1055
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,770
红了的视频能赚到真的钱
viral videos can make, like, actual money?

1056
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,840
爱心就是钱  亲爱的
Oh, hearts are money, honey.

1057
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,040
你们的优账户能把爱心转化为钱
Your Buzzzy account converts hearts into dollars.

1058
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:12,250
$43,000!

1059
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:15,220
小鬼  我们只需要27001元  我们成功了
Kid, we only needed $27,001. We're done.

1060
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:18,150
不不不
Oh, no, no, no.

1061
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:20,120
那是43元
That's $43.

1062
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:24,160
43元  那还不到一半呢
43? That's not even half of 27,001.

1063
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,460
我们只剩下八小时能用来拯救我的游戏了
And we only have eight hours left to save my game.

1064
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,400
虽然我也不想这么说  但那是不可能的了
Ugh. Well, I hate to say it, but that ain't happening.

1065
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,100
你的视频没人气了
Your video is tapped out.

1066
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,530
但我不是宏了吗
But I thought I was trenching?

1067
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,070
红了
Trending.

1068
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,240
是的  但那是15秒之前的事了
You were. But that was 15 seconds ago.

1069
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,210
现在你不红了
Now, you're not.

1070
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:40,010
还是谢谢你们专程过来
Thanks for stopping by, though.

1071
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,310
我们怎么办  小鬼
What are we gonna do, kid?

1072
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,250
好了  我有个主意  听我说
All right, pal, I have an idea. And hear me out.

1073
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,480
不如我们回到屠戮赛车
What if we go back to Slaughter Race

1074
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,690
我让闪姐好好...
and I ask Shank really...

1075
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:56,020
不不不  我们不要再回到那个死亡陷阱
No, no, no. We're not going back to that death trap.

1076
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:58,260
赞姐  如果我给你拍一堆视频...
Yesss, what if I made you a whole bunch of videos...

1077
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,900
都是我做各种各样疯狂的事
of me doing all kinds of them crazy things?

1078
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,530
你是说轰炸市场吗
You mean saturate the market?

1079
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:05,030
那会让你迅速得到好多心
That could get you a lot of hearts fast.

1080
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:06,270
你有没有好好地考虑过
Have you thought this through at all?

1081
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:09,070
你打算在视频中都做些什么
What do you plan on even doing in these videos?

1082
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:11,370
我就模仿流行的
I'll just copy whatever's popular.

1083
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:13,980
天才  可能仔  现在什么最流行
Genius. Yo, Maybe, what's trending right now?

1084
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,180
我们来看看
Mmm-hmm. Let's have a lookie-lookie.

1085
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,250
一如既往  人体受伤排第一
As usual, human suffering is number one...

1086
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:21,220
接下来是吃辣椒挑战
followed by hot pepper eating challenges...

1087
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,920
街机直播
video game walkthroughs...

1088
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,350
尖叫山羊又流行起来了
oh, screaming goats are back...

1089
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:27,460
拆箱视频  烹饪短片  化妆教程
unboxings, cooking demos, makeup tutorials...

1090
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:30,460
最后是  蜜蜂双关语
and lastly, ugh, bee puns.

1091
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:33,000
我们来做蜜友吧
Let's "Bee" Friends.

1092
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,330
已经连着两周了
Two weeks in a row, guys.

1093
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:38,330
十四天的蜜蜂双关语啊
That's a fortnight of bee puns.

1094
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:41,170
他才不说蜜蜂双关语呢  配不上你
He won't be doing any bee puns. They're beneath you.

1095
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:43,940
我要说蜜蜂双关语  我要说
Oh, I'm doing a bee pun. Oh, yes, I am.

1096
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,910
我要吃辣椒  我要化妆
And I'm eating a hot pepper, and I'm putting on makeup...

1097
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:48,340
要做什么都行
and whatever else it takes!

1098
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:51,050
因为  小鬼  我们是来拯救你的游戏的
Because, kid, we came here to save your game

1099
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,350
我们要这么做

1124
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,180
今天要做魔鬼椒挑战
with the ghost pepper challenge.

1125
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,880
应该会很辣吧  我们来看看
Supposed to be spicy. We'll see about that.

1126
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,150
也不是很...
Mmm. That's not so...

1127
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:02,420
好辣  停下来
Oh, it's very hot! Oh, make it stop!

1131

乔西
Hey, Josey,

1132
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:09,560
你看过辣椒挑战的了吗
did you see the pepper challenge?

1133
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,660
还没有
Oh, not yet.

1134
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:13,130
我在看他嘬嘴唇的那段
I'm watching the one where he just smacks his lips.

1135
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:14,500
好恶心
It's disgusting.

1136
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,960
不要真的画出一条线
You don't want any real hard lines.

1137
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:18,400
要抹均匀  像这样
You just want to blend that out there, like this...

1138
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,300
这样  朋友
And that, my friends,

1139

才能画出完美的猫眼妆
is how you achieve the perfect cat eye.

1140
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,630
我总是先来一段乡村舞步
I always start with the hootnanny.

1141
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:27,640
然后牙线步
Shift it into a floss.

1142
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,010
最后以热辣马拉特结尾
And now I finish with a hot Marat. Huh? Huh?

1143
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,550
跟着我来
Follow along with me,

1144
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:36,320
然后我要给这片小云画一个朋友
and I'm gonna give this little cloud a little friend...

1145
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,090
一棵树
in the form of a tree.

1146
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:39,390
人人都需要朋友
Everybody needs a friend.

1147
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:42,520
看看那些家伙
Look at these guys.

1148
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:44,490
看看那个  谁在他的耳朵下
Look at this one, sleeping under his ear.

1149
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,700
你们这群小土豆  醒醒
You couch potatoes. Wake up.

1150
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:49,660
我们已经把温度设在950
We've been baking at about 950 degrees

1151
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,170
烤了6个小时
now for six hours...

1152
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,670
所以应该已经考好了
so she should be ready.

1153
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,040
看  烤糊的派
Voila! Burnt pie!

1154
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,510
我们来吹一下
Let's have a little whiff of this here.

1155
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:00,380
我的头发  我的头发
My hair, my hair! My hair!

1156
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:03,250
这家伙着火了
This man is on fire.

1157
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,350
字面上和象征意义上都火了
Literal and figurative fire.

1158
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:07,220
但他还需要在接下来五小时内
But he still needs 200 million hearts

1159
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,650
集齐两亿颗爱心
in the next five hours...

1160
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,650
不然这个可人的孩子就会失去她的游戏
or this beautiful child loses her game.

1161
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:13,160
所以我要进行第二阶段
That's why I'm on to phase two...

1162
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,660

Yesss, can I be a pop-up?

1178
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:59,400
我不知道  你能烦人到讨厌吗
I don't know. Can you be annoyingly aggressive?

1179
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,240
我不知道  我能吗  能吗  能吗
I don't know. Can I? Can I? Can I?

Oh, yes, you're perfect. Here.

1182
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,210
谢谢
Thank you!

1183
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:10,350
你要去的话  我也要去
If you're going, I wanna go.

1184
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:13,780
不  宝贝  你得留在这里  当我的电影明星
No, baby, you've got to stay here and be my movie star.

1185
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:17,090
什么  不不不  我和这孩子就像鞋和袜
What? No, no, no. Me and the kid are like shoes and socks.

1186
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,450
或者花生黄油和培根
Or peanut butter and bacon.

1187
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,260
离开对方就无法存活
One cannot exist without the other.

1188
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,520
来吧  小鬼  告诉她
Go on, kid, tell her.

1189
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:22,490
没错
It's true.

1190
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:26,060
事实上  正是因为如此  所以我们
In fact, it's so true that we will be fine

1191
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:28,130
分开一小会儿也没事的
if we're apart for a minute.

1192
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:30,630
拜托  伙计  我们要拯救的是我的游戏
Come on, pal. It's my game we're trying to save.

1193
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,240
我只是也想去做出点贡献
I just wanna get out there and be useful.

1194
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:34,270
但是不带我吗
But without me?

1195
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:36,300
万一你迷路了呢  你只是个小鬼
What if you get lost? You're just a kid.

1196
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:38,470
你就是个成熟的大人吗
Oh, and you're some mature adult?

1197
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,480
我更大
Well, I'm bigger.

1198
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,410
别这么没安全感  大家伙
Don't be insecure, big fella.

1199
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:44,710
她不会迷路的  我保证
She's not gonna get lost. I promise.

1200
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,480
她会乘坐我的专用网络浏览器
She'll be in my personal web browser.

1201
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:51,120
而且你的应用上还有优享视频
And your app comes with BuzzzFace...

1202
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,320
所以不管她在互联网何方  你都能联系到她
so you can keep in touch anywhere on the Internet.

1203
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,160
看  我不会有事的
See, I'll be fine.

1204
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,060
我知道  我只是...
I know, I just...

1205
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:03,700
我们六年没有分开过了
We haven't been apart in like six years.

1206
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,600
我会想你的
I'm going to miss you.

1207
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,500
你也不会有事的
You'll be fine, too.

1208
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:10,270
你的视频得到的爱心越多
The more hearts your videos get,

1209
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:12,240
我们就能越快买到方向盘
the faster we'll get the wheel.

1210
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,840
然后我们就能回家了
And then we can go home.

1211
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:15,380
看  我们到了明天这时候
Look, we'll be celebrating

1212
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,610
就能在超级酒保的店里庆祝了
at Tapper's this time tomorrow, buddy.

1213
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,520
好吧  我想你说得对
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1214
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:22,790
再见
Bye!

1215
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:25,620
小心点  别傻乎乎的
Be careful, huh? Don't be a dummy.

1216
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:31,530
你要把她送到哪里
So where exactly are you sending her?

1217
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:33,800
既然糖果女孩来自街机游戏
Since candy girl comes from an arcade game...

1218
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,470
我觉得把她送到游戏区不错
I'm thinking she'd be good in the gaming district.

1219
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:38,320
{\an8}游戏区
屠戮赛车

1220
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,870
不行不行  这是个坏主意
Oh, no, no, no, no. Bad idea.

1221
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:41,500
那些游戏很危险  会侵蚀你的脑子
Those games are dangerous, and they rot your brain.

1222
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:42,810
我们不如把她送到一些
Why don't we send her somewhere

1223
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:45,470
跟那里完全不一样的地方
a little more totally different than that...

1224
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,880
离那里非常远
and nowhere near there?

1225
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,150
我们来看看  家庭型乐园
Let's see. Family Friendly Fansites.

1226
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,380
听起来很安全  她严格来说也是一名公主
That sounds safe, and she is technically a princess...

1227
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,420
那不如就送到这个
so how about this one here

1228
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,850
粉色的小城堡吧
with the sweet little pink castle?

1229
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:58,020
没问题
I love it.

1230
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:01,930
那我就将我们的新任弹窗员送到我的迪士尼网
Okay, I'll redirect our newest pop-up to OhMyDisney.Com.

1231
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,020
{\an8}我的迪士尼

1232
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,870
上帝啊  这地方太闪了

"Smart, funny, kind, or brave."

1244
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,700

Kind, I guess?

1245
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,740
根据你的回答  你的公主闺蜜是

红骷髅象征着世界树

世界树是智慧和命运的守护者

1255
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:12,800
我们大家都认为  先生
Are we to believe, sir,

1268
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:38,270
你的弹窗有许可吗
Hey, do you have a permit for that pop-up?

1269
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:40,790

你看到一个小孩往这里跑了吗
Did you see a kid come through here?

1278
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,480
她像只无头母鸡似的冲了进来
She came running through here like a headless hen.

1279
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:08,520
找到她了吗
Any sign of her?

1280
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,820
没有  也许她去飞狗巴迪区了

你们好
Uh, hi!

1284
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,700
女士们  我可以解释
Whoa, whoa. Ladies, I can explain.

1285
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:30,670
我也是一名公主
See, I'm a princess, too.

1286
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,510

好味糍糖果竞速的
Princess Vanellope Von Schweetz...

1288
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:37,480
凡妮洛普·冯·好味糍公主
of the, uh, Sugar Rush Von Schweetzes.

1289
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,780
你们肯定听说过我们
I'm sure you've heard of us.

1290
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,980
要是没听说过的话就太尴尬了
It'd be embarrassing for you if you haven't.

1291
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:44,450
你是哪种公主
Huh. What kind of a princess are you?

1292
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,620
哪种
What kind?

1293
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,460
-你有魔法长发吗  -没有
- Do you have magic hair? - No.

1294
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,060
-有魔力的双手吗  -没有

1295
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:51,330
-动物们会和你说话吗  -不会

- Kidnapped or enslaved? - No!

1299
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:57,030
你们没事吧  我要报警吗
Are you guys okay? Should I call the police?

1300
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,570
那我认为你应该
Then I have to assume you made a deal

1301
00:54:58,570 --> 00:54:59,970
和一个深海女巫达成过协议
with an underwater sea witch...

1302
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:00,870
她夺走你的声音
where she took your voice

1303
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:03,370
给你换取一对人足吧
in exchange for a pair of human legs?

1304
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,740
没有  天啊  谁会这么做
No! Good Lord, who would do that?

1305
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:07,340
你有过真爱之吻吗
Have you ever had True Love's Kiss?

1306
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:08,610
呕
Ew! Barf!

1307
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:09,750
你和你爸爸之间有问题吗
Do you have daddy issues?

1308
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:11,010
我连妈妈都没有
I don't even have a mom.

1309
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,820
我们也没有
Neither do we!

1310
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:15,350
接下来就是最重要的问题
And now for the million-dollar question.

1311
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:17,850
人们是不是认为你的所有问题都是因为
Do people assume all your problems got solved

1312
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,760
一个强壮高大的男子出现而解决的
because a big strong man showed up?

1313
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,890
是的  这又怎么了
Yes! What is up with that?

1314
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:23,490
她的确是公主
She is a princess!

1315
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,600
你的礼服是谁设计的
Who made your gown?

1316
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,430
我从来没见过这样的礼服
I've never seen anything quite like it.

1317
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:29,730
这件旧衣服吗
Oh, this old thing?

1318
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,600
我也真想拥有一件
Oh, I'd so love to have one of my own.

1319
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,700
-我也是  -我也是
- As would I. - Me too!

1320
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,500
-好棒哦  -最佳着装了
- So cool. - Best outfit ever!

1321
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:35,670
我也想要一件  姐妹们
Ooh! I want one, too, you guys!

1322
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:37,080
我让我的小老鼠们去做
I'll get my mice on this.

1323
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:42,580
这就是爱
So this is love.

1324
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:46,950
舒适女王  凡妮洛普公主万岁
All hail Princess Vanellope, the queen of comfy!

1325
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:48,920
凡妮洛普
Yay, Vanellope!

1326
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,720
这世上有这么多美妙的东西
Of all the thingamabobs in this entire world...

1327
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,890
但我从来没想到我会穿上真正的...
I never thought I'd get to wear a real...

1328
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:55,390
这叫什么来着
what's it called again?

1329
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:57,830
对了  短袖
Oh, yeah. Shirt.

1330
00:55:57,830 --> 00:56:01,730
*我曾梦想我会穿上短袖*
*I once had a dream that I might wear a shirt*

1331
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:04,430
等等  怎么回事
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait! What's going on?

1332
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,940
她在唱歌
Uh, she's singing.

1333
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,110
但是还有音乐和聚光灯
Yeah, but there was like music and a spotlight.

1334
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:10,940
等等  你们都看到了  对吧
Wait, you all saw it too, right?

1335
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:14,440
当公主们开始歌唱自己的梦想时就会这样
That's what happens when a princess sings about her dreams.

1336
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:17,750
我就从来没有过  一次都没有
Oh, that's never happened to me. I mean, not even once.

1337
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,650
你不如来试试
Why don't you give it a try?

1338
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:22,620
你真正想要的是什么  唱出来
What is it you really want? Sing about that.

1339
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,090
好吧
Okay. Uh, sure.

1340
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,820
我可以做到的  我们来试试
Huh. I could do that. Um, let's see.

1341
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:32,630
*方向盘啊  方向盘啊*
*Oh, steering wheel Oh, steering wheel*

1342
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:36,070
*没错  我想要一个方向盘*
*Oh, yes I want a steering wheel*

1343
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:42,380
有点一言难尽
Well, there is a lot to unpack here.

1344
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:45,110
你唱的这个方向盘
So, this steering wheel you sing of,

1345
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,710
是一种比喻吗
that's a metaphor?

1346
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,910
不不不  那不是比喻  我就是...
Oh, no, no, no, it's not a metaphor. I just...

1347
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:51,510
我真的想要一个方向盘
I literally want a steering wheel.

1348
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,720
我觉得问题在于我的音有点不准
I think the issue is I was a little pitchy.

1349
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,150
也许吧
Maybe a little.

1350
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:58,560
但是有时候你得找到一个
But sometimes your song can't start...

1351
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:01,690
能倒映出自己的地方  才能开始唱
until you go someplace to reflect.

1352
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:03,160
我们有的公主
What works for some of us...

1353
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:06,770
是找到水  盯着自己的倒影
is finding a form of water and staring at it.

1354
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:08,800
什么
What?

1355
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,140
是的  我喜欢看着许愿池
Oh, yes, I like to stare at a wishing well!

1356
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:12,540
我看着大海
I stare at the ocean.

1357
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:13,700
马槽的水
Horse trough.

1358
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:14,840
肥皂泡
Soap bubbles!

1359
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,540
等等  你们是说如果我盯着水
Wait, you're saying if I just stare at some water...

1360
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:20,010
很重要的水
Uh, important water.

1361
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:22,850
当然了  "很重要的水"
Right. Of course. "Important water."

1362
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:25,180
我盯着很重要的水
I stare at the important water...

1363
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:28,520
我不知怎么的就会魔力般开始歌唱我的梦想
and somehow magically I'll start singing about my dream?

1364
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,590
当然了
For sure.

1365
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:32,190
我觉得还是算了吧  女士们  但还是谢谢你们了
Uh, yeah, I don't think so, ladies, but thanks.

1366
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:35,590
还有五分钟  公主们
Five minutes, Princesses.

1367
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:38,200

拉尔夫  你去哪里

1414
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:22,170
一只猫咪

这是什么地方

1425
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,230

1426

"破坏王拉尔夫回来了"
"Wreck-It Ralph is back."

1427
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:58,670
他们在说我呢

1428
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:01,740
天啊  互联网还真是积极
Gee whiz, the Internet is so positive.

1429
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:04,280
"快手阿修是我最喜欢的游戏"
"Fix-It Felix, Jr. Was my favorite game."

1430
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,040

1431
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:08,080
"拉尔夫的视频烂爆了"
"Ralph's videos stink."

1432
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,010

"Just a worthless bum, alone on a pile of bricks."

1438
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:37,140
拉尔夫  你在这里啊
Yo, Ralph, you in here, dude?

1439
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:38,740
我得给你看看
Hey, I got to show you...

1440
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:44,050
互联网第一条规则
First rule of the Internet...

1441
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:46,950
不要看评论
do not read the comments.

1442
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:48,190
我早该告诉你的
I should have told you that.

1443
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,460
听着
Look.

1444
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:53,760
这个地方会激发有些人最黑暗的本质
This place can bring out the worst in some people...

1445
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,360
但是你应该无视掉这一切
but you gotta ignore all this.

1446
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,760
这和你无关  拉尔夫  这是他们的问题
This isn't about you, Ralph. It's about them.

1447
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,760
我不在乎  没关系
I don't care. It's fine.

1448
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:05,240
人们一直因为我是个坏人而讨厌我
People hated me my whole life for being the bad guy.

1449
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:07,970
这只是提醒我
It's just a good reminder

1450
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:09,340
这是对我来说
that this is the only heart

1451
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,020
唯一重要的爱心
that really matters.

1452
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,780
凡妮洛普给我的
Vanellope gave me this...

1453
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:14,210
只要她还喜欢我
and as long as she likes me...

1454
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:16,050
我不需要任何人
I don't need anybody else.

1455
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:17,720
我当然也不需要互联网
And I sure don't need the Internet.

1456
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,180
等等
Hold on.

1457
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:21,220
也没有那么糟糕
It's not all bad.

1458
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:23,220
互联网也能是一个
The Internet can also be a place...

1459
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,720
让你在一个网站上找到一个方向盘
where you find a steering wheel at one website...

1460
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:29,060
并赚到足够的钱买下来的地方
and make enough money to buy it at another one.

1461
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,200
恭喜你  拉尔夫  你成功了吗
Congratulations, Ralph. You did it.

1462
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,460
等等  真的吗
Wait, really?

1463
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:34,830
是的  你看看你的优账户
Yes, check your Buzzzy account.

1464

你需要两万七  你筹到了三万多
You needed 27K, you got over 30 grand!

1465
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,040
我的天啊
Oh, my gosh!

1466
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,470
真是太棒了
This is great!

Thank you, Yesss. I couldn't have done it without you!

1468
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:43,810
你说得没错
That's really true.

1469
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:45,240
易小子
Hey, eboy?

1470
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:46,810
你需要什么  大王
What do you need, ace?

1471
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:48,380
能载我一程吗
Can you give me a ride?

1472
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:50,450
来吧  卡西迪
Let's hop along, Cassidy.

1473
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:54,190
来吧  我的歌  来吧
Come on, song, come on.

1474
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,760
我在倒影了
I'm reflecting.

1475
01:01:57,390 --> 01:01:58,760
我想要什么
What is it that I want?

1476
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,130
我在追求什么
What is my quest?

1477
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:02,100
我的梦想是什么
What is my dream?

1478
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:06,760
女士们  我努力过了
Well, ladies, I tried.

1479
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:09,230
看来我这个公主没有歌
No song for this princess, I guess.

1480
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:14,770
这个东西怎么用
How does this thing work?

1481
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:16,170
小鬼  你能看到我吗
Hey, kid, can you see me?

1482
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:18,080
太好了  你就在我面前
Yeah! Yeah, you're right there.

1483
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,180
我们成功了  我们筹到钱了
We did it! We got the money!

1484
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:22,510
不是吧  拉尔夫  太好了

1485
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,020
我正和易小子前往易贝

Okay, I'll see you soon.

1490
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:33,290
我们要回家了  小鬼

1491
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:35,460
我们的生活终于要恢复正常了
Our lives can finally get back to normal.

1492
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:42,030
我真是不敢相信  我能回家了
Wow, I can't believe it. I get to go home.

1493
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,440
我想就这样了
So, I guess that's it.

1494
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,510
我想我想要...一个方向盘
I guess I just wanted a... A steering wheel.

1495
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,870
现在  我赛车了  那么...
And now, I got it, so...

1496
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:57,450

*Am I a baby pigeon sprouting wings to soar?*

1501
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:21,210
那是一个比喻吗
Was that a metaphor?

1502
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:24,410
看  那有个一美元店

*加上一块车牌*
*With a side of license plate*

1520
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,390
*有人觉得我们很糟糕*
*Some find us deplorable*

1521
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:09,590
*我觉得你们很可爱*
*Well, I think you're adorable*

1522
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:13,090
*也许我们鱼龙混杂  但我们心很真*
*We may be a motley crew But our hearts ring true*

{\an8}易贝

1546
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:20,920
受够了老旧笔记本的卡顿龟速吗
That old, tired laptop moving at a sloth speed?

1547
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,420
今天就买个新的吧
Bid on a new one today!

1548
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,260
想靠玩游戏赚钱吗
Do you wanna get rich playing video games?

1549
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:25,490
点击这里...
Click here to...

1550
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:27,690
拉尔夫  拉尔夫  这里
Oh. Ralph. Ralph! Hey, there.

1551
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:28,760
你好  斯帕姆利
Oh, hey, Spamley.

1552
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,100
有什么好消息  兄弟
What's the good word, brother?

1553
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,530
好消息是我刚买下了那个方向盘
Well, the good word is I just paid for the steering wheel...

1554
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,070
我们要回家了
and we are going home.

1555
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:35,170
恭喜你
Congratulations.

1556
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:36,440
谢谢
Thanks.

1557
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,570
你有没有看到凡妮洛普
Hey, have you seen Vanellope anywhere?

1558
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:40,670
你的小家伙吗  不  我没见过
Oh, uh, your little chum? Uh, no, no, I haven't.

1559
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,710
希望她没有迷路
Hope she's not lost.

1560
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:44,650
让我来用这个小东西来联系她
Let me try to reach her on this doohickey.

1561
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,220
看到那边了吗  那座山上
See over there? Over that mountain?

1562
01:06:57,230 --> 01:06:59,460
-看到了  -那是红杉高速
- Yeah. - That's the Sequoia Speedway.

1563
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:01,090
下个月就解锁了
It's gonna be unlocked next month.

1564
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,100
你跟她在那个可怕的游戏里干什么
Hey, what are you doing in that awful game with her?

1565
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:04,630
我觉得轨道会
I think the track will end...

1566
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:07,230
通到那里  绝对会很刺激
right over there. Yo, it's gonna be so tight.

1567
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,270
我好喜欢
Oh, I love it.

1568
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:10,570
我能和你说一些
Hey, can I tell you something

1569
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:12,810
我觉得我永远不能告诉拉尔夫的事吗
that I don't think I could ever tell Ralph?

1570
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:14,240
当然了
Of course.

1571
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,780
我知道这听上去很疯狂
I know it sounds crazy...

1572
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:19,280
但是我一走进这个游戏  感觉
but the second I walked into this game, it felt...

1573
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:22,350
感觉就像家
Well, it felt like home.

1574
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:24,720
比糖果竞速都更像家
I mean, more than Sugar Rush ever did.

1575
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,720
是吗  为什么
Oh, yeah? How so?

1576
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,550
因为这里就像是我的梦想
'Cause it's like my dream.

1577
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,760
充满了怪异
It's full of weirdos...

1578
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:34,130
而且这里的竞速超级危险
and the racing is super dangerous...

1579
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:36,460
你永远不知道接下来会发生什么
and you never know what's gonna happen next.

1580
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:38,630
我是说  回到家里
I mean, back home,

1581
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:41,100
我都知道接下来会发什么
I know exactly what's gonna happen next...

1582
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:44,110
因为拉尔夫的梦想就是每天做一模一样的事
because Ralph's dream is to do the same thing every day.

1583
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:53,150
我要告诉你一些我觉得我好多年前应该明白的事
Here's something I wish I'd learned years ago.

1584
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:58,250
没有规定说  最好的朋友就该有同样的梦想
There is no law saying best friends have to have the same dreams.

1585
01:07:58,250 --> 01:07:59,250
你知道吗
You know?

1586
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:02,490
没错
Yeah.

1587
01:08:02,490 --> 01:08:05,860
你是一个非常睿智的人  闪姐
You are a very wise person, Shank.

1588
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:08,260
还是一个好朋友
And a good friend, too.

1589
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:09,630
谢谢你
Thank you.

1590
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:11,800
这里大家都说"闪闪你"
Around here, peeps like to say, "Shank you."

1591
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,440
等你回家后
You know, after you go home

1592
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,340
你的人生恢复正常后
and your life gets back to normal...

1593
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:19,310
这里永远欢迎你
you are always welcome here.

1594
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:22,310
但问题是  我希望这里才是我的日常生活
But that's the thing, I want this to be my normal.

1595
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:24,380
我希望这才是我的人生
I want this to be my life.

1596
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:26,580
我不想回家
I can't go home now.

1597
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:29,850
我回不去了
I just can't.

1598
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:41,330
在我们那儿
You know, where I come from,

1599
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:43,630
这叫"打脸"
that's called a kick in the face.

1600
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:45,570
我真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

1601
01:08:45,570 --> 01:08:48,540
脸被打得啪啪响
A straight-up donkey kick to the teeth.

1602
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,540
她应该是我最好的朋友
She's supposed to be my best friend.

1603
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,610
不  不可能是这样的
No, this can't be right.

1604
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:55,740
不  她被洗脑了
No, she's been brainwashed.

1605
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:57,240
肯定就是这样
That's what this is.

1606
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:58,280
因为我所认识的凡妮洛普
Because the Vanellope I know

1607
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:59,710
绝对不会这样抛弃我
would never abandon me like that.

1608
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,480
我得赶紧把她救回来
I gotta get her out of there now.

1609
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,750
慢点  大个子
Hey, easy now, tiger.

1610
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:04,880
你的冲劲很棒
I admire the impulse...

1611
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:07,420
但是你这样像一个白骑士一样冲进去
but you charge in there like some white knight...

1612
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:08,920
她很可能不会听你的
she's liable to hold it against you.

1613
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:11,360
不然呢  我就这么让她留在一个
So what? I'm supposed to just let her stay in a game

1614
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,490
明显对她来说不好的游戏里吗
that's obviously bad for her?

1615
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:13,690
当然不是了
Of course not.

1616
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,630
那我们要怎么让她离开
Then how do I make her leave?

1617
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:18,730
她觉得那里又酷又刺激
She thinks it's so cool and exciting in there.

1618
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:22,600
除非你知道我要怎么让那个游戏变得无聊或者
Unless you know how I can make the game boring or...

1619
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,410
等等  你知道病毒什么的  对吧  斯帕姆利
Wait. You know about viruses and stuff, right, Spamley?

1620
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:28,380
你说什么呢
Who's asking?

1621
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:29,710
以前在我们那儿  我和小鬼
Back home, me and the kid

1622
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:32,310
经常在一个叫创的游戏里玩
used to goof off in this game called Tron.

1623
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:34,880
但是后来它染上了病毒  那些赛车就变得很慢
But then it got a virus that made the motorbikes go slow...

1624
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,880
然后凡妮洛普就不想再去那里玩了
and then Vanellope stopped wanting to hang out in there.

1625
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:38,550
所以  如果有办法
So, is there a way

1626
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:40,720
能把屠戮赛车也变成那样
to do something like that to Slaughter Race?

1627
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:41,760
有办法的
Oh, there's ways.

1628
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:44,190
跟我来
Follow me.

1629
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,560
我查到母亲的娘家姓
I got mothers' maiden names...

1630
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:55,920
{\an8}加强病毒

1631
01:09:50,570 --> 01:09:52,900
社保号码  安全码
social security numbers, PIN numbers...

1632
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,330
这个地方
Now, this area down here

1633
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:55,900
叫做深网
is what's called the Darknet.

1634
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,770
这里有很多坏人
A lot of shady characters hang out down here...

1635
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:59,940
所以尽量低调点  戈登
so try to keep a low profile. Gord!

1636
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:01,740
你在这里啊
Oh, there you are.

1637
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:04,280
这个戈登  他会一点制造病毒
Now Gord here, he's dabbled in virus-making.

1638
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,280
但是他的兄弟  就是我们要去见的那个人
But his cousin, this guy we're gonna go see...

1639
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:09,250
丹丹  这家伙是制造病毒的机器
Double Dan, this dude is a virus-making machine.

1640
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:11,450
我们到了
Oh, oh, here we go.

1641
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:13,490
你确定这里安全吗
Are you sure this is safe?

1642
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:15,320
这里安全吗  当然安全了
Is it safe? Of course it is.

1643
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,290
只不过不管怎么样  都不要看他的小弟弟
Just whatever you do, do not look at his little brother.

1644
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:19,800
他还有个小弟弟吗
Oh, he has a little brother?

1645
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:25,400
丹丹
Double Dan!

1646
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,800
好久不见
Long time no see.

1647
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,300
你是谁
Who are you?

1648
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:29,700
斯帕姆利治安官
JP Spamley.

1649
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:31,710
我们有一次在友星网[第一个交友网站]
Uh, we met one time over at Friendster...

1650
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:35,340
那说明已经是好久以前的事了
which tells you it had to be a long time ago.

1651
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:36,810
-你在看什么  -没什么
- Oye. What are you looking at? - Nothing.

1652
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:37,910
你在看我弟弟吗
Are you looking at my brother?

1653
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:38,980
-没有  先生  -不许看
- No, sir. - Don't you look

1654
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:39,950
我的小弟弟
at my little brother.

1655
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:42,280
-不  我没有  -他非常敏感
- Oh, no, I wasn't. - He's very self-conscious!

1656
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:46,590
你
You?

1657
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:48,460
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

1658
01:10:49,690 --> 01:10:51,930
我来到你脖子上的面前...
The reason I came to your neck of the face...

1659
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:54,730
我是说  你的脖子上有张脸  是你的地盘
I mean, there's a face in your neck. I mean, woods.

1660
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:57,060
地盘  我来这里是因为我...
Neck of the woods. The reason I'm here is 'cause I...

1661
01:10:57,070 --> 01:10:59,530
我听带一些肿瘤[音似]  流言
Well, I heard a little tumor, rumor...

1662
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:00,970
我听到流言称
I heard a rumor that you could, well,

1663
01:11:00,970 --> 01:11:03,370
你能给我点无害的病毒什么的
give me a harmless virus kind of thing...

1664
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:06,340
也许能让屠戮赛车游戏慢下来
that might be able to slow down the Slaughter Race game?

1665
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:08,080
对
Oh, yeah.

1666
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,910
我的弟弟戈登和我说了你想摧毁那里
My cousin Gordon told me that you wanted to crash it.

1667
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:12,010
摧毁  不
Crash it? No!

1668
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:13,880
不不不
No, no, no.

1669
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,480
我不想让任何人受伤
I don't want anyone getting hurt.

1670
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:18,690
有没有办法...
If there's a way to just, uh...

1671
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:19,650
我也不知道
I don't know...

1672
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:21,990
让那些车慢下来之类的
just make the cars go slow or something...

1673
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:24,590
这样那个游戏就会很无聊
so the game is boring...

1674
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:26,730
我的朋友就会跟我回家
and my friend comes back home to me.

1675
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:30,630
我来给你介绍  亚瑟
Allow me to introduce you to Arthur.

1676
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,030
冷静点  小子
Easy there, boy.

1677
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,870
他很热情
He's keen.

1678
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:39,710
我管亚瑟叫做不安全病毒
Arthur's what I call an insecurity virus.

1679
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:42,540
意思是他专门找漏洞和弱点
Means he looks for little flaws and weaknesses

1680
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:44,450
会让程序变得不安全
that make a program insecure.

1681
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:49,750
你把它放进屠戮赛车的游戏中
You release him into that Slaughter Race game,

1682
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:52,490
亚瑟就会找到代码中的缺陷
Arthur will find some defect in the code.

1683
01:11:52,490 --> 01:11:54,050
然后他会复制那些缺陷
Then he'll copy that defect

1684
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:56,790
传播到游戏各处
and spread it all over the game...

1685
01:11:56,790 --> 01:12:00,430
直到所有东西都变得"很无聊"
until everything becomes, quote, unquote, "Boring"...

1686
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:02,860
就像你想要的那样
just like you wanted.

1687
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:04,030
好吧
Okay.

1688
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:05,930
先说清楚
Just to be super clear here...

1689
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:07,400
没有人会受伤  对吧
no one gets hurt, right?

1690
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,540
你是傻的吗
Are you stupid?

1691
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:09,700
那个
Well, uh...

1692
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:11,910
因为只有你的愚蠢才会
Because the only way anyone gets hurt...

1693
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,410
让人受伤
is if you are stupid.

1694
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:14,910
你只要让
All you have to do...

1695
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:18,450
病毒乖乖呆在屠戮赛车里面
is make sure the virus stays in Slaughter Race.

1696
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:20,450
没错  别犯傻
Right. Don't be stupid.

1697
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:21,780
确保不要让病毒逃出屠戮赛车
Make sure it doesn't get out of Slaughter Race.

1698
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:22,880
甲状腺肿[音同]了
Goiter it. Gah!

1699
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:24,050
-知道了  知道了  -出去
- Got it! Got it. - Get out!

1700
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:25,590
谢谢你  你肿了大忙
Thank you, you're a cyst face.

1701
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:26,750
-出去  -我是说帮了大忙
- Out! - I mean, assistance.

1702
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,620
谢谢你肿了大忙...帮了
Thank you for your cyst face... Assistance.

1703
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:30,090
-出去  -再见
- Get out! - Goodbye!

1704
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,630
唉  我输了
Ah! Fiddlesticks! Well, that's game.

1705
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:37,970
新手运而已
Ah, beginner's luck.

1706
01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:40,730
拜托  小鬼   我一看就明白控球
Come on, kid. I know a hustle when I see one.

1707
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:43,840
-玩家马上到了  -谢了  鲍勃
- Player's on the way. - Thanks, Bob.

1708
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,440
-开始吧  -该认真起来了  伙计们
- Let's roll! - Game faces on, guys.

1709
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,540
该上场了  准备好开始你的第一场比赛了吗
Show time. You ready for your first race?

1710
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:49,940
我想是吧
Um, yeah. I think so.

1711
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:52,550
别紧张  你会很棒的
Hey, don't be nervous. You're gonna be great.

1712
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:54,720
不  我知道我会没事的
Yeah, no, I know. I'll be fine.

1713
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,850
你还没有告诉拉尔夫  对吗
Mmm. You didn't tell Ralph yet, did you?

1714
01:12:57,990 --> 01:12:59,820
没怎么说
Not exactly.

1715
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:02,460
拜托  小凡  他是你最好的朋友
Come on, V. He's your best friend.

1716
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:03,760
你得让他知道
You gotta let him know

1717
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,490
你准备再在这里待一段时间
you're planning on staying here for a while.

1718
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:08,500
我知道  但他会很难过的
I know. But he's gonna get really upset.

1719
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,500
他也许会  但是你们俩
Yeah, he might, but you guys...

1720
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,100
你们能谈谈  能解决的  你们会搞定的
you'll talk, you'll work it out, you'll figure it out.

1721
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:14,900
但万一我们搞不定呢
Yeah, but what if we don't?

1722
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:17,710
万一他觉得很受伤
What if his feelings get hurt so bad...

1723
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:19,770
再也不想当我的朋友了呢
he won't wanna be my friend anymore?

1724
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:23,010
听着  友谊的确会变
Look. All friendships change...

1725
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:24,850
但是好的友谊
but the good ones...

1726
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:26,180
却会因此而更加坚定
they get stronger because of it.

1727
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:29,550
闪姐  虽然不想打断你们
Uh, Shank, I hate to bother you...

1728
01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:31,890
但是玩家在等着了
but the player is waiting.

1729
01:13:31,890 --> 01:13:33,750
我不会教你该怎么办  小鬼
I'm not gonna tell you what to do, kid.

1730
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:34,820
这是你的决定
It's your call.

1731
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:36,690
好吧
Yeah, okay.

1732
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:38,690
好吧
All right.

1733
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:39,860

1739
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,890
不过要小心闪姐和她的手下
but watch out for Shank and her crew.

1740
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,740
是漂移起跳加加速飘逸
Power drift into a drift jump!

1741
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:31,750

1742

1748
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:06,880
没事的
It'll be okay.

1749
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,050
拉尔夫没事的
Ralph will be fine.

1750
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:09,690

怎么回事  斯帕姆利
What's going on, Spamley?

1764
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:38,010
这个地方都变得很疯狂了
The whole place is going crazy.

1765
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:40,080
我以为病毒只会让她的车慢下来
I thought that virus was just supposed to slow down her car.

1766
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,180
本来是的
It was.

1767
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:43,050
它肯定找到了非常不稳定的东西
It must've found something real unstable in there.

他们要重启游戏了
They're gonna reboot the game...

1773
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:54,200
不属于这个游戏的东西

1774
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,300
都会被删除
will be deleted.

1775
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,870
我得带她离开这里
Yeah, and if I don't get her outta there,

1776
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:58,240
凡妮洛普会死的
Vanellope's gonna die!

1777
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,140
快点  小鬼  这个游戏要崩溃了  快走
Come on, kid. The game's crashing. Let's go.

1778
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:04,710
我觉得是因为我的故障
I think it's my glitch.

1779
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:07,810
对不起  我不是故意毁掉你的游戏的
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to destroy your game.

1780
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:10,880
我们没事  但是你的代码不属于这个游戏
We'll be fine, but your code isn't part of this game.

1781
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,680
我们得带你离开这里  跟我去出口
We got to get you out of here now. Follow me to the exit.

1782
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:24,330
不  不
Oh, no, no!

1783
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:31,970
小鬼
Kid!

1784
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:34,100
小鬼  你在哪里
Kid, where are you?

1785
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,300
服务器要重启了  拉尔夫
The server is rebooting, Ralph.

1786
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:38,370
你们俩都得赶紧离开这里
Both of you have to get out of here now.

1787
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:39,640
小鬼  我来了  我来了
Kid, I got you. I got you.

1788
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,880
游戏即将重启
Game reboot...

1789
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:46,850
五  四  三
in five, four, three...

1790
01:16:46,850 --> 01:16:48,750
二  一
two, one.

1791
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:53,170
{\an8}服务器重启中

1792
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,720
正在重启
Reboot in progress.

1793
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:58,230
拜托  凡妮洛普  醒醒
Come on, Vanellope. Wake up.

1794
01:16:58,230 --> 01:17:00,400
拜托  别丢下我  小鬼
Come on. Don't leave me, kid.

1795
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:04,370
拉尔夫
Ralph?

1796
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:07,170
你醒了  你没事吧  小鬼
Oh. There you are. You okay, kid?

1797
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:11,370
拉尔夫  我搞砸了
Ralph, I messed up so bad.

1798
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:14,080
不  你没有  没事的
No. No, you didn't, it's okay.

1799
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:17,150
这都是因为我和我的故障
This is all because of me and my glitch.

1800
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:19,050
我就应该和你一起
I should've just stayed with you...

1801
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:21,750
而不是去追随什么愚蠢的梦想
instead of following some stupid dream.

1802
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,320
我毁了一切
I've ruined everything.

1803
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,720
不  小鬼  不
No, kid, no.

1804
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:33,400
听着  我不是故意想要发生这种事的
Ah, look. I didn't mean for it to happen like this.

1805
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,200
不应该这么严重的
It was not supposed to be this bad.

1806
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:42,070
你不是故意想要发生什么的
You didn't mean for what to happen?

1807
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:45,740
我可能  算是在游戏里...
I mighta, kinda sorta put a...

1808
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:50,110
放了一个无害的小病毒
harmless little virus in the game.

1809
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:52,350
一个病毒
A virus?

1810
01:17:52,350 --> 01:17:54,920
是你干的
You did this?

1811
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,050
要不是我听到你告诉闪姐
I wouldn't have done anything

1812
01:17:57,050 --> 01:17:58,420
你想要永远留在屠戮赛车
if I hadn't heard you tell Shank...

1813
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:00,220
我也不会干出这种事
that you wanted to live in Slaughter Race forever.

1814
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:03,930
所以你是在监视我了
So you were spying on me?

1815
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:06,100
你也不是完全无辜的
Hey. You're not exactly innocent here.

1816
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:08,760
你本来准备甩掉所有人  抛弃糖果竞速
You were gonna ditch everybody and abandon Sugar Rush.

1817
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:10,770
拜托  我只是16名车手中的一名
Oh, please. I'm one of 16 racers.

1818
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:12,100
他们不会想念我的
They'd never miss me.

1819
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:13,440
那我呢
What about me?

1820
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,970
你干出这种事以后  我为什么还要
Why would I ever spend another second with you...

1821
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:17,140
跟你待在一起
after what you did?

1822
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,280
不
No!

1823
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:25,720
不
No.

1824
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,080
凡妮洛普  你要去哪里
Vanellope, where are you going?

1825
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:29,490
只要没有你的地方
Wherever you're not.

1826
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:30,820
等等  我能解释
Wait a minute. I can explain.

1827
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:33,060
不  你不要再跟着我了
No! You will not follow me.

1828
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:34,090
凡妮洛普  拜托
Vanellope, please...

1829
01:18:34,090 --> 01:18:36,820
朋友不会像你一样干出这种事  永远不会
A friend would never do what you did. Never!

1830
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:39,260
所以你离我远一点
So you leave me alone!

1831
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:41,930
凡妮洛普  不  不  拜托
Vanellope, no, no, no! Please!

1832
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:44,500
拜托  我都做了什么
Please! What did I do?

1833
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,240
扫描不安全
Scanning for insecurities.

1834
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,910
凡妮洛普  求你了  别离开我
Vanellope, come on, don't leave me!

1835
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:49,280

传播不安全
Distributing insecurity.

拜托
Come on.

1844
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:17,400
在哪里啊
Where is it?

1845
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,140
不
Oh, no.

1846
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:45,130
你真是个笨蛋
You are such an idiot.

1847
01:19:56,870 --> 01:20:01,380
你干什么  拉尔夫  我说了别跟着我
What is your problem, Ralph? I told you, don't follow me.

1848
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,580

What can KnowsMore help you find today?

1883
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:24,330
外面全...
There's a whole...

1884
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:25,630
全食  臭氧层上有个洞
Whole Foods, a hole in the ozone...

1885
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:28,330
由英国摇滚乐队齐柏林飞艇创作的《好多爱》
A Whole Lotta Love by British rockers Led Zeppelin?

1886
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:31,130
不  不  外面全是拉尔夫在追我
No! No! There's a whole bunch of Ralphs chasing me.

1887
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:33,670
朋友
Friend...

1888
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:35,610
也许现在是时候
This would probably be an appropriate time

1889
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:36,910
关闭我的网站了
for me to shutter my site.

1890
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:47,380
你觉他们要花多久才能进来
How long you think before they get in here?

1891
01:21:48,150 --> 01:21:49,490
一秒整以后
Precisely one second.

1892
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:55,590
是我  是真正的我
It's me! It's the real me!

1893
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:00,500
-拉尔夫  -抱歉
- Ralph? - My apologies.

1894
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:01,730
我跟着这群东西过来的
I followed those things here.

1895
01:22:01,730 --> 01:22:02,930
我觉得它们是在找你
I think they're looking for you, kid.

1896
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:07,170
是吗  你做了什么
Yeah, you think? What did you do?

1897
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:10,310
我很抱歉  我不知道怎么会这样的
I'm so sorry. I don't know how this happened.

1898
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:11,410
我觉得非常明显了
Well, I think it's fairly obvious.

1899
01:22:11,410 --> 01:22:14,040
这是因为一个不安全病毒克隆了
It happened because an insecurity virus cloned...

1900
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:16,550
你超级掌控  粘人  自我毁灭性的行为
all of your needy, clingy, self-destructive behavior.

1901
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:18,250
这种行为如果听之任之的话
The very behavior which left unchecked

1902
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:19,620
就会摧毁友谊
can destroy friendships...

1903
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:23,290
而现在  就是整个互联网
and in this particular case, the entire Internet!

1904
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:27,060
万事通  你什么都知道
KnowsMore! You have all the answers.

1905
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:28,360
提问
Official query...

1906
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,390
如果我的克隆体
what do I do if clones of me

1907
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,000
都想要抓住我的朋友该怎么办  搜索
are trying to capture my friend? Search.

1908
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:36,500
我对你的提问找到两条结果
I find two results for your query.

1909
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,640
你要么让所有的克隆体就接受心理治疗
Either you put all the clones in therapy.

1910
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,600
好像不大现实
Not very realistic.

1911
01:22:40,610 --> 01:22:42,570
或者  反病毒区域处于
Or, the anti-virus district is surrounded

1912
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:44,640
安全软件的墙内
by a gate made from security software.

1913
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:45,610
如果凡妮洛普能想办法
If Vanellope could somehow

1914
01:22:45,610 --> 01:22:47,110
把这些克隆体都引到墙内
lead all of the clones through the gate...

1915
01:22:47,110 --> 01:22:49,110
他们就会立马被删除
they would be deleted all at once.

1916
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:52,320
有点像互惠互助的风笛手
Sort of a co-dependent pied piper situation.

1917
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:55,050
等等  我们认识一名风笛手
Wait. We know a pied piper.

1918
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:56,490
-是吗  -赞姐[是的]
- We do? - Yesss.

1919
01:22:56,490 --> 01:22:58,050
-谁  -赞姐
- Who? - Yesss!

1920
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:58,720
是啊  但是是谁呢
Yeah, but who is it?

1921
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:02,560
你是说赞姐
Oh, you mean Yesss!

1922
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:09,370
谢谢你的帮助  万事通
Thanks for your help, KnowsMore.

1923
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:11,100
这么说好像有点太空洞了吧
It's a bit of an empty gesture at this point,

1924
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:13,300
你不觉得吗
wouldn't you say?

1925
01:23:13,310 --> 01:23:14,700
看来我忘记告诉拉尔夫
Guess I forgot to tell Ralph

1926
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:16,440
当你引爆互联网后
that when you break the Internet...

1927
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:19,240
不用真的把互联网爆破了
you don't literally have to break the Internet.

1928
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:20,480
真不敢相信他居然这么做了
I can't believe he did this.

1929
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:23,110
我是说  这家伙显然是做了些
Yeah, well, I mean, dude obviously made

1930
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:25,250
非常值得质疑的决定
some real questionable choices here.

1931
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:29,390
但他还是做了蜜蜂双关语视频来拯救他朋友的游戏
But he also made a bee pun to save his best friend's game...

1932
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:33,190
我能怎么说呢  小鬼  人生就是很复杂
so what can I say, kid, life's complicated.

1933
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:36,230
准备好做风笛手了吗
You ready to pied the piper?

1934
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:41,270
这边
Yoo-hoo! Up here!

1935
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:45,800
是我  你们在全世界最好的朋友
It's me, your bestest friend in the whole wide world...

1936
01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:47,210
你们离了我就活不了
who you can't live without!

1937
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:49,740
朋友
Friend!

1938
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:55,550
我在这里的确觉得我的表现
Wow, from up here I can see how I do come across as...

1939
01:23:55,550 --> 01:23:57,310
超级掌控  粘人
needy, and clingy,

1940
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:59,690
自我毁灭  和万事通说的一样
and self-destructive like KnowsMore said.

1941
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:02,390
听着  小鬼
Listen, kid...

1942
01:24:02,390 --> 01:24:05,520
如果你不想再做我的朋友也没关系
I don't blame you for not wanting to be my friend anymore.

1943
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,690
我从来没说过我不想再做你的朋友
I never said I didn't want to be your friend.

1944
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:11,390
我是说你的表现是个糟糕的朋友  你当时的确是
I said you were acting like a bad friend. Which you were.

1945
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,130
我知道  但是我...
I know I was, but I...

1946
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:14,260
宝贝们
Hey, my babies!

1947
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:17,400
前面就是反病毒区域了
That's the anti-virus district straight ahead. Whoo!

1948
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:19,070
好吧  未完待续  好吗
All right, to be continued, okay?

1949
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:28,750
我们快到了
Whoo-hoo! We're gonna make it!

1950
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,200
你们没事吧
You guys okay?

1951
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,460
我没事
I'm fine!

1952
01:24:47,470 --> 01:24:50,470
没事  听着  我们还是能成功的
Yeah, all good. Look, we can still do this.

1953
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:52,770
来吧  大个头  帮我把车翻过来
Come on, big man. Help me turn this thing over.

1954
01:24:56,210 --> 01:24:58,410
伙计们
Uh, guys?

1955
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:12,220
朋友
Friend?

1956
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:14,490
真是太可怕了
That is unsettling.

1957
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:19,630
朋友
Friend.

1958
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:21,900
赶紧带凡妮洛普离开这里
Get Vanellope out of here now.

1959
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:23,030
你呢  拉尔夫
What about you, Ralph?

1960
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,170
快走  我要和镜子中的自己来场约会
Just go. I got a date with the man in the mirror.

1961
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,540
说你呢
Hey, you!

1962
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:32,880
你离她远一点
You keep away from her!

1963
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,550
我要砸个稀巴烂
I'm gonna wreck it!

1964
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:40,590
她不是你的朋友
She's not your friend!

1965
01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:43,150
她是我的朋友
She's my friend!

1966
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:45,620
这边走
Here it is, this way.

1967
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:47,690
快走  小鬼  我们得赶紧离开
Come on, kid. We gotta move.

1968
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:01,610
我的天
Eeeee-oh-boy!

1969
01:26:18,690 --> 01:26:19,760
不
No!

1970
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:25,630
凡妮洛普
Vanellope!

1971
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:32,570
放开我
Hey! Let go of me!

1972
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:36,710
-小鬼  -拉尔夫
- Kid! - Ralph!

1973
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:45,720
回来
Hey, get back here!

1974
01:26:48,490 --> 01:26:49,920
你把她放下
You put her down!

1975
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:15,410
凡妮洛普
Vanellope!

1976
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:34,940
你现在就是个彻头彻尾的坏蛋
You know, you're acting like a real bad guy here!

1977
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,000
不
No!

1978
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,540
你就是
Well, you are!

1979
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:41,470
我永远不会做你的朋友
And I will never be your friend!

1980
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:46,980
笨蛋
Hey, doofus!

1981
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:48,680
拉尔夫
Ralph!

1982
01:27:56,620 --> 01:27:58,860
想抓我就来啊  大笨蛋
Catch me if you can, you big dummy!

1983
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:06,970
我来救你了  小妹
I got you, little sister.

1984
01:28:10,670 --> 01:28:12,340
快走  离开这里
Now go! Get out of here!

1985
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:14,010
-拉尔夫  -快走
- Ralph! - Go!

1986
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:16,810
不  别伤害他
No! Don't hurt him!

1987
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:18,540
拜托  不
Please, no!

1988
01:28:23,350 --> 01:28:25,820
住手  你要捏死他了
Stop it! You're squishing him!

1989
01:28:27,550 --> 01:28:29,550
你要杀死我最好的朋友了
You're gonna kill my best friend!

1990
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,030
好吧  你赢了  你赢了  好吗
Fine! You win! You win, okay?

1991
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:41,840
拜托  放下他
Just please put him down.

1992
01:28:44,470 --> 01:28:47,010
我会成为你唯一的朋友  好吗
I'll be your only friend, okay?

1993
01:28:47,010 --> 01:28:49,070
放了他
Just let him go.

1994
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:50,680
不  不  小鬼
No! No, kid.

1995
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,710
没错  没错
That's it. That's it. Yeah.

1996
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:59,580
放下他  我会跟你走
Put him down and I'll go with you...

1997
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:01,090
我们会永远是最好的朋友
and we'll be best friends forever.

1998
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:04,590
只有我和你
Just me and you.

1999
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:05,790
这就是你想要的  对吗
That's what you want, right?

2000
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,360
但这不是我想要的
Well, that's not what I want!

2001
01:29:12,130 --> 01:29:14,700
阻碍一个朋友实现她的梦想是不对的
It's not right to hold a friend back from her dreams!

2002
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,840
她不是专属于你的
You don't own her!

2003
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:19,640
友谊不是这样的
That's not how friendship works!

2004
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,470
你要放手
You need to let her go!

2005
01:29:28,650 --> 01:29:29,750
你要放手
You need to let her go.

2006
01:29:32,790 --> 01:29:35,860
我知道  放手的时候可能是会有些痛苦
I know. It's gonna hurt a little bit when you do.

2007
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:39,760
我骗谁呢  那会非常痛苦
Oh, who am I kidding? It's gonna hurt a lot.

2008
01:29:41,630 --> 01:29:43,830
但是你会没事的
But you're gonna be okay.

2009
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,200
我们会没事的
And we're gonna be okay.

2010
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:49,470
对吧  小鬼
Right, kid?

2011
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:53,770
当然了  永远会的
Of course we are. Always.

2012
01:29:55,910 --> 01:29:58,980
看  不管她去哪里
See? No matter where she goes...

2013
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:01,810
不管她住在哪里
or where she lives...

2014
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:04,080
她永远都是我们的朋友
she's always gonna be our friend.

2015
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,550
我们要相信她
And we just gotta trust her.

2016
01:30:06,550 --> 01:30:08,990
这才是最好的朋友该做的事
Because that's what best friends do.

2017
01:30:10,090 --> 01:30:11,590
对吧
Right?

2018
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:27,510
谢了  伙计
Thanks, buddy.

2019
01:30:32,550 --> 01:30:34,510
我感觉真棒
I feel good about this.

2020
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:42,050
拉尔夫  你看
Ralph, look!

2021
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:43,990
我觉得你修复了你的不安全感
I think you fixed your insecurity!

2022
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:47,230
你说得对
You're right.

2023
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:50,730
拉尔夫  不
Ralph, no!

2024
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:56,240
停到这里来  拉尔夫
Park it right here, Ralph!

2025
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:58,570
你的老朋友斯帕姆利来接住你
Your ol' pal JP Spamley's gotcha!

2026
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,140
看来是没用了
Wow, that didn't work.

2027
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:09,680
你们看
Look up there!

2028
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,550
是一个需要拯救的强壮高大的男子
It's a big strong man in need of rescuing.

2029
01:31:55,990 --> 01:31:59,200
{\an8}皇家床垫

2030
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:16,050
谢了  小青蛙
Oh, thanks, Frogger.

2031
01:32:16,580 --> 01:32:17,720
等等
Wait a minute.

2032
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:19,890
你们都是谁
Who are all of you?

2033
01:32:19,890 --> 01:32:21,920
我们是凡妮洛普的朋友
We're friends of Vanellope's.

2034
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:24,090
没错  凡妮洛普的朋友
Yeah, and any friend of Vanellope's

2035
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:25,720
都是我的朋友
is a friend of ours.

2036
01:32:25,730 --> 01:32:27,590
不客气
You're welcome.

2037
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:28,960
拉尔夫
Ralph!

2038
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,060
你看起来不错啊  大块头
Looking good, big fella!

2039
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:35,000
这条裙子不是给大块头设计的
This dress is not made for a big boy.

2040
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
后面包得太严实了
It's going right up the back alley there.

2041
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,670
让我来调整一下
Let me just make a little adjustment.

2042
01:32:38,670 --> 01:32:41,110
好了
There we go.

2043
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:45,010
互联网今晚能长舒一口气了
Internet users are breathing a collective sigh of relief tonight.

2044
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:47,350
破坏王拉尔夫病毒虽突然出现
Just as mysteriously as it appeared,

2045
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:49,750
但是也神秘地消失了
the Wreck-It Ralph virus has vanished.

2046
01:32:51,330 --> 01:32:54,800
{\an8}屠戮赛车

2047
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:58,120
你知道我刚刚意识到什么吗
You know what I just realized?

2048
01:32:58,130 --> 01:33:00,860
这里根本没有日出日落
The sun never rises or sets here...

2049
01:33:00,860 --> 01:33:02,830
因为一切都是活跃着的
because everything's always on.

2050
01:33:02,830 --> 01:33:05,400
你的观察力也太敏锐了
Well, now, isn't that an astute observation?

2051
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:06,970
我知道  对吧
I know, right?

2052
01:33:06,970 --> 01:33:08,170
我可能是除了万事通以外
You know, other than KnowsMore,

2053
01:33:08,170 --> 01:33:09,940
全互联网最聪明的人了吧
I'm probably the smartest guy on the Internet.

2054
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:11,970
没错  没错
Yeah. Yeah.

2055
01:33:11,970 --> 01:33:14,970
小凡  我们要重新上线了  你准备好了吗
Yo, V. We're about to come back online. You ready?

2056
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:16,380
马上来
Be right there!

2057
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:19,040
拉尔夫  别那么客气
Hey, Ralph, don't be a stranger!

2058
01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:21,650
我总没有你来得客气[奇怪]  闪姐
Well, I can't be much stranger than you, Shank.

2059
01:33:21,650 --> 01:33:24,050
这个双关不错
Oh. That's a good dad joke.

2060
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:27,050
别忘了
Hey, don't forget.

2061
01:33:27,050 --> 01:33:28,990
你知道闪姐加入了我的代码
You know Shank added my code and everything,

2062
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:30,820
我以后就能重生了
so I'll be able to regenerate.

2063
01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:31,960
我会很安全的
I'm gonna be totally safe.

2064
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:34,390
不  我知道  一定会很棒的
No, I know. It's gonna be great.

2065
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:35,990
你找到了你梦想中的游戏
You found your dream game.

2066
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,260
是的
Yeah, I did.

2067
01:33:38,170 --> 01:33:39,170
是的
I did.

2068
01:33:40,030 --> 01:33:42,170
那么
So, uh...

2069
01:33:42,170 --> 01:33:45,200
我想我应该进去了  你知道吗
I guess I should probably head in there now, you know?

2070
01:33:45,210 --> 01:33:48,180
在你走之前  我要给你这个
Oh, before you go, I wanted to give you this.

2071
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:52,080
我很抱歉被我摔碎了  拉尔夫
Oh, I'm so sorry I broke it, Ralph.

2072
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,110
不  不  没事
No, no. It's okay.

2073
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:56,150
现在我们可以一人一半了  看
Now we can both have a half. See?

2074
01:33:58,220 --> 01:33:59,020
没错
Yeah!

2075
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:08,730
我好爱你
I love you so much.

2076
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:11,230
我会很想你的
I'm really gonna miss you.

2077
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:15,040
我也会想你的  小鬼
I'm gonna miss you too, kid.

2078
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:17,770
真的
I really am.

2079
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:22,670
{\an8}你是我的英雄

2080
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:24,380
好了
All right.

2081
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:28,220
我又有点粘你了
Okay, getting a little clingy on me, here.

2082
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,150
去吧  赶紧去吧
Go on. Get out of here.

2083
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:34,420
这个世界在等你呢  小鬼
The world's waiting for you, kid.

2084
01:35:32,050 --> 01:35:34,110
说实话
I'll be honest,

2085
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:36,420
回到这里感觉还是有点奇怪
it still feels kind of weird around here.

2086
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:38,450
很多事都变了
I mean, a lot has changed.

2087
01:35:38,450 --> 01:35:39,920
尽管我们买下了那个方向盘
Even though we got that steering wheel

2088
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:40,990
拯救了糖果竞速
and saved Sugar Rush...

2089
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:43,160
一切还是都不一样了
it's never really gonna be the same.

2090
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:46,970
{\an8}终点

2091
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:47,960
比如  那些赛车手都没有那么讨厌了
For one thing, the racers aren't even that obnoxious anymore.

2092
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:50,360
天啊  很抱歉你没有赢  太妃塔
Oh, golly. I'm sorry you didn't win, Taffyta.

2093
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:53,000
我们的友谊对我来说
Pfft! Our friendship is much more important to me

2094
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,300
比胜利重要多了  蓝芝士
than winning, Rancis.

2095
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:56,040
失败才能塑造人物
Losing builds character!

2096
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:57,970
每个人都是赢家  太妃塔
Everyone's a winner, Taffyta.

2097
01:35:57,970 --> 01:35:59,510
阿修和卡尔霍
Felix and Calhoun,

2098
01:35:59,510 --> 01:36:00,710
虽然他们很呆
as goofy as they are,

2099
01:36:00,710 --> 01:36:03,140
但是他们还是一对很棒的父母
they turned out to be pretty great parents.

2100
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:04,440
我想问你们俩
I gotta hand it to you two,

2101
01:36:04,450 --> 01:36:06,950
你们怎么驯服这些家伙的
how on earth did you tame those things?

2102
01:36:06,950 --> 01:36:08,310
很简单  中士
It's simple, Surge.

2103
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,920
做父母的关键是...
The key to parenting is...

2104
01:36:13,890 --> 01:36:15,860
然后你要...
And then what you do is...

2105
01:36:18,330 --> 01:36:21,560
这就是教导出完美孩子的秘诀
And that is the secret to raising perfect children.

2106
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:25,000
希望每个父母都能听听
Wow, I wish every parent could hear that.

2107
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,370
我也很忙
I'm keeping busy, too.

2108
01:36:26,370 --> 01:36:28,300
我终于加入了桑吉夫的读书俱乐部
I finally joined Zangief's book club.

2109
01:36:27,010 --> 01:36:30,590
{\an8}今晚读书俱乐部

2110
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:30,370
说得好  拜森  你呢  拉尔夫
Good point, Bison. And how about you, Ralph?

2111
01:36:30,370 --> 01:36:32,310
你觉得陀思妥耶夫斯基
Do you feel Dostoyevsky

2112
01:36:32,310 --> 01:36:34,910
想要动摇叙述者的地位吗
intended to make narrator unreliable?

2113
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:38,580
我觉得  又不觉得
I do and I don't.

2114
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:41,150
你觉得  你又不觉得
You do, and you don't.

2115
01:36:41,150 --> 01:36:43,920
二元性  太深刻了  拉尔夫
Duality. That's really deep, Ralph.

2116
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,220
谢谢你  索尼克
Thanks, Sonic.

2117
01:36:45,220 --> 01:36:47,950
我不知道我在说什么
I don't know what I'm talking about.

2118
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:50,290
我们每周五会有一个新的活动
Oh. And we got this new thing we do every Friday night...

2119
01:36:50,290 --> 01:36:52,390
我们都会去一个不同的游戏里玩
where we all go and hang out in a different game.

2120
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:54,060
这周是我主持
I actually hosted this week.

2121
01:36:55,460 --> 01:36:58,060
希望你们都饿了  我做了烧焦的派
Hope you're all hungry. I made burnt pie.

2122
01:36:58,070 --> 01:36:59,930
什么是烧焦的派  破坏王
What's burnt pie, Wreck-It?

2123
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:02,240
就是你烧焦的派
Oh, it's just a pie that you burn.

2124
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,170
用什么派都可以
You can use any pie.

2125
01:37:03,170 --> 01:37:04,940
你可以直接丢在烤箱里很久
You just leave it in the oven too long.

2126
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:11,240
没错  我们玩得是很开心
Yeah, we really do have a lot of fun.

2127
01:37:11,250 --> 01:37:14,580
这应该就是我要和你说的所有新鲜事了
I guess that's pretty much all the news I got for you.

2128
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:17,320
天啊  你说的故事永远不会让人失望  拉尔夫
Oh, man, your stories never disappoint, Ralph.

2129
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:18,920
真希望我们能早点再一起玩
I just wish we could hang out sooner.

2130
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:20,420
我也是
Yeah. Me, too.

2131
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:22,120
你说你什么时候休假来着
When did you say you were getting those days off?

2132
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:24,920
我们的升级是从1月25日开始
Uh, our upgrade starts on January 25th,

2133
01:37:24,930 --> 01:37:26,630
所以应该是两个月后
so, like, two months from now.

2134
01:37:26,630 --> 01:37:29,300
那很快就过去了  说到这个
Oh, that'll go by in a flash. Oh, speaking of which...

2135
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:30,400
你想在我来见你时给你
you want me to bring you anything from home

2136
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,400
从家里带点什么吗
when I come visit?

2137
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:33,470
你知道我在互联网上
Oh! You know what I cannot find

2138
01:37:33,470 --> 01:37:35,230
怎么都找不到什么东西吗
anywhere on the Internet?

2139
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:38,170
半生不熟的汉堡时间汉堡
A halfway decent BurgerTime burger.

2140
01:37:38,170 --> 01:37:40,470
我一直在和闪姐和其他人说这个汉堡
I've been talking them up to Shank and the crew.

2141
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,210
说实在的  我觉得他们开始认为
And honestly, I think they're starting to think

2142
01:37:42,210 --> 01:37:43,380
那是我编的了
I'm making it up.

2143
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:44,650
好的  包在我身上
All right, consider it done.

2144
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:46,320
我给你们带一堆
I'll bring you guys a truckload.

2145
01:37:48,650 --> 01:37:50,980
太阳已经出来了
Well, sun's coming up already.

2146
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:52,450
看来我得去上班了
Guess I better get to it.

2147
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:53,950
我也是
Yeah, me too.

2148
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:55,120
下周再聊吗
Talk next week?

2149
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:56,990
等你的来电  女士
I shall await your call, madam.

2150
01:37:56,990 --> 01:38:01,600
那么再见  再见  放屁是如此甜蜜的悲伤
Then, adieu, adieu, farting is such sweet sorrow.

2151
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,900
再见  臭脑袋
So long, stinkbrain.

2152
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:05,370
再见  小鬼
Bye, kid.

2153
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:22,280
你没事吧  拉尔夫
Hey. You doing okay there, Ralph?

2154
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:26,520
我没事  我很好
Yeah, I am, actually. I'm doing great.

2155
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:29,260
走吧  阿修  去工作吧  伙计
Come on, Felix. Let's get to work, buddy.

2156
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:42,120

《无敌破坏王2：大闹互联网》

2158
01:42:00,670 --> 01:42:03,740
小茉  电影喜欢吗  亲爱的
Hey, Mo, did you like the movie, sweetie?

2159
01:42:03,740 --> 01:42:06,340
预告片中有一段
Well, there was a scene in the trailer...

2160
01:42:06,340 --> 01:42:08,380
电影里没有
that wasn't in the movie...

2161
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:10,810
让我有点难过
and that makes me sad.

2162
01:42:10,810 --> 01:42:12,910
那真是太糟了
Aw, that's too bad.

2163
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:14,520
也许你玩会儿游戏会开心点
Maybe playing your game will cheer you up.

2164
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:15,520
好吧
Okay.

I'm starting to understand why people like this game.

2177

非常佛系
Very zen.

2178

Uh, Ralph, you might wanna try feeding the kitty for a little while.

2186
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:03,700
不  小猫咪吃奶昔
No, the kitty gets the milkshake.
