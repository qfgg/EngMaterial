5
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,490
很明显我对有些事判断错误
Obviously I miscalculated a few things.

6
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,700
为什么在你即将心想事成时
Why is it that the moment your life exceeds your wildest dreams.

7
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,020
却又总被搅了好事
The knife appears in your back.

8
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,920
我来告诉你件事
Well I'll tell you one thing.

9
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,380
我绝不会让他们碰我一根汗毛
I will never let them touch me.

10
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,880
我的邻居一定打开门对我抱怨了
My neighbor must have open the door to complain.

11
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,820
对于智商上千的我来说  肯定错过了一些东西
For a guy with a 4 digit IQ, I must have missed something...

12
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,290
但错过的并不太多
but I haven’t missed much.

13
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,360
我几乎就要成为影响世界的人了
I come this close to having an impact the world.

14
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:31,420
然而现在唯一能做的  看来只有撞击人行道
And now the only thing I have impact on. Was the sidewalk.

15
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,800
永无止境

16
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,520
看见那家伙了吗
You seethat guy?

17
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,810
那就是不久前的我
That was me, Not so long ago.

18
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,160
一个毒酒不沾的人为何这个样子
what kind of guy, without a drug or alcohol problem looks this way?

19
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,950
除非是个作家
Only a writer.

20
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,830
奇怪的是没有人相信我刚签了一本新书合约
strangely enough, nobody believe that! actually had a book contract.

21
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,680
他是一种新型变型核因子  真的是我个人创作
He was disguised as a novel NF but it was really my personal manifesto.

22
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,640
在21世纪是很独特的
individuals in the 21 century.

23
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,240
创建一个乌托邦社会  我们都是某种...
Creating a utopian society, where are all sort a...

24
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,920
这真是...  这真是个...
It really is... It really is. A...

25
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,450
今天我一定要发威
Today was the day, I gonna kick its ass.

26
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,450
灵感来吧  来吧
Here we go, here we go...

27
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,580
会很精彩的
It's gonna be great.

28
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,050
只需要投入时间  坐在房间里
only need to invest time sifting in the room.

29
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,680
这是成功的关键
That's the key concept.

30
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,300
大门不出
Don't leave the room.

31
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,520
几个星期这样过去了
A few weeks passed this way.

32
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,470
或许是几个月
Maybe a few months.

33
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,810
至少我还有林迪
At least I still had Lindi.

34
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,510
就这样?
Just like that?

35
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,510
算了吧  爱迪...
Come on, Eddie...

36
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,490
我不觉得这令人惊讶
This is hardly a surprise.

37
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,000
我很惊讶
I'm surprised.

38
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,960
不要这样
Let's just not do this.

39
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,350
我准备在星期五交稿
I am gonna hand in 90 pages tomorrow or friday...

40
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,610
先看她如何说吧
if you just wait to see what she says.

41
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,930
-爱迪  -什么?
- Eddie! - What?

42
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,940
我知道事情将会怎样  我是  曾经是你的女朋友
I know how it's going. I am ... I was your girlfriend.

43
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,560
女朋友已不足以形容你
This word doesn't even begin to describe what you are to me.

44
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,810
伙伴  借贷公司
Partner? Squeeze?

45
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,900
恋人  情妇
Paramour. Inamorata

46
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,180
清洁工  提款机
Cleaning Lady. Bank.

47
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,070
即使这样
Even so...

48
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,950
你要知道
What's mine is yours too.

49
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,240
我会给你所有我将来拥有的  甚至后半生
And you know that I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

50
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,780
其实我有想过  我们也许应该...
In fact, I was thinking, that we should probably...

51
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,290
不要求婚
Don't propose!

52
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,560
为什么不?
Why not?

53
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,440
因为你曾经的婚姻太"美好"了
Because it worked out so "well" for you last time.

54
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,830
的确如此  我刚毕业就和梅利莎结婚了
it's true, I was married once, right out of college to melissa.

55
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,430
我愿意
I do.

56
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,980
可是很短暂
Briefly.

57
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,120
这样不行
This isn't working.

58
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,690
虽然你说的都是事实  但我仍然爱你
Well even though everything you said is true, I still love you.

59
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,220
我得回去工作
I gotta get back to work.

60
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,680
你还没有告诉我怎么回事
You didn't even tell me what happened.

61
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,380
-我得到那份工作了  -真的?
- I got it! - You did?

62
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,870
真的  我现在是名编辑
Hum, I am an editor.

63
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,900
有自己的助手  相信吗?
I'll have my own assistant. You believe that?

64
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,460
当然相信  你应得的
Yea, Of course I believe you. You deserve it.

65
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,560
谢谢
Thanks.

66
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,520
她当时是对的  为什么要容忍?
She was right. Why stick it out.

67
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,310
我刚错过了机会
I had clearly missed my own chance.

68
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,590
我童年记得的
We both knew what was backing.

69
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,810
在新泽西州老家  在我房间的下铺
The lower bunk of my childhood bedroom in Jersey.

70
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,950
爸爸邀请我加入
My Father happy to welcome me into...

71
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,850
一个牙齿实验
the challenging field of dental supply inventory.

72
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,220
爱迪・莫拉
Eddie Morra!

73
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,660
所有跟你没有多余关系的人
Of all the useless relationships better forgot and put away in mothballs.

74
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,060
最好把他忘记  我的前小舅子
Is there any more useless than the ex-brother in law?

75
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,080
这么巧  多久没见了?  九年了
Holy Shit, man! How long it's been? Nine years?

76
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,580
你还好吗?  看起来你像个流浪汉
Are you alright? You look like you livin' on the streets.

77
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,790
怎么回事
What's going on?

78
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,910
没什么  我在写作
Not much. Ehmm, I am writing... writing a lot.

79
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,650
你还在尝试写作?
Oh, you still trying to write?

80
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,050
事实上  我跟书商已经有合约
In a matter of fact, I have a book contract

81
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,650
-真的?  那很好  -是的
- Really? It's great. - Yes.

82
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,860
你呢  还在做药品生意?
What abou you? Still dealing?

83
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,670
我看起来像是还在买卖药品?  
Do I look like I am still dealing?

84
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,050
不不  当然不
No, you don't, no, no.

85
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,760
走吧  去喝一杯  聊聊你的书
Come on, let's get a drink I wonna hear about this book.

86
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,560
下午2点  太早了吧
I don't know, it's two o'clock in the afternoon.

87
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,570
几时起你也在乎喝酒时间了?
And when does that ever stopped you?

88
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,780
好吧
Well.

89
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,330
梅利莎现在怎么样
So, so how is Melissa doing?

90
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,410
-给你  -谢谢
- Here you go. - Thanks.

91
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,540
我不可能知道  没见她
I wouldn't know, I don't see her.

92
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,190
她搬到了北部

93
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,760
在家做网上销售的工作

95
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,350
2个孩子  丈夫是谁?
Couple of kids. Who is the husband?

96
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,750
真想知道的话  那个人已经离开了她
He walked out on her, if you really wonna know.

97
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,690
你会在乎吗  老兄
What do you care, man?

98
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,980
你们的婚姻好象仅持续了5分钟
You were married for like five minutes.

99
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,590
我不想谈她  说说你吧
I don't wonna talk about her. I want to talk about you.

100
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,600
说说你的书进展如何
Tell me about this book. How's it going?

101
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:46,230
比原定计划慢了  没赶上进度
Well it's a.... I am behind, I am behind on my book...

102
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,740
-你写多少了?  -一个字也没写
- How much you already written of it? - Not one word.

103
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,080
-创作问题是吗  -是的
- Creative problems, uhm? - Yeah.

104
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,670
我想我可以帮忙  只此一次
I suppose, I can help you with that. Just this once.

105
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,600
别  别  别...
Oh, no, no, no...

106
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,810
你甚至还不知道是什么
You do not even know what it is.

107
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,010
-你还在买卖药品  -兄弟  我一早就转行了
- You still dealing. - Brother, I am lightyears from that now.

108
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,040
现在我在一家制药公司作咨询工作
I've been doing some consultung for a pharmaceutical company.

109
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,230
在地下工厂造假伟哥  算了吧
On a magic lab for fake viagra... come on.

110
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,850
不  这是一个独家产品  明年上市
No. This is an exclusive product. This coming on the streets next year.

111
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,070
通过了临床试验  已得到联邦食品药监局认可
Adopted by clinical tests and approved by the FDA.

112
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,360
只是出于好奇
Just out of curiosity and that's all...

113
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,980
让我看看
Let me see.

114
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,490
里面是什么?
What's in it?

115
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,730
他们发现了激活大脑潜能的方法
They've identified these receptors in the brain that actived specific circus.

116
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:46,140
据说人只能运用大脑20%的能力
And you know how they say that we can only access 20% of our brain.

117
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,640
这药可使大脑100%运作
All of this does. It let you access all of it.

118
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,200
弗恩  看着我  我跟你一样吗?
Vernon, look at me. Do I looked like you?

119
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,250
我虽然萎靡不振  意志消沉
I'm broken, I'm depressed of my ass.

120
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,880
但我不认为夸夸其谈和毒品能让我的生活
I do not think that my life can take some sudden of spring,

121
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,580
发生突然转变  变得出名  富有
famous, fortune, by taking a shiny brags and drug.

122
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,560
是的  什么时候
Yes. When?

123
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,900
告诉他  我不能这样做
Tell him I can not do that.

124
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:12,200
不  你告诉他  就现在
No. Do tell. No, now!

125
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,210
恐怕我现在必须离开了
I'm afraid I must leave you now.

126
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,270
但我真的还想再跟你聊聊  打电话给我
But I really do wonna do this again, so call me.

127
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,550
这个算是礼物
And that's on the house.

128
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,180
我不想要
I do not want it.

129
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,480
别没良心
Do not be ungrateful.

130
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,700
你知道价格吗  一颗8百美元  吓人吧
You know how much it costs? 800 bucks. Pop!

131
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,180
不用客气
You're welcome.

132
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,610
回家的路上  我想着梅利莎
On the way home, I thought about Melissa.

133
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,190
她怎么也成了失败者呢
How can she be a failure too?

134
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,940
她很聪明  比身边的任何人都聪明
She been so smart. Smarter than anyone around her.

135
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,740
显然这必定跟爱迪有直接关系
Clearly, there was directline between this Eddie.

136
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,940
下午三点就有些醉
Slightly drunk at three o'clock and other things.

137
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,090
吐在他老板的桌上
vomiting on the boss' desk...

138
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,450
或是偷吗啡自杀
or steal morphine of dying.

139
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,660
怎能怪琳达抛弃我呢
So who can blame Linda for dumping me.

140
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,490
说到底  一颗药丸还能让我糟到哪里去
In the end, how much worse could it get?

141
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,190
我不想见到任何人
I don't want to see anybody.

142
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,530
尤其是房东那年青而又令人厌恶的妻子
Especially not my landlord's nasty young wife.

143
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,400
-瓦莱丽  周二  -够了  够了
- Valerie, on Tuesday ... - No, enough, ok?

144
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,760
史帝夫来收租金的话  你可以跟他瞎编
Steve handles the rent, so you can fed your crap to him!

145
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,750
我突然有了别的理由摆脱她
I suddenly had extra reason to get away from her.

146
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,540
我草率的吞下了药丸
I had thoughtlessly ingested a substance.

147
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,160
付他妈的房租
Pay the damn rent!

148
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,390
我开始知道这药的作用
I got remarkably little information from Veron about what this drug would do.

149
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,170
你甚至可以找份邮件快递工作来付房租
you can even be a biker messanger and come up with that .

150
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,890
如果是迷幻药怎么办
What if it's a hallucinogen?

151
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,870
真是可悲
It's pathetic!

152
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,100
我的天  
Oh My God!

153
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,010
发作的时候还要听她说话  我可能会跳窗
Listening to her rag when I was triping, I would jump out of the window.

154
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,000
回神  你在听我说吗
Hello? Are you listening to me?

155
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,030
知道吗  你很快会被赶出去
Do you get it? You gonna be out on the streets!

156
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,890
接着我感觉到了
And then I felt it.

157
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,810
就象盲人复明一般
I was blind, but now I see.

158
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,010
-怎么回事?  -什么?
- What's wrong? - What?

159
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,850
你不喜欢我  我不怪你
You do not like me and I dont blame you.

160
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,050
你认为我是一个失败者  
You think I am a loser,

161
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,570
一个只会欠你老公房钱的失败者
who doesn't pay his rent and is sponging out your husband.

162
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,940
你巴不得我饮弹自尽
You whishing I blow my brain out.

163
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,580
但我的存在不应该让你这么沮丧
but my existence shouldn't make you this upset.

164
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,280
-究竟什么原因?  -不关你的事
- What is it? - That's none of your business!

165
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,560
法律学校的课程有问题
Something wrong in Law school?

166
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,970
你怎么知道我在读法律学校
How do you know I am in law school?

167
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,790
谁没事会拿着一本已逝大法官的书
People normally not carrying around dry concipated academical books about a dead supreme court justice.

168
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,200
你偷偷摸摸跟踪我
You are a creep! You been following me.

169
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,600
不  我看到那本书
No, I just noticed the book.

170
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,340
你只看到了个书角  怎么会知道
You saw only a corner. How did you know that?

171
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,330
我以前看到过  12年前上大学时
I've seen it before. 12 years ago in college...

172
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,630
坐在沙发上想着做爱
sitting on the couch and wanted to make sex.

173
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,810
等着她走出浴室  
I was waiting for her coming out of the bathroom,

174
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,340
希望她有保险套
hoping she'd have a condom.

175
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,530
不知怎的  我的潜意识
Somehow, my subconscious has served this up.

176
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,670
让我回想起这些记忆
A memory I wouldn't even recorded.

177
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,670
一些我以为忘记了的记忆变得即取即用
It was there the whole time and all I need was the access.

178
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,560
如果你想写论文  这本书不合适
If you writing a paper, thats not the book I'd use.

179
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,470
谁问你的意见了?
Who asked you?

180
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,880
就从那儿开始吧  黑斯廷处理过很多案子
Hasting has its own history, I'd start there.

181
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,110
有趣的是这家伙是个白痴
Interesting point dramatically, this guy was an idiot...

182
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,610
他大部分的理论观点都是由被他解雇的秘书写的
which gives increased theory that one of the clerks he has fired actually wrote most this guy's major oponions.

183
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,810
你用谷歌搜索他秘书的儿子  他们很乐意谈论自己的父亲
You google the clerk's sons. They love to talk to you on their dad.

184
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,450
他们能告诉你一些别人都不知道的事情
They give you something that no one else says.

185
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,700
这样你便有一些比别人特别的课题
So you have something that no one has... information from the museum show,

186
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,040
只要大略的阅读
half read article some PBS docomentory.

187
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,020
知识点就会出现在眼前  并且自己融汇
It was all bubbling up of my front... mixing itself together...

188
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,800
混合成一杯极好的资讯鸡尾酒
into a sparkling cocktail of useful information.

189
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,680
她没有机会(拒绝我)
She didn't have a chance.

190
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,100
那你有什么建议
So, what are your suggestions?

191
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,540
我们当然也有做她的论文
We really worked on her paper too.

192
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,130
45分钟就完成了一篇很棒的论文
In 45 minutes, it was a polish jam.

193
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,760
她非常的愉快
She was pleased.

194
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,660
家
Home.

195
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,480
这不可能是我的家  可能吗?
But it couldn't be my home, could it!?

196
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,680
谁会象这样生活?
Who would live like this?

197
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,800
真想一把火烧掉这一切
First thought was torching.

198
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,580
但我还有理智
But, sanity prevailed.

199
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,620
这是到底是什么药?  我不敢相信
What was this drug? I couldn't stay messy on it.

200
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,920
我已经6个小时没有抽烟  也没进食
I hadn't had a cigarette in 6 hours, I hadn't eaten.

201
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,010
但我感觉神清气爽  究竟是什么?
So, I am steamiest and tidy. What was this?

202
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,730
象毒品一样强化感官?
A drug for people, who wonna be more heino retentive?

203
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,910
我没有幻觉  不觉得怪异  只觉得头脑清醒
I wasn't high, wasn't wired, just clear.

204
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,550
我知道需要做什么  怎样做
I knew what I needed to do, and how to do it.

205
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,100
第二天早上  当我开始思索时
The next morning, I send a little probe down into my brain.

206
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,300
感觉脑袋不灵光了
No signs of brilliance came up to gravy.

207
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:50,280
我被打回原形
In short, I was back.

208
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,360
但有些东西保留了下来
But something remained.

209
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,960
-你在开玩笑吗?  -没有
- Are you kidding. - No

210
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,680
-白纸生出字来?  -是的
- Words have appeared on paper... - Yes.

211
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,200
-你写的  -您看3页吧
- Written by you? - All I ask you to do, is to read 3 pages.

212
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,870
就看3页
Just read 3 Pages in the next hour.

213
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:17,000
如果你读不下去  我退还您的预付款
and if you don't want to keep reading, I give you back the advance.

214
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,680
行  爱迪  忙你的去
OK, Eddie. Go ahead.

215
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,730
爱迪  到家给我打个电话
Eddie, give me a call, when you get in.

216
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,960
爱迪  我读了40多页  给我打电话
Eddie, I am 40 pages further in. call me.

217
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,500
这的确有点意思  我仍在读
This is a little crip odd, but I am still reading.

218
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,380
好吧  你是如何办到的?
Ok, how did you do this?

219
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,440
我真的喜欢  到家赶快给我来电  好吗
I'd really like... call me the minute you get it! Call, ok?

220
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,490
-是谁?  -弗恩  是爱迪
- Who is it? - Vernon, its Eddie.

221
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,820
-哪个爱迪?  -莫拉
- Eddie who? - Morra.

222
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,210
来的不是时候  爱迪
Not a good time, Eddie.

223
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,060
弗恩  我真的需要的和你谈谈
Hey Vern, I just really need to talk to you.

224
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,750
-弗恩  发生了什么  -别担心  我没事
- Vern, what happened? - Don't worry about it, I'm fine.

225
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,300
爱迪  你终于感兴趣了?
So, Eddie, you are interested after all.

226
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,490
这东西太神奇了
The stuff is amazing.

227
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,120
聪明人服用效果更好
Works better, if you are already smart.

228
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,290
弗恩  谁把你打伤的?  
Vernon, who did this to you?

229
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,330
别打听了
Trust me, you do not want to know.

230
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,140
那个药叫什么名字 
So what is this called?

231
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,030
还没有正式名字
Still no name on the street.

232
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,880
厨子都叫它NZT-48
However, boys in the kitchen, are calling it NZT-48.

233
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,580
厨子  听起来没得到药监局批准
Boys in the "kitchen" ? Doesn't sound very FDA approved.

234
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,710
药监局批准?  那都是骗人的  你会相信?
FDA-approved. That's a lie. You didn't believe this shit, did you?

235
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,310
好了  我了解到的是
OK, what we have here,

236
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,730
一个很久不见  极不可靠的家伙
some unknown, untested, possibly dangerous drug...

237
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,030
从身份不明的实验室里骗出一些
scammed out of some unidentifed lab somewhere,

238
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,640
未经测试的不明危险药物
given to me by a highly unrealible guy I hadn't seen in years.

239
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,020
你还想要更多?  
So do you want more?

240
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,290
要  肯定要
Yes, definitely.

241
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,080
好的  我们谈谈  不过我现在需要你帮忙
Alright, we'll talk about it. But I need a favour first.

242
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,090
你瞧  这个样子我可没法出去
Obviously, I am in no condition to go out right now.

243
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,260
所以如果你能下去  
So I was wondering if you could pop down...

244
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,430
到干洗店把我的西装取回来
at drycleaners and grab my suit for me.

245
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,080
再弄点早餐来
And maybe grab a little breakfast for us.

246
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,830
他知道我会去的
He knew, he had me.

247
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,140
没问题
Sure.

248
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,070
从现在起  我会高兴的听他差遣
From now on, I'd be happily be his errand boy.

249
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,770
帮他擦窗  洗厕所
Wash his windows, scrab his toilets.

250
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,310
替他做任何事  只为得到他的药丸
Anything I can do, to get my hands on this little clear pill...

251
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,540
成为强化版爱迪
that would bring back... enchanced Eddie.

252
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,460
弗恩
Vern?

253
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,290
弗恩
Vern?

254
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,740
911  有什么紧急情况
911, what's you emergency?

255
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,380
我要报告...  一起谋杀
Hi, I need to report... a murder.

256
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,470
是的  7B
7B, yes.

257
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,660
我不会离开的
OK, I won't.

258
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,000
他们花了很长时间才到达
It took them forever.

259
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,300
我站在那里  开始明白...
And the longer I stood there, the clearer I saw.

260
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,120
弗恩一早就知道对方会找上门
Vern had know, whoever had done this.

261
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,050
而对方找上门的原因只有一个
And one guess, what they have been looking for.

262
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,470
但他们找到了吗
But have they found it?

263
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,310
如果在家里做饭  我也没命了
Shit. You are a cook, I'd be dead too.

264
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,450
警察  请开门
Police department. Open the door please.

265
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,790
警察  快开门
Police department. Open the door.

266
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,900
请开门

昨天我在街上遇见他
Just before I met him on the street, and... yeah.

289
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,180
我的天
Oh my God!

290
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,200
我并不吃惊  他牵扯进一些事里
I wish, I was more surprised, he was involved in some stuff.

291
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,690
我还是别说了
I better not to say any more.

292
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,750
对  别说了
No, no. It's a bad idea.

293
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,320
我们也许应该见一面  行吗?
So we should probably meet or something, right?

294
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,740
不知道  我要忙葬礼  
I don't know. I gotta do the funeral and...

295
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,390
谁知道还有什么别的事

296
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,080
我们不能见面  知道了吗
We can't meet, ok?

297
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,290
好吧  那我们还是在葬礼上见吧
Ok, I guess I'll see you at the funeral then...

298
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,480
不  我不想见你  请别来  
No! I don't, I don't want that. Please don't.

299
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,020
等忙完了我会打给你
I'll call you with some point when this is over.

300
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,550
-好的  那就这样  -嗯

303
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,580
值得冒险
Worth the risk?

304
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,420
是你的话会怎么做
What would you do?

305
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,430
弗恩的现金  还有那喷涌而出的空前的脑动力
Vern's cash, combined with unprecedented surge motivation...

306
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,240
让我在四天内完成我的书
enabled me to finish the book in 4 days.

307
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:37,510
一天一颗  能做到的永无止境
A tablet a day, and what I can do with my day was limitless.

308
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,210
三天内学会弹钢琴
I learned to play the piano in three days.

309
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,550
数学变得有用  有趣
Math became useful and fun.

310
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,820
全押
I'm all in there.

311
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:55,690
甚至随便听听外语就能流利的说
Even half listing to any language had became fluid.

312
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,810
所以  你认为莎士比亚甘于平凡?
So Shakespeare empower mediocrity?

313
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,510
不和你争
There is no argue with you.

314
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,480
这很棒
This was great.

315
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:15,710
海伦已确定患上肿瘤
So mama has been doing research on Helen's tumors.

316
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:19,010
而根据医学纪录  这个病
And it's totally clear that anybody will familiar with Dumas Pere Porthos...

317
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,200
须要用到铂基药物
should be suffer mining Platinum base double gradual mental,

318
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,910
结合环戊烯酮酸去治疗
if I could have some ciclopentane acid.

319
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,740
突然间  我明白了一切的一切
I suddenly knew everything about everything.

320
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,230
当然  还有一个暂时性增长
Of course, there is a temporary increase,

321
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,550
但两年后便会崩溃
but then the collapse of the action is complete after two years.

322
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,830
不会  因为有防护措施
No, cause there are safeguards.

323
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,200
反侵略扩张?  那不存在的  
Against the aggressive expansion?

324
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,540
人性中并没有防护措施
There aren't. 'cause there are no safeguards in human nature.

325
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,450
我们离题太远了
We are wired to overreach.

326
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,580
每个国家历史上都有法律和城墙
Look at history, all the countries has rules and wall.

327
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,390
葡萄牙曾拥有庞大的船队  
Portugal with his big massive navy.

328
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,400
他们现在得到的却是袜子和廉价的保险套
All they got now are socks and cheap condoms.

329
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,200
英国人的想法更可笑
Or the British in their costumes.

330
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,900
没有人认为:  嘿  我们做得相当好  
Nobody thinks: hey we are doing pretty well.

331
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,760
我们有朋友  有家园  
We got friends, we got home,

332
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,320
在瑞士银行的帐户里有大笔金钱
we got a big swiss bank account.

333
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,410
"不要在冬季里入侵俄罗斯  
You know what? "Let's not invade Russia in winter.

334
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,840
咱们回家喝啤酒吧  利息就够花了"
Let's go home, let's pop a beer, let's live in all the interests".

335
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:55,930
是的
Yes.

336
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,030
我的大脑充满了讯息
My brain was full of such things.

337
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,310
所有我读过的  听过的  看过的  
Everything I've ever read, heard, seen...

338
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,930
都井井有条等待调用
was now organized and availible...

339
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,800
就这样喷涌而出
here it is, here you go.

340
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,080
爱迪
Eddie!

341
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,690
我肯定你有一个投资组合  若没有
Listen, I'm sure you have a portfolio but if not,

342
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,420
我非常有兴趣和你一起工作
I'd be very interested working with you.

343
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,640
好  凯文
Good, Kevin.

344
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,540
我交了新朋友  他们邀请我到海滩游玩
I made new friends who invited me to the beach.

345
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,240
不是附近的海滩
The beach... was not nearby.

346
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,690
我不再畏惧  不再害羞
All my fear, all my shyness... gone.

347
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,120
越来越大胆
But it was not enough for me to relax.

348
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,740
唯一的问题是  如果停止前进
only problem, if I wasn't moving forward.

349
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,450
我感觉自己会爆炸
I felt like I was going to explode.

350
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,160
-有人跳过吗  -你疯了吗?
- Anybody ever jumped? - Are you crazy?

351
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,860
-他要跳下去  -不  他不会跳的
- He is gonna do it. - No, he is not gonna do it.

352
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,180
我的天
God!

353
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,800
然后  我开始有个想法
Then I began to form an idea.

354
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,020
突然  我知道我应该怎么做
Suddenly, I knew exactly What I need to do.

355
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,530
不是写作  不是出书
It wasn't writing. It wasn't books.

356
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,610
比这更重要的事
It was much bigger than that

357
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,320
但需要钱才能实现
But it will take money to get there.

358
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,860
熊市的时候  没有人能赚很多钱
In the down market, nobody was making much.

359
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,980
那是因为没人有NZT
But no one had NZT.

360
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,330
用弗恩的8百块  我一天就赚了2千
With Vern's last 800 Dollars, I made $ 2,000 in a day.

361
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,760
第二天  7千5百
Next days, 7500.

362
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,350
太慢了
It was too slow.

363
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,550
我需要更多的资金
I'd need more capital.

364
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,180
银行不会借钱给我这样的人
Banks wont lending the guys like me.

365
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,680
他坐在那边的角落
He is in the corner back there.

366
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:54,590
丽芙告诉过你吧  我想借笔短期贷款
Liv told you that I want a short-term loan?

367
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,710
是的  我当时回话说  算了吧
Yes, and I said - forget it.

368
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,220
为什么?
Why?

369
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,910
我从没见过你  而且还没喜欢上你
Because I never seen you before and I don't like you already.

370
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,850
为什么要给你10万元?
Why would I give you 100,000 Dollars?

371
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:11,970
因为我能在4天翻倍
Because I quintuple my money 4 days in a row.

372
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,750
-你知道如何钻空子?  -不是钻空子
- So you got a fix on the game? - No, not a fix.

373
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,910
我用图表分析做了一些预测
I was able to calculate, sir. In pattern of use geogrphics.

374
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,620
如果你看看第四列  这是最初...
If you look at column four, This was the first...

375
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,910
被你看出来了
You're good.

376
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,400
好吧  这是钻空子
Ok, its a fix.

377
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:34,330
如果你被抓了打算怎么办
Yea, but when you get caught, what you gonna do then?

378
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:39,390
通常我不会记下谁借过钱给我
Well it's not as I if have a black book with your name in it,

379
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,380
还有  我很确定你是我惹不起的人
and besides, I get the strong feeling that you are not somebody I want to disappoint.

380
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,450
不要起来  我说不要起来  坐下
Do not get up. I said don't get up, sit down!

381
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,300
拿了钱  你就属于我了  明白吗
Ok, you take this, and you are mine, you understand?

382
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,370
若你不还  你知道会发生什么?
You don't pay, you know what we do?

383
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,610
我会把你的肚子割开  
I cut you at waist,

384
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,110
扯出你的肠子在你的脖子上打结
peel your skin up over your head and tie a knot in it.

385
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,950
你不会马上丧命  但最终窒息而亡
You dont't die from this, You suffocate.

386
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,950
祝你好运
Good luck.

387
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,660
我的新朋友  凯文・多伊尔  他教我怎样
My new friend, Kevin Doyle show me how you can get...

388
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,370
在一个交易日内赚取2倍半的利润
two and a half time your cash at day trade firm.

389
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,270
这一周来我一直在服用
I've been up the dose for over a week.

390
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,800
药物似乎加速了我的学习进度
It seemd to cut my learning curve.

391
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,490
为什么买入?  那公司的CEO正面临起诉
Why you buying this? The CEO ist just being indicted.

392
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,880
但并未对外发放防范信息
But not for the big fat defensive contract he bribed into.

393
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,860
或许内部被贿赂
That's still on.

394
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,450
下周一应该会公布
It should be announced next week.

395
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,100
我沉浸其中  忘我的亢奋
I was jacked in, booted up.

396
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,300
最后一周完结前  我的银行帐户
At the end of week, My brokerage account...

397
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,300
已超过2百万美元

398
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,330
消息迅速蔓延
Word quickly got out.

00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,940
你有19个消息
You have 19 messages.

安排你与卡尔・万隆会面
We got you a meeting with Karl van Loon.

407
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,150
卡尔・万隆想跟你会面
Karl van Loon wants to meet you?

408
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,890
似乎是这样
Apparently so.

409
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,890
但你不擅长金融
You know what's a finance gift.

410
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,390
你能帮卡尔・万隆做些什么?
What can you do for Karl van Loon?

411
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,060
什么时候会说意大利语了
Since when do you speak italian?

412
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,480
什么事都会改变的
All has changed for the better.

413
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,110
我猜  自己清醒了
I guess, someone gave me a wakeup call.

414
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,180
我希望你不是为我而改变  
I hope you didn't do it for me.

415
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,830
不  我只是想向你道歉
No, I just wanted to apologize to you.

416
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:24,680
我想让你知道  我不会再自暴自弃
And let you know that apparently my capacity for self-sabotage wasn't boundless after all.

417
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,470
问题是  你为什么要放弃我?
The real question is why did you ever put up with me?

418
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,180
我当时是爱你的
I was in love with you.

419
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,940
你的书何时面世?  
So when does the book come out?

420
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,540
下一年  你的新助手怎样了?
Next year. How is your new assistant?

421
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,660
她很好
She is good.

422
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,300
那...  你打算...

You know? I'm really happy you're here with me.

424
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,900
我为你骄傲
I'm proud of you.

425
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:01,700
而且...
And...

426
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,540
有一点点害怕你
And a little intimidated.

427
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,480
我们再一次开始(恋爱)
We started up again.

428
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,250
在她家
Her place.

429
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,450
在我家
My place.

430
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,940
任何地方
Basiclly every place.

431
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,140
"三天的掠夺式交易  不明身份的莫拉先生"

OK, give me that.

435
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:45,290
-他是神?  -晚一点来我家?
- He is god!? - You coming over later?

436
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,000
去不了  我没有钥匙
I can't. I don't have a key.

437
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,820
想起来了
Oh, that's right.

438
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,630
我可以要回来吗
Can I have it back?

439
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,190
-不  -不?
- No - No?

440
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,640
一定要那间公寓的钥匙?  新公寓的钥匙可以吗
I mean, does it have to be that key? Can it be a new key?

441
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,700
我们的公寓
Our place.

442
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,260
性价比问题
It'll be cost-effective.

443
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,580
你觉得我不实际
And you say I am not practical.

444
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,840
我送你上班
Can I walk you to work?

445
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,700
亲爱的  在看什么?
What are you doing, honey?

446
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,340
没什么
Nothing.

447
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,250
你该睡了
You should sleep.

448
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,690
明天不是要跟卡尔・万隆会面吗
Isn't your Van Loon meeting tomorrow?

449
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,640
爱迪
Edi?

450
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,440
你没事吧?
Are you okay?

451
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,650
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

452
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,070
你上次吃饭是什么时候?
When is the last time you ate something?

453
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:29,430
你在这  报纸上都是你
Here it is. Nice Article on the post.

454
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,280
他在路上
He is on his way.

455
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:38,200
我警告你  他很善变
Now be warned, he is mercurial.

456
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,310
一分钟前当你是朋友  下一分钟就能吃了你
One minute your best friend, the next you are lapper.

457
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,410
他需要直接的答案
And he needs direct answers.

458
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:46,020
一个错误  你便会失去机会
One mistake, and you have lost him forever.

459
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,660
我认为我们要预演一次
I think we should act out some scenarios.

460
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,320
我在进餐  凯文
I am eating, Kevin.

461
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,450
我说  你准备好了吗?
Hey, are you ready for this?

462
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,100
你肯定吗?  我的前途都在这了
Are you sure? 'cause I got a little bit line here.

463
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,090
何不吃份吐司
Have a toast here.

464
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,710
-约翰  -卡尔  很高兴见到你
- John. - Hi, Karl. Good to see you.

465
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,420
-你好  -爱迪
- How are you? - Eddie.

466
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:20,050
爱迪・莫拉  你的秘密是什么?
So, Eddie Morra, What is your secret?

467
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,660
配方
Medication.

468
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,980
我服用特殊的配方
I am on special medication.

469
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:25,670
是吗
Yeah.

470
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,110
有一套方法复杂的公式
There is a formula with a complex method,

471
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,460
当然研究也不可或缺  大量的研究
but of course research was a component, massive research.

472
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,300
我对所投资的公司了如指掌  其一举一动尽在眼底
I knew absolutely everything, every move the companies that I bought.

473
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,610
我办公室内的文件堆得有喜马拉雅山那么高  
Papers stack up like the Himalaya in my office.

474
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,220
你知道为什么吗?
And you know what?

475
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,510
-股价上涨  -间不容发
- The stocks went up. - By a hair.

476
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,350
当然  股票价格已经上涨  谁还愿意做那些
Sure the stocks rolls, but who wants to do all that work for...

477
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,950
琐碎的  微不足道的事
a shitty little optic?

478
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,870
短期持有不能增加人们的期望
That's not the grow people expect from a short-time holding.

479
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:52,000
我偏向于听信传闻和流言
So I dispensed with the hard statics and went through to rumor mails.

480
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:55,560
你根据传闻和流言来投资?
So your investments are based on the tom-tom speaking industry?

481
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:59,410
是的  股价并不是真的根据一个公司的运营状况变动
Sure.The shareprice is not really basing how a company works.

482
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,910
而是由散户的心理决定
Its about how mass psychology works.

483
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:03,410
所以如果我发现确定的计算方法能预测股票走向的话
So, if I found certail algorithms to predict how stocks grow...

484
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:06,120
制造流言就是你所谓的散户心理
Pattery-ignition, that's your psychology.

485
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,180
不能这么说  这模式不是每个人都能理解
Well, not everybody understands the patterns.

486
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,900
这的确有效
And that give me a little bit more optic,

487
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,170
但这只是部分窍门  所以我还去了3号门
but it's a partly trick, so that why I went on Door Number 3.

488
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,590
Door Number 3: 美国德克萨斯州奥斯丁市的一家广告代理商

489
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:15,460
你是说它是终极公式?
You really implying that it's some sort of ultimate formula?

490
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,990
他只用了10天时间就将资产从1万2千增长到2百30万  
He went from 12,000 to 2.3 million in ten days.

491
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,090
皮尔斯先生  我确实有个公式
I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce.

492
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:22,600
大妄想
Delusion of grandeur.

493
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:26,020
我没有大妄想  只有大秘诀
I have no delusion of grandeur. I have a actural recipe for grandeur.

494
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,450
爱迪  我不知道你是什么人  在玩什么把戏
I don't know who you are, Eddie. And what your game is.

495
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,860
但我能肯定  你的处事方式和我不同
But I'm sure one thing, you don't work in my world.

496
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,880
在我认识的投资者中
I was surrounded by investors...

497
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:39,780
你是独特的一个
and you have no lines which shows the pride and fear which is...

498
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:42,520
这并不代表我更喜欢你的方式
not the style I like yours any better,

499
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,290
但你的方式的确是我们不曾见过的
but it is obvious picture you style which we haven't seen before.

500
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:49,430
看看这些公司  告诉我你的想法
Take a look this companies, tell me what do you think.

501
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,210
-现在?  -是的  慢慢看
- Right now? - Yes. take your time.

502
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,340
没问题
Sure.

503
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,320
这些公司都是分散的  对吗
These companies aren't the question, are they?

504
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,550
解释一下
Explain.

505
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,550
除非你两面讨好
Unless you playing both sides of the fence...

506
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,580
掌控整个能源
control the whole power actual a lot.

507
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,870
不对  通过并购市场是没法做到的
No, these companies wouldn't get you there in a merging market.

508
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,600
你也许会...
You would have... Oh! wow!

509
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,220
这一定是次非常大的合并
This must be some big-ass merger you count to plating.

510
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,850
只有一家公司会对
And there really only one company would love blame...

511
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:35,350
与万隆合并有异议
justify the merger with Van Loon associates.

512
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,720
谁告诉你的?
Who've you been talking to?

513
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,560
我只是分析细节  汉克・艾德伍德真的会加入合并?
Oh, I am just connacting the dots. Hank Ed Wood would really go for it?

514
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,200
不管你是个杰出的骗子  还是思维敏捷的年青人
Whether you are amazing con nor you are a so smart young man....

515
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,500
你们俩一起...
Come on! The two of you together...

516
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,760
全世界都不得不来乞求能源
The whole world have to come begging for...

517
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,830
就象哈沃・特斯尼斯自吹为大师般不遗余力
energy like Hover Twisness blowed guru.

518
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,540
回到主题上来  你还有什么发现
Now you going backwards. What else you got?

519
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:55,900
预测
Prediction.

520
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,760
-不会成功  -为什么?
- It won't come off. - Why is that?

521
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:01,610
-你得应付利比亚  -真的吗?
- You have to back off Lybia - Really?

522
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,350
但是  我不想在车内讨论
But, you dont want here this in a car...

523
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,070
好吧  给你个机会
All right, you get your shout.

524
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,980
明天十点见我  
Meet me tomorrow for same ages at 10,

525
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,380
你要真是有勇有谋的话  就由你来操作这次交易
and tell me the guts little Shimark on it's right home. You structure this deals.

526
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,140
-你要做足准备  -听凭您的安排
- And you better be prepared. - I am on your disposal.

527
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,450
你不会真的住这里吧?
You don't really live here, do you?

528
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,230
斯巴达人的个头并不比美塞尼亚人大(英雄不问出身)
Well, the spartans won't bigger than mensenities.

529
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,080
是么  最终斯巴达人失败了
Yeah, and they eventurally get their asses kicked.

530
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:37,200
我没回家  想走走  一边走一边吸收  摄取
I didn't go in. I wanted to walk, move, digest, ingest.

531
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,500
你知道生命中有的时刻
There are moments in life, moments, when you know,

532
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,000
你只要跨过那座桥  便是新生
you crossed the bridge, you old life is over.

533
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,660
万隆是我的那座桥  我终于有了出头之日
van Loon was my bridge. Finally I had my shout.

534
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:47,750
华尔街也将成为我的垫脚石
Wall Street would be my steppingstone.

535
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,260
但我能走多远呢
But how far can I go?

536
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,500
首席执行官  跨国公司  甚至总统
CEO? A global force? Maybe president.

537
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,900
假以时日  我会叫世界震惊
Time cellody. Shook up the free world and got the things done.

538
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:08,970
突然  
Suddenly,

539
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:13,050
思维再次跳跃
there was another skip.

540
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,780
我怎么走过20条街的
How had I gone the last 20 blocks?

541
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,820
又过了10条街  然后发现...
I get another 10 blocks. And then...

542
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,150
自己正走在市郊住宅区
I was way uptown.

543
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,320
这是哪一间酒吧
What bar was this?

544
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:09,830
打架?  
A fight?

545
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:11,750
我不知道怎么打
I don't know how to fight.

546
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,500
或许知道?
or do I?

547
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,400
手这样架住他嘴巴
Set  her fingers in her mouth.

548
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,670
象这样
Like this.

549
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
攻击重要部位  眼睛  脖子  小腹
Attack vital Taek. Eyes, neck, intestines.

550
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,190
无论怎样  不要放弃  破坏他们的平衡
Whatever you do, do not end. Cut out the balance of your attacker.

551
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,050
集中力量攻击
disrupt the balance. Use the focus of your body.

552
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:30,930
当药效过去后
When it finally stopped.

553
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:33,750
我不记得在自己的生命中有那18小时
I couldn't account for the last 18 hours in my life.

554
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,580
是我  我还以为你会来
Hey, It's me. I thought you'd coming over.

555
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:03,170
你还好吗?  到家给我打个电话
Is everything okay? Call me when you get there.

556
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:46,540
我决定在不吃NZT的情况下看看万隆的文件
Even off NZT, I've decided to give Van Loon's files a shoot.

557
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:56,180
天书一般
They were hieroglyphics.

558
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,620
-你好  -凯文  我是爱迪
- Hello? - Kevin, this is Eddie.

559
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:05,610
听好  我不能来参加今天的会议
Listen, I can't make the meeting today.

560
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,030
你在说什么?
What you talking about?

561
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,670
我病了  今天不会来
I can not come today. I'm sick.

562
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,790
你现在不能感冒
You can't have the flu right now.

563
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:13,660
他们不会再给这样的机会
They never give this chance again.

564
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,300
我知道  听我说...
I know, listen. I just...

565
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,610
我看着这一切
I looked all this, otherwise.

566
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,910
你昨天都做什么了
What you've been doing last day?

567
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,350
凯文  我...
Kevin, I...

568
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,060
你明白吗  这是测试
Don't you get it? This is a test.

569
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:29,340
明白  但我现在过不了测试
Yes, well. I can't pass the test right now.

570
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,710
我如何知道你过不了
And how may I know if you don't.

571
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,690
-我理解  听我说...  -你听我说
- I know, listen. I just... - Listen to me...

572
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:37,470
振作精神  来开会
pull yourself together and get done to the meeting.

573
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,260
好吧  我会去的
OK, ok. I'll be there, I'll be there.

574
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:12,590
-你好吗  爱迪  -很高兴再次见到你
- Hi. How are you? Eddie? - Good to see you again.

575
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,110
坐
Sit down.

576
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:22,440
-你知道些什么关于汉克・埃德伍德?  -埃德伍德...
- What do you know about Henk Ed Wood? - Ed Wood...

577
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,990
他是个不因循传统的人
He is an iconoclast...

578
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:32,010
拥有半个科罗拉多州
owns about half of Colardo.

579
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:35,120
这就是你准备的  爱迪?
This is prepare, Eddy?

580
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:40,360
这是埃德伍德专题讨论?  每个人都了解他吗
Is this Ed Wood one on one? And does everybody know about Ed Wood.

581
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:42,460
两年前他在哪
Where was he two years ago?

582
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:47,600
不知道在哪
Nowhere.

583
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:52,030
两年前  福布斯排行榜还没有他
Two years ago, he wasn't even on Forbes' radar.

584
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,350
这是一个极大的飞跃  对吗?
This is a great big forward, right?

585
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:58,670
我落后于这个家伙
I'm backward this guy,

586
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:00,440
不知从哪儿冒出来的
comes out nowhere, so strong...

587
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,690
甚至在我安插人进他的公司前就已经很强大了
has been on the run before I could even get anybody in his camp.

588
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,130
将我挤出了最大两家企业之列  是北半球最好的公司
beats me out of two properties, best companies in the north...

589
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:17,870
我们面前的这间酒店
We are in the front of the hotel where a woman...

590
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:22,090
昨晚在房间内发现一名女性死者  确认为玛丽亚・温伯格
identified as Maria Vinberg, found dead last night in the room.

591
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,790
警方审问了酒店的员工几个小时
Police interrogated for several hours Employees at the hotel.

592
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:39,100
目击者曾看到受害者与一名男子在一起
witness saw a man together with the victim.

593
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,700
我们要怎么说服他  有什么主意?
How can we convince him to be in this game, got any ideas?

594
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:44,120
你怎么看
What do you think?

595
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,350
我想你跟他们不一样
I guess you're not one of those guys, are you? Eddy.

596
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:59,590
你会被电视分散注意力?
We lose you if there's a screen in the room?

597
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,510
世界在旋转  时间在流逝
There are tectonic plates which are shifting right under us.

598
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,700
稍等会儿
Hold on, one second.

599
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,810
这可能吗  我杀了人?
Was it possible? Could I've kill someone.

600
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:35,310
是我做的吗
Was it even me?

601
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,880
爱迪  是梅利莎
Edi? This is Melissa.

602
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:47,280
弗恩是否给了你一些东西  那些东西很危险
Did Veron give you something? Since these things are dangerous.

603
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,510
梅利莎
Melissa?

604
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:52,550
能见个面吗?  我要和你谈谈
Can we meet somewhere I have to talk to you.

605
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:54,140
我们正在谈
We talking now.

606
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:57,460
不  我们下午在比利餐厅见面吧
No, let meet at Billys on afternoon.

607
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:59,900
爱迪  我不能
Edi, I can't.

608
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:01,580
来吧
Please, come.

609
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:06,070
这很重要  我真的想知道你说的那个东西
This is important. I really need to know what you talking about.

610
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,990
然后我意识到  还有一些人知道NZT的存在
I realized that there were other people, who might now about NZT.

611
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,980
弗恩的其他客户
Vernon's other clients.

612
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,300
你好  我找杰瑞・布兰登
Yeah, hi. Can I talk to Jerry Braden?

613
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:57,980
杰瑞住院了
Jerry is in hospital.

614
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,880
-为什么?  -他精神不太好
- What is it? - Yea, he is not doing well at all.

615
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,090
你好  保罗・卡普兰是吗?
Hello. Paul Kaplan is there?

616
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:08,950
不在  保罗三天前去世
It is not. Paul died three days ago.

617
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:12,230
我的天  抱歉
God! Sorry.

618
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,130
他开始是头痛  然后在工作中昏倒
He started getting headaches, then he collapsed at work.

619
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,470
现在还住在重症监护室
Now he is in ICU.

620
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,570
祝他早日康复  谢谢
Wish him all the best. Thanks.

621
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,690
我拨出的寻人电话
Of all the people I called...

622
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:24,190
三个死了  其余的都病了
three were dead, and the rest were sick.

623
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,630
你好
Hello.

624
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:51,400
哪位
Hello?

625
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,500
快开  快
Go! GO!

626
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:09,120
爱迪  
Eddie.

627
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:12,410
梅利莎
Melissa.

628
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:28,730
不要告诉我  "我看起来不错"  我知道不好
Do not tell me that I look good, Because I know.

629
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,910
我不想你看到这样的我
I did not want to see me this way.

630
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,350
你看起来不错
You look good.

631
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,470
是的  我设法改变我的生活
Yes, I sorted to get myself together.

632
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:42,280
NZT会对你产生效果的
NZT will do that to you.

633
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:45,980
-什么意思?  -我也服用过
- What do you mean? - I mean I took it too.

634
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,500
-弗恩没告诉你更多  对吧  -没告诉
- Vernie didn't tell you this, did he? - No.

635
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:54,330
当他告诉我这药时  我想一探其中的秘密
When we he told me about this new drug I was like down the hedge...

636
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:56,140
确实让我惊讶
and it was amazing.

637
00:55:57,150 --> 00:56:00,480
我在45分钟内读完布赖恩・格林的《优雅的宇宙》
I read Brian Green's The Elegant Universe in 45 minutes.

638
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:02,400
而且我看懂了  明白了
and I understood it.

639
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:05,180
我的工作效率一夜之间忽然增长
My productivity has increased the sharply overnight.

640
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:06,880
我上司开始嫉恨我
And my boss started to hate me.

641
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:13,220
当我取得他的职位后感到害怕
They offered me his job. Then I got scared.

642
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:16,620
-为什么?  -因为我还没有笨到
- Why? - Why. Because I am not stupid.

643
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:20,460
相信一个人的大脑能在完全活跃的情况下而不出问题
Nobody can operate at that level of mental activity and not crush.

644
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:24,330
我停止了服用
I stopped taking it.

645
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,170
-然后?  -然后我病了
- And? - And I got sick.

646
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:34,520
头疼  作呕  因此我回去找弗恩
Headaches, throwing up. So I went back to Veron.

647
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,500
他告诉我服用过的人  都死去了
He talked me about alle the people that would die.

648
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:41,740
-你吃了多少了?  爱迪  -很多
- How much you've been taking? Eddie. - I'm taking a lot.

649
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,840
也许他们改良了  
Maybe, maybe they worked out bugs.

650
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:50,500
也许是不同的种类
Maybe it's different batch.

651
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,020
是的
Yes.

652
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:56,580
-你现在停药了  对吗?  -先说完经过
- You off it right now, aren't you? - Just finish the story.

653
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:00,140
我停药后没死
I didn't take anymore and I didn't die.

654
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,060
一段时间后我意识到
After a time I realized that...

655
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:06,430
自己无法集中精神超过10分钟
I can't concentrate on  to anything longer than 10 minutes.

656
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:11,000
爱忘事  懒的动  行动迟缓
I missed deadlines, got lazy, slow, so slow.

657
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,560
那是两年前的事  
That was two years ago.

658
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,180
到现在都没有好转
I haven't been the same since.

659
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:26,090
你还有药片么?  很好
You have some left? Good.

660
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,550
回家就吃  减少剂量  不要一下子停药
You go home and take it, reduce the dose, don't just stop,

661
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:31,950
若直接停药  你会死
You'll die, if you just stop.

662
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:37,180
试着摆脱掉它  否则  头痛只是个开始
Try to take if off. Otherwise, the headaches are just beginning.

663
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:40,810
我得走了
I have to go.

664
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:44,720
-你知道是谁生产的吗?  -我不知道
- Do you know who produces them? - I do not know.

665
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,440
我得走了
I have to go.

666
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:20,930
-倒霉  -听着  听着  听我说
- Oh, shit! - Listen, listen. Listen to me.

667
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,720
-你把我忘了是吗?  -没有
- You forget about me? - No.

668
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:27,650
我约了你十二点
12:00 and you were not here!

669
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:30,060
-我现在在这里  -好
- I am here now. - Good.

670
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,890
-跟我来  -我可以写支票给你
-Come forward. -I can write a chque.

671
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:39,410
支票  你精神不正常?
Chque! Chque! Are you out of your mind?

672
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,140
你认为我是什么  融资机构?
What do you think I am? Some financial institutions?

673
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:44,330
你说得对  我去银行提给你
You're right. Maybe I just go to the bank.

674
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,710
哪儿弄来的东西?
Where did you got that?

675
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,630
-这是什么?  -阿司匹林
- What is it? - It's just aspirin.

676
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,000
我还没有见过这样的阿司匹林
I have not seen such aspirin.

677
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:02,420
这是好东西  对吗?
It's something good, hum?

678
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:26,070
我感觉很爽  这东西有什么成份?
I feel good, man. What's in this stuff?

679
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,900
就是维他命和阿司匹林
It's just errr... vitamins with aspirin.

680
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,870
少胡扯  爱迪
Holy shit, Eddie baby.

681
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:01,470
琳达  我阻止不了他冲进来
Lindi, he is not allowed to enter, but I could not stop him.

682
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:06,260
-泰勒  我必须挂了  -我病了
- Tyler, I have to go. - I'm sick.

683
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:11,730
对不起  我坚持不到回家
I'm sorry! I couldn't make it home.

684
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:15,280
-我送你去医院  -不要
- You go to the hospital. - No, no, no...

685
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:20,730
我希望你能为我做些事情  我需要服药
I want you to do something for me. I need my pills.

686
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:23,520
-爱迪  什么样的药  -亲爱的  这很复杂
- Eddie, what kind of pills? - Honey, it's complicated.

687
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,890
你吃的什么药  你在服毒品?
What did you take? Are you on drugs?

688
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:32,860
我别无选择  把事情向琳达和盘托出
I had no choice. I told Lindi everything.

689
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:39,890
这么说你旺盛的精力  过人的专注都是因为这药?
So all these energy of yours, all this focus has been a drug?

690
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:41,680
我还以为它是被认可的
I thought it was approved.

691
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:45,740
我还藏起了一些
I have a supply stash.

692
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:52,140
-你想我去帮你拿  -不  我去取
- You want me to go get it. - No, I'm gonna go get it.

693
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:54,880
给我你公寓的钥匙  我去拿
Give me your keys. I go to the apartment.

694
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:58,550
它不在我的公寓  放在别的地方了
It's not in my apartment. I moved them.

695
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:02,060
放在哪儿了?
Ok. So where did you move it?

696
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:10,930
在我家里
In my house.

697
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,850
难以置信
Unbelievable.

698
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,950
-你拿到了?  -是的
- You got it? - Yeah.

699
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:35,080
有人跟踪我
There someone following me.

700
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,000
-你确定?  -确定
- Are you sure? - Yeah.

701
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,490
他的计程车一直跟着我的计程车
He got into a cab behind me and he's making every turn I'm making.

702
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,830
亲爱的  报警
Baby, call the cops.

703
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,720
能绕过去吗
Can you got around him?

704
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,060
-发生什么事  -塞车
- What happened? - We stopped.

705
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:52,100
他从车里出来了
He is getting out...

706
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,100
爱迪  他正走过来
Eddie, he is walking over here.

707
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:56,870
琳迪
Lindi.

708
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:58,820
我的天
Oh, god!

709
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:14,880
救命  
Help!

710
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:16,630
救命
Help!

711
01:02:18,810 --> 01:02:23,300
这个人在追我  从我家一直跟到这
This man is chasing me. He followed me from my building.

712
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:26,640
我不认识他  帮帮我
I don't know him. Please!

713
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,320
离她远一点
Leave her alone.

714
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:33,270
你聋了吗?  我说  别靠近她
Are you deaf? I said, leave her alone!

715
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:37,580
哥们  你是不是要惹我?
Buddy, are you trying to piss me off?

716
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:41,140
你做什么  伙计?
What are you doing, man?

717
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:15,510
-你还在吗  -在  我在  -你不要说话  不要动
- Are you still there? - Yeah, I'm here. What happen?

718
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:20,890
-我困在这了  他会找到我的  -别说话  也别动
- I'm stuck. He'll find me. - Ok, stop talking and don't move.

719
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:23,020
-他杀死了两个人  -什么?
- He killed two guys. - What?

720
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:27,310
-他会杀了我  -不  不会的
- He's gonna kill me, too. - No, no, no.

721
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:28,400
你能看到他吗
Can you see him?

722
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:35,620
还不能
No, not yet.

723
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,810
我不知道该怎么做
I do not know what to do.

724
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:43,360
你打开袋子  吃一颗药丸
I need you to open the bag and take one of those pills.

725
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:45,150
为什么
Why?

726
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:48,690
因为吃了之后你就会知道该怎么办
because you know what to do. You take it then you know.

727
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:52,440
他有刀  爱迪  我想不出摆脱的法子
He has a knife, Edi. I can't think my way out of a knife.

728
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,810
那药30秒发挥作用  相信我  
Just listen to me, it come out in 30 seconds.

729
01:03:55,810 --> 01:03:57,730
到时候你就知道怎么做
And you think your way out. That's what it does.

730
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:22,320
他越来越近了
He is getting closer.

731
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:28,940
琳达  我爱你
Linda, I love you.

732
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:41,450
回到我这来
Now get back to me.

733
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:49,830
发生了什么事
What happened?

734
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:03,840
爱迪  亲爱的  一切会好起来
Edi, my dear. It's gonna be ok.

735
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,290
你得离开这里
You got get out here.

736
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:46,010
你还好吗
Are you okay?

737
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,630
还好
Yeah.

738
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:53,050
对于发生的一切  我很抱歉
I'm so sorry for everything that happened.

739
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:57,890
我想让你知道  这些事情不会再次发生
I want you to know you that you'll never ever have to go thourgh this again.

740
01:06:58,250 --> 01:06:59,820
因为现在我可以保护你
Cause I can take care of us now.

741
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:01,820
我相信你可以
I'm sure you can.

742
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:04,920
我们会很安全  我回来了
I can make it safe. I'm back, ok?

743
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:11,710
-谁回来了  爱迪?  -我
- Who is back? Eddie. - Me.

744
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:16,210
不  这不是你  你跟之前不同
No! It's not you. You were different before.

745
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:18,130
我仍然是同一个人  
I am still the same person.

746
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:20,030
不是的  我也吃过所以我知道
I wasn't when I was on it.

747
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:23,260
我做了这辈子都不可能再做的事
I did things that I would never do.

748
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:24,680
但这东西救了你的命
Those things saved your life.

749
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,760
-但那不是我  -是你  不是你是谁
- But there weren't me. - Yes. There were, nor the where was.

750
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:28,810
我知道药效是怎样的
I know how it workes.

751
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:32,310
我懂  我完全理解  你觉得自己无所不能
I get it, I totally get it. you fell invincible.

752
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,510
它所能带给我们的是你无法想像的
Where it will take us that you can't even imagine.

753
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,670
我们能够做的事情
The things we will be able to do.

754
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:41,280
一年后我们会在哪里
Where we will be in a year from now.

755
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,400
我们将会过怎样的生活
What kind of life that we'll finally be able to live?

756
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:47,330
没有我你也能靠它生活
Will you might live it without me?

757
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:54,060
我会停止服用的
Look, I'll stop taking them.

758
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:57,210
有些事必须要做  以保证我们安全
There are some things I need to do to keep us safe and then set us up.

759
01:07:57,210 --> 01:07:59,700
之后我不会再服用  这是我的计划
And then I gonna get off it. That's the plan.

760
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:04,410
我有计划  我发誓会停止服用
I have a plan. I swear I'm gonna get off it.

761
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:10,870
我希望你能做到
I hope you do.

762
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,150
在监视我吗
Looking for me?

763
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:49,150
你认为你可以逃避出我掌心吗?
You think you can run away from me?

764
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:50,810
你认为我不知道你是谁?
You think, I dont know who you are?

765
01:08:51,150 --> 01:08:52,810
我相信我们的交易已经结束了
I was under the impression, our business is finished.

766
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:56,480
给我药  不然就地做了你
Well I wish some more of this stuff, or I shoot you right here.

767
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:57,640
然后照张相
And take a pic.

768
01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:59,650
我摆脱不了这家伙
This guy was not gonna go away.

769
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:01,280
几片药可以应付他一段时间
A few pills would buy me some time.

770
01:09:01,290 --> 01:09:05,000
-给你  两清了  -不一定
- Here it is. We're done. - We'll see.

771
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:08,460
直至我找到一个...  永久的解决办法
Until I found a more... permanent solution.

772
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:10,720
除非看到真正有威胁的人
Unless you see a real threat I never wonna know...

773
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:11,830
否则我不想让人知道我有保镖
that I have any security.

774
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:14,410
你们不要注视我  但要一直跟着  
You never perceive me. You'll always follow me.

775
01:09:14,410 --> 01:09:15,860
永远不要在15步以外徘徊
Never wander 15 steps behind.

776
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:17,880
互相也不要太靠近
And never stand to close together,

777
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:20,860
如果发生什么  我希望能够看到身后的情况
I wonna be able to look behind me if the opportunity persents itself.

778
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:24,400
不要穿同样颜色的西装  这不是黑客任务
And don't wear the same color of suit. This isn't the matrix!

779
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:31,920
爱迪  你要知道  我曾经找过你
You have to know Eddie, I wrote you up.

780
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:34,270
-我病了  -你不能病
- I was sick. - You don't get sick.

781
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:36,700
当你到达我这个级数时  就算给车撞了也不能死
You playing at this level, you get hit by a car you don't even die.

782
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:38,610
-你是绝对正确的  -我知道我是对的
- You're absolutely right. - I know I'm right.

783
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:41,290
那天我甚至不知道在跟谁  或跟什么在交谈
I mean, I didn't know who or what I was talking to.

784
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:44,190
跟摄氏40度(的我)在交谈
105, that your talked to, believing in.

785
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:50,650
-我修定了我的推测  -我没问你推测
- I sent over revised projections. - I didn't ask your projections...

786
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:53,130
我知道  但是我觉得  假如你能看看
I know, but I think If you look at them...

787
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:55,080
我已经看了  事实上有问题
I already have. There is matter in fact.

788
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:59,830
我解雇了项目组的一些人
I fired a few people over here projections.

789
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:02,120
-我很抱歉  -不用抱歉
- I'm sorry. - No, you're not.

790
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:04,670
你很不平凡  你注意到一些我的团队忽略的事情
You reliefed, you know things that my team has missed.

791
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:08,680
有那么一刻我曾想过这是真的吗
The minute, the instant... That's no longer true?

792
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,510
2个月后我开始服用NZT
Two months after I started NZT.

793
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,310
我已是公司史上最大企业合并的中间人
I was brokering the biggest merger in corporate history.

794
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:21,870
讽刺的是  这么做肯定残酷  残酷到让人憎恨
Ironically, it's gonna be cruel, cruel just gonna be the word hates me.

我可以用相同的成份进行调配

805
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:53,190
很难说是否有相同效果  
but the reaction on the brain...

806
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,340
没法预期
Dark, it's dark work.

809
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,490
制药就是这样的  否则可能药死人

813
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,220
不好意思离开会儿

我以为我已经没有麻烦了  探长先生

This isn't about Veron again, Mr. Morra.

816

你真幸运  有人打扫过房间

822
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:06,180
这是案例中最不具说服力的证据
In the best case, These are unconvincing evidence.

823
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:09,360
跟我说实话  当时你在那里吗

政府的贿赂导致自身腐败堕落

继续

4万5千美元?

844
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:17,460
4千万是一大笔钱
40 million is bloody, Eddie. It's a lot more without control.

845
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:19,110
爱迪  你要知道  
You know, Eddie,

846
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,300
你可能会认为你不需要为我工作了
you might think that you will not work for me anymore.

847
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,410
我学到了很多

848
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:28,140
我希望如此  但这并不意味着你有足够的经验

你没有想过做好准备自己干

853
01:13:37,970 --> 01:13:39,260
我意思是说  你要知道你不平凡
I mean, you do know, you're a freak.

854
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:45,800
这是上帝的礼物  是运气  或是家族遗传
Your way is a gift from God or luck or biological heritage.

855
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:47,530
是礼物  不是挣得的
A gift. not earned.

856
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:50,950
你不知道我所知道的  因为你还没有那些经验
You do not know what I know, because you have not earned those powers.

857
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:53,340
当你有经验后会灭掉我们
You'll kill us with those powers.

01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:56,670
你象个孩子一样不知道珍惜
You throw them around like a child.

859
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:59,510
你没有走过不公平的路

你没有辛苦存集过资金

861
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:04,630
你没有娶过可以让你少奋斗30年的妻子
you haven't done the time that first merriage a girl with the right father.

862
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:06,840
你只是认为你可以
You think you can go over all this.

863
01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:11,130
你不曾收买  迷惑或威胁人  以此来提升你的职位
You haven't bribed, charmed or threaten your way to sit at that table.

864
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:14,680
你从没有过竞争经验  因为你还没有竞争过
You never experienced competition, because you haven't competed.

865
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,090
不要让我成为你的的竞争对手
Don't make me your competition.

866
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:22,610
我开个价给你  你可以买些想要的玩具
Now I'll open up a line of credit for you. You've been wanted your few "toys".

867
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:43,030
酒店客房不再是一个合适的选择
Hotel rooms were no longer an option.

868
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:45,460
我需要住在保险柜里面

该建筑以安全为重心  中央控制

钢门加上气压锁

871
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,690
这是3层式非并行安全系统

去你MD下星期
Next week, you can go fuck yourself.

878
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,070
不要说你有什么感觉
Not that you feel anything.

879
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:30,490
我不认为你想让金融界朋友们知道
I don't think your fortune 500 finacial friends...

880
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:34,120

883
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,390
显然  这不能再继续下去
Obviously, this can not go on.

884
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:48,100
但这是世界上一小部份
But there is very little on this earth...

885
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,590
4千万美元也解决不了的事
that 40 million dollars can't solve.

886
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:52,390
埃德伍德明天9点签署文件
Tomorrow at 9:00, Ed Wood would sign the papers.

892
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,460
纯粹是你的预测?
Oh, basing on your charts and projections?

893
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,310
也许你应该提醒我  你是谁?
Maybe you remind me, who are you anyway?

894

对不起  卡尔  这家伙惹我反感

我丈夫今早感到头痛  头晕
My husband has experienced some pain and dizziness this morning.

901
01:16:51,970 --> 01:16:54,460
他正在接受观察和体检
He is currently analyzed, and going tests.

902
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,990
我只是想让你知道  我们非常希望签署这个合同
I just want you to know we have every intention of signing the contract.

903
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:03,200
一旦他恢复正常  我们就继续进行
And as soon as he is able, we will proceed.

904
01:17:04,710 --> 01:17:07,620
我知道这是陈词滥调  但如果有任何需要
I realize that this is a useless platitude, but if there is anything we can do...

905
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:08,920
随时告诉我们

Thank you, gentlemen. I relay on your digression.

908
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,590
或许是另一个手段
There would be approximate.

909
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:21,300
为了变卦放弃权利?
A person like him giving away the power for turning?

910
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:27,950
希望他早日康复
Hope he will get better.

911
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:35,210
但埃德伍德没有好转  因为他没有NZT了
But Ed Wood wouldn't get better. Because Ed Wood was out of NZT.

912
01:17:41,050 --> 01:17:42,210
我为什么惊奇
Why would me surprised?

913
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:46,070
有多少成功人士是依靠NZT的
I wonder how many other successful people might be explained by NZT?

914
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:49,340
至少我仍有一些药  生命还没受到威胁

我们准备好了
I've been all over them.

918
01:17:56,230 --> 01:17:59,310
他们无论种族  身材  衣着
We can not allow any disparity in race or physical type.

919
01:17:59,530 --> 01:18:01,320
都与你极度相似
between you and the rest of the suspects.

920
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:04,740
看起来跟你的复制品差不多
they are close to your clones as its possible as you could get.

921
01:18:05,170 --> 01:18:08,460
就好像是同一个大帅哥  模糊难辨
It's gonna be just one big handsome blur's guy.

922
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,240
玻璃后面的是谁?
Who was out there?

923
01:18:26,190 --> 01:18:27,560
那个女人的丈夫?
Woman's husband?

924
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,250
酒店女工?
Hotel maid?

925
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:34,690
事情会怎么结束?
Was this how it's going to end?

926
01:18:39,610 --> 01:18:42,100
没确定  他昏头了
Nothing in this clue, he was dizzying.

927
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:45,930
"右边数第三个  不  不是他"
"He was the third from the right. No, not him." Here you go.

928
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:49,440
很好的西装  量身订做的吗
This thing is a beauty. custom-made?

929
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:51,650
是的
I did.

930
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:13,740
市场推测万隆合伙人正在跟汉克・埃德伍德
Market speculates today. The doubt has been yo-yo in this speculation at...

931
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:19,100
谈判有关合并的事宜
Van Loon associates and Henk Ed Wood are negotiating about a merge.

932
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:20,470
你有向别人提及过吗?
Have you been talk to anyone?

933
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,130
我没有跟任何人谈起过  卡尔  我又不傻
I haven't been talk to anybody, Karl. I'm not stupid!

934
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:28,740
我知道你不傻  但聪明的人多会犯一些小错误
I know that you're not stupid but don't make the classic smart person's mistake.

935
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,570
你认为这里没人比你更聪明
Do you think that there is none smarter than you.

936
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:32,380
你究竟到哪里去了?  
Where the hell have you been?

937
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:34,310
这是你第二次消失
This is the second time and the disappearance.

938
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:36,930
就在楼里喝咖啡  为什么问  我错过了重要时刻?
I was in the building. I was getting coffee. Why? Is it been a moment?

939
01:19:36,930 --> 01:19:39,000
是的  重要时刻  埃德伍德陷入昏迷状态
Yes, It's been a moment alright. Ed Wood is in a coma.

940
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:40,910
他没有耍我们  而是快死了
He wasn't playing us, he is dying.

941
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:43,520
关于这件事你都知道些什么?
What do you know about this?

942
01:19:44,730 --> 01:19:46,630
我当时可不象平时那般有问必答
I was less than usually equipped answer.

943
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:51,330
我意识到早就应该吃NZT了
I noticed, that I was overdue to take my NZT.

944
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:54,130
疼痛是从眼睛后面开始的
And the pain was starting behind my eyes.

945
01:19:55,030 --> 01:19:55,930
稍等
Excuse me.

946
01:19:56,810 --> 01:19:57,940
不要逃避
You are not excused.

947
01:19:57,940 --> 01:19:59,470
卡尔  你的员工解手也不行?
Your employees aren't allowed to take a piss, Karl?

948
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:26,850
律师  警察  还是更衣室的人拿去了
It was Brant, or someone else the police station, cloakroom.

949
01:20:41,730 --> 01:20:44,140
莫拉先生...
Mr Morra...

950
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:46,660
莫拉先生  您有一个包裹
Mr Morra! This just came for you.

951
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:58,370
我再问你一次  爱迪  你知道些什么?
I ask you again, Eddie. What do you know about this?

952
01:20:58,910 --> 01:21:01,400
-关于消息走漏?  -不是  关于埃德伍德
- What about? The leak? - No, about Ed Wood.

953
01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:03,210
关于埃德伍德些什么?
What about Ed Woodu?

954
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:05,830
想骗我  你还不够老道
You got a long way to go as a liar.

955
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:06,910
卡尔  我不知道这些...
Karl, I do not know what...

956
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:08,880
听  你所说的都是废话  
Listen, what you about to say is bullshit!

957
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,260
我知道你是隐藏了些什么的  我已经察觉到了
There is something you hiding from me, I smell it on you!

958
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:15,740
现在  我想知道这笔交易怎么就作废了
Right now, I want to know why is this cluster fuck of deal is dead in the water!!

959
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:21,470
爱迪
Eddie!

960
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:40,440
今天  在莱诺克斯山医院附近  
Today, near the Lennox Hill Hospital today,

961
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:43,170
更多关于万隆跟埃德伍德合并的传言流出
more twisting terms about van Loon - Ed Wood merger.

962
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:46,630
关于这次合并的谣传绝对不具真实性
There is absolutely no truth to the rumor of this merger.

963
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:48,720
不论怎么说
None whatsoever.

964
01:21:49,130 --> 01:21:52,210
我丈夫还在医院接受检查  对我们来说这是个困难的时刻
My husband is having tests and it's a difficult time.

965
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:55,950
如果各位将更多的问题留待下次提出  我将非常感激
We would be appreciate you directing further questions to our returning.

966
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,280
目前没有更多的消息
Err, yes. We have no further comments at this time.

967
01:21:59,470 --> 01:22:02,040
我们正在等待艾德伍德先生的检验结果  
We are waiting for results of Ed Wood's test,

968
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,260
并希望是最好的结果
and hoping for the best.

969
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:46,970
爱迪  我知道你在里面
Eddie, I know you're there, Eddie.

970
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:51,480
出来吧
Come out.

971
01:22:54,330 --> 01:22:55,320
快点
Come on!

972
01:22:58,530 --> 01:22:59,520
打开门
Open the door.

973
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,940
所以我在这里
And so, here I am.

974
01:23:22,450 --> 01:23:24,950
我知道他们会用可怕的方式慢慢地将我杀死
I knew that they will kill me slowly and horrible.

975
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,350
但跳楼至少是我的选择
But this choice would at least be mine.

976
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:39,270
然而求生是生物的本能
But we are instinct creatures.

977
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,110
我想活下去
We want to live.

978
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:44,710
我混乱的大脑试图记起
so my foggy brain tried to remember...

979
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:46,830
在什么地方还有一颗NZT
where one tablet of NZT might be...

980
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:55,170
有可能的
It was possible,

981
01:23:56,090 --> 01:23:57,450
"有可能"就足够了
and possible was enough.

982
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:23,340
爱迪
Hi, Eddie.

983
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:49,290
你知道我需要更多  为什么要让我失望
You know, I want more, so why would you upset me?

984
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,790
我讨厌使用最后一份
I don't like being dumped of this last one.

985
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,210
你还不知道如何有效使用它们
You do not even know how to use it.

986
01:24:58,020 --> 01:25:00,160
我把它们溶解
You see, I have dissolved a solution.

987
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:02,010
直接注射
You shoot it.

988
01:25:02,410 --> 01:25:05,110
药物直接进入血液和大脑
It goes right into the blood and brain.

989
01:25:07,410 --> 01:25:08,730
持续得更久
It lasts much longer.

990
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,510
你打算告诉我其它的药在哪吗?
Are you gonna tell me where the rest is?

991
01:25:28,530 --> 01:25:29,810
不  没这打算
No, probably not.

992
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,620
给我搜

993
01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:36,840
这些家伙会找到的
You know, these guys are gonna find it...

994
01:25:38,570 --> 01:25:40,270
我也会想法让你说
Or I gonna make you tell me.

995
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:43,560
问题是  哪种方式先找到
The question is, which is gonna come first.

996
01:25:45,110 --> 01:25:46,680
看来  要探讨一番
I guess, we'll find out.

997
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,810
这是浪费时间
This is a waste of my time, you know.

998
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:56,480
我也不想再做这些事
And I am gefting out of this side of the business...

999
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,390
正在张罗进出口贸易公司
I'm starting import-export company.

1000
01:26:02,890 --> 01:26:04,300
这些都是非常让人兴奋的东西
Very exiting stuff.

1001
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,360
我给你带来了很多工具  你真幸运
I got a lot on my plate, you're lucky I am here.

1002
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:15,770
这里有个保险箱

1003
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:20,780
要是以前我可能会剥你的皮  活剥了你
Back in the old times. I might peel your skin back, flay you.

1004
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:25,560
剥皮  多美的词儿  我以前都没注意到
Flay. That's a nice word, I didn't notice before.

1005
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:28,780
我的词汇真匮乏
I had such a poor vocabulary.

1006
01:26:34,030 --> 01:26:36,390
但后来我发现一样东西: 谷歌
But then I discovered this thing: Google.

1007
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:40,450
你知道人的结肠有20英尺长吗?
Did you know that the colon is 20 foot long?

1008
01:26:40,530 --> 01:26:42,310
我不知道  也不相信
I had no idea, I don't believe it.

1009
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:46,450
这回要亲眼看看  谁让我好奇心重呢  这个词儿也不错  
I gotta see this for myself. I am dubios. It's another nice word.

1010
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:50,690
我敢肯定  你也很好奇
Anyway. I am sure you're curious too.

1011
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:53,100
不要担心  都消过毒了
Do not worry, everything is sterilized.

1012
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:55,600
我会留住你性命  好增加一点乐趣
I gonna keep you alive for the whole fun.

1013
01:26:56,450 --> 01:26:58,640
我会保留你的小弟弟
You gonna get a reserved place in front, baby!

1014
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:40,330
没有太多的尝试和挣扎  因为我也会死在这里
Not much of a try and fuzzy. because I would die here too.

1015
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:44,550
只有NZT可以帮到我
only NZT could help me...

1016
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,250
但剩下的  已溶解在这死人的血液中
and the last one was in this pug's bloodstream.

1017
01:29:03,110 --> 01:29:04,100
维克多
Victor!

1018
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,170
什么?
What?

1019
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:29,940
我看不到任何东西
I do not see anything!

1020
01:30:13,290 --> 01:30:15,140
射你的右手边

1021
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:23,720
维克多
Victor!

1022
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:23,680
警方认为先前的屋主
The police will later know that my appartment privious owner...

1023
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:24,750
是个军火商
was an arms dealer.

1024
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:28,210
有一些不满意的客户来报仇  很正常
Of course with some disstatisfied clients.

1025
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,090
夜晚才刚刚开始
And the night was still young.

1026
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,500
我敢肯定你想知道  你的老板发生了什么事
I'm sure you're curious about What happened to your boss.

1027
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:48,740
我肯定
I certainly am.

1028
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:53,350
如果我的转变真的能够为拯救埃德伍德先生的生命有用
I mean if my turning was really working for saving Mr. Ed Wooda's life,

1029
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:55,790
他为什么死了?
Why is he dead?

1030
01:31:57,030 --> 01:32:01,240
我的意思是他将自己的生命寄托在药物上的意义是什么
I mean what point was the point to expressible riding with his life sitting medication?

1031
01:32:02,690 --> 01:32:03,990
他老板死了
His boss was dead.

1032
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:07,030
所以我不再是他的问题
So I didn't matter now.

1033
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:13,540
但是他并不欣赏我的律师偷了药后私藏起来的举动
But he didn't appreciate that Moris Brant had kept the pills for himself.

1034
01:32:25,730 --> 01:32:27,440
再一次万事皆有可能
And it was all still possible.

1035
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:33,840
12个月后

1036
01:32:46,610 --> 01:32:48,100
事实上  没有更多门票了
Actually there're no more tickets.

1037
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:52,640
是的  我知道  提前预定的资助人优先
Yes, I know. And over booked fund raisers at first.

1038
01:32:53,530 --> 01:32:55,670
他来了  我会问他
Well, here he comes. I'll ask him.

1039
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,740
-好多了  做得好  -谢谢您
- Oh, that's much better. Great job! - Thank you, sir.

1040
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:02,180
爱德华
Edward.

1041
01:33:04,630 --> 01:33:07,210
我看过第二溢出带
I taken a looking at second overflowed band.

1042
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:10,840
有一笔巨资打算汇入  他们想保持价位
A wave of donations is coming in. And all are just happy to keep their money.

1043
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:11,910
太好了
Great.

1044
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:14,430
等等  有个自称是艾文公司的人在办公室内等你
Hold on. A guy from Iven Camcorps in your office.

1045
01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:15,440
我午餐有约
I have a lunch.

1046
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,560
你距离出席赞助商的活动还有两分钟
You have two minutes yet for your main sponsor.

1047
01:33:17,580 --> 01:33:19,650
-艾文药业公司?  -是的
- Iven Camcorps pharmaceuticals? - Yes.

1048
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:24,190
终于遇到了一位愿意亮相的
Finally meet the guy who keeps the lights on.

1049
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:27,810
-卡尔?  -莫拉先生
- Karl? - Mr. Morra.

1050
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:30,390
真是意外
What a surprise!

1051
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:32,610
他们告诉我  有人来自艾文
They told me that someone comes from Iven ...

1052
01:33:33,030 --> 01:33:35,810
是的  我打算退出能源工业
Yes, thats me now. I am moving out of the energy business.

1053
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:37,660
不会吧
Come on!

1054
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:40,170
这好比赫夫纳退出夜总会似得(不可能)
That's like Hefner move out of the mansion.

1055
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:43,080
几个月前我买了艾文药业  我很惊讶你还没听说
I bought Iven several months ago. I'm surprised you didn't hear.

1056
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:47,390
没听说  我这里很忙
No, no! Well... I gonna keep me up here.

1057
01:33:47,810 --> 01:33:50,220
是收获的时候了  莫拉参议员
That's gonna pay off, Senator Morra.

1058
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:53,950
参议员  谁估计的到?  
The Senate... Who knows?

1059
01:33:53,950 --> 01:33:57,210
这能让事情发展得更顺利  对吗爱迪?
Anything is possible from here, isn't it, Eddie?

1060
01:33:58,290 --> 01:34:02,490
你我都知道  你能维持这种状态的关键是什么
I think we both know where it's heading if you can maintain.

1061
01:34:05,490 --> 01:34:07,900
你有没有想过  药吃完后怎么办?
Have you asked yourself, what you gonna do when you run out?

1062
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:27,310
-你都知道些什么  -这有关系吗  反正我就是知道了
- What did you know? - Does it matter? I know now.

1063
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:29,750
若你提早找我的话
I wish you'd come to me at first, Eddie.

1064
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:31,590
便可以用33美元的股价购买艾文的股票
I could have bought Iven at 33 a share.

1065
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:32,890
我们会是合作伙伴
We could have been partners.

1066
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:38,930
所以NZT是艾文制造的
So Iven makes NZT.

1067
01:34:38,930 --> 01:34:41,510
它永远不会正式存在
Well. It'll never officially exist.

1068
01:34:41,730 --> 01:34:44,310
当然  你具有的有利条件无需多说
Obviously, I don't need to point out the advantages for you.

1069
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:46,540
我觉得你也许应该说说
Oh I think, maybe you do.

1070
01:34:47,370 --> 01:34:50,660
无限量的供应  但你再也得不到
Unlimited supply. We know, you can't get anymore.

1071
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:52,340
你肯定?
Are you sure about that?

1072
01:34:52,370 --> 01:34:54,140
我今早关闭了你的实验室
I shut down your lab this morning.

1073
01:34:57,010 --> 01:34:59,500
爱迪  我只想帮助你
Eddie, I just want to help you, that's all.

1074
01:35:00,610 --> 01:35:04,900
继续供应你  不会让你心烦意乱  记在心里就好
Keep your supply, no distraction service. Give a piece of mind, that's all.

1075
01:35:07,450 --> 01:35:09,950
我需要做些什么作为回报?
In return I do what?

1076
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:14,170
也许给我点建议  我不会麻烦你太多
Give a little advice maybe, I won't be bother you much at first.

1077
01:35:14,590 --> 01:35:16,800
以后呢  会是什么事?
Later. What would bother me with?

1078
01:35:17,530 --> 01:35:22,450
有一些雄心勃勃的想法  我们认为是可行的
We have some ambitious ideas, We think that is achievable.

1079
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:26,430
-若我不太喜欢你的主意?  -那只能祝你万事如意了
- And if I don't like your ideas? - Then, we'll say godspeed.

1080
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:30,150
你的辉煌将会继续  但象烛光般短暂
And your candle will shatter brief of lovely light.

1081
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:34,770
你不用现在答覆我  爱迪
Do you know what I mean? Eddie. Let's not go there right now.

1082
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:39,700
目前我只想让你健康聪明
Right now, I just want to keep you brillant and healthy.

1083
01:35:40,220 --> 01:35:41,410
走吧  一起吃个午饭
Come on, let's go get some lunch.

1084
01:36:00,610 --> 01:36:01,680
您先请  参议员
After you, Senator.

1085
01:36:03,940 --> 01:36:05,010
谢谢你的支持  卡尔
Thanks for your stand by, Karl.

1086
01:36:07,010 --> 01:36:07,800
给我们一点时间
Give us a second.

1087
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:09,530
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

1088
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:11,370
你想当美国总统
Do you want to be president of United States?

1089
01:36:11,450 --> 01:36:13,150
还是脑血管阻塞  中风?
Or braindead, stuck full of tubes?

1090
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:13,950
我会把握自己的机会
I'll take my chances.

1091
01:36:14,090 --> 01:36:16,990
你的机会不存在  我们已经关闭了你的实验室
I told you, your chance don't exist. We have shut down your lab.

1092
01:36:16,990 --> 01:36:18,480
难道你不认为一个能够创建NZT的天才
Don't you think the smartass who created NZT...

1093
01:36:18,790 --> 01:36:20,360
也许会有3-4间实验室
might have 3, 4 other labs?

1094
01:36:20,490 --> 01:36:21,750
那又怎样?  已没有工厂可以制造它了  
So what. You're not making anymore.

1095
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:23,530
没错  所以我找到了一个解决方案
That's right. I got something better.

1096
01:36:23,630 --> 01:36:27,710
我已重新设计  改良和修正了它
See once you know what's in it you can tweak, re-engineer, get the bugs out.

1097
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,320
咱们各走各的  卡尔
I am off, Karl.

1098
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:33,750
你无论如何都不会为我工作吗
Even so, there is no scenario you are not gonna work for me.

1099
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,750
你打算怎么付我薪水?  用香烟
How you gonna pay me? In cigarettes?

1100
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:38,770
-去年你有17次内幕交易  -你在威胁我吗?
- Last year you traded insider information 17 times. - You threating me?

1101
01:36:38,850 --> 01:36:42,760
来自迪拜的支票  对智利的倾销  消失不见的官员
Like cheques from Dubai, dumping in Chile, disappeared officals.

1102
01:36:42,820 --> 01:36:44,180
你想跟我对着干?
Do you want a war with me?

1103
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,180
相信我  当我说这些的时候  可没有发挥想象
Trust me when I say this I am not even being creative.

1104
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:49,530
你不能在给我安上一堆罪名后  还想活着离开
There's no way you can make accusations like that and walk out alive.

1105
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:53,510
你怎么想是你的事  如果你想斗  我会准备好
Then you would even think that's yours. I want to prepare you want to fight me.

1106
01:36:53,530 --> 01:36:54,770
你根本没资格跟我斗  
You are no longer equipt to fighe me.

1107
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:56,230
你真的以为我什么都没学到?
Do you think I didn't learn anything?

1108
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:58,750
以为我没有任何转变?
My story does not mention you on it?

1109
01:36:59,070 --> 01:37:00,310
你根本不知道我是个怎样的敌人  
You have no idea what kind enemy I am...

1110
01:37:00,310 --> 01:37:02,350
货车会从后面撞上计程车
That van is going rear on that taxi.

1111
01:37:03,070 --> 01:37:03,640
什么?
What?

1112
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,290
货车时速80公里  而司机正在发短信
The driver writes a text message and go 80 km per hour.

1113
01:37:06,510 --> 01:37:08,290
它一定会撞上18米外的一辆计程车
He must have points with braking at 18 meters from a taxi!

1114
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:14,410
我看得到这一切  卡尔
I see everything, Karl.

1115
01:37:14,850 --> 01:37:16,840
我领先你50步  并领先于所有人
I'm 50 moves ahead of you and everybody else.

1116
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:19,540
你怎么知道我身边没有能跟你竞争的人?
What make you think I don't have a guy with bid on you right now?

1117
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:21,440
你如何能知道明年这个时候自己还活着?
How do you know that you will be alive next year this time?

1118
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,970
你在干什么?  放开你的手
What are you doing? Put your hands off me!

1119
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:27,750
心肌泵血力量只有正常的一半  应该是扩张型心肌病
Heart is pumping with half power Walls of your heart are dilated.

1120
01:37:28,090 --> 01:37:30,160
你需要一个人造心脏来维持大动脉的运作
Aorta is in motion. Soon you need this replaced.

1121
01:37:32,330 --> 01:37:33,620
你已经知道的
You already knew that.

1122
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,660
你应该对此感到高兴
You know you should be glad about this.

1123
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:44,580
若我来帮你做事  你只能当跟班
Cause me working for you, you'll end up as my bitch.

1124
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,440
也许我们应该先冷静下来后再谈谈
Maybe we should cool off and talk again.

1125
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:02,550
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

1126
01:38:04,970 --> 01:38:05,830
不要忘了投票
Don't forget to vote.

1127
01:38:14,710 --> 01:38:17,090
爱德华  顺利吗?  
Edward, you good?

1128
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,920
嗯  跟你说了我约了人吃午餐
Yeah, told you I have a lunch.

1129
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:28,650
-抱歉迟到了  -别在意
- I am sorry, baby. - Hey, don't worry.

1130
01:38:31,090 --> 01:38:33,500
-今天过得怎么样?  -不能更好了
- How's your day gone? - Perfect better.

1131
01:38:35,730 --> 01:38:37,300
我还是不习惯你这个发型
I still can't get used to this haircut.

1132
01:38:37,930 --> 01:38:39,420
我在街上可能都认不出是你
I wouldn't even recognize you on the street.

1133
01:38:39,930 --> 01:38:41,000
我已不是从前的我了
All I am a new man.

1134
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:43,830
我已经点过餐了
I've already ordered.

1135
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:46,380
担担面  2个猪油饼
Can I have Szechuan dandan noodle. 2 Crullers with lard.

1136
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:47,530
青葱炒龙虾
Stir fried lobster with spring onion.

1137
01:38:47,530 --> 01:38:49,730
千万不要给我味精呀
I don't want MSG in any dishes.

1138
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:52,220
围巾会保护你的衣服
Neck scarf will keep your suit clean.

1139
01:38:52,220 --> 01:38:54,430
可是保护不到我的脏爪啊
But it can't keep my hans clean.

1140
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:00,290
干嘛这样看着我
What?
