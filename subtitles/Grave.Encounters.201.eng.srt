1
00:00:20,835 --> 00:00:22,833
My name is Jerrod Hartfelder.

2
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:27,053
I turn a video production company.
Here in California.

3
00:00:27,078 --> 00:00:30,575
We focus primarily in-
on reality shows.

4
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,395
If you ever seen the show, "Tornado
Trackers, "is one of ours.

5
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,316
A club came to us by mail.

6
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:43,137
It was an episode of a reality show
new called "Grave Encounters".

7
00:00:43,162 --> 00:00:47,458
It was run by a young
producer named Lance Preston.

8
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:52,078
The idea was that your group
paranormal investigators,

9
00:00:52,103 --> 00:00:56,898
investigate spirits
places and things like that.

10
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:59,121
And this was long before
any other

11
00:00:59,122 --> 00:01:01,318
program of the same nature
that there are now around.

12
00:01:01,343 --> 00:01:03,641
It seemed that he was not in his time.

13
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:07,362
My name is Lance Preston.

14
00:01:07,387 --> 00:01:09,335
When I was small and
my parents moved us to

15
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,283
a house, which later
found to be haunted.

16
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:14,705
The things it found
stayed with me forever.

17
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,026
Since then, I'm obsessed
in trying to capture evidence

18
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:20,449
and show that these things are real.

19
00:01:20,474 --> 00:01:22,222
Come with me and
my team

20
00:01:22,223 --> 00:01:23,970
paranormal investigators
professional

21
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:25,793
while we risk
to enter the premises

22
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,591
Most Haunted
known to man.

23
00:01:27,616 --> 00:01:31,312
We'll be all night, and
with cameras to record everything.

24
00:01:31,337 --> 00:01:34,334
If you're ready, it is
time to attend the

25
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:37,556
Grave Encounters
(Meeting Cemetery)

26
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:40,778
Everything seemed to be going well.

27
00:01:40,803 --> 00:01:45,498
The cuts were to be fantastic.
We were very excited.

28
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:47,821
We had the same thing.

29
00:01:51,242 --> 00:01:53,839
And then of course, they
did the episode 6.

30
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:56,661
Want to say something else?

31
00:01:56,686 --> 00:01:59,683
Yes! I want to be very
clear about this.

32
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:02,306
What is about to
see is not a movie.

33
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,829
Ok?

34
00:02:03,854 --> 00:02:06,601
There are 66 hours of film
continuous, unedited,

35
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:09,348
that was written for
Lance's show.

36
00:02:09,373 --> 00:02:13,969
It was not manipulated in any way.

37
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:17,390
It's just continuous film, only
edited because of length.

38
00:02:20,912 --> 00:02:27,904
(Do not copy the movie)

39
00:02:30,627 --> 00:02:31,825
Action!

40
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:35,746
Hello! Hello! Test Site, you!

41
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:37,370
Lance Preston!

42
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:39,393
Catch and background
all the time.

43
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:41,216
I'll just move a little, wait.

44
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:43,139
Ready? Yes I'm ready!

45
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:46,360
It's still recording.
I want to get you well.

46
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:49,382
A palace back. Is it good?

47
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:54,103
Good Afternoon! Welcome to a new
Grave Encounters episode.

48
00:02:54,127 --> 00:02:56,325
I'm your host
as always, Lance Preston.

49
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,548
And tonight I am very
happy to take you to visit

50
00:02:58,573 --> 00:03:01,370
One of the most terrifying
I have ever seen.

51
00:03:01,395 --> 00:03:04,891
Behind me is the Hospital
Psychiatric Collingwood.

52
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:09,212
This is one of six buildings
an area of??80 hectares.

53
00:03:09,237 --> 00:03:12,034
Wait, wait, is
to pass a car.

54
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:14,656
Matt continues from there,
I will not say that again.

55
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:18,078
Between 1895 and 1960

56
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:24,896
It was home to more than 80,000 men
sick and mentally disturbed.

57
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:30,116
After its closure in 1963
several ghosts have been seen.

58
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:33,787
Objects that move alone.
And sometimes you hear

59
00:03:33,788 --> 00:03:37,433
the laughter of patients
condemned to live here.

60
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:43,652
Tonight, my team and I
we will be locked for 8 hours.

61
00:03:43,677 --> 00:03:45,675
Locked inside,
during the hours

62
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:47,673
that phenomena are
more frequent.

63
00:03:47,697 --> 00:03:50,794
Using the tools most
advanced to hunt ghosts

64
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:54,316
we look, how
were known,

65
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,812
ghosts of the Hospital
Psychiatric Collingwood.

66
00:03:58,636 --> 00:04:00,934
Cut. Nice!

67
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:01,758
It was?

68
00:04:02,382 --> 00:04:04,580
Morgan! Morgan Turner! Yes Ola Ola

69
00:04:04,605 --> 00:04:06,403
Sorry! Thanks for coming.

70
00:04:06,428 --> 00:04:08,326
I know the roads and everything.
Do not worry.

71
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:10,050
I'm really happy to do this.

72
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:12,072
This will even appear on television?
Yes, hopefully.

73
00:04:12,097 --> 00:04:13,796
Do not look for me
I'm just recording.

74
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,419
Do not worry, it records everything.

75
00:04:15,444 --> 00:04:17,542
Morgan is here with me
Turner, local historian.

76
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:19,964
Morgan is here today

77
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:23,286
to tell us about the
dark past of the hospital.

78
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:26,408
Morgan? Can you tell us when
the hospital was built?

79
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:31,927
The story is very similar to
other institutes of the same time.

80
00:04:31,952 --> 00:04:34,250
Built in 1893

81
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:40,768
To relieve overcrowding
the County's hospital in Denver.

82
00:04:40,793 --> 00:04:44,389
At the time, mental illness
was not well perceived.

83
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:45,513
Treatments were only
Many pioneers.

84
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:50,133
Psychiatric Hospitals like this
were seen as a trash

85
00:04:50,158 --> 00:04:52,256
for family members
embarrassing, rather

86
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:54,354
a place where
could even heal.

87
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:55,578
Right.

88
00:04:55,603 --> 00:04:58,200
The conditions were minimal,

89
00:04:58,225 --> 00:05:03,919
People slept on the floor, the
times, without blankets or clothing.

90
00:05:03,944 --> 00:05:07,041
It was not at all, a place
fun place to be stuck.

91
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:09,863
Can you tell us about
Arthur Freinken?

92
00:05:09,864 --> 00:05:13,483
Your story should be the most
interesting about this hospital.

93
00:05:13,508 --> 00:05:15,706
Yes, right.
I assumed I would ask that.

94
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:18,528
Freinken was a neurosurgeon
Harvard graduate.

95
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:22,349
It was placed here from 1937 to 1948.

96
00:05:22,374 --> 00:05:25,321
He was very
known due to their

97
00:05:25,322 --> 00:05:28,268
experimental methods
to operate the brain.

98
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:32,089
He started the
frontal lobe surgery.

99
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:36,210
Performed about 140 surgeries
to the frontal lobe, the cable.

100
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,432
August 15, 1948.

101
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:42,628
Six patients had fled
their rooms,

102
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:45,301
and stabbed Freinken
in your office.

103
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:47,948
His body was found by
a nurse the next day.

104
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,469
Unfortunately, this death was
completely irrelevant due to

105
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,966
death of the famous baseball player,
David Bruce, the same day.

106
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:58,088
Wow! This story is 'the nuts'!

107
00:05:58,113 --> 00:06:02,108
Morgan, give us your opinion more
honest, believe in ghosts?

108
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:09,925
I do not know. But this would be if there
a good place to go looking for them.

109
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,798
The traffic was even
crap today.

110
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:14,845
We did not take long, were
about 6 hours away is not it?

111
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,368
"Death awaits you." Oh my God!

112
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:20,989
Looks like we'll find out.
This is so silly!

113
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:24,161
This may take
rather, they're

114
00:06:24,162 --> 00:06:27,308
old current.
We should not use them.

115
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,531
Take it easy bro.

116
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:32,552
Slow motion, background music.
And it is scary.

117
00:06:32,577 --> 00:06:36,973
Well, that's it. Here we go...

118
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,896
Go take...

119
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,816
Oh my God!

120
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,838
This is the entrance
Main building.

121
00:06:47,562 --> 00:06:49,160
Nice! Yes!

122
00:06:49,585 --> 00:06:53,581
If you are family members, make
check-in at the reception, right there.

123
00:06:53,606 --> 00:06:56,303
This is scary as shit!
It's crazy!

124
00:06:56,727 --> 00:06:58,426
Are you picking up? Records everything!

125
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,049
I shoot everything!

126
00:07:00,773 --> 00:07:03,171
Do not smoke.

127
00:07:03,196 --> 00:07:06,592
Obviously you can not. Do not try.
It has a fire alarm.

128
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:11,812
I'm here with Kenny Sandivol.
Current caretaker, for eight years.

129
00:07:11,837 --> 00:07:15,333
Kenny! Would you say that this
place is haunted?

130
00:07:15,658 --> 00:07:20,953
Well, I've never done this before.
Should I speak to you or the camera?

131
00:07:21,077 --> 00:07:22,276
Only... ignore the camera.

132
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:28,095
I do not know if I believe in spirits
or ghosts or anything.

133
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,917
But since I'm here
seen very strange things.

134
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:33,939
Especially at night,
can hear the

135
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,936
sounds of the pipe and
of the construction.

136
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:42,356
It is very difficult to say, but
I'm not alone.

137
00:07:44,378 --> 00:07:46,177
Come see!

138
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:48,499
Let? Ok

139
00:07:49,224 --> 00:07:50,922
It is as if these corridors
be infinite.

140
00:07:50,947 --> 00:07:52,146
Ah, yes.

141
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,667
Hard to believe that this was the home
of thousands of mentally ill.

142
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:56,891
Exact thousands.

143
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,413
The day is so dark here.

144
00:08:00,537 --> 00:08:02,934
Are you afraid? Yes.

145
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:05,956
There are plenty of
interest, which I will show you.

146
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:11,176
Guys! If you think that now is
wait until dark tonight.

147
00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:13,598
None of these work lights,
is just too dark.

148
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:16,620
You see this window here? Yes.

149
00:08:16,645 --> 00:08:20,042
Closing it before nightfall,
and sometimes I

150
00:08:20,043 --> 00:08:23,438
here in the morning, and is
fully open.

151
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:24,662
What!

152
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:25,886
I can not figure out what it is.

153
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:29,707
It is as if something or someone was
trying to get out or so.

154
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:32,829
It is definitely a point
interest in the paranormal.

155
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,348
Here you? Perfect.

156
00:08:46,565 --> 00:08:50,860
How is it supposed to help
people in those cubicles?

157
00:08:54,981 --> 00:08:56,979
Oh my God!
This is officially fucked!

158
00:08:57,004 --> 00:09:00,101
Is this real? Yes, totally real.

159
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,522
One patient was here
caught a good few years.

160
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:05,920
And this is what left us.

161
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,943
He spent his time
write on the walls.

162
00:09:07,968 --> 00:09:10,665
Then it was the same
a quarter of patients?

163
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,888
Yes, this was even the fourth
one of the patients. Really?

164
00:09:12,913 --> 00:09:16,509
I do not know if he died here, but
been here a very long time.

165
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:18,132
Very scary.

166
00:09:19,556 --> 00:09:23,751
What the fuck!? Kenny!
This is awesome!

167
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:25,974
Fire, the acoustics are
same shit here.

168
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,498
What is this?

169
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:30,819
Supposedly a young
patient committed suicide here.

170
00:09:30,844 --> 00:09:32,942
What? Right here?!

171
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:37,962
One patient committed suicide right here?
Yes, cut his wrists in this bath.

172
00:09:37,987 --> 00:09:40,185
Oh my God, it's so sad.

173
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,107
Some say they hear the sound of
flow of water coming out.

174
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:45,529
Never heard such a thing.

175
00:09:45,754 --> 00:09:46,953
Where are we going now?

176
00:09:47,177 --> 00:09:48,376
Let the service tunnels.

177
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:50,899
Can not wait to see them.

178
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:55,119
Pssst! Are you okay?

179
00:09:55,844 --> 00:09:58,940
Kenny! This is exactly
what I was looking for!

180
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,063
These tunnels all the buildings together.

181
00:10:01,088 --> 00:10:03,885
They have almost a mile long.

182
00:10:06,408 --> 00:10:09,604
This is a maze down here.
You can easily lose yourself here.

183
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:18,121
Once I got here, and the
air was very cold.

184
00:10:18,146 --> 00:10:22,841
I was so quiet. I felt like
if someone were watching me.

185
00:10:23,365 --> 00:10:27,161
A very strange feeling.

186
00:10:29,484 --> 00:10:31,582
What? What? It's just my shadow.

187
00:10:33,904 --> 00:10:36,702
This is Garry Krefeld.
Krefeld company.

188
00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:40,123
He worked here some time ago.

189
00:10:40,148 --> 00:10:41,746
Is that true?

190
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:45,867
In 1983, the state was
try to make some changes here

191
00:10:45,892 --> 00:10:49,888
but in the end it was all the fucking.
Damn sorry.

192
00:10:49,913 --> 00:10:52,211
You want to say again? Yes is better.

193
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,433
Anyway,
I and my staff

194
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:56,631
came here about
two weeks.

195
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,453
And experienced any type
of supernatural phenomenon?

196
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:06,371
The boys thought
heard weird noises.

197
00:11:06,372 --> 00:11:09,768
And disappeared
some tools.

198
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:14,088
I thought they were thieves but
never seen any, so...

199
00:11:14,113 --> 00:11:16,711
And there was an accident, right? Yes..

200
00:11:16,735 --> 00:11:20,731
One of the boys went upstairs.
Right there.

201
00:11:20,756 --> 00:11:23,304
He swears that something
pushed the stairs.

202
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:25,851
He gave a very hard fall.

203
00:11:25,876 --> 00:11:29,373
He hurt himself on his knees, and gave up.

204
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,445
Does not sound like a
residual haunting.

205
00:11:31,446 --> 00:11:33,493
Sounds more like a
intelligent haunting.

206
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:39,312
A residual haunting is
known as an echo of the past.

207
00:11:39,337 --> 00:11:41,335
That repeats itself endlessly.

208
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,857
An intelligent haunting
is actually a spirit.

209
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:47,179
Interact with intent.

210
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:49,802
There have been reports
people who say they

211
00:11:49,803 --> 00:11:52,399
been pushed, scratched
or even fired.

212
00:11:52,424 --> 00:11:54,821
It's rare but it happens.

213
00:11:54,846 --> 00:11:57,843
So, you used
spend much time here?

214
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,564
Yes, the kids in high school
came here a lot.

215
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:03,388
You know. Exit and such.

216
00:12:03,413 --> 00:12:04,611
And then saw something?

217
00:12:04,936 --> 00:12:06,734
Yes.

218
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,856
We were even here.

219
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:13,877
Here. The date or something.

220
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:22,593
I looked up and I swear to God.
I swear I saw someone there.

221
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:29,910
One was wearing white robes...
as a hospital gown... yes.

222
00:12:29,935 --> 00:12:32,333
And had his head shaved.

223
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,353
Appearance of full spectrum!

224
00:12:37,378 --> 00:12:40,375
Why not ask
quickly to the gardener?

225
00:12:41,998 --> 00:12:45,894
Sorry! Sorry sir!

226
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,067
We are recording a program
TV, and we were

227
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,215
she liked to think of giving
a quick interview.

228
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,536
I am here with the gardener
local, Javier Horteguez.

229
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:58,056
Javier, have you ever noticed something
stranger around the building?

230
00:12:58,381 --> 00:13:00,879
No. Not really. What do you mean?

231
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:05,499
Well, he heard strange sounds or
witnessed anything paranormal?

232
00:13:05,524 --> 00:13:07,322
I started working here.

233
00:13:07,347 --> 00:13:09,345
He started working. Okay.

234
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,865
TC can take a break?
And if you do for the camera?

235
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,089
Pretend you saw something?

236
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,210
I have to go back to work! Ok

237
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:22,830
It will be fast! Wait, just
wait a bit. You do not have more?

238
00:13:25,552 --> 00:13:27,350
They are $ 20.

239
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,771
I am here with the gardener
local, Javier Horteguez.

240
00:13:31,796 --> 00:13:35,792
Javier, saw something in the past
10 years you worked here?

241
00:13:35,817 --> 00:13:39,713
Yes, I saw a ghost. Right there.

242
00:13:40,137 --> 00:13:42,035
It was very scary.

243
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,256
A spirit outside the building.
Unbelievable.

244
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:48,828
This is a point of interest
supernatural different

245
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,376
any that
have recorded before.

246
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:54,198
Three, two, one...

247
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,414
Due to the huge size of the
We place a medium flame.

248
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:06,036
Houston we Gris
help in the investigation.

249
00:14:08,258 --> 00:14:10,656
Houston! Are you feeling anything?

250
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:16,650
Wow! There is an energy
unbelievable here!

251
00:14:17,174 --> 00:14:18,872
It's like thousands of voices
talking at the same time.

252
00:14:18,873 --> 00:14:20,571
This sound is deafening!

253
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:24,292
There is something more.

254
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:34,106
There is something more.

255
00:14:34,131 --> 00:14:36,428
It's like a dark spirit.

256
00:14:36,453 --> 00:14:39,251
It may possibly be a demon.

257
00:14:39,276 --> 00:14:42,173
We have to be extremely
careful tonight.

258
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:46,393
We do not want to play with this thing.
No way.

259
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,913
It's here.

260
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:54,135
Are you feeling anything?

261
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,158
Yes.

262
00:14:56,882 --> 00:15:00,579
I'm feeling a
great sadness here.

263
00:15:00,604 --> 00:15:03,201
A deep sadness.

264
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:11,567
I see a patient.
A female patient.

265
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:16,412
A girl. There is water, red...
red water.

266
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:28,425
Blood. Blood. He died here.
He cut his wrists in the bathtub.

267
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,546
The guard said that a girl
had died here.

268
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:34,569
Houston! This is incredible.

269
00:15:34,594 --> 00:15:38,090
The spirit is still with us.

270
00:15:41,612 --> 00:15:43,609
Cut.

271
00:15:43,634 --> 00:15:44,833
Yes!

272
00:15:46,656 --> 00:15:49,553
There was too much? No.

273
00:15:55,173 --> 00:15:58,969
Lance! How do you feel about
to your episode six? Very well.

274
00:15:58,994 --> 00:16:00,192
It is a good place.

275
00:16:00,217 --> 00:16:02,565
Do you think this is because
we'll see a ghost?

276
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:04,913
Yes, thousands of them.
I'm sure.

277
00:16:04,938 --> 00:16:08,234
Wow! You try to sound like
less antiseptic.

278
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:11,256
It would be great.
But if we can not, I

279
00:16:11,257 --> 00:16:14,253
to make sure we get
a good scares.

280
00:16:15,377 --> 00:16:18,773
Wait, wait! TC!

281
00:16:18,798 --> 00:16:21,296
Want to record something to the setting of the sun?

282
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,419
Son of a bitch!

283
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:53,052
House of the window, tip!

284
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:11,757
Ok, this is scary as shit.
I'll leave.

285
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:28,665
Ok, here we are with our wise
Grave Encounters technician, Matt.

286
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,387
Matt! Why not show us the
What are you doing here?

287
00:18:31,412 --> 00:18:33,260
Installed ten cameras
in static

288
00:18:33,261 --> 00:18:35,108
main points
paranormal activity.

289
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:36,832
Is recorded on tape.

290
00:18:36,857 --> 00:18:38,855
But it also saved on the hard drive.

291
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,677
All who come here is on
to my computer wirelessly.

292
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:44,199
So always know
what is happening.

293
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,772
Well done Matt!
Why not show to us

294
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:47,321
what each one
this equipment?

295
00:18:47,346 --> 00:18:50,543
This is an EMF meter.
It is a device that

296
00:18:50,544 --> 00:18:53,739
measures levels of
electricity in the air.

297
00:18:53,764 --> 00:18:55,837
So the main idea
is that when the meter

298
00:18:55,838 --> 00:18:57,910
EMF fields detects human
remains stable.

299
00:18:57,911 --> 00:18:59,984
While the fields
caused by activity

300
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:02,056
paranormal will produce
peaks in reading.

301
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:04,478
Infrared sensors.

302
00:19:04,503 --> 00:19:09,099
The idea is the same as the EMF, but this
shows changes in temperature.

303
00:19:09,124 --> 00:19:12,220
It is believed that the spirits
cause a loss of temperature.

304
00:19:12,245 --> 00:19:14,543
Known in the community
paranormal, such as cold spots.

305
00:19:14,968 --> 00:19:17,165
One, two, three...

306
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,387
This is a recorder
analog audio. Right.

307
00:19:20,412 --> 00:19:23,609
It is used to capture EVPs.
Oh wait...

308
00:19:23,634 --> 00:19:27,729
Explains to the audience
What is an EVP.

309
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:29,952
Electronic Voice Phenomenon
(Electronic Voice Phenomenon).

310
00:19:29,977 --> 00:19:34,672
Capture sounds that the ear
humans can not detect.

311
00:19:34,697 --> 00:19:37,045
So when you play,
if we hear something,

312
00:19:37,046 --> 00:19:39,392
means that something is
trying to communicate with us.

313
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:42,714
This is my favorite.
The Geiger counter.

314
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:44,787
Turns the sound here, and
you're ready to go.

315
00:19:44,788 --> 00:19:46,835
Look at this! It is spectacular.

316
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:53,453
I assure you, if there is anything
paranormal here, we'll catch it.

317
00:19:54,477 --> 00:19:57,674
Well folks, we are ready
to be locked.

318
00:19:57,699 --> 00:19:59,846
My friend Kenny, the
janitor of the building,

319
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:01,994
will have the honor of
locked inside.

320
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:06,714
Kenny, thank you!
See you at 6 am.

321
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:09,037
Six hours exactly. Good luck!

322
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:15,056
I am a demon. A demon child.

323
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,279
I can not wait to see you in the morning.

324
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:23,697
Yes, we have to spend the
night with these two freaks.

325
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,619
What are you doing?
I'm talking to Kenny.

326
00:20:26,644 --> 00:20:28,692
He locked the door?
It's good for the show.

327
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:30,740
Do not worry about it.

328
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:32,563
What do we do if we need
more material?

329
00:20:32,688 --> 00:20:35,285
Well done! This is what will happen.

330
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:40,305
This is the best place
ever investigated.

331
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,328
And the most dangerous.

332
00:20:42,353 --> 00:20:44,950
I want to draw attention
to the fact that

333
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:47,547
have been built
almost like a prison.

334
00:20:47,572 --> 00:20:50,320
All the windows have bars.
Could never

335
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:53,067
leave, even
we wanted.

336
00:20:53,092 --> 00:20:55,789
We are locked here
Kenny in until the

337
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,486
janitor of the building in
come get the morning.

338
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:01,508
We will be working
in total darkness.

339
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:05,030
Capturing all three
night vision cameras.

340
00:21:05,054 --> 00:21:07,002
More static cameras
Matt set up in the

341
00:21:07,003 --> 00:21:08,950
main points
paranormal activity.

342
00:21:09,075 --> 00:21:12,372
Okay folks! When you are
ready, it's about time we had a

343
00:21:13,596 --> 00:21:17,791
Grave Encounters!

344
00:21:17,816 --> 00:21:20,713
Okay, we're
now go through the

345
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:23,610
dark corridors of
old institution.

346
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:28,530
Abandoned for over 50 years.

347
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:33,550
We are looking for souls
were trapped in life.

348
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:36,872
And probably trapped
after life.

349
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:41,792
I feel a cold, it's cold here.

350
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:44,464
This was the corridor
where you could see

351
00:21:44,465 --> 00:21:47,111
the appearance of the person
with the shaved head,

352
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,434
to hang down the hall.

353
00:21:49,459 --> 00:21:51,856
Sasha, we use the PVS.

354
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,777
Is there someone here with us?

355
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,997
You were a patient here?

356
00:22:01,022 --> 00:22:04,618
You used to live here in the hospital?
Down again.

357
00:22:05,143 --> 00:22:07,740
"Is there someone here with us?"

358
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:13,060
"You were a patient here?"

359
00:22:15,382 --> 00:22:17,980
"You used to live here in the hospital?"

360
00:22:21,201 --> 00:22:23,099
Nothing.

361
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:25,422
Wait! I felt like...

362
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:28,943
Spirit, thou hast no
to be afraid of us.

363
00:22:28,968 --> 00:22:31,366
If you're here, show yourself!

364
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,686
I think it is getting cold as
move along, is to join us.

365
00:22:35,711 --> 00:22:37,709
Whether we will be here.

366
00:22:37,734 --> 00:22:43,528
If there is a spirit here
us, give us a sign.

367
00:22:44,253 --> 00:22:46,550
Open the window!

368
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,372
Even just a little bit.

369
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:03,383
Now I use this camera to
try to capture paranormal anomalies.

370
00:23:03,408 --> 00:23:05,905
Normally, there are
seen by the human eye.

371
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,728
It is known as
spirit photography.

372
00:23:15,246 --> 00:23:17,344
One more.

373
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:19,367
We expect that
photos are revealed.

374
00:23:19,392 --> 00:23:24,087
If there is a ghost behind
me, just let us know later.

375
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,904
It was you who wrote these walls?

376
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:34,626
Or just wanted to try to communicate?

377
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:43,642
Why not try
communicate with me now?

378
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:59,750
If the patient who killed himself in this room,
in the same bath, is here now,

379
00:23:59,775 --> 00:24:03,871
that show.

380
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,487
I'm really scared here.

381
00:24:12,812 --> 00:24:16,208
The chambers 2 and 4 have
temperature gauges.

382
00:24:21,428 --> 00:24:24,724
Personally, I am the only one
have to be here alone?

383
00:24:27,047 --> 00:24:29,644
Houston, feel anything?

384
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:33,665
I feel a very negative energy here.

385
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:40,583
Not just one but many.

386
00:24:40,908 --> 00:24:46,502
If there are spirits here
below, please show yourselves!

387
00:24:49,524 --> 00:24:52,221
Do you hear a sound.

388
00:24:53,145 --> 00:24:57,541
As I said, it seems that
these pipes are endless.

389
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,362
And it smells bad here.

390
00:25:02,885 --> 00:25:05,283
Heard what? I also heard.

391
00:25:11,202 --> 00:25:14,698
Ok, we hear something. What was that?

392
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:17,620
I do not know, come here. Here, follow me.

393
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:21,441
Where does it sound? Behind this door.

394
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:23,065
Ali

395
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,486
Want to open it?
You can slide the camera?

396
00:25:26,511 --> 00:25:29,208
Oh, not really. Damn!

397
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:31,931
Shit.

398
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:40,347
Shut up. They are rats.

399
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,270
No way! Really?

400
00:25:42,295 --> 00:25:45,192
It's nothing more.

401
00:25:45,217 --> 00:25:48,613
You're an idiot! There was a joke!

402
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:49,613
This is almost as scary
as the "Saw Dawn"!

403
00:26:48,702 --> 00:26:51,799
Can this be plasmo-waste.

404
00:26:51,823 --> 00:26:55,220
Discovered for the first time
Team Record Encounters?

405
00:26:56,469 --> 00:27:00,365
I think we should give more
a look at the top.

406
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,786
Saves me a few shots in the hallways,
does that chilling effect.

407
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:07,407
As we did Playview Mansion.

408
00:27:07,432 --> 00:27:10,429
Yes yes, and then cut.

409
00:27:17,847 --> 00:27:20,844
Scary, scary, scary.

410
00:27:24,465 --> 00:27:28,061
"CHECKERS OF THE DEAD. KING ME."

411
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:33,280
What the fuck?!

412
00:27:33,305 --> 00:27:36,402
"GLORY HOLE"

413
00:27:37,026 --> 00:27:39,324
Kitchen of the dead.

414
00:27:40,048 --> 00:27:43,544
Said to cause me to lunch, bitch!

415
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:46,966
What the fuck is that?

416
00:27:46,991 --> 00:27:50,188
This is scarier.
How did we miss this?

417
00:27:50,213 --> 00:27:52,910
Lance is gonna love me!

418
00:27:52,935 --> 00:27:55,432
Shit.

419
00:27:59,253 --> 00:28:04,148
Wait, wait, wait...

420
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:11,466
Yes, my dear?

421
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:14,388
She is crying, give him the phone.

422
00:28:15,212 --> 00:28:18,109
Hello sweet!

423
00:28:18,134 --> 00:28:19,832
What your mother told me
was that you fear

424
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,530
the monsters are
under your bed.

425
00:28:21,555 --> 00:28:23,953
We've had this conversation?

426
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:28,972
The monsters are not real.

427
00:28:28,997 --> 00:28:32,793
Even if they were not
came to our house.

428
00:28:32,818 --> 00:28:35,915
You know that Daddy will take care of you.

429
00:28:36,639 --> 00:28:39,636
Says the mother who gave permission
to sleep with her today.

430
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:42,957
Daddy will not be
at home until tomorrow.

431
00:28:42,982 --> 00:28:46,379
We will go to a pizzeria.
The father will be home soon.

432
00:28:46,404 --> 00:28:49,001
Bye bye.

433
00:28:54,521 --> 00:28:58,017
Because I got myself into this?

434
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:09,430
Shit, it's cold.

435
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:12,452
What the fuck was that!

436
00:29:12,477 --> 00:29:15,274
Guys, stop this shit!
I'm not playing!

437
00:29:18,196 --> 00:29:20,993
It is not the best time
to do this shit!

438
00:29:21,018 --> 00:29:23,016
What the fuck?!

439
00:29:25,938 --> 00:29:28,236
Where are people?

440
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:30,259
Maybe it was the wind or so.

441
00:29:30,284 --> 00:29:32,581
Solid. Not a tornado
would be able to move it.

442
00:29:32,582 --> 00:29:34,879
How do you think
it weighs?

443
00:29:34,904 --> 00:29:38,400
TC, how do you move?

444
00:29:38,425 --> 00:29:41,123
Whatever it was,
scared me like anything.

445
00:29:41,148 --> 00:29:43,845
You can not explain?

446
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,867
I have told you. I was shooting,
then turned and the door closed.

447
00:29:46,892 --> 00:29:49,689
I thought you were the first.
Were you shooting?

448
00:29:49,714 --> 00:29:52,311
I had already told you.
You were so busy...

449
00:29:52,336 --> 00:29:54,834
Grave? Let's see.

450
00:29:57,656 --> 00:29:59,853
Oh my God!

451
00:29:59,878 --> 00:30:02,276
That's scary.

452
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,397
I accept your apology,
I accept your apology.

453
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,819
I do not think you saw that!

454
00:30:08,844 --> 00:30:11,342
The footage we just saw the
moments ago, was captured by

455
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:13,764
TC cameramen.

456
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:17,485
This door behind
me close by itself.

457
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:22,905
There was no wind, no open windows
that could have caused this,

458
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:27,225
Let's now
establish contact.

459
00:30:32,045 --> 00:30:37,640
Is there anyone here with us?
Please make a noise.

460
00:30:39,563 --> 00:30:42,260
Batam in anything.

461
00:30:44,483 --> 00:30:47,080
Feel free
to close the door

462
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:49,677
as did also
the bit with the TC.

463
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:53,498
Feel free to hit with
her with the strength you want.

464
00:30:53,623 --> 00:30:57,020
Force Shut it!

465
00:30:59,842 --> 00:31:02,239
Now, please give us a sign!

466
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:08,358
Spirit, I invoke thee
to appear.

467
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:16,275
If there is someone here,
give us a sign...

468
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:19,397
Shit. Shit.

469
00:31:19,422 --> 00:31:21,719
Do you really think
we had something here.

470
00:31:21,744 --> 00:31:24,841
Shit! What was it?

471
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:26,664
Oh my God!

472
00:31:26,689 --> 00:31:28,887
That was very
scary people!

473
00:31:29,112 --> 00:31:31,010
He came here!

474
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:36,429
Shit, I see nothing.

475
00:31:36,454 --> 00:31:38,552
Did you hear?

476
00:31:43,372 --> 00:31:46,569
What? Oh shit...

477
00:31:46,594 --> 00:31:48,192
Shit...

478
00:31:52,213 --> 00:31:53,612
What the fuck?!

479
00:31:53,637 --> 00:31:55,834
Hello!

480
00:31:58,756 --> 00:32:01,254
This is fucked up people.

481
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:07,572
What is this personal? Matt?

482
00:32:07,597 --> 00:32:10,394
Matt, is there anyone there?

483
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:13,516
Is there someone at some of the
floors above us?

484
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:16,538
No. What is happening?

485
00:32:16,563 --> 00:32:18,761
Does anyone know what we're here
shoot and walk with us to enjoy.

486
00:32:18,786 --> 00:32:20,884
Why do not we get out?

487
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:24,205
Because this is where the sound came.
Jesus Christ.

488
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,228
Hello!

489
00:32:26,253 --> 00:32:29,450
Is there anyone here?
Somebody's kidding us.

490
00:32:31,173 --> 00:32:34,969
If someone is here to enjoy
us, no joke!

491
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:38,491
I'll call the police!
We have the right to be here!

492
00:32:38,516 --> 00:32:41,313
We have permission, and you do not!

493
00:32:41,338 --> 00:32:43,735
Lower your voice. I'm trying to talk!

494
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,257
Calm down guys. This is something real.

495
00:32:49,879 --> 00:32:53,176
I will use the EVP.

496
00:32:54,699 --> 00:32:57,096
What's your name?

497
00:32:57,121 --> 00:32:59,419
What do you want?

498
00:33:00,843 --> 00:33:03,840
You are in the room with us?

499
00:33:03,865 --> 00:33:06,562
Where are you?

500
00:33:06,587 --> 00:33:08,685
Come on, Sasha. Add to give.

501
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,908
"What's your name?"

502
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:11,931
"What do you want?"

503
00:33:12,955 --> 00:33:15,253
"Are you in the room with us?"

504
00:33:15,677 --> 00:33:18,275
"Where are you?"

505
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,396
What's that sound? What is this?

506
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:30,412
What the fuck was that?
What the fuck was that?

507
00:33:31,336 --> 00:33:34,333
No way! I recorded it.

508
00:33:34,358 --> 00:33:36,056
Sasha!

509
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:40,377
Please, please, I
want to go back to the entrance!

510
00:33:40,402 --> 00:33:42,050
I played some shit!

511
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:43,699
Was some shit
breathe with me!

512
00:33:43,724 --> 00:33:49,118
We gotta go, gotta go now!

513
00:33:49,143 --> 00:33:52,140
Wait, wait a second.
Wait for what?

514
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:54,562
We shot this program to what?
Five episodes?

515
00:33:54,563 --> 00:33:56,960
And we've never seen anything like it before.

516
00:33:56,985 --> 00:34:00,781
I do not care!
I just want to get out of here!

517
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:04,402
Houston, going down there
and turns right ok?

518
00:34:04,427 --> 00:34:06,425
I'd rather be down there.
No, no.

519
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,848
I need another face in the camera.

520
00:34:08,873 --> 00:34:11,570
I'm really scared, I think
I can not do this...

521
00:34:11,595 --> 00:34:14,592
Be a fucking work ok?
Retains the character.

522
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:17,314
We found something here.

523
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:19,137
I do not do that.

524
00:34:19,162 --> 00:34:21,160
Ok, I'll be back. I'll go with Houston.

525
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:24,282
No no. You come with me, come on.

526
00:34:24,307 --> 00:34:27,404
What are you doing?
Are you kidding? Did you see that?

527
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:32,024
We could find thousands of things!
Make millions ($$)!

528
00:34:33,148 --> 00:34:36,644
Even the moments
this same corridor

529
00:34:36,669 --> 00:34:39,766
undeniable proven track record
of paranormal activity.

530
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:46,184
Sasha was terrified because
a ghost touched her hair.

531
00:34:47,009 --> 00:34:50,605
Let's try to make contact.

532
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:57,023
Spirit, which hangs in the hallway

533
00:34:57,048 --> 00:34:59,396
to beg
show us a sign.

534
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,744
Show yourself!

535
00:35:04,366 --> 00:35:06,863
Please!

536
00:35:07,288 --> 00:35:11,883
If you're still here
us, give us a sign.

537
00:35:11,884 --> 00:35:16,478
It plays a sound or
in my hair.

538
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,697
Do you see anything?

539
00:35:22,722 --> 00:35:26,218
No. Wait. Give me the light... no, nothing.

540
00:35:26,243 --> 00:35:28,641
Not you dare ask me...
We are a team.

541
00:35:30,164 --> 00:35:32,162
I think it disappeared.

542
00:35:32,187 --> 00:35:34,835
Honestly, that is
all very funny...

543
00:35:34,836 --> 00:35:37,482
with these games that
we are preaching...

544
00:35:37,507 --> 00:35:39,305
Well, I do not know.

545
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,927
Come on, do something.

546
00:35:43,551 --> 00:35:46,248
Have done before, do it again.

547
00:35:46,273 --> 00:35:48,770
Are you fucking scared?

548
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:57,586
Jesus Christ. Forget it.

549
00:35:57,611 --> 00:36:02,007
Lance! Disappeared...
is enjoying with us...

550
00:36:02,032 --> 00:36:04,929
Shut up! Stop saying shit scenes.
Relax.

551
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,552
We could go home now?

552
00:36:06,577 --> 00:36:11,472
Lance, some people try
answers all of life.

553
00:36:11,497 --> 00:36:12,696
Ok

554
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,218
TC, what time is it?

555
00:36:15,243 --> 00:36:17,141
04:40

556
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:20,363
Let's go home.

557
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:25,383
Folks, we have footage that arrive.
Why do not we take everything and get out?

558
00:36:25,508 --> 00:36:27,605
Let's go home.

559
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,828
You have everything saved? Yes.

560
00:36:30,452 --> 00:36:33,150
I think it's right, up ahead.

561
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:37,670
Are you sure?

562
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,693
Yes, that's all. That's all.

563
00:36:43,614 --> 00:36:48,109
Is this the way, right?
Shit, it's a dead end.

564
00:36:48,134 --> 00:36:49,833
Personal.

565
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:51,456
Shit.

566
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:53,878
Not here.

567
00:36:53,903 --> 00:36:55,102
Come on, come on!

568
00:36:55,127 --> 00:36:58,923
Come on TC admits...

569
00:36:58,948 --> 00:37:01,346
What are applications?
We're not lost.

570
00:37:01,371 --> 00:37:04,567
We're not lost,
we came here...

571
00:37:04,592 --> 00:37:10,386
Matt! Matt! We lost shovel.

572
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:15,306
I need some information...

573
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,828
Why the hell is he not responding?

574
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:21,450
I'm not going there. TC! Why?

575
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:24,372
Because let's go back here.

576
00:37:24,397 --> 00:37:30,091
If we go in one direction,
'll get there ok?

577
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:31,315
What? North?

578
00:37:32,139 --> 00:37:34,487
I went around, and there
the corner is where

579
00:37:34,488 --> 00:37:36,834
was the bathtub.
He knows where we are.

580
00:37:36,859 --> 00:37:40,555
've Been here since
TC were here.

581
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,528
Explain to me when
saw this tub.

582
00:37:42,529 --> 00:37:44,476
Not the same bathtub!

583
00:37:44,501 --> 00:37:46,499
I know it is not.

584
00:37:46,524 --> 00:37:49,022
TC, get up, go.
He said six hours was not it?

585
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:52,243
You'll sleep here? Kenny is at 6 right?
I can not wait.

586
00:37:52,268 --> 00:37:54,466
I can not wait, can not wait.

587
00:37:54,491 --> 00:37:56,589
I will not walk in darkness.
I can not wait.

588
00:38:03,507 --> 00:38:06,004
Where are they?

589
00:38:11,024 --> 00:38:13,522
Shit.

590
00:38:14,546 --> 00:38:17,642
Where have you been?
Do not hear me calling you?

591
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:21,563
* All the talk at the same time! *

592
00:38:21,588 --> 00:38:25,085
We lost ourselves.
We do not hear the walkie-talkies?

593
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,208
I do not hear the radio call?

594
00:38:27,233 --> 00:38:30,329
No, not heard. You hear? No.

595
00:38:30,354 --> 00:38:33,151
Because we locked Lance?

596
00:38:33,176 --> 00:38:35,474
Lance!

597
00:38:35,499 --> 00:38:37,897
Because they had to lock
the fucking door?

598
00:38:37,922 --> 00:38:40,219
Holy shit!

599
00:38:40,244 --> 00:38:42,642
What are you seeing? What is it?

600
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:45,164
Her hair. Oh shit.

601
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,886
Fuck.

602
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:49,460
I'll download it
to the computer.

603
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:51,008
No, Matt, we do not have time.

604
00:38:51,033 --> 00:38:54,080
Take in the chambers
Still, all come together.

605
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:57,127
Guys, let's stand up
and begin to fix everything.

606
00:38:57,152 --> 00:38:58,950
Let's get ready to
when Kenny arrived.

607
00:38:59,175 --> 00:39:01,572
Someone help me?
Please? No no.

608
00:39:01,597 --> 00:39:03,895
I need everyone
down here, sorry.

609
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,818
I know.

610
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,440
You have a radio? Yes, I have a radio.

611
00:39:08,465 --> 00:39:10,963
Working? I hope so.

612
00:39:10,964 --> 00:39:14,083
Do you hear that? Yes, that's great,

613
00:39:14,108 --> 00:39:16,606
Be right back, okay? Ok man.

614
00:39:16,631 --> 00:39:19,228
Do not go without me.

615
00:39:28,444 --> 00:39:31,840
Okay, it's time to get out of here.

616
00:39:49,947 --> 00:39:52,444
Fuck!

617
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:56,964
What the fuck!

618
00:40:05,481 --> 00:40:07,079
Lance, are you there?

619
00:40:13,098 --> 00:40:16,095
Personally, I found something here.

620
00:40:16,819 --> 00:40:18,517
Hello!

621
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,437
Lance!

622
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:25,960
Hello!

623
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:30,780
Guys, stop playing!

624
00:40:47,288 --> 00:40:49,885
The morning is now approaching.

625
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:53,007
We have not seen anything paranormal
this last hour.

626
00:40:53,032 --> 00:40:56,328
Grave Encounters,
I am Lance Preston.

627
00:40:57,153 --> 00:40:58,951
Again. No, we do not have...

628
00:40:58,976 --> 00:41:00,974
Again.

629
00:41:00,999 --> 00:41:04,995
Grave Encounters,
I am Lance Preston.

630
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:08,716
That's all I have.
I can not do this anymore.

631
00:41:08,741 --> 00:41:14,435
No matter, tomorrow with the light
the morning will be much better.

632
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,758
That sounds good.
Where is Matt, anyway?

633
00:41:16,782 --> 00:41:19,380
Why is it taking so long?

634
00:41:19,405 --> 00:41:20,903
Matt?

635
00:41:22,626 --> 00:41:24,724
Matt? Are you there?

636
00:41:26,647 --> 00:41:28,545
Matt? Lance!

637
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,968
The radio was not working before.

638
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:39,284
Personally, I know this
will sound stupid...

639
00:41:39,309 --> 00:41:43,006
I'm the last person who wants
back to walk these halls

640
00:41:43,031 --> 00:41:47,426
It's dark, it can
have fallen and have been hurt.

641
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:48,650
She's right, he may be hurt.

642
00:41:52,271 --> 00:41:55,368
Folks, we have to go look for the.
Very well.

643
00:41:55,393 --> 00:41:59,489
This is ridiculous. Let's look it up.

644
00:41:59,913 --> 00:42:03,310
TC takes the camera.
Sasha takes the camera. Why?

645
00:42:03,335 --> 00:42:06,631
If we do this is
good that shot it.

646
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:11,901
Thanks for your help.
Hey! By the way, not

647
00:42:11,902 --> 00:42:14,648
is easy to get here
alone, I tell you right now.

648
00:42:14,673 --> 00:42:16,871
Jesus Christ.

649
00:42:17,695 --> 00:42:19,293
Matt!

650
00:42:29,508 --> 00:42:32,205
Matt! Matt! Matt!

651
00:42:36,526 --> 00:42:38,623
What the fuck?

652
00:42:38,648 --> 00:42:39,847
Shit!

653
00:42:43,968 --> 00:42:47,464
Why is this shit
scattered all around?

654
00:42:47,489 --> 00:42:49,188
Fuck.

655
00:42:54,607 --> 00:42:56,205
Okay, okay, okay.

656
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,229
Why he left
the equipment here?

657
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,228
Should not have done.

658
00:42:58,253 --> 00:43:02,649
He should be tidying up.
He must be here somewhere.

659
00:43:02,674 --> 00:43:05,571
TC going there, Sasha
and I will go here.

660
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:08,393
Why we do this?
It is a terrible idea.

661
00:43:08,418 --> 00:43:11,315
He has to be here, not
would leave things around...

662
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:14,037
Sasha comes to me.
TC goes by that side.

663
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:21,255
This looks like my room after
arguing with my girl!

664
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,476
Matt, where are you man?
I want to go home, that's enough!

665
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,999
Have we scared you are!

666
00:43:27,024 --> 00:43:29,222
I am looking for cigarettes.

667
00:43:31,844 --> 00:43:33,542
Come on, Matt!

668
00:43:33,567 --> 00:43:35,265
Not funny man.

669
00:43:42,383 --> 00:43:44,081
It will take the horns.

670
00:43:54,296 --> 00:43:56,294
Matt! Come on, buddy!

671
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,716
Look what my wife will kill me!

672
00:43:58,741 --> 00:44:03,636
It's late! Come on man.

673
00:44:03,661 --> 00:44:05,659
You better be dead
than to die.

674
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:11,978
Matt. I'm not kidding! Where are you?

675
00:44:12,003 --> 00:44:13,701
What the fuck?!

676
00:44:32,207 --> 00:44:34,205
Lance! Sasha!

677
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:36,827
Shit! What happened, what happened?

678
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:39,949
What, what? No, no.

679
00:44:41,772 --> 00:44:42,471
You okay man?

680
00:44:42,496 --> 00:44:44,494
Raise me. What?

681
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:46,217
Raise me.

682
00:44:50,014 --> 00:44:51,712
I swear, someone...

683
00:44:52,836 --> 00:44:54,534
I was pushed ok?

684
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:56,357
Someone pushed me fucking!

685
00:44:56,382 --> 00:44:59,529
I was on the stairs, the
Matt's looking, I looked

686
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,676
down, and something pushed me
was breaking the neck.

687
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:04,798
Oh my God.
I looked back and there was nothing there.

688
00:45:04,823 --> 00:45:08,919
These are things to enjoy with us.
It has been like this all night

689
00:45:08,944 --> 00:45:10,942
Call him! Call Kenny!
What are you waiting for?

690
00:45:10,967 --> 00:45:12,865
Okay, okay!

691
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:15,188
League now. I'll call ok? Take it easy.

692
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:17,111
Jesus Christ.

693
00:45:17,136 --> 00:45:19,933
Are you okay? No, I'm fine!

694
00:45:21,756 --> 00:45:24,553
Holy shit!

695
00:45:26,077 --> 00:45:29,973
I have no network, your attempt.

696
00:45:35,192 --> 00:45:36,990
Good!

697
00:45:37,015 --> 00:45:38,214
Good shit!

698
00:45:42,435 --> 00:45:44,632
What the hell are you doing TC?

699
00:45:44,657 --> 00:45:47,055
What do you think I'm doing?
Come help me.

700
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,377
You can not break the door! Then see!

701
00:45:50,402 --> 00:45:54,397
We can not damage the building,
we are responsible for this.

702
00:45:54,422 --> 00:45:56,320
Wait! The man can not see shit!

703
00:45:57,544 --> 00:45:59,742
Then shovel?

704
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:00,966
This will go out of your paycheck!

705
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,889
You think I care? No!

706
00:46:02,914 --> 00:46:04,112
Shit man!

707
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:07,034
I'm sick of this shit,
want to go home

708
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:11,255
I lie down and sleep.

709
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,377
This program is your only man.

710
00:46:14,402 --> 00:46:15,601
Put the fucking camera on the floor

711
00:46:15,626 --> 00:46:16,125
and help me.

712
00:46:19,447 --> 00:46:20,745
Help me.

713
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:21,969
Ok

714
00:46:24,092 --> 00:46:25,291
Ok

715
00:46:25,316 --> 00:46:28,213
Need my help? No.

716
00:46:28,238 --> 00:46:30,236
We're fine.

717
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:34,556
Shit, the three ok?

718
00:46:34,581 --> 00:46:38,977
One, two, three...

719
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:43,897
Fuck!

720
00:46:44,221 --> 00:46:46,419
Are you pushing? Yes I am.

721
00:46:46,444 --> 00:46:50,840
One, two, three...

722
00:46:56,659 --> 00:46:58,557
What the fuck?!

723
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,477
No, this is the fucking entry!

724
00:47:03,502 --> 00:47:04,700
This entry is the shit!

725
00:47:07,622 --> 00:47:09,820
We got here right?

726
00:47:09,845 --> 00:47:12,243
Yes, this is the entrance.

727
00:47:12,268 --> 00:47:13,466
This is not right.

728
00:47:13,491 --> 00:47:14,990
This is impossible.

729
00:47:15,015 --> 00:47:18,611
It was here that we got right?

730
00:47:18,736 --> 00:47:20,734
It was here that brought things.

731
00:47:20,759 --> 00:47:23,056
This makes no sense.

732
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:28,076
Makes no sense.

733
00:47:28,101 --> 00:47:30,299
It was here we come.

734
00:47:30,324 --> 00:47:32,622
It's just a hallway...
I do not know...

735
00:47:32,647 --> 00:47:36,543
He should have gone to get around, should
on the other side of the building.

736
00:47:37,966 --> 00:47:40,164
Lance!

737
00:47:45,384 --> 00:47:46,582
Lance!

738
00:47:49,005 --> 00:47:51,402
Are the same ports.

739
00:47:53,525 --> 00:47:55,923
I'm getting tired of this staff.

740
00:47:55,948 --> 00:47:58,245
Yes!

741
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:01,567
Houston, hold it.
Hold that, please.

742
00:48:03,989 --> 00:48:05,987
Be careful with your leg
careful with your leg!

743
00:48:06,012 --> 00:48:09,009
Shut up, you stay where you only the
look and not do anything!

744
00:48:09,034 --> 00:48:10,233
Okay, okay!

745
00:48:10,258 --> 00:48:12,256
What's wrong with you?

746
00:48:12,281 --> 00:48:14,778
One, two, three...

747
00:48:25,592 --> 00:48:27,291
Fuck!

748
00:48:29,413 --> 00:48:32,910
What is there to say?
What's up Cock?

749
00:48:32,935 --> 00:48:35,532
Perhaps this is the way
for the emergency exit.

750
00:48:35,557 --> 00:48:36,756
Houston shut the fuck up shit!

751
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:37,980
Shut the fuck up shit!

752
00:48:38,404 --> 00:48:40,602
This, you see?

753
00:48:40,627 --> 00:48:41,826
Move over.

754
00:48:41,851 --> 00:48:44,548
This work is man!

755
00:48:46,171 --> 00:48:47,969
Go la... You did?

756
00:48:48,694 --> 00:48:49,992
Give me a minute ok?

757
00:48:52,215 --> 00:48:56,011
Oh fuck!
We are here fucking locked!

758
00:48:56,735 --> 00:48:59,832
Let's get a tool.
We try to take the bars.

759
00:48:59,857 --> 00:49:04,652
I have a toolbox.
But it's in the bag, out there!

760
00:49:04,677 --> 00:49:07,574
There was you who wanted to lock in?

761
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,697
Fucking amazing idea!

762
00:49:10,221 --> 00:49:13,918
Obviously all
windows have bars.

763
00:49:13,943 --> 00:49:17,939
No, no! The window up there!
There was no bar do you?

764
00:49:17,963 --> 00:49:19,362
We go there.

765
00:49:19,387 --> 00:49:21,585
Come have my faith!

766
00:49:22,109 --> 00:49:24,607
What time is it Sasha?

767
00:49:24,632 --> 00:49:25,830
8:44

768
00:49:25,855 --> 00:49:27,054
You gotta be fucking kidding me!

769
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:30,126
I spotted you fucking? Got it?!

770
00:49:30,127 --> 00:49:33,173
8:44 pa are!
I have an audition tomorrow!

771
00:49:33,198 --> 00:49:35,396
Nobody cares to you
or with your fucking

772
00:49:35,397 --> 00:49:37,593
nor with the career
hearing your shit!

773
00:49:37,618 --> 00:49:39,317
Guys, let me
think for a minute!

774
00:49:39,342 --> 00:49:41,839
It makes no sense, it's all fucked!

775
00:49:41,864 --> 00:49:44,261
I checked the time of
Sunrise last night.

776
00:49:44,286 --> 00:49:46,284
What are you trying to say shit?

777
00:49:48,907 --> 00:49:51,005
Should begin to be
clear from the 7:45.

778
00:49:53,527 --> 00:49:55,825
But it's still night.

779
00:49:56,349 --> 00:49:59,546
Still is the night...
makes no sense!

780
00:49:59,571 --> 00:50:01,469
There's no joke man.

781
00:50:01,494 --> 00:50:02,892
Shut up!

782
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,116
It makes no sense.

783
00:50:04,141 --> 00:50:09,536
Get them out of this building! Please!
Somebody help us!

784
00:50:10,859 --> 00:50:17,353
Ok ok. Ok let's be rational?
A building is old right?

785
00:50:17,377 --> 00:50:20,874
It is an old building can
to be an anomaly

786
00:50:20,875 --> 00:50:24,370
power that made the mess
our clocks fastest...

787
00:50:24,395 --> 00:50:29,190
So if this does not
this would be hours yet.

788
00:50:29,215 --> 00:50:30,914
This would explain why
it is still dark,

789
00:50:30,915 --> 00:50:32,612
and why Kenny
has not yet appeared.

790
00:50:32,637 --> 00:50:35,134
Electric anomaly!
That idea sucks!

791
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:38,056
Why come to the
your ideas of rationalism?

792
00:50:38,081 --> 00:50:41,078
This is not an audition for any of the
your science fiction movies!

793
00:50:41,103 --> 00:50:42,502
There is nothing rational here.

794
00:50:42,503 --> 00:50:43,900
It is as rational as
anything else here.

795
00:51:10,398 --> 00:51:12,196
I checked my phone e...

796
00:51:15,318 --> 00:51:17,516
And mark 13:12 hours.

797
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:22,136
Is 13:12 pm

798
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:28,854
I do not think is right.
But I think that occurred to me...

799
00:51:29,678 --> 00:51:33,374
I do not know. They are all
are so tired

800
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:37,071
to take a nap.
Are taking a break.

801
00:51:38,494 --> 00:51:40,692
Let's wait until Kenny appears.

802
00:51:43,015 --> 00:51:46,611
I do not know how he
we will find.

803
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:47,835
Makes no sense.

804
00:51:51,256 --> 00:51:53,454
I have not slept for about 20 hours.

805
00:51:55,377 --> 00:52:01,870
I'll stop now for a bit e...
I take a nap.

806
00:52:32,064 --> 00:52:33,962
What the fuck?!

807
00:52:36,185 --> 00:52:38,083
Houston, what is your problem man?

808
00:52:38,108 --> 00:52:41,205
It was not me!
What are you doing, man?

809
00:52:43,228 --> 00:52:45,525
What happened?
Oh my God!

810
00:52:47,848 --> 00:52:51,844
Someone or something just
from our lights.

811
00:52:53,068 --> 00:52:55,565
We are in total darkness.
All we

812
00:52:55,566 --> 00:52:58,063
remains are the lanterns and
the lights of the cameras.

813
00:52:58,087 --> 00:53:01,484
What a waste.
I checked my phone.

814
00:53:01,509 --> 00:53:03,407
St. 8 pm.

815
00:53:03,632 --> 00:53:06,729
We slept for 7 hours.

816
00:53:06,754 --> 00:53:09,251
The TC was going to eat a sandwich e.??..

817
00:53:09,276 --> 00:53:10,874
They have to see it.

818
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:20,190
Lance! It smells bad
shut that shit!

819
00:53:20,215 --> 00:53:23,411
What are you doing? Close it there!

820
00:53:26,433 --> 00:53:29,830
All our food is so but
we still have plenty of water so...

821
00:53:30,055 --> 00:53:32,153
I do not know, we should be fine.

822
00:53:35,274 --> 00:53:37,872
Why not try to go through the tunnels?

823
00:53:37,897 --> 00:53:41,093
Kenny said that the tunnels
unite all the buildings.

824
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:43,316
Maybe we can find a
Output in other buildings.

825
00:53:43,341 --> 00:53:45,239
You see the Great Wall of China?

826
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:49,060
I'm not going to the tunnels...
If the lights go out we're fucked.

827
00:53:49,085 --> 00:53:52,082
Remember when you asked me
to record the sunset?

828
00:53:52,107 --> 00:53:54,654
I saw a fire exit.
If we ascend to the roof,

829
00:53:54,655 --> 00:53:57,202
maybe we can go down the
climbing and general merchandise here.

830
00:53:57,327 --> 00:53:59,774
So how?
We will stay here or...

831
00:53:59,775 --> 00:54:02,222
I do not care what we
only do we get out of here man!

832
00:54:02,247 --> 00:54:06,342
I do not want to be here.
Guys, want to do all this?

833
00:54:06,367 --> 00:54:08,365
On the roof! Okay, okay!

834
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:11,487
Let's get the equipment
whole, and let's go.

835
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:16,107
Give me a little personal light.
Sorry.

836
00:54:20,528 --> 00:54:22,326
Let's here?

837
00:54:22,351 --> 00:54:24,449
Lance? Where? No, no, no!

838
00:54:24,474 --> 00:54:26,721
TC said you knew where it was.

839
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:28,969
I said nothing!
Do not put the blame on me.

840
00:54:28,994 --> 00:54:33,290
I do not know where it was said.
I said I had stairs.

841
00:54:33,315 --> 00:54:35,562
What does that
matter now?

842
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,810
That's why we came.
I saw the outside.

843
00:54:37,835 --> 00:54:39,034
Ok! Fuck!

844
00:54:40,258 --> 00:54:42,555
I can not do it guys!

845
00:54:44,978 --> 00:54:47,175
What the fuck was that?!

846
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,298
Hello! Someone up here?

847
00:54:49,823 --> 00:54:51,621
TC! Is there?

848
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:54,042
I do not ask questions.
Stairs or not?

849
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:55,366
Let's get together.

850
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:58,338
Listen, keep the light
connected in front of me.

851
00:54:58,339 --> 00:55:00,186
Move it, move it go!

852
00:55:00,211 --> 00:55:03,508
Get out of my fucking face!
Out of my way!

853
00:55:04,632 --> 00:55:05,830
Wait guys! Slowly.

854
00:55:05,855 --> 00:55:07,853
What's wrong with you man?

855
00:55:10,476 --> 00:55:13,373
Yes! Yes! (Access to roof)

856
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,589
No way!

857
00:55:21,614 --> 00:55:24,611
Shut up and secure it. I see!

858
00:55:29,331 --> 00:55:31,929
It's solid ass!

859
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:34,950
What do you think?
It seems that there is a long time?

860
00:55:34,975 --> 00:55:37,173
Makes no sense.

861
00:55:37,798 --> 00:55:39,696
Fuck!

862
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:43,417
The fucking camera away from me!

863
00:55:46,638 --> 00:55:49,935
What do you think? I do not know, I do not know.

864
00:56:01,648 --> 00:56:07,642
Just left of the stairs.
Was completely sealed at the top!

865
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:10,164
I will document this
all, when we leave

866
00:56:10,165 --> 00:56:12,662
here, people will
want to see it.

867
00:56:15,284 --> 00:56:19,180
See it!
Here we climbed the stairs, right?

868
00:56:19,205 --> 00:56:20,903
This puts us on the 4th floor.

869
00:56:20,928 --> 00:56:24,525
We came here, we
be here at least, right?

870
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,248
Are you sure? I do not know...

871
00:56:26,273 --> 00:56:28,071
TC, this... Lance! Lance!

872
00:56:28,096 --> 00:56:29,295
What, what?

873
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:33,515
We are here? Can not...
Nor is there stairs!

874
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,538
It means nothing.

875
00:56:35,539 --> 00:56:37,536
This means that
we are on the 1st floor.

876
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:41,557
Remember that we
we came here right?

877
00:56:42,481 --> 00:56:47,676
TC, can you film it?
Yes, I'm shooting.

878
00:56:47,701 --> 00:56:49,599
This is so fucked!

879
00:56:50,423 --> 00:56:53,919
Fuck! What, what?

880
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:55,743
What the fuck? Did you hear that?

881
00:56:55,767 --> 00:56:58,065
Did you hear? What the fuck was that?

882
00:56:58,689 --> 00:57:01,986
What is this? Matt? Matt?

883
00:57:04,009 --> 00:57:06,806
Fuck! Matt! On this side!

884
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:12,825
Matt, are you?

885
00:57:15,347 --> 00:57:18,744
Staff will return! Matt!

886
00:57:19,768 --> 00:57:21,766
Not here. Not here!

887
00:57:23,289 --> 00:57:24,987
That just move?!

888
00:57:28,908 --> 00:57:31,506
Let's fuck out of here!

889
00:58:00,801 --> 00:58:03,698
We had all day to try
find a ladder.

890
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,017
I do not know.
We could not find any.

891
00:58:09,042 --> 00:58:10,241
This building is a maze of shit!

892
00:58:11,565 --> 00:58:13,663
That's what the TC says. It is as if this

893
00:58:13,664 --> 00:58:15,760
will always
change around us.

894
00:58:18,283 --> 00:58:21,280
We have not yet
find Matt.

895
00:58:21,305 --> 00:58:24,202
I do not know if he is okay.

896
00:58:24,227 --> 00:58:27,423
We should not be seeing so much shit!

897
00:58:32,543 --> 00:58:38,837
We are all tired, hungry.
We are trying to sleep again.

898
00:58:39,961 --> 00:58:42,558
This time we are sleeping in shifts.

899
00:58:42,982 --> 00:58:45,280
So it can always be one to watch.

900
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:54,595
TC, you're writing? Yes.

901
00:58:56,718 --> 00:58:59,316
We rise now.
You should see this!

902
00:58:59,341 --> 00:59:00,739
Off the fucking camera!

903
00:59:00,764 --> 00:59:02,461
Come Sasha!
We have to document everything.

904
00:59:02,486 --> 00:59:03,785
People have to see it.

905
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:05,009
Caution! Caution!

906
00:59:06,932 --> 00:59:09,429
Sasha, we will take it,
you have to understand...

907
00:59:09,454 --> 00:59:11,302
It is impossible for anyone
have come here and

908
00:59:11,303 --> 00:59:13,150
have done it without us
We give for nothing.

909
00:59:14,074 --> 00:59:16,072
Cut! Cut shovel there.

910
00:59:16,497 --> 00:59:18,295
Matt!

911
00:59:20,218 --> 00:59:21,717
I swear I heard.

912
00:59:21,742 --> 00:59:22,940
Matt!

913
00:59:24,664 --> 00:59:26,162
Hello!

914
00:59:26,587 --> 00:59:31,282
See? I told you that was
fucking heard! Alive.

915
00:59:31,307 --> 00:59:33,205
Matt! Are you okay?

916
00:59:34,229 --> 00:59:36,227
Can you hear me?

917
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:39,948
I'm frozen!

918
00:59:46,366 --> 00:59:48,964
Tell us where you are alone.
We'll pick you up!

919
00:59:51,786 --> 00:59:53,584
Shit!

920
00:59:53,609 --> 00:59:54,808
No longer there!

921
00:59:54,833 --> 00:59:56,331
We have to find it.

922
00:59:56,356 --> 00:59:57,954
How do we find the
if not managed

923
00:59:57,955 --> 00:59:59,553
find your way
to the front door?

924
00:59:59,578 --> 01:00:02,974
We should not be far off.
These walkie-talkies are a shit.

925
01:00:05,197 --> 01:00:07,395
How do you know what is it?

926
01:00:10,517 --> 01:00:13,813
Matt! Are you here?

927
01:00:14,937 --> 01:00:18,134
Sorry, sorry, sorry! Fuck!

928
01:00:18,558 --> 01:00:21,256
Matt! We hear you!
Where are you? Fuck!

929
01:00:23,778 --> 01:00:25,676
Sasha tries in all
frequencies.

930
01:00:25,677 --> 01:00:27,574
This is weak, has no
that much reach.

931
01:00:28,698 --> 01:00:30,296
How far is that
what was said?

932
01:00:30,297 --> 01:00:31,895
I did not say, was not
specifications.

933
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:37,214
Estimate? 200-300-400?
200 meters to get a clear sound.

934
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:39,137
Maybe 300 meters...
We will continue to walk.

935
01:00:39,162 --> 01:00:40,760
Before starting to cause noise.

936
01:00:40,785 --> 01:00:41,984
Stay together, come on.

937
01:00:42,908 --> 01:00:45,306
It's a dead end!
A dead end.

938
01:00:53,223 --> 01:00:55,321
Where are you fucking?

939
01:01:05,435 --> 01:01:07,333
Listen people this is
completely useless right?

940
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:09,856
If it were to find it...
the scope...

941
01:01:09,881 --> 01:01:11,079
Fuck!

942
01:01:11,704 --> 01:01:12,603
What the fuck was that?!

943
01:01:12,628 --> 01:01:13,827
It was Matt!

944
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:23,342
What are you doing, man?

945
01:01:27,463 --> 01:01:29,560
Lance! Lance!

946
01:01:31,184 --> 01:01:32,382
Oh fuck!

947
01:01:39,001 --> 01:01:41,099
Do something man.

948
01:01:41,623 --> 01:01:42,622
Lance! Lance!

949
01:01:47,242 --> 01:01:49,740
Who are you? What are you doing here?

950
01:02:07,147 --> 01:02:10,244
Turn off the light! Turn off the light!

951
01:02:12,067 --> 01:02:13,865
Have you seen the fucking her face?!

952
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:15,089
Shut your fucking mouth!

953
01:02:15,114 --> 01:02:16,312
Have you seen the fucking her face!?

954
01:02:24,029 --> 01:02:26,926
Why is this happening?
Oh my God!

955
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:33,844
Shit! Shit!

956
01:02:33,869 --> 01:02:37,965
We are lost!
Houston lost the fucking!

957
01:02:39,988 --> 01:02:41,487
Matt!

958
01:02:47,905 --> 01:02:50,003
Guys!

959
01:02:50,028 --> 01:02:51,227
Guys!

960
01:02:54,848 --> 01:02:56,446
Sasha!

961
01:03:06,461 --> 01:03:08,059
TC!

962
01:03:11,381 --> 01:03:12,979
Lance!

963
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:51,265
Is anybody there?!

964
01:04:19,061 --> 01:04:20,860
Help me! Guys!

965
01:04:47,657 --> 01:04:49,555
We are here today.

966
01:04:51,778 --> 01:04:53,076
The Houston disappeared.

967
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:58,696
Matt wanted to find the
radio but he does not respond.

968
01:05:01,018 --> 01:05:02,617
What the fuck was that?

969
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:07,337
Just go to weird shit
around us. Fuck!

970
01:05:10,758 --> 01:05:12,956
I do not know how long it will last.

971
01:05:16,577 --> 01:05:18,775
We are not alone.

972
01:05:23,995 --> 01:05:26,892
My name is on the bracelet!

973
01:05:26,917 --> 01:05:28,715
How is my name
is in the band?!

974
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:30,513
Fuck!

975
01:05:31,637 --> 01:05:35,033
First scratches on
my back and now...

976
01:05:36,857 --> 01:05:38,455
What the fuck!

977
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,028
When we wake,
we had one of these...

978
01:05:40,029 --> 01:05:41,577
have to do this.

979
01:05:41,602 --> 01:05:42,501
Fuck you!

980
01:05:44,324 --> 01:05:49,519
You wanted to get out of there was not?
I did not want!

981
01:05:49,543 --> 01:05:52,241
Vieste is not it? I did not want!

982
01:05:52,266 --> 01:05:54,264
That's it! What an idiot!

983
01:05:54,289 --> 01:05:57,385
What does this mean?
It means we're fucked.

984
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:58,609
Get it? It is what it means.

985
01:05:59,533 --> 01:06:01,231
This is crazy.

986
01:06:01,256 --> 01:06:03,155
This is crazy shit!

987
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:28,853
Do not look! Jesus Christ!

988
01:06:33,673 --> 01:06:35,272
What the fuck?!

989
01:06:39,193 --> 01:06:41,790
Is there something! What the fuck?

990
01:06:47,609 --> 01:06:49,307
Enough already!

991
01:06:49,332 --> 01:06:51,430
It is as if we walked in circles.

992
01:06:55,151 --> 01:06:58,348
Still can not find
or Matt Houston.

993
01:06:58,373 --> 01:07:01,370
Stop it! What do you mean, stop what?

994
01:07:01,395 --> 01:07:03,393
Are you kidding?
Fuck more to your program!

995
01:07:03,418 --> 01:07:05,815
I am not part of it... I just...

996
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:08,837
I'm just documenting ok?
People will want to see this!

997
01:07:08,862 --> 01:07:14,756
Matt disappeared and the Houston right?
We have to focus on out of here

998
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:15,880
and find them.

999
01:07:16,304 --> 01:07:20,101
And you're still doing that shit!

1000
01:07:20,125 --> 01:07:21,824
Okay folks, let's stop a bit.

1001
01:07:22,848 --> 01:07:23,647
I just...

1002
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:27,068
Fuck it, let's bazaar!

1003
01:07:32,787 --> 01:07:36,783
You can not run faster?
Let's fuck!

1004
01:07:36,808 --> 01:07:38,906
Oh my God! Come on!

1005
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:40,829
No, no, no, no! Arise!

1006
01:07:40,854 --> 01:07:42,552
Are you crazy?! Arise!

1007
01:07:43,077 --> 01:07:44,775
Arise!

1008
01:07:47,298 --> 01:07:49,895
I can not, I can not! You know!

1009
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,916
Arise, Arise!
I know, I know.

1010
01:07:53,941 --> 01:07:56,738
Go recovers. Do what you have to do!

1011
01:07:56,763 --> 01:07:59,560
We must continue on!

1012
01:08:00,684 --> 01:08:03,481
Damn! What, what?

1013
01:08:03,506 --> 01:08:05,404
I found something! Come here!

1014
01:08:06,728 --> 01:08:08,526
That are waiting for fucking? Come on!

1015
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:09,650
Look!

1016
01:08:11,772 --> 01:08:14,769
Matt? Is he right? I do not know man!

1017
01:08:18,191 --> 01:08:20,489
Matt, get up!

1018
01:08:22,611 --> 01:08:24,609
So you close
shit the room!

1019
01:08:33,325 --> 01:08:37,321
Man, to the jokes!
Matt are you okay?

1020
01:08:38,245 --> 01:08:38,945
Oh fuck!

1021
01:08:40,468 --> 01:08:45,363
The patient has some kind
phobia in childhood.

1022
01:08:45,388 --> 01:08:47,686
Matt! Oh my God!

1023
01:08:50,208 --> 01:08:52,506
Arise! Let's go!

1024
01:08:52,531 --> 01:08:55,028
Come on, get up!

1025
01:08:55,053 --> 01:08:57,550
Let us take you back!

1026
01:08:57,575 --> 01:08:59,773
Come on! Here, here!

1027
01:08:59,898 --> 01:09:01,097
Come on!

1028
01:09:03,419 --> 01:09:05,717
Put him in bed, leave it there.

1029
01:09:05,742 --> 01:09:08,040
You see anything? No, we're fine.

1030
01:09:10,662 --> 01:09:13,659
Where were you?
Where did you get those clothes?

1031
01:09:15,482 --> 01:09:19,678
Damn, talk with us!
Look at his wrist.

1032
01:09:19,703 --> 01:09:20,901
Matt? Matt?

1033
01:09:25,122 --> 01:09:27,020
How did these wounds?

1034
01:09:30,042 --> 01:09:34,537
Matt! What they'll do?
What did you see?

1035
01:09:36,161 --> 01:09:39,058
I'm sick of this!
We have to leave.

1036
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:44,627
Yes of course we can leave.
We can go.

1037
01:09:44,628 --> 01:09:46,975
When we are better.

1038
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:50,097
What? What do you mean
"When we are better"?

1039
01:09:50,121 --> 01:09:51,920
What the fuck does that mean?

1040
01:09:53,643 --> 01:09:55,641
I was not ready.

1041
01:09:57,164 --> 01:09:59,562
The process is slow. But the patient
was responding to treatment.

1042
01:09:59,587 --> 01:10:01,585
He's crazy.
Must be stoned or so.

1043
01:10:01,586 --> 01:10:03,583
Not to say
make sense.

1044
01:10:03,608 --> 01:10:06,105
TC! Shut up! Do not tell me to shut up.

1045
01:10:09,027 --> 01:10:11,924
Do not be sad it's okay.

1046
01:10:17,943 --> 01:10:20,141
It will help you too.

1047
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,958
Oh my God!

1048
01:10:29,681 --> 01:10:32,178
TC! Go check the door!
I've done it.

1049
01:10:32,203 --> 01:10:33,402
Go on!

1050
01:10:33,427 --> 01:10:37,623
Come on man.
Make sure that nothing is here!

1051
01:10:46,139 --> 01:10:48,337
We found Matt.

1052
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:52,058
It's completely fucked.

1053
01:11:03,671 --> 01:11:05,669
The TC is still here with us.

1054
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:07,492
What?

1055
01:11:07,517 --> 01:11:10,914
It's okay.
What are you doing?

1056
01:11:25,124 --> 01:11:27,621
I do not feel well.

1057
01:11:29,345 --> 01:11:31,143
There is something wrong with me.

1058
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:42,456
Yes, you're a bit hot.
You must have a fever.

1059
01:11:47,076 --> 01:11:49,074
It takes a lot of water. Thank you.

1060
01:11:49,099 --> 01:11:51,297
Get some sleep. I can not sleep.

1061
01:11:56,217 --> 01:11:59,514
And I think we'll ever get.

1062
01:12:04,434 --> 01:12:06,332
What the hell was this?

1063
01:12:06,357 --> 01:12:07,555
Jesus!

1064
01:12:14,673 --> 01:12:17,171
Come on!

1065
01:12:21,991 --> 01:12:24,788
Come on... go!

1066
01:12:25,512 --> 01:12:27,210
Quick, here!

1067
01:12:58,903 --> 01:13:01,400
You see anything? What is it?

1068
01:13:02,324 --> 01:13:05,221
There is blood in the bathtub!
There is blood in the bathtub!

1069
01:13:05,246 --> 01:13:07,344
What? Come on!

1070
01:13:07,369 --> 01:13:09,167
We go where man? Come on!

1071
01:13:13,488 --> 01:13:15,286
What the fuck?!

1072
01:13:18,308 --> 01:13:19,606
Matt? Matt?

1073
01:13:19,631 --> 01:13:22,129
What do these fucking?
TC! Stay away from the bathtub.

1074
01:13:22,154 --> 01:13:23,752
Come on Matt!

1075
01:13:23,777 --> 01:13:25,675
TC! What is it
Cock is doing?

1076
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:27,898
Fuck, I do not know!

1077
01:13:31,819 --> 01:13:34,017
Oh my God! Oh my God!

1078
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:37,238
Help me! Help me!

1079
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:39,361
Turn the tub!

1080
01:13:48,077 --> 01:13:49,476
Gone!

1081
01:13:49,701 --> 01:13:51,099
Gone!

1082
01:13:51,723 --> 01:13:53,522
Fucking disappeared!

1083
01:13:53,946 --> 01:13:56,044
Suddenly gone! Without a trace!

1084
01:15:08,395 --> 01:15:10,393
Shit! No, no!

1085
01:15:16,511 --> 01:15:18,509
It is a lift!

1086
01:15:19,034 --> 01:15:20,932
Open it! Open it!

1087
01:15:21,157 --> 01:15:22,755
Open it! Open it!

1088
01:15:27,975 --> 01:15:29,873
It's just the echo of the elevator.

1089
01:15:30,397 --> 01:15:32,145
If we reach
tunnels, perhaps

1090
01:15:32,146 --> 01:15:33,894
can get out by
other building.

1091
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:42,210
Go there!

1092
01:15:42,435 --> 01:15:43,933
Fuck! Fuck!

1093
01:15:45,557 --> 01:15:51,550
Hear! Watch out Matt,
I'll get some tools.

1094
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:54,672
Stay here.

1095
01:16:33,957 --> 01:16:35,455
What the fuck is that?

1096
01:16:38,477 --> 01:16:40,375
Jesus! It is a language? Fuck!

1097
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:03,177
What's up? What's up?

1098
01:17:09,895 --> 01:17:11,393
Bring the light, points to there.

1099
01:17:14,216 --> 01:17:17,113
Here is a ladder. Head down.

1100
01:17:18,336 --> 01:17:19,735
How do we take Matt?

1101
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,457
I'll go first and you come
then with Matt ok?

1102
01:17:26,578 --> 01:17:28,876
Get away! It is back there.

1103
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:31,498
Lance! Lance!

1104
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:41,912
Where is the button?

1105
01:17:43,236 --> 01:17:44,435
Oh here it is!

1106
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:33,909
Is gone?

1107
01:18:34,933 --> 01:18:36,631
I do not know, disappeared.

1108
01:18:37,655 --> 01:18:40,152
Ok ok. Let's go.

1109
01:18:44,373 --> 01:18:46,571
Where is he? Matt!

1110
01:18:49,493 --> 01:18:51,591
Jesus! He jumped! He jumped!

1111
01:19:21,785 --> 01:19:22,983
Come on!

1112
01:19:23,508 --> 01:19:25,306
Relax. You're done!

1113
01:19:31,625 --> 01:19:34,022
It's okay. It's okay.

1114
01:19:47,433 --> 01:19:48,732
The tunnels are here!

1115
01:19:50,455 --> 01:19:53,053
Finally we arrived.

1116
01:19:53,477 --> 01:19:56,674
I can not. I can not go.

1117
01:19:56,699 --> 01:19:58,497
Come on, Sasha!

1118
01:19:58,522 --> 01:20:01,119
Kenny said that connected
all buildings.

1119
01:20:01,843 --> 01:20:03,242
You have to do this to me.

1120
01:20:03,467 --> 01:20:05,365
I can not do this alone!
Ok? Ok

1121
01:20:11,184 --> 01:20:13,681
It is close to me and let's here.

1122
01:20:16,004 --> 01:20:17,902
Should not be too far away.

1123
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,418
Okay, off you go.

1124
01:20:33,236 --> 01:20:37,432
No, no! We've already been here!

1125
01:20:39,255 --> 01:20:41,852
We should not be here! What the fuck?!

1126
01:20:47,472 --> 01:20:49,170
I can not go!

1127
01:20:51,293 --> 01:20:52,891
Wait a minute!

1128
01:21:16,292 --> 01:21:18,789
I want my mother!

1129
01:21:37,196 --> 01:21:38,694
It's day...

1130
01:21:39,219 --> 01:21:41,216
What day is today?

1131
01:21:44,838 --> 01:21:47,835
I do not know what day it is.

1132
01:21:48,359 --> 01:21:50,707
We spent the whole day
walking in one direction.

1133
01:21:50,708 --> 01:21:53,054
We did not get anywhere.

1134
01:21:54,178 --> 01:21:57,075
It pains me much to leg.

1135
01:21:57,100 --> 01:22:02,495
Sasha could.
It will not be able to continue.

1136
01:22:06,815 --> 01:22:08,513
Who's there?

1137
01:22:09,437 --> 01:22:11,136
Who are you?

1138
01:23:12,098 --> 01:23:13,896
Sasha?

1139
01:23:24,011 --> 01:23:25,609
Sasha, where are you?

1140
01:23:25,634 --> 01:23:26,633
Where are you?

1141
01:23:52,332 --> 01:23:54,030
Fuck!

1142
01:24:01,547 --> 01:24:03,745
What do you want?

1143
01:24:09,564 --> 01:24:11,562
What do you want?

1144
01:24:34,064 --> 01:24:36,861
I'm running out
battery bit by bit.

1145
01:24:40,083 --> 01:24:42,380
Now, I can only connect
lights when needed.

1146
01:24:44,303 --> 01:24:46,601
But I do not need more light!

1147
01:24:49,623 --> 01:24:51,721
Just me walking straight ahead.

1148
01:24:53,844 --> 01:24:56,041
He could continue to walk for hours.

1149
01:24:58,264 --> 01:24:59,863
It's like a game.

1150
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:08,778
How far can you go?

1151
01:25:10,502 --> 01:25:12,500
If someone is watching this...

1152
01:25:14,223 --> 01:25:15,422
Fuck you!

1153
01:25:19,742 --> 01:25:20,941
Fuck you!

1154
01:25:21,765 --> 01:25:23,363
Fuck you, fuck!

1155
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:27,184
This was for you.

1156
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:30,944
Do not you hear anything? Do not you hear anything?

1157
01:26:30,969 --> 01:26:32,767
Do not you hear anything?

1158
01:26:36,089 --> 01:26:38,686
I'm alive!

1159
01:26:44,106 --> 01:26:46,503
I woke up e...

1160
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:49,925
I do not know how long
I was sleeping but...

1161
01:26:50,649 --> 01:26:52,547
There is a door!

1162
01:26:52,572 --> 01:26:54,770
Look!

1163
01:27:42,845 --> 01:27:44,643
This is not happening.

1164
01:27:46,766 --> 01:27:48,165
This is not happening.

1165
01:27:51,287 --> 01:27:53,185
I must be crazy!

1166
01:28:57,743 --> 01:28:59,442
Jesus!

1167
01:29:26,838 --> 01:29:28,736
It is not possible!

1168
01:29:43,047 --> 01:29:45,744
No! I'm not crazy!

1169
01:29:45,769 --> 01:29:49,665
I'm not loco! No! No! No!

1170
01:30:01,578 --> 01:30:03,975
I'm so much better now!

1171
01:30:07,297 --> 01:30:08,496
Finally, I can go home!

1172
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:18,710
Grave Encounters. I'm Lance Preston.

1173
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:24,329
Cut!

1174
01:30:24,330 --> 01:30:27,727
Subtitling and Translation: MrJonny and
Rafaela

1175
