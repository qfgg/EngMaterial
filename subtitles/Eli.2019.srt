1
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:15,635
爸 爸
{\fs12}Dad! Dad! Dad!

2
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:16,803
好烫！
{\fs12}It burns! Aah!

3
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,849
不！
{\fs12}Dad! No!

4
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:26,771
伊莱？
{\fs12}Eli?

5
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,444
伊莱？
{\fs12}Eli?

6
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,322
你还好吗？
{\fs12}Are you okay?

7
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,493
做了同样的梦
{\fs12}Had the same dream.

8
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,371
你以为你已经痊愈的梦？
{\fs12}The one where you thought you were cured?

9
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:46,583
对
{\fs12}Yeah.

10
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,668
你会的，宝贝
{\fs12}You will be, honey. 

11
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,879
所以我们才要这样做
{\fs12}That's why we're doing this.

12
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,798
只要再开一段路就到了，好吗？
{\fs12}Just one more drive to go, okay?

13
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,719
你保证？ -我保证
{\fs12}Promise? -Promise.

14
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,430
我们在太阳下山前就会到了
{\fs12}We'll be there before sunset.

15
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,765
我说的是痊愈
{\fs12}I mean about being cured.

16
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,268
我对天发誓
{\fs12}Cross my heart.

17
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,190
你知道我爱你，对吧？
{\fs12}You know I love you, right?

18
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,360
我知道
{\fs12}I know.

19
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,612
（夜莺汽车旅馆）

20
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,746
还是刷不过？
{\fs12}Also declined.

21
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,498
什么？
{\fs12}What's that?

22
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,415
刷不过
{\fs12}Declined.

23
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,756
我只有这些
{\fs12}That's all I got.

24
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,263
三个人，住两晚？
{\fs12}Three people, two nights? 

25
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,389
那要240元
{\fs12}That's 240.

26
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,599
我们住一个晚上而已
{\fs12}We stayed one night.

27
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,894
（退房规定 超过早上9点退房，加收一晚费用）

28
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,691
手表挺不错的
{\fs12}Nice watch.

29
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:37,819
我们走
{\fs12}Let's go. 

30
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,362
阳光很强
{\fs12}Burning daylight.

31
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,321
我们准备好了
{\fs12}We're ready.

32
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,241
来吧，宝贝
{\fs12}Come on, honey.

33
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,207
哇靠，看看那个
{\fs12}Holy shit, dude. Check that out.

34
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,043
那是什么玩意啊？
{\fs12}What the fresh fuck is that? -Ha ha ha ha ha.

35
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,921
休士顿，我们有麻烦了
{\fs12}Houston, we have a problem.

36
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,923
嘿，外星人
{\fs12}Hey, spaceman,

37
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,758
你哪个星球的？天王星？
{\fs12}what planet are you from--Uranus?

38
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,593
天王星
{\fs12}Uranus.

39
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:05,805
伊莱！
{\fs12}Eli.

40
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,517
是我
{\fs12}Come here... honey. Ah. It's me.

41
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,644
没事，是我
{\fs12}It's okay.

42
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,106
妈，衣服破了…
{\fs12}Mom. Mom, it's ripped. Mom, it's--

43
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,358
衣服破了，快拿胶带
{\fs12}It's ripped. Get the tape.

44
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,569
没事，我来处理 -他会晕厥的
{\fs12} It's okay. I got him - He's gonna pass out.

45
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,740
伊莱，你没事了，交给我
{\fs12}Eli, you're okay. I got it.

46
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,241
深呼吸，伊莱
{\fs12}Breathe, Eli.

47
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,910
我很抱歉 -伊莱，冷静
{\fs12}I'm sorry. -Eli, calm down. 

48
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:28,870
他需要呼吸
{\fs12}Take it easy.

49
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,079
呼吸，宝贝
{\fs12}Breathe, honey. 

50
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,707
伊莱，看着我，我在这里
{\fs12}Eli, look at me. I'm right here.

51
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,296
很行嘛，混蛋，欺负生病的孩子
{\fs12}Real tough, assholes, picking on a sick kid.

52
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,049
别看他们，这里只有你和我，好吗？
{\fs12}Don't look at them. It's just you and me, okay?

53
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,260
别看他们，看着我，好吗？
{\fs12}Hey, don't look at them. Look at me, okay? 

54
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,595
呼吸
{\fs12}Breathe.

55
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,263
成熟点吧 -呼吸，宝贝
{\fs12} Go grow up. - Breathe, honey.

56
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,016
你能闻到刚出炉的生日蛋糕吗？
{\fs12}Can you smell that birthday cake fresh from the oven?

57
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,852
好，深呼吸，闻到了吗？
{\fs12}All right, breathe in. Smell it?

58
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,104
吹蜡烛
{\fs12}Blow out those candles.

59
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,606
抿着唇
{\fs12}Purse your lips.

60
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,400
就是这样，很好
{\fs12}That's it. Good.

61
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,445
还有几枝蜡烛，通通吹熄
{\fs12}There's a couple more left. Blow 'em out.

62
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,531
很好
{\fs12}That's good.

63
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,203
现在许个愿
{\fs12}Now make a wish.

64
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,918
你许了什么愿？
{\fs12}What did you wish for?

65
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,214
我希望可以痛打他们一顿
{\fs12}I wish I could beat the crap out of them.

66
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,051
许别的愿望
{\fs12}Make another wish.

67
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,304
洪恩医生能治好我
{\fs12}That Dr. Horn can fix me.

68
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,270
我们离开这里吧？
{\fs12}Should we get out of here?

69
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,066
走吧 -再见，老弟
{\fs12}Come on. -See ya, man.

70
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,776
发射喽！ -好耶！
{\fs12}Blast off. -Yeah.

71
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,529
再见！
{\fs12}Bye.

72
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,118
可恶！
{\fs12}Shit.

73
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,412
混蛋！
{\fs12}Asshole.

74
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,656
烂货
{\fs12}Piece of shit. 

75
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,241
之前的车就不会这样
{\fs12}The old car never did that.

76
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,452
我不是在说车子，我是在说你
{\fs12}I wasn't talking about the car. I was talking about you.

77
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,369
保罗！
{\fs12}Paul.

78
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,249
怎么？他知道我在开玩笑
{\fs12}What? He knows I'm kidding.

79
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,420
但我们确实要勒紧裤带 才能带你去看这个医生，小子
{\fs12}But we did need to tighten our belts to get you to this doctor, pal.

80
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,131
我知道
{\fs12}I know.

81
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,426
她值得我们花的每一分钱
{\fs12}Well, she's gonna be worth every penny.

82
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,052
她简直是神医
{\fs12}She's a miracle worker. 

83
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,221
对吧？
{\fs12}Right?

84
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,478
你要不要拿我的牌给我看？
{\fs12}Are you gonna show me my card or not? -Oh.

85
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,356
这是
{\fs12}Is...

86
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:03,983
你的牌吗？
{\fs12}this your card?

87
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,236
那是我的牌
{\fs12}That is my card.

88
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,280
你怎么做到的？
{\fs12}How'd you do that?

89
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,073
这不是你的牌
{\fs12}It's not your card. 

90
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,075
你只是骗我，想让我好过一点
{\fs12}You're lying to me to make me feel better.

91
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,703
冷静，宝贝，我不会骗你的
{\fs12}Calm down. I wouldn't lie to you, baby. 

92
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,038
对吧？保罗
{\fs12}Right, Paul?

93
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,874
他很紧张 -对
{\fs12}He's nervous. -I know.

94
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,546
我真想念华盛顿特区
{\fs12}I miss DC.

95
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,419
这是我们要住的地方？
{\fs12}Is this where we're staying?

96
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,921
是的，小子 -对
{\fs12}It is, buddy. -Yep.

97
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,881
只住一阵子
{\fs12}Just for a little while.

98
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,361
拿好你的东西，我们走
{\fs12}Hey, get your stuff. Let's go.

99
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,381
门铃呢？
{\fs12}Where's the doorbell?

100
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,757
我不知道
{\fs12}I don't know.

101
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,352
欢迎，米勒一家，我是洪恩医生
{\fs12}Welcome, Miller family. This is Dr. Horn.

102
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,480
为了保护屋子的完整性
{\fs12}In order to protect the integrity of the house,

103
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,985
进出只能经过消毒室
{\fs12}the decontamination chamber is our only way in or out.

104
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,989
伊莱，你可以自己先进来吗？
{\fs12}Eli, will you please enter first by yourself?

105
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,074
我们跟着就来
{\fs12}We'll be right behind you.

106
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,118
你不会有事的
{\fs12} You're okay.

107
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,578
你可以的
{\fs12}You got this.

108
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,148
请举起双臂
{\fs12} Raise your arms, please.

109
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,415
（净化完成）

110
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:22,390
你好，伊莱

114
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,155

00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,449
总算见到本人了 -洪恩医生
{\fs12} Nice to meet you in the flesh finally. - Dr. Horn.

116
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,828
我的护士，芭芭拉和玛丽瑟拉
{\fs12} These are my nurses--Barbara, Maricela. 

117
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:44,954
幸会
{\fs12}Pleased to meet you.

118
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,247
这地方还好找吧？
{\fs12}Did you find the place okay?

119
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,833
你们好，米勒先生太太 -叫我萝丝就好
{\fs12} Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Miller. - Call me Rose.

120
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,877
我们很高兴你们前来 你们会受到很好的照顾
{\fs12}We're so happy to have you out here. You're in good hands.

121
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,504
我知道 -这里真不错
{\fs12}I know. -It's so lovely here.

122
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,673
我认为隔离对灵魂很好
{\fs12}I find the isolation is good for the soul.

123
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,925
失陪一下
{\fs12}Excuse me.

124
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,598
你可以脱掉防护衣了
{\fs12}You can take your suit off now.

125
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:06,767
你很安全
{\fs12}You're safe.

126
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,561
如果这里有污染呢？
{\fs12}What if there are contaminates? 

127
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,770
这里没有，宝贝
{\fs12}There aren't any.

128
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,981
这是净化屋
{\fs12}This is a clean house.

129
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,697
他有点害羞 -不急
{\fs12}He's a little shy. -There's no rush.

130
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,949
你必须先相信自己
{\fs12}You have to trust yourself first. 

131
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,701
去拿米勒家的行李吧？
{\fs12}Will you fetch the Millers' luggage?

132
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:24,827
好的 -当然
{\fs12}Right away. -Absolutely.

要多久时间？ -治疗吗？
{\fs12} How long will it take? The treatment? 

135
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,835
我们分三阶段进行
{\fs12}We do it in three stages.

136
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,795
这叫病毒基因疗法
{\fs12}It's called Viral Gene Therapy.

137
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,799
你的免疫系统 制造太多坏的免疫球蛋白…
{\fs12}You see, your immune system produces too many bad immunoglobulin--

138
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,218
我身体的重组活化基因有缺陷
{\fs12}My body carries a defective RAG1-RAG2 gene.

139
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,096
我们可以用编码病毒来矫正缺陷
{\fs12}Which we can correct using an encoded virus.

140
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,556
你真的很懂你的身体
{\fs12}You really know your stuff. 

141
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,474
我做了研究
{\fs12}I read.

142
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,601
萝丝和保罗，你们住这一层楼
{\fs12}Rose and Paul, you'll be on this floor,

143
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,186
但我们要先去伊莱的房间
{\fs12}but we're gonna go to Eli's room first.

144
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,854
他不能和我们一起睡吗？
{\fs12}Can't he sleep with us?

145
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,024
很遗憾，我们的病患 必须在自己的房间接受治疗
{\fs12}Unfortunately, our patients must be in their own rooms for treatment.

146
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,109
你当医生多久了？
{\fs12}How long have you been a doctor? 

147
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,819
我成为免疫学者有25年了
{\fs12}I've been an immunologist for 25 years,

148
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,863
但这间净化屋是三年前成立的
{\fs12}but I started this clean house three years ago.

149
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,990
你治疗过几个病人？
{\fs12}How many patients have you treated?

150
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,283
相当多
{\fs12}Quite a few.

151
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,910
他们都被你治愈了？
{\fs12}And you've cured all of them?

152
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,874
你治好他们了？
{\fs12}And you've cured all of them?

153
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:15,419
伊莱，我知道你很紧张 但你不用紧张
{\fs12}Eli, I know you're nervous, but you don't need to be.

154
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,671
我会让你好起来
{\fs12}I will make you better.

155
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,885
别担心
{\fs12}Don't worry about that. 

156
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,887
那是空气过滤机的声音
{\fs12}That's the sound of the air filtration.

157
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,181
老旧管线有时会因此震动
{\fs12}Sometimes it makes the old piping vibrate.

158
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,891
这是一间老房子了
{\fs12}This is an old house.

159
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,144
在我买下之前 这间屋子不知道废弃多久了
{\fs12}It had been abandoned for God knows how long before I bought it. 

160
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,103
我们走吧？
{\fs12}Shall we?

161
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,607
那下面是什么？
{\fs12}What's down there?

162
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,736
这间屋子不是所有区域 都改造成净化的环境
{\fs12}Not all of the house had been retrofitted to be a clean environment.

163
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,530
但是别担心
{\fs12}But don't worry. 

164
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,864
这些区域都气密隔离了
{\fs12}These seals are airtight.

165
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,201
我们继续好吗？
{\fs12}Shall we continue?

166
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,290
伊莱
{\fs12}Eli.

167
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,380
这是你的房间，伊莱
{\fs12}This is your room, Eli.

168
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,741
我知道你需要时间适应
{\fs12}I know it's a lot to get used to,

169
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,411
但我希望你不要把这里想成医疗机构
{\fs12}but I hope you don't think of this as a medical facility.

170
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,956
对我来说，这里就是家 现在也是你的家了
{\fs12}To me it's a home, and for now, it's your home.

171
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,294
水安全吗？
{\fs12}Is the water safe?

172
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,175
这里的水彻底过滤了
{\fs12}The water here is completely filtered, 

173
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,385
比瓶装水更洁净
{\fs12}purer than bottled water.

174
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,263
你可能很久没有淋浴了
{\fs12}Probably a long time since you've had a shower.

175
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,268
宝贝，你可以信任洪恩医生
{\fs12}You can trust Dr. Horn, honey.

176
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,436
呼吸
{\fs12}Breathe.

177
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,521
没事的，呼吸
{\fs12}It's okay to breathe.

178
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:41,815
没事的
{\fs12}It's okay.

179
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,153
就是这样
{\fs12}That's it.

180
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,005
好久没抱你了
{\fs12}Oh, it's been so long.

181
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,050
我爱你
{\fs12}I love you.

182
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:09,927
我知道
{\fs12}I know.

183
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,511
这是哪来的？
{\fs12}Where'd you get that?

184
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,389
这是回家时要给他穿的，你喜欢吗？
{\fs12}It's for him to wear when we go home. Do you like it?

185
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,895
当他脱下防护衣 你看到他的脸了吗？
{\fs12}Did you see his face when he took off the suit?

186
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,815
他好快乐
{\fs12}He was so happy.

187
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:06,984
你记得吗？
{\fs12}You remember?

188
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,069
快乐？
{\fs12}Happy? Hmm?

189
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,698
我只是心里还有很多事
{\fs12}I just got a lot on my mind. 

190
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:13,615
我知道
{\fs12}I know.

191
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,160
但是这会成功的
{\fs12}But this is gonna work.

192
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,497
这就是我们期待的
{\fs12}Everything we hoped for.

193
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,209
我祈求的一切就在这里
{\fs12}Everything I prayed for is right here.

194
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,381
他会好起来的
{\fs12}He's gonna get better.

195
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,842
我们要有信心
{\fs12}We just gotta have faith.

196
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,262
我有信心
{\fs12}I do.

197
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,891
我向来信得过
{\fs12}I've always been a faithful man.

198
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:28,565
嗨
{\fs12}Hi.

199
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,944
你要进来吗？
{\fs12}Do you want to come in?

200
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:09,982
伊莱？
{\fs12}Eli?

201
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,990
天啊，你在发抖
{\fs12}My God, you're shaking.

202
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,076
今晚我可以和你们睡吗？
{\fs12}Can I sleep in your bed tonight?

203
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,480
早安，伊莱
{\fs12}Good morning, Eli. 

204
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,815
你觉得如何？
{\fs12}How are you feeling?

205
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,567
还好
{\fs12} Okay. 

206
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,152
听说你昨晚没睡好
{\fs12}I heard you didn't sleep well.

207
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,824
我的房间有别的东西
{\fs12}There was something in my room.

208
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,367
是什么？
{\fs12}What was it? 

209
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,285
我不知道
{\fs12}I don't know.

210
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:04,745
好像是…
{\fs12}Like... 

211
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,372
有人对着窗户呵气？
{\fs12}breathing on the window?

212
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,751
你当时在睡觉还是醒着？
{\fs12}Were you asleep or awake?

213
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,711
醒着
{\fs12}Awake.

214
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,546
应该是吧
{\fs12}I think.

215
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,967
你服用的免疫抑制剂 副作用是会做恶梦
{\fs12}Bad dreams are a side effect of the immunosuppressants you're taking.

216
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,179
以前有些病患还出现幻觉，这很正常
{\fs12}I've even had some patients hallucinate. It's perfectly normal.

217
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,431
我们开始吧？
{\fs12}Shall we begin?

218
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:45,869
你们不一起来？
{\fs12}You're not coming?

219
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:49,748
妈？
{\fs12}Mom?

220
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:54,169
我们必须待在这里，宝贝 -我们不会离开的，我保证
{\fs12}We have to stay here, honey? We won't move from this spot. Promise.

221
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,259
伊莱
{\fs12}Eli.

222
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,428
你何不许个愿？
{\fs12}Why don't you make a wish?

223
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,354
你许了什么愿？
{\fs12}What'd you wish for?

224
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:15,691
希望我很勇敢
{\fs12}That I was brave.

225
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,236
你已经很勇敢了
{\fs12}You already are.

226
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:36,920
这边请
{\fs12}Just this way.

227
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,519
站在那边
{\fs12}Stand there.

228
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,063
站在那边
{\fs12}Stand there.

229
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,691
双手举高
{\fs12}Hands in the air.

230
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,615
6…66
{\fs12}Seis, sesenta y seis.

231
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,159
手臂张开
{\fs12}Arms out.

232
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,245
转身
{\fs12}Turn around.

233
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,664
等等
{\fs12}Wait.

234
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,965
转身，伊莱，面向这边
{\fs12}Vírese, Eli. Face this way.

235
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,844
为何要拍我的照片？
{\fs12}Why are you taking my picture?

236
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,679
拍好了
{\fs12}Listo.

237
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,264
你是哪里人？
{\fs12}Where are you from?

238
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,187
你知道问太多问的男孩怎么了吗？
{\fs12}Do you know what happened to the boy who asked too many questions?

239
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:37,898
他得到答案了？
{\fs12}He got answers?

240
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,282
上手术台
{\fs12}Stations.

241
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,766
伊莱，这是何时开始的？
{\fs12}So when did this all start, Eli?

242
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,185
大概四年前
{\fs12}About four years ago.

243
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,604
但现在情况更糟了
{\fs12}But it's much worse now.

244
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,649
我的病患都像你一样
{\fs12}My patients are all just like you.

245
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,651
免疫系统都出了问题
{\fs12}All with failing immune systems.

246
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,279
病症潜伏到你这个年龄才发作
{\fs12}The condition remains dormant until around your age.

247
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,659
你认为让你生病的因素是什么？
{\fs12}What do you think is making you sick?

248
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,743
针筒
{\fs12}Needle.

249
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,704
很多
{\fs12}Lots of things.

250
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,457
空气、水
{\fs12}The air, water.

251
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,877
灰尘
{\fs12}Dust. 

252
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,379
有可能是那些东西
{\fs12}Could be those things.

253
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,339
也可能是别的因素
{\fs12}Could be something else.

254
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,385
因为自体免疫症候群的核心是什么？
{\fs12}Because what is an autoimmune syndrome at its core?

255
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,224
是身体本身会奋战，对吗？
{\fs12}It's the body fighting itself, right?

256
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,852
在正常、健康的身体
{\fs12}In a normal, healthy body,

257
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,479
骨髓里的干细胞会产生抗体
{\fs12}antibodies are produced by stem cells in the marrow.

258
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,274
但是你身体中的基因受损
{\fs12}But in your body, that gene is impaired,

259
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,776
所以我要把这种特别修正过的病毒
{\fs12}so I'm gonna take this modified virus 

260
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,695
注射到你的骨髓中
{\fs12}and inject it into the marrow.

261
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:11,074
病毒会修补你的基因 重启你的整个免疫系统
{\fs12}This virus is gonna repair that gene and reset your entire immune system.

262
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,827
就像变魔术一样
{\fs12}Poof. Like a magic trick.

263
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:15,662
好吗？
{\fs12}Right?

264
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,602
手术刀
{\fs12}Scalpel.

265
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,610
骨干打洞器
{\fs12}Bone punch.

266
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,575
我要你从100开始倒数
{\fs12}So, I want you to count back from 100.

267
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,328
100…
{\fs12}One hundred...

268
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:58,955
99…
{\fs12}Ninety-nine...

269
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:02,876
98…
{\fs12}Ninety-eight...

270
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,504
继续数
{\fs12}Keep counting.

271
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,256
97…
{\fs12}Ninety-seven...

272
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,176
96…
{\fs12}Ninety-six...

273
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,346
95…
{\fs12}Ninety-five...

274
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,807
94…
{\fs12}Ninety-four...

275
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,770
93…
{\fs12}Ninety-three...

276
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,358
92…
{\fs12}Ninety-two...

277
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,658
什么…
{\fs12}What-What...

278
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,343
洪恩医生？
{\fs12}Dr. Horn? 

279
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,220
洪恩医生，让我走
{\fs12}Dr. Horn, let me go.

280
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,555
我不能，伊莱
{\fs12}I can't do that, Eli.

281
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,432
洪恩医生，好烫！
{\fs12}Dr. Horn, it burns.

282
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,434
那是药物 -不！
{\fs12}That's the medication. 

283
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:02,894
不，真的很烫！
{\fs12}No! No, it really burns.

284
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,396
那表示起作用了
{\fs12}That means it's working.

285
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,297
我不该那样做的
{\fs12}Ah. I shouldn't have done that.

286
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,299
毕竟你是病人
{\fs12}What, with you being sick and all. 

287
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,176
你怎么知道我生病了？
{\fs12}How do you know I'm sick?

288
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,220
你来这里了，不是吗？
{\fs12}Well, you're in there, aren't you?

289
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,556
你们都是生病才来的
{\fs12}That's where all of you stay.

290
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,975
他们说你对外界过敏，是吗？
{\fs12}They say you're what, like, allergic to the world, right?

291
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,353
你可以这样说
{\fs12}I-I guess you could say that.

292
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,063
所以你不曾到外面玩？
{\fs12}So you've never been outside?

293
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,398
不，我有
{\fs12}No, I have. 

294
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,316
我不是生下来就这样的
{\fs12}I mean, I wasn't born like this.

295
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,694
我妈告诉我，生我很辛苦
{\fs12}My mom-My mom told me I was a tough birth.

296
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,571
我怀孕时她病得很重
{\fs12}She was sick a lot when I was pregnant. 

297
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,157
应该说她怀孕时，但是…
{\fs12}Er, um, when she was pregnant, but...

298
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,201
我最近才发病… -你对大家都长篇大论？
{\fs12}I was fine until recently-- -You tell everybody your life story?

299
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,789
你真可爱
{\fs12}You're cute. 

300
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:10,915
我是海莉
{\fs12}I'm Haley.

301
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,459
我就住在附近
{\fs12}I live down the road.

302
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,169
我是伊莱
{\fs12}I'm Eli. 

303
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,462
你叫什么？
{\fs12}You're what?

304
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,089
伊莱，我叫伊莱
{\fs12}Eli. My name's Eli.

305
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:21,843
不，我不喜欢
{\fs12}No, I don't like it. 

306
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,803
我要叫你别的名字
{\fs12}I want to call you something else.

307
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,597
你喜欢什么？
{\fs12}What are you into?

308
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,140
你喜欢做什么？
{\fs12}What do you like to do?

309
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,477
我喜欢魔术，扑克牌魔术
{\fs12}Um, I like magic--card tricks.

310
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,270
扑克牌魔术？
{\fs12}Card tricks? 

311
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,605
哇
{\fs12}Wow.

312
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:34,898
不
{\fs12}No. 

313
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,107
不，你看
{\fs12}No, look.

314
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,402
等等
{\fs12}Hold on a sec.

315
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,658
你看，挑一张牌，随便一张
{\fs12}Look. Pick a card, any card.

316
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,204
等等，所以我挑一张牌
{\fs12}Wait. So I pick a card and then-

317
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,539
然后你就会…
{\fs12}and then what, you're gonna, like, guess what card I picked?

318
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,416
猜出我挑中的牌？
{\fs12}Uh... -Hey, 

319
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,420
你要看真正的魔术吗？
{\fs12}you want to see a real trick?

320
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,217
我可以靠意志力让这段木片起火
{\fs12}I can light this twig on fire with my mind.

321
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,345
你不相信我？看好了
{\fs12}Don't believe me? Watch.

322
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,601
你怕火吗？
{\fs12}You scared of fire?

323
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,230
不怕
{\fs12}Uh... no.

324
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,067
我以前很怕火
{\fs12}I used to be scared of fire, 

325
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,485
然后我学会如何控制火
{\fs12}then I learned how to master it.

326
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,530
火柴在哪里？
{\fs12}Where's the match?

327
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,699
什么火柴？
{\fs12}What match?

328
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,494
少来，你转身就是在点燃火柴
{\fs12}Come on. It's what you were doing when you turned around.

329
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,412
你藏在掌心，然后分散我的注意力
{\fs12}You hid it in your palm and then distracted me.

330
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,706
好的魔术师不会透露她的秘密
{\fs12}A good magician never reveals her secrets.

331
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,250
拜托，告诉我
{\fs12}Come on, tell me.

332
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,501
这样有什么好玩的？
{\fs12}What's the fun in that?

333
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,504
有些事你要靠自己去发掘
{\fs12}Some things you just got to figure out on your own.

334
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,090
总之，我该走了
{\fs12}Anyway, I got to go.

335
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:43,925
等等
{\fs12}Wait.

336
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,178
我可以问问我爸妈，是否能让你进来
{\fs12}I could ask my parents if you could come inside.

337
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,222
进去里面？
{\fs12}In there? 

338
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:50,765
不必了
{\fs12}No, thanks.

339
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,183
为什么？
{\fs12}Why not?

340
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,856
听着，我不想吓到你
{\fs12}Look, I don't mean to freak you out, but...

341
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,692
但这里就是…怪怪的
{\fs12}there's just something... 

342
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,318
整个屋子都很怪
{\fs12}off about the whole place.

343
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,028
让我毛骨悚然
{\fs12}Gives me the creeps.

344
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,657
其实我根本不该过来的
{\fs12}Actually, I'm not even supposed to be here.

345
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,951
经营这个地方的女人
{\fs12}The woman that runs this place, 

346
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,578
她不喜欢我
{\fs12}she doesn't like me.

347
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,205
我也不喜欢她，她这个人
{\fs12}I don't like her either.

348
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,623
有些可疑
{\fs12}She's... shifty.

349
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:17,208
可疑？
{\fs12}Shifty?

350
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,004
你不要乱说比较好
{\fs12}It's just better if you don't say anything.

351
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,465
改天见，胡迪尼
{\fs12}See you later, Houdini.

352
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,129
你在做什么？
{\fs12}What are you doing?

353
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,217
你不能自己在这里乱走
{\fs12}You can't wander this place by yourself.

354
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,597
把这个插回你的手臂
{\fs12}Put this back in your hand.

355
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,772
她去哪里了？
{\fs12}Where did she go?

356
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:03,898
谁？
{\fs12}Who?

357
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:10,989
亲爱的上帝
{\fs12}Dear Lord...

358
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,826
谢谢祢赐予我们的一切
{\fs12}we are thankful for everything that you have given us...

359
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,247
赐予我们一家能够这样相聚
{\fs12}and for this time that we get to spend together as a family.

360
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,585
特别是让我们找到洪恩医生
{\fs12}And especially for placing Dr. Horn in our paths.

361
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,462
以上帝之名，阿们
{\fs12}In Jesus' name, amen.

362
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,505
阿们
{\fs12}Amen.

363
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,058
你有心事？
{\fs12}Something on your mind, honey?

364
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,436
他不高兴，因为我吼了他
{\fs12}He's upset because I yelled at him.

365
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,981
我向他道歉了 但他必须把点滴插回手臂
{\fs12}I said I was sorry, but he needs to put that drip back in his hand.

366
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,442
他不肯相信我在走廊看到一个人
{\fs12}He won't believe me that I saw someone in the hallway.

367
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,570
屋里还有另一个小孩 -可能是其中一个护士
{\fs12}There's another kid in this house. -Probably one of the nurses.

368
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,655
那不是护士！
{\fs12}It wasn't a nurse!

369
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,115
伊莱
{\fs12}Eli.

370
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:55,658
宝贝
{\fs12}Honey.

371
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,410
冷静点，好吗？
{\fs12}Calm down, okay?

372
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,287
冷静
{\fs12}Calm down.

373
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,248
那是另一个病人
{\fs12}It was another patient.

374
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,000
宝贝，我也害怕
{\fs12}Honey, I'm scared, too.

375
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,670
对，我有时也害怕新地方、新的人
{\fs12}I am. I get scared of new places, new people sometimes,

376
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,798
但是对你来说，肯定难以承受
{\fs12}but for you, it must be so overwhelming.

377
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,676
以你的身心状况来说
{\fs12}On your body and your mind.

378
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,929
但这里除了我们，没有别人
{\fs12}But there is nobody else here except us. 

379
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,681
我保证
{\fs12}I promise.

380
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,983
来，我帮你弄
{\fs12}Here. I got it.

381
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:34,906
好
{\fs12}Right.

382
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:36,866
吃饭吧
{\fs12}Eat up.

383
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,372
看起来好像大便
{\fs12}Looks like shit. 

384
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,083
吃起来也像大便
{\fs12}Tastes like shit, too.

385
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,140
（基础解锁）

386
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,309
（掌心火焰）

387
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,685
我就知道
{\fs12}I knew it.

388
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,273
“要达到最好效果，请在黑暗中练习”
{\fs12}"For best results, practice in a dark place."

389
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,784
你是谁？
{\fs12}Who are you?

390
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,241
（伊莱）

391
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,334
（谎）

392
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,551
不！
{\fs12}No! No, no! No! No!

393
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,726
伊莱！听我说！
{\fs12}Eli, Eli! Listen to me!

394
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,353
不！
{\fs12}Shh. -No!

395
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,354
是爸爸
{\fs12}It's Dad. Shh. Shh. Shh.

396
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,065
冷静！听我说
{\fs12}Honey. -Hey, listen to me. Shh. Shh. Shh.

397
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,527
嘿 -保罗，想想办法！
{\fs12}Hey. -Paul, do something!

398
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,446
什么？ -不！
{\fs12}Do what? -No! No! No!

399
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:07,702
呼吸，深呼吸…
{\fs12}Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Just breathe. Just breathe. Just breathe. Just--

400
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,220
是…药物的关系
{\fs12}It's, uh, it's the medication.

401
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,890
也许你可以减少剂量之类的
{\fs12}Maybe you could lower the dosage or something.

402
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,268
我是说，如果他看到东西…
{\fs12}I mean, if he's seeing things, I mean...

403
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,478
我们付出一切来治疗 -我知道
{\fs12}We put everything on the line for this. -I know.

404
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:35,396
一切的一切
{\fs12}Everything.

405
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,149
他吓坏了，保罗 -好，让她做她的事
{\fs12}He was terrified, Paul. -Okay, let her do her job.

406
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,609
我不打算美化此事
{\fs12}I-I'm-I'm not gonna sugarcoat this.

407
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,529
我们进行的疗法 对伊莱的身体很辛苦
{\fs12}What we're doing here is very hard on Eli's body,

408
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,825
他的病肯定会引发一些症状
{\fs12}and some of the symptoms from his condition are bound to flare up,

409
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,952
但我们必须继续疗程
{\fs12}but we need to stay the course of the medication,

410
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,121
特别是第二阶段
{\fs12}especially with Procedure Two.

411
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,372
什么意思？
{\fs12}Why? What do you mean?

412
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,501
伊莱在康复前，状况会变得更糟
{\fs12}Eli's gonna get worse before he gets better.

413
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:09,805
嘿
{\fs12}Hey.

414
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,434
要坚强，宝贝
{\fs12}Be strong, sweetheart.

415
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,602
我们就在这里
{\fs12}We're right here.

416
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:41,837
好消息，伊莱
{\fs12}Good news, Eli. 

417
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,881
我们整晚研究你的干细胞
{\fs12}We spent the night working on your stem cells,

418
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:46,300
我们可以确定基因疗法的病毒
{\fs12}and we can confirm that the gene therapy virus

419
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,177
正在修正你的基因变异
{\fs12}is correcting the mutation.

420
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,808
这会有点烧灼
{\fs12}This is gonna burn a little bit. 

421
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,101
数到三
{\fs12}On the count of three.

422
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,521
一、二…
{\fs12}One, two...

423
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,235
一下子就结束了
{\fs12}It'll be over before you know it.

424
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,986
保持冷静 -好烫
{\fs12}Remain calm. -It burns.

425
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,114
好痛！
{\fs12}It hurts!

426
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:12,743
好烫！
{\fs12}Aah! Aah, it burns!

427
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,495
呼吸
{\fs12}Breathe. 

428
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,455
这是必经的过程
{\fs12}This is supposed to happen.

429
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,463
很遗憾，要治好你的病毒
{\fs12}Unfortunately, the virus that's gonna cure your affliction

430
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,632
无法越过你的脑血管障壁
{\fs12}is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier,

431
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,050
所以我们必须穿透
{\fs12}so we have to penetrate.

432
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:29,802
钻子
{\fs12}Drill.

433
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,138
放轻松
{\fs12}Relax.

434
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,932
紧张只会加重你的症状
{\fs12}Stress will make your symptoms worse.

435
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:47,987
你不会有事的，你会好起来的
{\fs12}You're gonna be fine. You will be.

436
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,072
看我儿子
{\fs12}Jesus, look over my son...

437
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,118
…度过难关的力量
{\fs12}give him the strength to get through this.

438
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:57,121
你真的以为祈祷能帮助我们？
{\fs12}You really think praying's gonna help us?

439
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:03,794
他怎么样了？
{\fs12}How is he? 

440
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,880
他今天产生一些反应
{\fs12}He had a bit of a reaction today.

441
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,381
反应？
{\fs12}A reaction?

442
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,924
对，这很正常
{\fs12}Yes. It's quite common.

443
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,511
他的身体会排斥新的细胞 就像其他移植手术一样，好吗？
{\fs12}His body's gonna reject the new cells just like any transplant. Okay?

444
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:13,554
我可以看看他吗？
{\fs12}Can I see him?

445
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,807
先让他休息一下
{\fs12}After he's had some rest.

446
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:25,357
谢谢
{\fs12}Thank you.

447
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,242
洪恩医生告诉我，你非常坚强…
{\fs12}Dr. Horn told me how strong you were--

448
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,286
她有些可疑 -可疑？
{\fs12}There's something shifty about her. -Shifty?

449
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,245
什么？
{\fs12}What?

450
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,207
我认为她让我病得更重了
{\fs12}I think she's making me sicker. 

451
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,666
不，她没有，伊莱
{\fs12}No, she's not, Eli. It's the medication--

452
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,960
是药物的关系… -我知道我看到什么，妈
{\fs12}I know what I saw, Mom,

453
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,504
不是药物
{\fs12}and it's not the medication.

454
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,006
就算是药物，为何我会觉得更糟糕？
{\fs12}And if it was, then why do I feel worse?

455
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,591
因为发挥作用了
{\fs12}Because it's working.

456
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,595
好的细胞在对抗坏细胞
{\fs12}The good cells are fighting the bad stuff. 

457
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,971
你自然会觉得虚弱
{\fs12}You're bound to feel weak.

458
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,849
我想离开
{\fs12}I wanna leave.

459
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,393
你要离开？
{\fs12}You want to leave?

460
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:03,604
好
{\fs12}Okay.

461
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,815
我们走，来吧
{\fs12}Let's go. Come on.

462
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,151
医生说你的病在好转了
{\fs12}Doctor says you're getting better.

463
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,696
你想离开，永远这么病下去
{\fs12}You want to leave and stay sick forever, 

464
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,782
还是你要留下来治好
{\fs12}or do you want to stay and get better?

465
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:15,950
你要哪一种？
{\fs12}What's it gonna be?

466
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:21,872
留下来治好
{\fs12}Stay and get better.

467
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,365
是谁？
{\fs12}Who's there?

468
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,040
那不是真的
{\fs12}That's not real.

469
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,041
伊莱
{\fs12} Eli. 

470
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,126
那不是真的，不是
{\fs12}That's not real. It's not real.

471
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,060
让我出去！
{\fs12}Let me out!

472
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:08,812
拜托！
{\fs12}Please!

473
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,367
不！
{\fs12}No!

474
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,577
不，拜托停止！
{\fs12}No. Please stop!

475
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,666
妈！
{\fs12}Mom! 

476
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,584
妈、爸，不要！
{\fs12}Mom, Dad, help!

477
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:16,046
（伊莱谎谎谎）

478
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:25,556
（谎）

479
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:32,479
你做了什么？
{\fs12}What did you do?

480
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,069
不是我
{\fs12}It wasn't me!

481
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,822
伊莱，你就站在衣橱门前面
{\fs12}Eli, you were standing in front of the closet door.

482
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,365
因为我一直躲在那里
{\fs12}'Cause I'd been hiding in there. 

483
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,783
用玻璃碎片？
{\fs12}With shards of glass?

484
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,535
他们也在我的窗户写字
{\fs12}They wrote it on my window, too.

485
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:49,246
写你的名字？ -不，“谎”
{\fs12}Your name? -No. "Lie."

486
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,914
你可能弄伤自己的，宝贝
{\fs12}You could've hurt yourself, honey.

487
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:52,875
伊莱
{\fs12}Eli,

488
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:56,170
我没有其他病人提过见鬼
{\fs12}none of my other patients have ever mentioned ghosts.

489
00:45:58,672 --> 00:45:59,798
嘿！ -不
{\fs12} Hey. - No.

490
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,301
没有人相信我！
{\fs12}No one believes me!

491
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,693
你现在才决定现身
{\fs12}Oh, now you decide to show up.

492
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,196
昨晚发生什么事？
{\fs12}What happened last night?

493
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,072
我给你惹麻烦了？
{\fs12}Did I get you in trouble?

494
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:29,703
你看起来真糟
{\fs12}You look terrible.

495
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,372
我也觉得很糟
{\fs12}I feel terrible, too.

496
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,500
发生什么事？
{\fs12}What happened?

497
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,837
如果我告诉你，你要保证不笑我
{\fs12}If I tell you, you have to promise not to laugh.

498
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,255
快说吧
{\fs12}Just spill it.

499
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,595
我觉得这栋房子闹鬼
{\fs12}I think this house is haunted.

500
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,681
我认为这里发生过可怕的事
{\fs12}I think something bad happened here.

501
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,393
真好，现在你也觉得我疯了
{\fs12}Great. Now you think I'm crazy, too.

502
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,604
不，我没有这么想
{\fs12}No, I don't think you're crazy.

503
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:56,772
那你在笑什么？
{\fs12}Then why'd you laugh?

504
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,358
因为佩利
{\fs12}Because Perry,

505
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,237
在你之前住在这里的孩子 他也说过同样的话
{\fs12}the kid who stayed here before you, he said the same thing.

506
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:07,866
他也说过？ -对
{\fs12}He did? -Yep.

507
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,577
我和他聊得没有你多
{\fs12}Well, I don't talk to him as much as I talk to you,

508
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,788
但他说他看到鬼
{\fs12}but he said that he was seeing ghosts.

509
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,667
洪恩医生说她的其他病人都没看过鬼
{\fs12}Dr. Horn said none of her patients ever saw ghosts.

510
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,210
你相信她啊？
{\fs12}And you believe her?

511
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:21,922
爸妈说要相信她
{\fs12}Mom and Dad said to trust her.

512
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:25,217
我相信你的爸妈总是告诉你实话
{\fs12}Oh, and I'm sure your parents always tell you the truth.

513
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,346
佩利说他在这里待得越久
{\fs12}Perry said the longer he was in there,

514
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:32,558
鬼魂就看得越清楚 他告诉洪恩医生了
{\fs12}the more clearly he saw them, and he told Dr. Horn that.

515
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,726
她怎么说？
{\fs12}Well, what did she say?

516
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,144
我不知道
{\fs12}I don't know.

517
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,605
他说他要进行第三阶段
{\fs12}He said he was about to get Procedure Three.

518
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,984
那是我最后一次见到他
{\fs12}And that was the last time I saw him.

519
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:48,657
我必须离开这里
{\fs12}I need to get out of here. 

520
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,450
那就穿上你的防护衣离开
{\fs12}So get your hazmat and go.

521
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,493
我不能
{\fs12}I can't. 

522
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,787
没有爸妈，我在外面无法存活
{\fs12}I wouldn't survive outside without my parents.

523
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,045
你在这里等着
{\fs12}Wait here a sec.

524
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,241
不！
{\fs12}No!

525
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,577
不，放开我！
{\fs12}No! Let go of me!

526
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,332
不！
{\fs12}No!

527
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,142
放开我！
{\fs12}No! Let me go!

528
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,895
不！放开我！
{\fs12}No! Let go of me!

529
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,531
不！
{\fs12}No. No. No!

530
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,910
放我出去！
{\fs12}Let me out! Let me out!

531
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,918
不！
{\fs12}No. No. No!

532
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:25,587
不
{\fs12}No.

533
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:26,964
不，住手！
{\fs12}No, stop!

534
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,216
不！
{\fs12}No!

535
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:49,528
呼吸
{\fs12}Eli, breathe.

536
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,655
伊莱，呼吸
{\fs12}Eli, breathe.

537
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,240
呼吸
{\fs12}Breathe.

538
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,408
呼吸 -伊莱？
{\fs12} Breathe. - Eli?

539
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:56,326
伊莱？
{\fs12}Eli?

540
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,036
怎么回事？
{\fs12}What's going on?

541
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,914
我…我听到尖叫，他想离开这间屋子
{\fs12}I-I heard screams. He was trying to leave the house.

542
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,208
他们打开大门
{\fs12}They opened the door.

543
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:05,836
氟派醇，20毫升！
{\fs12}Haldol, 20 ccs!

544
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,005
我以为你说这里绝对安全
{\fs12}I thought you said this place was secure.

545
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,673
肯定是电线短路
{\fs12}Must have been an electrical short circuit.

546
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,135
你知道鬼魂的事
{\fs12}You know about the ghosts.

547
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,761
伊莱，你必须停止
{\fs12}Eli, you have to stop it.

548
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:15,887
快点！
{\fs12}Hurry, hurry!

549
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,264
我知道佩利的事！
{\fs12}I know about Perry!

550
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,684
谁…佩利是谁？
{\fs12}Who-Who's Perry?

551
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,770
我不知道你在说什么 -说谎
{\fs12}I-I don't know what you're talking about. -Lie.

552
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:24,730
佩利是谁？
{\fs12}Who's Perry?

553
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,149
说谎！
{\fs12}Lie! 

554
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:28,984
你说谎！
{\fs12}You're a liar!

555
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,029
告诉我这里的真实情况
{\fs12}Someone tell me what's actually going on.

556
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,363
伊莱，我在这里
{\fs12}Eli, I'm right here. 

557
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,032
看着我，我就在这里
{\fs12}Look at me. I'm right here.

558
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,992
好吗？深呼吸
{\fs12}Okay? Breathe. Breathe.

559
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,285
我们来许愿
{\fs12}Let's make our wish.

560
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,203
我不要许什么鬼愿！
{\fs12}I don't want to make a fucking wish!

561
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,256
妈？
{\fs12}Mom?

562
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,475
{\fs12}He's...

563
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:10,233
{\fs12}He's just not-- he's not accepting treatment.

564
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:18,408
{\fs12}He's just not accepting it. No, he's not.

565
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:23,330
{\fs12}I think we have to prepare for the decision. We're just going to do it.

566
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,334
{\fs12}He's not accepting treatment.

567
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,503
目前没有其他办法
{\fs12}So there's no other choice at this point.

568
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,420
对
{\fs12}Yeah.

569
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:37,094
我只是说，我不敢相信他真的想跑走
{\fs12}I was just saying that I can't believe that he actually tried to leave.

570
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,264
最后的治疗不如预期
{\fs12}The last treatment didn't go as I'd hoped.

571
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,975
伊莱的大脑正在发动战争对抗血清
{\fs12}Eli's brain is waging a war against the serum.

572
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,270
所以他感觉病得很重，还出现幻觉
{\fs12}That's why he's feeling so sick and delusional.

573
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,190
我要施用烦宁
{\fs12}I'm going to administer diazepam

574
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,193
让他能休息到天亮
{\fs12}to enable him to rest until dawn,

575
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,237
然后再开始最后的疗程
{\fs12}and then we'll begin the final procedure.

576
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:57,989
等等
{\fs12}Wait.

577
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,660
我认为该由我喂他吃药
{\fs12}I think I should be the one that gives it to him.

578
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,497
我让他吃药，他比较能接受
{\fs12}He'll take it better coming from me.

579
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,487
我没有疯，妈妈
{\fs12}I'm not crazy, Mom.

580
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,657
我知道你没有
{\fs12}I know you're not.

581
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:43,910
爸爸认为我疯了
{\fs12}Dad thinks I am.

582
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:46,413
不，他没有
{\fs12}No, he doesn't.

583
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,583
他没有 -他有
{\fs12}He doesn't. -Yes, he does.

584
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,837
他看着我，一副不相信我的样子
{\fs12}He looks at me like he doesn't believe me.

585
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,591
就像你现在看着我的样子？
{\fs12}You mean the same way you're looking at me right now?

586
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,890
你知道，这对他来说很痛苦
{\fs12}You know, this is hard for him.

587
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,475
看着你经历这些
{\fs12}Watching you go through this.

588
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:11,229
洪恩医生是他找到的
{\fs12}He was the one that found Dr. Horn.

589
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,773
他到处找医生来帮你
{\fs12}He looked everywhere for a doctor to help you.

590
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:16,401
如果不带你来这里
{\fs12}We would never have brought you here

591
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:19,070
我们认为你无法撑下去 也无法过正常的生活
{\fs12}if we didn't think you could go on and live a normal life.

592
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,326
但你说你相信我的
{\fs12}But you said you believed me.

593
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,536
对，我相信你看到东西
{\fs12}I do. I believe that you saw things.

594
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,495
我只是…
{\fs12}I just...

595
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,166
我只是不相信你看到的东西是真实的
{\fs12}I just don't believe the things you saw are real.

596
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:38,298
嘿
{\fs12}Hey.

597
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:40,592
相信我
{\fs12}Trust me.

598
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,929
我知道药效会如何扰乱心智
{\fs12}I know the effects medication can have on the mind.

599
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:46,306
你看到一些事，你发誓那是真的
{\fs12}You see something, and you swear it was real.

600
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:47,891
但不是
{\fs12}But it's not.

601
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,480
我知道你很难接受
{\fs12}I know how hard this is for you.

602
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,400
但一切就快结束了
{\fs12}But it's almost over.

603
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,986
你只需好好睡个觉
{\fs12}You just need to get some sleep.

604
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,198
那是什么？
{\fs12}What's that? 

605
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:04,324
什么？
{\fs12}What?

606
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,244
什么？
{\fs12}What?

607
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,958
我不像某人那么会变魔术
{\fs12}I'm not as good at tricks as some people.

608
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:15,585
来
{\fs12}Here.

609
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:20,966
这是什么？ -可以帮助你睡觉的药
{\fs12}What is it? -It's just something to help you sleep.

610
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,270
让我看看
{\fs12}Show me.

611
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,233
好
{\fs12}Good.

612
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:41,778
过来
{\fs12}Come here.

613
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:46,366
你知道我爱你，对吧？
{\fs12}You know I love you, right?

614
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:48,535
我知道
{\fs12}I know.

615
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,589
317
{\fs12}Three-one-seven--

616
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:02,507
什么？
{\fs12}What?

617
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:06,886
来，躺好
{\fs12}Okay, lie down.

618
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,020
祝好梦
{\fs12}Sweet dreams.

619
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,338
海莉
{\fs12}Haley.

620
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,055
讨厌
{\fs12}Bitch. Unh.

621
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,141
还活着啊？
{\fs12}Still alive, huh?

622
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:36,559
听着
{\fs12}Listen.

623
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:40,271
佩利有没有说 鬼魂是想伤害他，还是帮他？
{\fs12}Did Perry ever say if the ghost was trying to hurt him or help him?

624
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:41,981
他没有说，为什么？
{\fs12}He didn't say. Why?

625
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,859
因为他们想把我拖离那间屋子
{\fs12}Because they tried to drag me out of the house,

626
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:48,530
我不确定他们是想杀我 还是想救我离开
{\fs12}and I'm not sure if they wanted to kill me or get me to leave.

627
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,907
听起来像是他们想杀你
{\fs12}It kind of sounds like they wanted to kill you.

628
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,700
你为何觉得是想救你？
{\fs12}Why would you think otherwise?

629
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:00,959
“谎”？
{\fs12}"Lie"?

630
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:02,168
他们写的
{\fs12}They wrote that. 

631
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,295
写在我的窗户，还有衣柜门
{\fs12}On my window and on my closet door.

632
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,298
但如果倒过来看…
{\fs12}But if you turn it upside down...

633
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:11,177
317
{\fs12}Three-one-seven.

634
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,429
那是什么意思？
{\fs12}What does that mean?

635
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:15,098
这是他们一直想告诉我的
{\fs12}This is what they've been trying to tell me the entire time.

636
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:19,060
好像是暗门的密码
{\fs12}Ooh. Oh, like a secret code to a secret door.

637
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,353
我又没说是门
{\fs12}I never said it was a door.

638
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:23,982
别一副疑神疑鬼的样子
{\fs12}Don't give me that suspicious look.

639
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:26,067
这只是我想到的第一个可能
{\fs12}It was just the first thing that entered my head.

640
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,861
你不会也是鬼吧？
{\fs12}You're not a ghost, too, are you?

641
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,613
他们现在给你吃什么药？
{\fs12}What kind of drugs do they got you on now? 

642
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:31,739
我看起来像鬼吗？
{\fs12}Do I look like a ghost?

643
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,785
我认为是开门的密码
{\fs12}I think it is a code to a door...

644
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,495
通往医疗部的侧翼
{\fs12}to the medical wing.

645
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,122
里面有什么？ -答案
{\fs12}What's in there? -Answers.

646
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:40,707
什么的答案？ -她为何说谎
{\fs12}To what? -To why she's lying.

647
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,293
你要去查吗？
{\fs12}Are you gonna do it?

648
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,128
如果被抓到了呢？
{\fs12}What if you get caught?

649
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,132
每个人都要睡觉
{\fs12}Everybody's gotta sleep.

650
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:51,676
是吧？
{\fs12}Right?

651
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:25,126
（门已上锁 输入密码）

652
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,385
谎
{\fs12}Lie.

653
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:44,098
你和洪恩医生谈了什么？
{\fs12}What were you and Dr. Horn talking about?

654
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,559
什么？
{\fs12}What?

655
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,687
你和洪恩医生谈了什么？
{\fs12}What were you and Dr. Horn talking about?

656
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:52,231
在我过去之前
{\fs12}Before I came along.

657
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,154
告诉我
{\fs12}Tell me.

658
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:02,700
只是谈到需要做好心理准备
{\fs12}Just talking about the need to be prepared...

659
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,161
面对各种可能性
{\fs12}for all possibilities.

660
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,914
各种可能性？你是什么意思？
{\fs12}All possibilities? What do you mean?

661
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:22,679
听着，她说每一种疗程都有…
{\fs12}Look, she said that with each procedure, there are...

662
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,306
固有的风险
{\fs12}inherent risks.

663
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,686
上一次疗程他有不良的反应
{\fs12}He had a bad reaction to the last one.

664
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:36,234
虽然他有可能恢复健康，但是…
{\fs12}And for every chance that he's gonna pull through, there's...

665
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,198
什么？ -他也可能熬不过去
{\fs12}What? -There's a chance that he won't.

666
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:47,537
她那样说？
{\fs12}She said that?

667
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:49,706
她是那样说的
{\fs12}It's what she said.

668
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,292
她觉得疗程不会成功？
{\fs12}That she doesn't think it's gonna work?

669
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:59,298
可是我不懂
{\fs12}Then I don't understand.

670
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:02,969
她治好每一个病人了
{\fs12}She's cured every one of her patients. 

671
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,220
你是这样告诉我的
{\fs12}That's what you told me.

672
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:09,392
我是这样告诉伊莱的
{\fs12}That's what I told Eli.

673
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,402
你为何要骗我？
{\fs12}Why would you lie to me?

674
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:23,698
这种事你怎能骗我？
{\fs12}Why would you lie to me about that?

675
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:28,035
我只是替伊莱着想
{\fs12}Just tried to do what's best for Eli.

676
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:32,290
萝丝，你知道总是有风险的
{\fs12}You knew this was always a possibility, Rose.

677
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:34,208
他会有生命危险吗？
{\fs12}Is his life in danger?

678
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:37,462
有吗？
{\fs12}Is it?

679
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:46,471
你怎么敢这样？
{\fs12}How dare you?

680
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:47,972
我怎么敢？
{\fs12}How dare I?

681
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:50,057
我要离开 -我怎么敢？
{\fs12}I'm leaving. -How dare I?!

682
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:51,225
我要带他走
{\fs12}I'm taking him with me. 

683
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,727
在你做了那件事之后？
{\fs12}After what you did?

684
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:55,480
是你不计一切要尝试的！
{\fs12}You're the one that wanted to try anything!

685
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,692
{\fs12}And you're in denial.

686
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:03,070
{\fs12}We had one chance to do the right thing.

687
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:05,198
{\fs12}Rose. Rose!

688
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:27,512
伊莱
{\fs12}Eli.

689
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,671
（伊莱米勒 男）

690
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:09,053
（第一疗程）

691
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:12,598
（佩利霍布斯）

692
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,600
佩利，“疗程一”

01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:23,776
“疗程三”
{\fs12}Treatment 3.

695

“艾格妮丝，疗程一”
{\fs12}"Agnes. Treatment 1."

696
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,370
“疗程二”

697
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:38,040

700
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,509
“疗程三”
{\fs12}"Treatment 3."

701
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:33,304
妈！
{\fs12}Mom! 

702
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,097
爸，我们必须离开！
{\fs12}Dad, we have to leave!

703
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:56,661
深呼吸，萝丝
{\fs12}Take a breath, Rose.

704
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:57,828
开门！
{\fs12}Open the door.

705
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,205
打开这道门！
{\fs12}Open this door!

706
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:02,625
我要离开
{\fs12}I am leaving, 

707
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,460
我要带他走
{\fs12}and I'm taking him with me.

708
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:05,795
你要去哪里？ -哪里都行
{\fs12}Where would you go? -Anywhere. 

709
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,505
只要远离这里
{\fs12}As far away as possible.

710
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:10,591
把他藏在玻璃牢笼，远离这个世界？
{\fs12}And keep him hidden in a glass cage away from the world?

711
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:11,842
这算什么样的生活？
{\fs12}What kind of life is that? 

712
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,886
有人爱他的生活
{\fs12}A life where he is loved.

713
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:18,265
再多的爱
{\fs12}No amount of love 

714
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:20,393
也无法保护他免除这个情况
{\fs12}can protect him from his condition.

715
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:22,103
你知道的
{\fs12}You know that. 

716
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:25,231
你亲眼看到病况可能变得多糟
{\fs12}You've seen with your own eyes how bad it can get.

717
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:26,857
情况只会越来越糟
{\fs12}It will only get worse, and by then, 

718
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:28,526
到时候就太迟了
{\fs12}it's gonna be too late.

719
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:33,489
出去只有无尽的痛苦
{\fs12}Out there, there's nothing but suffering.

720
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:35,950
他在这里才是受苦
{\fs12}There's only suffering for him in here.

721
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:38,327
在这里，还有一丝机会
{\fs12}In here, there's still a chance. 

722
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:39,245
有吗？
{\fs12}Is there?

723
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:43,290
我需要知道你能救他
{\fs12}I need to know that you can save him.

724
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,503
萝丝，有你站在我这边，我可以
{\fs12}With you by my side, I can, Rose.

725
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:55,928
妈！
{\fs12}Mom!

726
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,320
肯定是昨晚跑进来的
{\fs12}Must have gotten in last night.

727
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,489
爸
{\fs12}Dad.

728
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:18,034
爸，妈妈在哪里，我们都得离开
{\fs12}Dad,  where's Mom? We all need to leave right now.

729
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:20,661
她马上就回来了 -不
{\fs12}She'll be back in a minute. -No.

730
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,496
不，我们必须立刻走
{\fs12}No, we have to leave right now.

731
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,582
爸，是她，是洪恩医生
{\fs12}Dad, it's her. It's Dr. Horn.

732
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,959
我看到她的档案了
{\fs12}I saw her files.

733
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,879
她的病患都没熬过第三疗程
{\fs12}None of her patients made it past the third procedure.

734
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,214
爸，他们全死了
{\fs12}Dad, they all died.

735
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:39,013
你记得大草原吗？
{\fs12}You remember the old meadow?

736
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:43,476
我们带布朗森去过的 当时它还是小狗
{\fs12}The one we took Bronson to when he was just a pup.

737
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:47,688
昨晚我做了一个梦
{\fs12}Last night, I had a dream 

738
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:51,275
我们都在大草原上玩球
{\fs12}that we were playing ball in the old meadow...

739
01:07:52,693 --> 01:07:54,528
布朗森在追球
{\fs12}and Bronson was chasing the ball.

740
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:57,073
它在攻击那颗球 还记得它以前常那样做吗？
{\fs12}He was attacking it.  Remember how he used to do that?

741
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,075
爸
{\fs12}Dad.

742
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:02,745
你吓到我了
{\fs12}You're scaring me.

743
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:06,040
不，过来
{\fs12}No, no, no. Come here.

744
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:13,589
伊莱，你真是备受疼爱
{\fs12}You are so loved, Eli.

745
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:15,758
你知道的
{\fs12}You know that.

746
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,805
有时候连我都吃你的醋 你妈会对你说…
{\fs12}Sometimes I get jealous of you, the way Mom...

747
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:24,892
“你知道我爱你，对吧？” 然后你回答
{\fs12}says, "You know I love you, right?" And you say...

748
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:26,268
我知道
{\fs12}I know.

749
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:30,606
好像稀松平常
{\fs12}Like it's nothing to you.

750
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:37,196
我听了很高兴 你的口气仿佛那没什么
{\fs12}That makes me happy, the way you say it like that, like it's nothing.

751
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:39,698
爱很正常
{\fs12}Love is normal.

752
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:42,284
你心中毫无怀疑
{\fs12}There's just no doubt in your mind.

753
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,454
伊莱
{\fs12}Eli.

754
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:49,542
我很抱歉
{\fs12}I'm so... sorry...

755
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:52,002
对这一切都很抱歉
{\fs12}for all this.

756
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:56,549
过来
{\fs12}Come here.

757
01:09:02,763 --> 01:09:03,764
你为何要这样做？
{\fs12}Why did you do that?

758
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:06,350
带他去检验室
{\fs12}Take him to the exam room.

759
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,605
放开我！你被她们洗脑了！
{\fs12}Let go! She's brainwashed you!

760
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:13,649
妈！爸！
{\fs12}Mom! Dad! 

761
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:16,485
你们要相信我！我看到档案了！
{\fs12}You have to believe me! I saw the files!

762
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,029
放手！
{\fs12} Let go!

763
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:21,115
这是为了你好
{\fs12}This is for your own good.

764
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:22,700
不！
{\fs12}No! 

765
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,702
不，她会杀了我！
{\fs12}No, she's gonna kill me!

766
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,579
就像她杀了其他人！
{\fs12}Like she killed the others!

767
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,080
放手！
{\fs12} Let go! 

768
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:29,498
为何镇静剂没发挥作用？
{\fs12}Why isn't the sedation working?

769
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:30,624
妈！
{\fs12}Mom! 

770
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:33,169
妈，拜托，你必须相信我！
{\fs12}Mom, please, you have to believe me!

771
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,045
她杀了她所有的…
{\fs12}She killed all her--

772
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:45,514
伊莱！
{\fs12}Eli!

773
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:46,849
伊莱！
{\fs12}Eli!

774
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:47,808
别跑！
{\fs12}Stop!

775
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:56,734
伊莱 -她移走档案了！
{\fs12}Eli. -She moved them!

776
01:09:56,817 --> 01:09:57,943
她知道我发现了
{\fs12} She knows I know. 

777
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:58,861
冷静下来
{\fs12}Settle down.

778
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:00,696
你杀了你的病人，不是吗？
{\fs12}You killed your patients, didn't you?

779
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:04,325
你拿他们做实验，然后你杀了他们！
{\fs12}You experimented on them, and then you murdered them!

780
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:05,868
但他们还在这里！
{\fs12}But they're still here!

781
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:07,953
他们还在屋子里！
{\fs12}They're still here in this house!

782
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:09,747
伊莱，呼吸 -退后！
{\fs12}Eli, breathe. -Get back!

783
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:12,124
你不知道你病得多重 -离我远一点！
{\fs12}You are sicker than you realize. -You get away from me!

784
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,334
你们通通退后！
{\fs12}Get back, all of you!

785
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:16,545
我以为他们想伤害我
{\fs12}I thought they were trying to hurt me,

786
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,047
但他们没有伤害任何人
{\fs12}but they never hurt anyone.

787
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:19,298
从头到尾都是你
{\fs12}It was you the whole time. 

788
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:20,466
伊莱，深呼吸
{\fs12}Eli, take a breath.

789
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:46,158
伊莱，我们只想帮助你
{\fs12}Eli, we're all just trying to help you.

790
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:48,077
开门
{\fs12}Open the door.

791
01:10:48,702 --> 01:10:49,536
伊莱
{\fs12} Eli. 

792
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:50,663
伊莱！
{\fs12} Eli. 

793
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:53,040
好，我们从另一边进去
{\fs12}Okay, we'll get in another way. 

794
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:53,999
跟我来
{\fs12}Come with me.

795
01:12:20,794 --> 01:12:22,921
爸、妈，我是对的，这地方不是…
{\fs12}Mom, Dad, I was right. This place is not--

796
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:25,591
你在做什么？
{\fs12}What are you doing? 

797
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,343
你在做什么？让我出去！
{\fs12}What are you doing? Let me out!

798
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:28,719
让我走，我不能呼吸！
{\fs12}Let me out. I can't breathe!

799
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:30,179
你不能把他留在那里
{\fs12}You can't leave him in there.

800
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:31,180
我无法呼吸！
{\fs12}I can't breathe!

801
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,015
我们必须如此
{\fs12}We have to. 

802
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:34,141
不！
{\fs12}No!

803
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:35,642
他知道了
{\fs12}He knows.

804
01:12:58,332 --> 01:12:59,291
伊莱
{\fs12}Eli.

805
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:15,224
我能呼吸
{\fs12}I can breathe.

806
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,104
我能呼吸
{\fs12}I can breathe.

807
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:21,605
我能呼吸
{\fs12}I can breathe.

808
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:32,157
妈！
{\fs12}Mom! 

809
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:34,118
妈、爸，我的病好了！
{\fs12}Mom, Dad, I'm not sick!

810
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:35,744
我可以呼吸了！
{\fs12}I can breathe!

811
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:42,751
为何你们说我生病了？
{\fs12}Why did you tell me I was sick?

812
01:13:45,045 --> 01:13:47,047
为何你们说我会死？
{\fs12}Why did you tell me I was gonna die?

813
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:49,716
放我出去！
{\fs12}Let me out! 

814
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:51,343
放我出去！
{\fs12}Let me out!

815
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,181
拜托，妈，让我出去！ -萝丝
{\fs12} Please, Mom, let me out! - Rose.

816
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:58,058
放我出去！
{\fs12}Let me out!

817
01:13:58,767 --> 01:13:59,601
萝丝
{\fs12}Rose.

818
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:03,522
我知道他醒着，但我们快准备好了
{\fs12}I know he's awake, but we're almost ready.

819
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:05,983
我需要见他 -希望你别去，我们可以进行…
{\fs12}I need to see him. -I wish you wouldn't. If we just proceed--

820
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:07,109
我不是在求你
{\fs12}I'm not asking.

821
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:17,119
伊莱
{\fs12}Eli.

822
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:19,705
伊莱，你听见我了吗？
{\fs12}Eli, can you hear me?

823
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:24,877
很抱歉我骗了你
{\fs12}I'm sorry I lied to you.

824
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:29,214
你对外界并没有过敏
{\fs12}You were never allergic to the outside,

825
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,093
但我必须让你这样相信 才能保护你
{\fs12}but I had to make you believe you were to protect you.

826
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:36,889
保护你远离外界
{\fs12}Protect you from the world.

827
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,733
我知道你肯定很困惑
{\fs12}I know this must be so confusing...

828
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:50,068
也很害怕
{\fs12}and scary...

829
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:52,946
但没有人想伤害你，宝贝
{\fs12}but no one's trying to hurt you, honey.

830
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:56,408
这一切都不是你的错
{\fs12}And none of this is your fault.

831
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:00,454
是我的错
{\fs12}It's mine.

832
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:07,169
可是宝贝，你必须完成最后疗程
{\fs12}But, baby, you've got to see this last procedure through,

833
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:11,173
然后我向你保证，我会解释一切的
{\fs12}and then I promise you, I will explain everything.

834
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:15,135
伊莱
{\fs12}Eli.

835
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:18,055
伊莱！
{\fs12}Eli.

836
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:21,475
伊莱
{\fs12}Eli.

837
01:15:34,112 --> 01:15:35,531
那是伊莱 -那是伊莱！
{\fs12} That was Eli. - Eli!

838
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,658
伊莱！不！
{\fs12}Eli! No!

839
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:40,702
伊莱！
{\fs12}Eli!

840
01:15:58,720 --> 01:15:59,638
伊莱！
{\fs12}Eli!

841
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:00,847
开门！
{\fs12}Open this door!

842
01:16:02,182 --> 01:16:03,559
开门！
{\fs12}Open the door!

843
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:05,561
发生什么事？
{\fs12}What's happening? 

844
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:07,229
他们骗我！
{\fs12}They lied to me!

845
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:09,898
我没有生病！
{\fs12}I'm not sick!

846
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,068
他们打算杀了我！
{\fs12}They're gonna kill me!

847
01:16:34,464 --> 01:16:35,549
开门！
{\fs12}Open this door!

848
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:38,093
你不明白这是怎么回事！
{\fs12}You don't understand what's happening here!

849
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:40,345
我办不到！
{\fs12}I can't do it! 

850
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:41,430
你可以的
{\fs12}Yes, you can.

851
01:16:41,638 --> 01:16:43,557
你比其他人坚强多了
{\fs12}You're so much stronger than the others.

852
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:45,434
伊莱！
{\fs12}Eli!

853
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:46,643
开门！
{\fs12}Open this door!

854
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:53,358
不要害怕
{\fs12}Don't be afraid.

855
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:56,236
别怕，伊莱！
{\fs12}Don't be afraid, Eli.

856
01:16:56,486 --> 01:16:58,488
不！ -别怕
{\fs12} No! - Don't be afraid.

857
01:16:58,572 --> 01:16:59,406
你
{\fs12}You.

858
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:01,783
他们才该害怕！
{\fs12}They're the ones who are afraid!

859
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:04,536
不不不
{\fs12}No! No! No!

860
01:17:40,405 --> 01:17:42,407
不！放开我！
{\fs12}No! Let go!

861
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:49,456
不！ -把他的衣服脱掉
{\fs12}No! -Get his shirt off.

862
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,291
把他的衣服脱掉
{\fs12} No! - Get his shirt off.

863
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:56,213
不！
{\fs12}No! Unh.

864
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:59,424
爸！你为何要这样做？
{\fs12Dad! }Why are you doing this?

865
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:00,342
不！
{\fs12}No!

866
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:02,761
不！
{\fs12}No! No! 

867
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:04,262
不！
{\fs12}No!

868
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:07,265
你在做什么？
{\fs12}What are you doing?

869
01:18:10,727 --> 01:18:11,561
萝丝
{\fs12}Rose. 

870
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:13,146
你在做什么？
{\fs12}What are you doing?

871
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:15,148
他说得对
{\fs12}He was right.

872
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:18,235
她想杀了他
{\fs12}She wants to kill him.

873
01:18:19,736 --> 01:18:21,697
我看到那些孩子的尸体了
{\fs12}I saw the bodies of the children.

874
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,491
她把他们埋在下面
{\fs12}She buried them down there.

875
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:28,370
她没有救他们
{\fs12}She didn't save any of them.

876
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:32,499
为何你告诉我，你能救他？
{\fs12}Why did you tell me you could save him?

877
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,918
因为我可以
{\fs12}Because I can.

878
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:37,587
我以为我可以治好伊莱 天知道我有多想救他
{\fs12}I thought I could cure Eli. God knows I wanted to.

879
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:40,340
要不是他这么强悍 基因疗法会有效的
{\fs12}The gene therapy would've worked if he weren't so strong.

880
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:42,342
他已经失控了
{\fs12}He's too far gone, 

881
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:44,636
但他还是能得救的
{\fs12}but he could still be saved.

882
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:46,346
妈，她在说什么？
{\fs12}Mom, what is she talking about? 

883
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:48,849
妈… -退后！
{\fs12}Mom! -Get back! Get back!

884
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:51,601
别碰我的儿子
{\fs12}Don't you touch my son.

885
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:53,979
我们必须救他出去
{\fs12}We've got to get him out of here.

886
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:56,523
他不能离开这里，你知道的 他这个样子不行
{\fs12}He cannot leave here. You know that. Not the way he is.

887
01:18:56,606 --> 01:18:58,400
我会救你出去，宝贝
{\fs12}I'll get you out of here, honey. 

888
01:18:58,483 --> 01:18:59,568
我们要离开
{\fs12}We're gonna leave.

889
01:19:00,026 --> 01:19:01,319
宝贝，解开…
{\fs12}Honey, get this...

890
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:03,739
放开我！ -萝丝
{\fs12}Get off of me! Rose.

891
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:04,656
萝丝
{\fs12}Rose.

892
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:07,367
让我帮助你
{\fs12}Let me help you.

893
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:10,328
你要帮助我，带他离开这里？
{\fs12}You're gonna help me get him out of here.

894
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:13,123
我会帮助你
{\fs12}I'll help you.

895
01:19:13,665 --> 01:19:14,791
你保证？ -对
{\fs12}Promise? -Yes.

896
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:17,085
解开他，拜托
{\fs12}Untie him, please.

897
01:19:23,049 --> 01:19:23,884
救他
{\fs12}Save him.

898
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:28,597
保罗
{\fs12}Paul.

899
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:30,682
保罗，你在干嘛？ -不！
{\fs12}Paul, what are you doing? -No!

900
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:32,517
我可以拯救他的灵魂
{\fs12}I can save his soul. 

901
01:19:33,059 --> 01:19:34,227
不，你在做什么？
{\fs12}No. What are you doing?

902
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:36,188
她会杀了他！ -不！
{\fs12}She's gonna kill him! -No!

903
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:37,814
不！ -不！
{\fs12}No! -No!

904
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:39,900
不，放开我！
{\fs12}Get off of me! No, get off me!

905
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:41,151
不！ -爸！
{\fs12}No! -Dad!

906
01:19:41,985 --> 01:19:43,695
萝丝！ -爸！
{\fs12}Rose! -Dad!

907
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,781
你在做什么！
{\fs12}What are you doing?

908
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:48,408
爸！你为何要这么做！
{\fs12}Dad! Dad, why are you doing this?

909
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:50,619
不！
{\fs12}No! No!

910
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:54,581
伊莱
{\fs12}Eli...

911
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:58,335
你被带来这里，是满怀爱与希望的
{\fs12}you were brought here with love and hope.

912
01:19:58,418 --> 01:19:59,294
不
{\fs12}No!

913
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:02,506
你的爸妈和我合作良久 远远超过你所知
{\fs12}Your parents have been working with me for longer than you realized.

914
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:04,132
不！
{\fs12}No. No!

915
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:06,384
你的病…
{\fs12}The sickness you have--

916
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:08,220
我没有病，我能呼吸
{\fs12}I'm not sick. I could breathe.

917
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:10,055
我可以呼吸
{\fs12}I could breathe.

918
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:14,434
你的病因不是来自外界
{\fs12}The sickness you have doesn't come from outside.

919
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,686
而是来自体内
{\fs12}It comes from within.

920
01:20:17,437 --> 01:20:18,522
我做了什么？
{\fs12}What did I do?

921
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:20,774
我做了什么？
{\fs12}What did I do? 

922
01:20:21,024 --> 01:20:22,400
你还没做错什么
{\fs12}You didn't do anything wrong.

923
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:25,445
但是你将来会的
{\fs12}But you will.

924
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:31,910
妈！这是怎么回事？
{\fs12}Mom! Mom, what's happening?

925
01:20:34,454 --> 01:20:36,623
以圣父、圣子和圣灵之名
{\fs12}In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

926
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:38,124
阿们
{\fs12}Amen.

927

要是我说了，你会相信吗？
{\fs12}Would you have believed me if I had?

{\fs12}Sometimes you just have to walk the path for yourself.

{\fs12}Besides, we're not allowed to set each other free.

外面好冷
