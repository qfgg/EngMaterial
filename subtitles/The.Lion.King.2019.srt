有的却一辈子活在黑暗中
others spend their lives in the dark,

67
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,650
乞求残羹剩饭
begging for scraps.

The way I see it...

69

you and I are exactly the same.

We both want to find a way out.

这不是演习
This is not a drill.

陛下要求接见
His Majesty has requested an audience.

It is forbidden to eat a member of the king's court!

Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba.

是今天吗
Was that today?

我不小心忘记了
Must've slipped my mind.

92
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:35,400
我当然无意对陛下或沙拉碧失礼
Of course I meant no disrespect towards His Majesty or Sarabi.

你也知道  我对王后极其尊重
As you know, I have tremendous respect for the queen.

00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,690
作为国王的弟弟
As the king's brother,

95
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,740
你应该站在前列
you should've been first in line.

96
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,990
我本来在继承前列
I was first in line.

97
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,870
难道你忘了吗
Or don't you remember?

98
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,240
直到尊贵的王子诞生
That is, until the precious prince arrived.

99
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,370
不要背对着我  疤面
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.

100
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,580
不  木法沙
Oh, no, Mufasa,

101
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,760
你才不应该背弃我
perhaps you shouldn't turn your back on me.

102
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,930
你在挑战我吗
Is that a challenge?

103
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,350
我做梦都不敢再次挑战你
I wouldn't dream of challenging you again.

104
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,470
明智的选择
A wise decision.

105
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,930
你根本敌不过国王陛下
You are no match for His Royalness.

106
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,740
就智力来说  我占上风
Well, as far as brains go, I got the lion's share.

107
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,810
但要比蛮力
But when it comes to brute strength,

108
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,410
恐怕我哥哥
I'm afraid my big brother...

会永远称王
will always rule.

不是永远  疤面
Not always, Scar.

有一天  我的儿子会掌权
One day, it'll be my son who rules.

Simba will be your king.

那就祝国王万岁
Then long live the king.

- What am I gonna do with him? - Oh, come on.

115
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,880
你我都清楚  早就该把他
We both know he should've been

116
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,460
流放到荣耀大地之外了
expelled from the Pride Lands long ago.

117
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,460
他是我弟弟  沙祖
He's my brother, Zazu.

118
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,800
这里是他的家
This is his home.

119
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,390
只要我还身居王位  就绝不会赶他走
As long as I am king, that will never change.

120
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,300
家家都有个难缠得主  陛下
Well, there's one in every family, sire.

121
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,810
我有个表哥以为自己是啄木鸟
I had a cousin who thought he was a woodpecker.

122
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,430
脑袋对着树猛啄
He slammed his head into trees,

123
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,230
但我们的喙可经不住这么折腾
and our beaks aren't built for it.

124
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,860
他经常得脑震荡  你要走了
He was concussed regularly. Oh, you've gone.

125
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,990

Sire, coming back!

So, what's first?

140
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,150
下令狩猎  驱逐邪恶入侵者
Give orders for the hunt? Chase away evil intruders?

141
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,070
爸爸  走错方向了
Dad! You're going the wrong way!

00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,920
看  辛巴
Look, Simba.

145
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,880
阳光照耀下的一切都是我们的王国
Everything the light touches is our kingdom.

146
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,090
这全都由你统治吗
You rule all of that?

147
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,720
是的
Yes.

148
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,260
但国王的统治时间
But a king's time as ruler...

149
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,340
像太阳一样有起有落
rises and falls like the sun.

150
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,180
有一天  辛巴
One day, Simba...

151
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,180
我的太阳会落下
the sun will set on my time here...

152
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,440
而你则会作为新王冉冉升起
and will rise with you as the new king.

153
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:33,070
这一切都会属于我吗
All of this will belong to me?

154
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,230
王国不属于任何人
It belongs to no one,

155
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,900
但你会肩负保护它的使命
but will be yours to protect.

156
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,280
责任重大
A great responsibility.

157
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,450
阳光照耀下的一切吗
Everything the light touches?

158
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:46,000
那些树  还有那个饮水坑
Those trees? And the watering hole?

159
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,000
还有那座山
And that mountain?

160
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,460
还有那片暗影地带的尽头
And beyond those shadows?

161
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,880
你绝不能到那里去  辛巴
You must not go there, Simba.

162
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,170
可我以为国王想去哪儿就去哪儿
But I thought a king could do whatever he wants.

163
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,010
征服任意一片领土
Take any territory.

164
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,630
虽然有的王只懂得索取
While others search for what they can take...

165
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,440
但真正的王致力于奉献
a true king searches for what he can give.

166
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,270
你所见到的一切事物
Everything you see exists together

167
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,450
都保持着微妙的平衡
in a delicate balance.

168
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,070
作为国王  你要理解这种平衡
As king, you need to understand that balance...

169
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,490
尊重所有生物
and respect all the creatures...

170
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,960
不论是爬行的蝼蚁还是跳跃的羚羊
from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope.

171
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,540
可是爸爸  我们不是会吃羚羊吗
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?

172
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,260
是的  辛巴  先听我解释
Yes, Simba. But let me explain.

173
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,540
我们死后  尸体会化为青草
When we die, our bodies become the grass...

174
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,350
而羚羊以草为食
and the antelope eat the grass...

175
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,270
因此所有生物都在生命轮回中紧密相连
and so we are all connected in the great circle of life.

176
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,100
-陛下  -早上好  沙祖
- Sire! - Morning, Zazu.

177
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,640
晨间报告准备好了吗
Do you have the morning report?

178
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,150
是的  陛下
Yes, sire.

179
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,350
十只火烈鸟正在站立[表态]Ten flamingos are taking a stand.

180
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,270
两头长颈鹿正在交颈[打架]Two giraffe were caught necking.

181
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,520
据蜜蜂提供的消息[嗡嗡]The buzz from the bees...

182
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,210
花豹遇到了一点麻烦[斑点]is that the leopards are in a bit of a spot.

183
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,270
想不想来点乐子
Ready for some fun?

184
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,230
早上四点  小鸟鸣叫[发信]The birds are tweeting at 4:00 in the morning.

185
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,280
我就说  "小鸟  我们知道了"
I'm like, "Birds, we get it."

186
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,010
身体伏地
Stay low to the ground.

187
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,030
看我的吧
I got this.

188
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,000
注意风向  阴影
Check the wind, the shadows...

189
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,600
等待突袭的最佳时机
and wait for the perfect moment to pounce.

190
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,330
猎豹偷走了狒狒的晚餐
The cheetahs stole the baboons' dinner,

191
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,540
结果狒狒发狂[猩猩]and now the baboons are going ape.

192
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,420
当然  要我说  猎豹[谐音"骗子"]永远发不了家
Of course, as I say, cheetahs never prosper.

193
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,880
我就是这么想的
That's what I say.

194
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,000
听懂了吗  我再说一次
Do you get... I'll say it again.

195
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,300
猎豹永远...
Cheetahs never...

196
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,140
拜托  我在报新闻
Come on! It's the news!

197
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,980
好样的
That's very good!

198
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,650
陛下
Sire!

199
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,980
陛下  鬣狗进入了荣耀大地
Sire! Hyenas in the Pride Lands.

200
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,770
他们在狩猎
They're on the hunt!

201
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:36,940
沙拉碧在哪
Where's Sarabi?

202
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,440
她正带头应敌
She's leading the charge.

203
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,230
沙祖  带辛巴回家
Zazu, take Simba home.

204
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,860
爸爸  让我去  我能帮上忙
Dad, let me come! I can help.

205
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,660
不  儿子  你和其他小狮子待在一起
No, son. You stay with the other cubs.

206
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,920
我不是小狮子
I am not a cub.

207
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,050
好了
Come on.

208
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,920
我们回家
Let's go home.

209
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,760
我们到了
Here we are.

210
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,850
你去和其他小狮子一起玩吧
Now you go along and play with the other cubs.

211
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,650
真棒
Great.

212
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,690
如果你想猎杀成功
If you wish to kill something...

213
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,030
也许应该待在下风处
you might want to stay downwind.

214
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,990
我知道怎么狩猎  疤面叔叔
I know how to hunt, Uncle Scar.

215
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,880
那但愿我们永远不会被一只甲虫袭击
Well, let's hope we're never attacked by a beetle.

216
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,080
回你的窝里去吧  辛巴  我可不当保姆
Go back to your den, Simba. I don't babysit.

217
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,680
当保姆  我将会成为荣耀石的国王
Babysit? I'm gonna be the king of Pride Rock.

218
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,300
我爸爸带我巡视了整个王国
My dad showed me the whole kingdom.

219
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,430
说我将会统治一切
Said I'm going to rule it all.

220
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,180
是吗
Is that so?

221
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,340
想想看
Think about it.

222
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,640
等我成为国王  我必须得向你发号施令
When I'm king, I'll have to give you orders.

223
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,230
告诉你该做什么
Tell you what to do.

224
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,230
这多奇怪啊
How weird is that?

225
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,240
你根本想象不到
You've no idea.

226
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,950
你爸爸带你巡视了整个王国
So, your dad showed you the whole kingdom?

227
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:49,610
他带你去了北部边境外的暗影地带吗
Did he show you the shadows beyond the northern borders?

228
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,170
没有  他说我不能去那里  永远不能
No. He said I can't go there. Ever.

229
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,910
他说得完全没错
And he's absolutely right.

230
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,830
大象坟墓可不是一位年轻王子该去的地方
An elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince.

231
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,680
大象坟墓
An elephant graveyard?

232
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,560
天呐  我说得太多了
Oh, dear. I've said too much.

233
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,930
不过我想你迟早都会发现那里的
Though I suppose you'd have found out sooner or later...

234
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,890
等你成为国王统治一切
you being king and all.

235
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,180
你去过那里吗
You've been there?

236
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,810
我们都去过  那里可不是小狮子该去的地方
We've all been there. And it's no place for a cub.

237
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,310
那些腐烂的尸骨
All those rotting bones...

238
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,570
还有渗出的滚烫泥浆
and burning pools of oozing mud.

239
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,980
腐烂的尸骨  渗出的泥浆
Rotting bones? Oozing mud?

240
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,790
向我保证你会远离那里  辛巴
Promise me you'll stay away, Simba.

241
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,040
你可以走了
Now, you run along.

242
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,300
要记住
And remember...

243
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,340
这是我们的小秘密
it's our little secret...

244
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,180
陛下
Your Majesty.

245
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,800
娜娜  快点  我们得走了
Nala! Come on. We have to go.

246
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,680
-去哪儿  -饮水坑
- Where? - Watering hole.

247
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,020
辛巴  她正在清洁身体
Simba, she's having her bath.

248
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,020
你也该做清洁了
And it's time for yours.

249
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,900
但是  妈妈...
But, Mom...

250
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,190
我可以自己来
I can do it myself.

251
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,770
别动
Hold still.

252
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,270
你把我的鬣毛都弄乱了
You're messing up my mane!

253
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,540
来吧  耳朵后面舔一舔
Come on. Behind the ears.

254
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,700
别这样  妈妈
Come on, Mom!

255
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,500
看见了吧  全干净了  我们能走了吗
See? All clean. Can we go?

256
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,540
现在没有鬣狗了
There's no hyenas.

257
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,550
你刚刚把他们都赶跑了
You just chased them all off.

258
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,840
只能去饮水坑  不能跑远了
Just to the watering hole and no further.

259
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,960
还有要待在下风处
And stay downwind.

260
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,840
还有一件小事
And one more little thing.

261
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,840
沙祖要跟你们一起去
Zazu will be going with you.

262
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,180
-沙祖  -沙祖
- Zazu? - Zazu?

263
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,100
沙祖要跟着  否则你们不许去
Zazu goes... or you don't.

264
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,190
来吧  跟上  我们结成小组一起行动
Come along. Keep up. Let's move in a unit.

265
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,650
好了  结伴制
Okay, buddy system.

266
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,610
我们到底要去哪儿
So, where are we really going?

267
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,690
你怎么知道
How did you know?

268
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,940
你讨厌水
You hate the water.

269
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,070
我听说了这个地方  娜娜
I heard about this place, Nala.

270
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,990
世上最不可思议  最难以置信的...
The most incredible, amazing...

271
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,500
直接告诉我是哪吧
Just tell me where.

272
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,960
一处大象坟墓
An elephant graveyard.

273
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,910
那里有多远
How far is it?

274
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,950
不远  只要走到暗影地带就好
Not far. Just to the shadows.

275
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,040
但别担心  大家都去过那里
But don't worry, everyone's been there.

276
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,670
我们以前从来没去过那么远
We've never been that far before.

277
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,500
如果我们迷路了怎么办
What if we get lost?

278
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,710
放轻松  娜娜
Relax, Nala.

279
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,140
我今天早上跟着爸爸巡视了整个王国
I patrolled the entire kingdom this morning with my dad.

280
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,800
没什么好担心的
There's nothing to worry about.

281
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,600
还有一件事要担心
Well, there is one thing.

282
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,300
有危险逼近  有东西在向我们靠近
We have an imminent threat. Something is approaching.

283
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,640
等等  当我没说  那是我自己的影子
Wait, scratch that. That's my own shadow.

284
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,640
我们要怎么摆脱这只笨鸟
How we getting rid of the dodo?

285
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,440
相信我  我可以的
Trust me, I got this.

286
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,360
跟随我奔向自由吧
Follow me to freedom.

287
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,860
太感动了
How lovely it is...

288
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,150
看着未来的国王和他未来的王后
to see the future king with his future queen.

289
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,570
我感动得都要换毛了
I could just molt.

290
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,200
你说"未来的王后"是什么意思
What do you mean, "future queen"?

291
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,240
总有一天你们俩会永结同心
Well, one day the two of you will be betrothed.

292
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,840
喜结连理  白头偕老
Intended. Affianced.

293
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,620
辛巴  你懂鸟语吗
Simba, you speak bird?

294
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,870
结婚
Married!

295
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,930
拜托  总有一天你们会结婚
Come on. One day you will be married.

296
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,640
同彼此结为夫妻
To each other.

297
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,760
-这不可能  沙祖  -绝对不可能
- That's not gonna happen, Zazu. - Never ever.

298
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,890
娜娜和我是朋友
Nala and I are friends.

299
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,050
而且  她害怕犀牛
And besides, she's afraid of rhinos!

300
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,260
-他从来没吃过黑斑羚  -我试过一次
- And he's never eaten an impala. - I've tried it once.

301
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,020
我们永远不会结婚的  沙祖
We are never getting married, Zazu.

302
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,230
一位忽视传统的君王
A monarch who ignores tradition?

303
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,690
如果怀着这样的态度
With an attitude like that,

304
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,400
恐怕你会成为一位非常可悲的国王
I'm afraid you'll be a pretty pathetic king.

305
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,860
别想指挥我该去哪里
Well, I'm not letting anyone tell me where to go,

306
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,860
该做什么
what to do...

307
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,320
甚至该和谁结婚
and even who to marry.

308
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,240
永远不会有像我这样的国王
There will never be a king like me.

309
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,620

我来牵制注意力  让大家包围
I'm the lead distraction so everyone can circle.

421
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:47,300
好吧  好吧  抱歉
Okay, okay. Sorry.

422
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,010
别抱歉  照做就是了
Don't be sorry. Just do it.

423
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,060
这顿大餐
Now, this is a meal

424
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,880
我可是等了一辈子了
I've waited my whole life for.

425
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:01,640
拿国王的儿子当点心  真是意外之喜
What an unexpected treat, to eat the son of a king.

426
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,720
等等  国王  就是那个谁吗
Wait a second, the king? As in you-know-who?

427
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,350
统治百兽的那位
Who rules you-know-where?

428
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,390
木法沙可不能统治我
Mufasa does not rule me!

429
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,360
你不能把我怎么样
You can't do anything to me!

430
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,730
因为我是未来的国王
'Cause I'm the future king!

431
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,400
他在对我发号施令呢
He's telling me what to do.

432
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,620
他父亲的力量在他内心闪烁
His father's strength flickering inside.

433
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,740
我在想
I wonder...

434
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,620
那种勇敢到底是什么味道
how all that bravery will taste.

435
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,870
放他们走  桑琪
Let them go, Shenzi!

436
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,010
他们犯了一个错误  可怕的错误
They made a mistake, a horrible mistake!

437
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:36,010
但若你这样做  就会挑起跟木法沙的战争
But if you do this, you will start a war with Mufasa!

438
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,850
鬣狗和狮子有史以来
Hyenas and lions have been at war

439
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,430
就没有停止过交战
since the beginning of time.

440
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,180
但是木法沙的血脉将在这里结束
But Mufasa's bloodline will end here!

441
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,510
快跑
Run!

442
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,900
别让他们跑了
Don't let them get away!

443
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:05,790
快点
Come on!

444
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,180
你们听到了吗
Did you hear that?

445
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,120
未来的国王
The future king!

446
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,770
不要伤害我
Don't hurt me!

447
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,520
再来一次
Do it again!

448
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,140
如果你再敢靠近我儿子半步
If you ever come near my son again...

449
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:14,310
不会  木法沙  绝不
No, Mufasa. Never.

450
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,150
绝不会了
Never again.

451
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,610
桑琪  我警告过你了
You've been warned, Shenzi.

452
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,870
我以为你很勇敢呢
I thought you were very brave.

453
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,160
沙祖
Zazu?

454
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,540
带娜娜回荣耀石去
Take Nala back to Pride Rock.

455
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,750
遵命  陛下
Yes, sire.

456
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,750
别太难为他了  陛下
Don't be too hard on him, sire.

457
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:20,290
我记得曾经有一头任性的小狮子
I remember a cub, a certain headstrong cub...

458
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,000
经常陷入困境
who was always getting into scrapes.

459
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,010
但他取得了突出的成就
And he achieved some prominence,

460
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,180
对不对  陛下
did he not, sire?

461
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,390
我必须给我的儿子上一课
I have to teach my son a lesson.

462
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,350
娜娜  走吧
Nala, come along.

463
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,990
辛巴
Simba?

464
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,760
你故意违抗我的命令
You deliberately disobeyed me.

465
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:07,630
我知道
I know.

466
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,680
你可能会被杀死的
You could have been killed.

467
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,470
更糟糕的是  你把娜娜也置于险境了
And what's worse, you put Nala in danger.

468
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,230
你知道这之间的利害关系吗
Do you understand what's at stake?

469
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,270
你危及到了我们狮群的未来
You jeopardized the future of our pride.

470
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,690
我只是想让你知道我可以做到
I just wanted to show you I could do it.

471
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,940
我可以像你一样勇敢
That I could be brave like you.

472
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,500
我只在需要勇敢的时候勇敢
I'm only brave when I have to be,

473
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,320
别无选择的时候
when there's no other choice.

474
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,240
但是你什么都不怕
But you're not scared of anything.

475
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,830
今天我怕了
I was today.

476
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,250
真的吗
You were?

477
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:39,540
是的  我以为自己会失去你
Yes. I thought I might lose you.

478
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,090
就连国王也会害怕  对吧
I guess even kings get scared, huh?

479
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,720
比你想象的还要害怕
More than you could ever know.

480
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,010
-但你知道吗  -什么
- But guess what? - What?

481
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:54,010
我想那些鬣狗更害怕
I think those hyenas were even scareder.

482
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,480
那是因为没人敢跟你爸爸嚣张
That's 'cause nobody messes with your dad.

483
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:58,850
过来
Come here.

484
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:12,820
-爸爸  -怎么
- Dad? - Uh-huh?

485
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,200
我们是朋友  对吗
We're pals, right?

486
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,160
对
Right.

487
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,910
而且我们永远会在一起
And we'll always be together...

488
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,370
对吗
right?

489
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,880
辛巴  我要教你一件我父亲告诉我的事
Simba, let me tell you something my father told me.

490
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,460
你看那片星空
Look at the stars.

491
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,300
历史上所有伟大的国王
The great kings of the past...

492
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,300
都在浩瀚星空中俯视着我们
look down on us from those stars.

493
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,350
-真的吗  -是的
- Really? - Yes.

494
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,180
不论何时你觉得孤独
So whenever you feel alone...

495
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,660
就想想那些国王
just remember that those kings...

496
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,440
会一直在你身边引导你
will always be up there to guide you.

497
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,400
我也是
And so will I.

498
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,440
但我看不到他们  爸爸
But I can't see them, Dad.

499
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,990
继续寻找  儿子
Keep looking, son.

500
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,860
继续寻找
Keep looking.

501
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,940
木法沙好强
Mufasa is strong.

502
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,990
比我们强得多
Like, way stronger than us.

503
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,920
-请给我点空间  -什么
- Please give me some space. - What?

504
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,450
这么大个洞穴你躺在哪儿不行
You could lay anywhere in this cave.

505
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,620
-你想让我躺在哪儿...  -我需要个人空间
- Where do you want me to... - I need some personal space.

506
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,990
-好吗  -好的
- Okay? - Okay.

507
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,600
并不是要贬低你  你很厉害
Not to take anything away from you. You were great.

508
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,540
但是他...
But he is...

509
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,020
好吧  现在我知道你是故意的了
See, now I know you're doing this on purpose.

510
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,730
你也非常勇敢  强势  能量充沛
You're brave, too. Tough, good energy.

511
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:51,940
你这纯粹是恶意中伤了
Now you're just being spiteful.

512
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,730
姿势不错
Good posture.

513
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,130
下次让我看见木法沙
Next time I see Mufasa...

514
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,940
我要给他一个永远忘不掉的教训
I'm gonna teach him a lesson he will never forget.

515
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,890
你走运了  他就在你背后
Well, you're in luck! He's right behind ya.

516
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,010
木法沙
Mufasa?

517
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,740
那不是国王
That's not the king.

518
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,540
你们这些蠢货掠尽了自己领地的全部活物
You fools have stripped your land of every living thing.

519
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,000
然而我把两头小狮子送到你们手上
And yet I send two little cubs your way...

520
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,710
你们却让他们活着回去了
and they come back alive.

521
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:29,460
看来我们只能吃了你将就了
I guess we'll have to eat you instead.

522
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,880
为什么只看到一顿饭
Why eat one meal...

523
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,300
却放弃后半辈子都能大快朵颐的机会
when you can be feasting the rest of your lives?

524
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,100
你能给我们提供什么
What could you possibly offer us?

525
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,310
一个让你们填饱肚子的地方
A place where you can fill your bellies.

526
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,740
阳光照耀下的一切
Where everything the light touches

527
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,190
都归你们尽情杀戮
is yours for the kill.

528
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,100
荣耀大地可不是你说了算的
The Pride Lands are not yours to give.

529
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:50,900
国王控制着所有猎场
The king controls those hunting grounds.

530
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,080
所以我们要杀了他
That's why we're going to kill him.

531
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:09,720
在狩猎一事上
Mufasa has always shown too much restraint...

532
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,130
木法沙总是过于克制
when it comes to hunting.

533
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,550
等我成为国王
When I am king...

534
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,380
强者就可以予取予求
the mighty will be free to take whatever they want.

535
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,550
因为鬣狗的肚子永远填不饱
Because a hyena's belly is never full.

536
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,780
木法沙太强大了  难以挑战

♪ 没错  我们的獠牙和野心一样赤裸 ♪
♪ Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared ♪

560
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:59,400
♪ 准备好 ♪
♪ Be prepared ♪

561
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,880
我爸爸很生我的气
My dad was pretty upset with me.

562
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,050
所以我们才要来这里  辛巴
That's why we're here, Simba.

563
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,840
我知道你怎样做才能向他弥补你的过错
I think I know a way for you to make it up to him.

564
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,020
一个让他忘记之前一切的礼物
A gift that will make him forget it ever happened.

565
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,810
但他是国王  我能送他什么呢
But he's the king. What could I give him?

566
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,350
你的咆哮
Your roar.

567
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,770
我的咆哮
My roar?

568
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:35,730
没错
Yes!

569
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:38,230
你听到了吗
Did you hear that?

570
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:44,030
这个峡谷是所有狮子来练习咆哮的地方
This gorge is where all lions come to find their roar.

571
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,280
所有狮子
All lions?

572
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,820
我爸爸也是吗
Even my dad?

573
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,080
木法沙在你这么大的时候也来过这里
Even Mufasa came here when he was your age.

574
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,830
不肯离开
Refused to leave...

575
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:55,830
直到他的咆哮响彻云霄
until his roar could be heard above the rim.

576
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,290
一直到天上吗
All the way up there?

577
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,050
那时候你就知道自己练好了
That's when you know you've found it.

578
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,670
只要一点点练习
With a little practice...

579
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,430
就不会再被叫小狮子了
you'll never be called a cub again.

580
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,840
听好了
Watch this.

581
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,970
你会学会的  辛巴
You'll get it, Simba.

582
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,020
慢慢来
Just takes time.

583
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,400
我一会儿来看你
I'll check on you later.

584
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,860
爸爸会为我骄傲的  对吗
Dad will be so proud, won't he?

585
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,360
这是一个他永远忘不掉的礼物
It's a gift he'll never forget.

586
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,010
木法沙  快来
Mufasa! Quick!

587
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,010
峡谷里角马狂奔
Stampede in the gorge!

588
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,220
辛巴在下面
Simba's down there!

589
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,140
辛巴
Simba?

590
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,310
我去找他
I'll find him.

591
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,090
扎祖
Zazu!

592
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,710
坚持住  救援来了
Hold on! Help is coming!

593
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,970
他在那儿  那棵树上
There he is! On that tree!

594
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,350
我来了  辛巴  坚持住
I'm coming, Simba! Hold on!

595
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:10,190
我去帮他们  扎祖  你去叫狮群
I'll help them, Zazu! You get the pride!

596
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,110
快去
Go!

597
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,260
爸爸
Dad!

598
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,390
辛巴
Simba!

599
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,480
到我这儿来  儿子
Come to me, son.

600
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:44,230
跳
Jump!

601
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,500
爸爸
Dad!

602
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,600
疤面
Scar!

603
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,640
救救我
Help me.

604
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:18,700
国王万岁
Long live the king!

605
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,660
不
No!

606
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,730
爸爸
Dad?

607
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:24,010
爸爸
Dad?

608
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,700
快点  醒醒
Come on, wake up.

609
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:53,750
救命  救命啊
Help! Somebody help!

610
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:26,370
辛巴
Simba!

611
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,830
你干了什么
What have you done?

612
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:33,960
是角马狂奔
It was a stampede.

613
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:35,540
他想救我
He tried to save me.

614
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,840
这是个意外
It was an accident.

615
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,350
我不是故意的…
I didn't mean for it to...

616
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:40,260
你当然不是
Of course you didn't.

617
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:43,720
谁都不希望发生这种事
No one ever means for these things to happen.

618
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,050
但是国王已死
But the king is dead...

619
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,930
如果不是因为你…
and if it weren't for you...

620
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:51,140
他就还活着
he'd still be alive.

621
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,810
你父亲对你寄予厚望
Your father had such hopes for you...

622
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,360
给了你太多机会
gave you so many chances.

623
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:00,440
而你就这样报答他
And this is how you repay him.

624
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:03,220
我不知道  我不知道
I didn't know. I didn't know.

625
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,510
你母亲会怎么想
What will your mother think?

626
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:09,010
一个害死父亲的儿子
A son who causes his father's death.

627
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:13,440
一个杀死国王的孩子
A boy who kills a king.

628
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:16,110
我该怎么办
What am I gonna do?

629
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:18,730
跑
Run.

630
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,780
逃跑吧  辛巴
Run away, Simba.

631
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:26,780
跑得远远的  再也别回来
Run away and never return!

632
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,380
杀了他
Kill him.

633
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,840
下去看看  确保他已经死了
Go down and make sure he's dead.

634
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,100
有没有搞错
Seriously?

635
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:31,680
对不起
I'm sorry.

636
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:36,100
现在距离很合适了
That's a good distance right there.

637
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:36,980
好的
Okay.

638
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,610
这么高摔下去没有幼崽能活下来
No little cub could survive that fall.

639
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,360
听着  我们就告诉她
Listen, we're gonna tell her...

640
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,130
我们下去了  然后把他吃了
we went down there and we ate him.

641
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,450
完美  因为我饿了
That's perfect, 'cause I am starving!

642
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:50,780
我们不是真要吃了他
We're not gonna eat him.

643
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,370
辛巴死了
Simba is dead.

644
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:54,200
她只需要知道这么多
That's all she ever has to know.

645
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:57,710
我看行
Works for me.

646
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:56,930
木法沙的死是个可怕的惨剧
Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy.

647
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:00,650
荣耀大地上最伟大的领袖
The greatest leader the Pride has ever known.

648
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,730
失去兄弟
To lose a brother...

649
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,150
是沉痛深切的损失
such a deep, personal loss.

650
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,120
而小辛巴  他还那么年幼
And little Simba, who had barely begun to live.

651
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,370
这个幼崽的血脉关系到我们的未来
A cub whose blood held our future.

652
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:20,410
这痛苦难以承受
It's almost too much to endure.

653
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:24,130
我真希望我能及时赶到峡谷
I only wish I had gotten to the gorge in time...

654
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,960
去救他们
been there to save them.

655
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,680
而怀着沉重的心情
And so it is with a heavy heart...

656
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:35,850
我只能继承王位
that I must assume the throne.

657
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:38,680
木法沙和辛巴已死
Mufasa and Simba are gone...

658
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:43,440
所以我就是你们的国王
which means I am your king.

659
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,360
但我必须承认
But I must admit...

660
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,110
这个重任我无法独自承担
I cannot bear this burden alone.

661
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,120
我需要一些帮助来确保
And I will need some help to ensure

662
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,620
荣耀大地的安全
the safety of the Pride.

663
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,300
娜娜  跟紧点
Nala, stay close.

664
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,680
因此  从这场悲剧的灰烬中
And so, from the ashes of this tragedy...

665
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:16,760
我们将迎来新时代的曙光
we shall welcome the dawning of a new era.

666
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,930
一个伟大
A great...

667
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,810
辉煌的未来
and glorious future!

668
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,280
天呐
Oh, dear.

669
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,180
没撞到
I missed 'em!

670
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,220
总有一天我干掉一只秃鹫
I'm gonna get one of those vultures one day.

671
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,060
总有一天
I'm gonna get one!

672
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:26,680
我不明白这为什么对你这么重要
I don't know why it's so important to you.

673
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:28,850
我只是觉得这样会让我舒坦些
I just feel like it would make me feel better.

674
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,270
糟糕  是头小狮子
Oh, no. It's a little lion!

675
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,480
-这不是狮子  -那你去看看
- That is not a lion. - Well then, go check it out.

676
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,530
-是什么  -不是狮子  是只小鸟
- What is it? - That is not a lion, it's a furry bird!

677
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:36,900
看起来像狮子
It looks like a lion!

678
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,860
不是狮子  让我仔细看看  失礼了
That's not a lion. Let me get a closer look. Excuse me.

679
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,490
让我看看这是什么情况
All right, let me see what we're dealing with here.

680
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:43,700
是狮子
It's a lion!

681
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,200
-快逃命  彭彭  -等等  丁满
- Run for your life, Pumbaa! - Wait! Hey, Timon.

682
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,290
等等  丁满  是小狮子呀
Wait, Timon, wait! It's a little lion!

683
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,500
它会长大的
It gets bigger.

684
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,340
我们能留下他吗  好吗  拜托了
Can we keep him? Can we please keep him?

685
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,630
好的  我保证每天都遛他
Okay. I promise I'll walk him every day!

686
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:55,340
如果他弄出乱子  我来收拾
If he makes a little mess, I'll clean it up.

687
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,170
你才会是乱子
You'll be his little mess!

688
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:58,420
他会吃了你  然后用我身体当牙签
He's gonna eat you and then use my body as a toothpick!

689
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:00,640
但是等他长得高大强壮了
But one day, when he's big and strong,

690
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,220
他就会站在我们这边
he'll be on our side!

691
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,560
有了  如果他站在我们这边呢
I've got it. What if he's on our side?

692
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,850
听我说
Hear me out!

693
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:09,810
有头凶猛的狮子在身边或许不是坏主意
Having a ferocious lion around might not be such a bad idea!

694
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:11,480
那我们能留下他了吗
Well then, can we keep him?

695
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,270
可以  我们当然要留下他
Yes, of course we can keep him!

696
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:15,690
天呐  我们俩到底谁负责动脑
My God, who is the brains of this operation?

697
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:17,740
♪ 我们要给他取名弗雷德 ♪
♪ We're gonna name him Fred! ♪

698
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,490
你们是谁
Who are you?

699
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,700
-我们救了你的命  -是的
- We're the guys who saved your life. - Yes.

700
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,910
冒着生命危险  击退了愤怒的秃鹫
Risked everything. Fought off angry vultures!

701
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,910
很多秃鹫  一大群
Hordes of them. Flocks.

702
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:27,830
我是彭彭
I'm Pumbaa.

703
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,170
-这是丁满  -我有说我们救了你的命吗
- This is Timon. - Did I mention that we saved your life?

704
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:32,670
无所谓了
It doesn't matter.

705
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,840
太消沉了吧
How bleak is that?

706
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,670
这都无所谓吗
It doesn't even matter?

707
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:40,840
难道我自己的麻烦还不够多吗
Like I don't have enough that I'm dealing with, right?

708
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,430
现在他的麻烦也得我解决吗
Now his problems are my problems?

709
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:44,640
但我们可以帮助他  我们有能力帮他
But we can help him. We're in a position to help him.

710
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,680
你是怎么了  尽量长话短说
So, how are you, in as few words as possible?

711
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:50,730
我干了坏事
I did something terrible.

712
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,600
我不想说
I don't wanna talk about it.

713
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,820
听着  孩子  我们都犯过错
Look, kid, we've all made mistakes.

714
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:58,320
一定有什么是我们能做的  对吧
There must be something we can do, right?

715
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,860
除非你能改变过去
Not unless you can change the past.

716
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:02,570
我说  这个要求有点高
Well, you know, that's a lot to ask...

717
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:04,110
-太难了  -说实话
- That's pretty hard. - if I'm being honest.

718
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,280
-难度太高  -改变过去
- That's a biggie. - I mean, change the past?

719
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,200
过去已经发生了
It already happened.

720
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,040
-所以无法改变  -但是
- Yeah, so you can't change that. -But

721
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,580
你知道什么是可以改变的吗
you know what you can change?

722
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:12,750
未来  这是我们的专长
The future. That's our specialty.

723
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:13,830
我们的特长
Kind of our thing.

724
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:16,710
还没发生的事要怎么改变啊
How can you change something that hasn't happened?

725
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:18,920
想要改变未来
Well, to change the future,

726
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,510
就得放下过去
you gotta put your past behind you.

727
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:21,510
抛得远远的
Way behind.

728
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:24,050
听着  小子  坏事无可避免
Look, kid, bad things happen

729
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:25,930
而你却无能为力  对吧
and you can't do anything about it, right?

730
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:27,260
对
Right.

731
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:30,060
错  如果世界背弃你
Wrong! When the world turns its back on you...

732
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:31,810
那你就背弃世界
you turn your back on the world!

733
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,140
只关注接下来的事情
And only embrace what's next!

734
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:36,360
把未知变成无所谓
And turn the "what" into "so what?"

735
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,690
爸爸可不是这么教我的
Well, that's not what I was taught.

736
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:40,820
那或许你需要新上一课
Well, then maybe you need a new lesson.

737
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:45,370
跟我学  小子  哈库那玛塔塔
Repeat after me, kid. Hakuna matata.

738
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,870
-什么  -哈库那玛塔塔
- What? - Hakuna matata.

739
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:49,030
哈库那玛塔塔
Hakuna matata.

740
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,160
哈库拉  大多数人一听到
Hakuna. Most people get a bigger reaction

741
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:51,870
就会很激动
when we say it the first...

742
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,330
-不管怎样  -还有人一听到
- Okay, well anyway. - Some people start clapping

00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:59,630
-好吧  -我来数拍子
- Okay. - I do the counting here.

746
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,550
-我想数  -不如我们一起数
- I wanna count! - Why don't we count together?

747
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:03,010
-好吧  好主意  -那好
- Okay, that's a good idea. - All right.

One more time.

848
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,760
不用了  我们唱够了
Oh, no, I think we did it. Yeah.

849
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,010
我们唱得很棒了
I think we got this one.

850
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:21,310
但我们刚刚进入最佳状态
But we're just getting in the groove, guys.

851
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:22,520
不  还是让他们意犹未尽吧
No, let's leave 'em wanting more.

852
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,560
是啊  从我们开始到现在你已经长了180公斤
Yeah, you've grown 400 pounds since we started.

But you insisted we sing the song.

00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,070
是我吗  明明是你起得头
I insisted? You started singing it!

娜娜
Nala.

867
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:20,700
过来
Come.

868
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,200
和我们一起坐
Sit with us.

869
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:34,340
沙祖  你去哪了
Zazu, where have you been?

870
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:37,630
很抱歉  娜娜  我已经尽快赶来了
I'm sorry, Nala. I came as soon as I could.

871
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,470
晨间报告  沙祖
The morning report, Zazu.

872
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,810
陛下  荣耀大地危在旦夕
Your Majesty, the Pride Lands are in imminent danger.

873
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,900
最后的畜群也要被鬣狗赶跑了
The hyenas are chasing off the last of the herds.

874
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,360
鸟回来了
The bird's back!

875
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:54,360
抓住他
Get him!

876
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,700
别回来了  除非你想被吃掉
Don't come here again, unless you want to be eaten!

877
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:28,600
我们必须做点什么  沙拉碧  我们必须战斗
We have to do something, Sarabi. We have to fight!

878
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:32,360
娜娜  疤面是国王
Nala. Scar is the king.

879
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,110
但你是我们的王后
But you are our queen!

880
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:36,440
趁现在还来得及  我们应该离开
We should leave before it's too late!

881
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:40,200
我们必须团结起来保护荣耀大地
We must all stay together and protect the Pride Lands.

882
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:44,410
这是我们的家  我们决不能放弃它
This is our home. We must never abandon it.

883
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:46,580
这不是我记忆中的家
This isn't the home I remember.

884
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:48,910
我们的时代会到来的  娜娜
Our time will come, Nala.

885
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,870
要有耐心
Be patient.

886
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:51,750
沙拉碧
Sarabi.

887
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,170
国王要见你
The king wishes to see you.

888
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:57,800
别去
Don't go.

889
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,260
我不怕他
I'm not afraid of him.

890
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:19,070
要与我共食吗  沙拉碧
Won't you join me, Sarabi?

891
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:21,150
食物多得很
There's plenty to go around.

892
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,530
你狩猎过度了  疤面
You're overhunting, Scar.

893
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,080
我只是完善了猎杀技巧
I've simply perfected the kill.

894
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,160
在我的军队的帮助下
With the help of my army.

895
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:30,500
你在屠杀一切
You're killing everything.

896
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:34,290
你还不明白吗  没有谁来挑战我
Don't you see? There is nobody to challenge me.

897
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:36,920
我们终于可以予取予求了
We can finally take whatever we want.

898
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:38,170
我们
We?

899
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,380
很久以前你选择了木法沙而不是我
Long ago you chose Mufasa over me.

900
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:44,470
但现在换了新国王
But now there is a new king.

901
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:47,390
所以不要这么自私
So stop being so selfish.

902
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,520
自私的是你
You are the selfish one.

903
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,520
其他狮子都指望着你
The other lions look to you.

904
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:54,440
只要你反抗  他们就会拒绝我
As long as you resist they will reject me.

905
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:59,400
站在我身边  我们将一起享受盛宴
Take your place by my side, and we will feast together.

906
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:03,110
我永远不会当你的王后
I will never be your queen!

907
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,570
那么从现在起
Then from now on...

908
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:10,830
狮子等鬣狗吃饱再进食
the lions will eat after the hyenas.

909
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,790
他们不会留下多少残渣
And they don't leave much behind.

910
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:47,010
你这是在干什么  小姑娘
Just what do you think you are doing, young lady?

911
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:48,760
走开  沙祖
Go away, Zazu.

912
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,550
我要去寻求帮助
I'm going to find help.

913
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,600
我绝对不会走开
I will very much not go away.

914
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,930
我发过誓要保护你
I am sworn to protect you

915
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:56,270
必须命令你回去睡觉
and must order you back to bed.

916
01:04:56,270 --> 01:04:58,520
我不再需要保护了
I don't need protecting anymore.

917
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:52,240
疤面  很高兴见到你
Scar! Uh, wonderful to see you.

918
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,240
突然来访不好意思
Sorry to drop in like this!

919
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,040
我有没有告诉过你我哥哥
Have I ever told you about my brother

920
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,370
以为自己是只啄木鸟
who thought he was a woodpecker?

921
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:15,310
娜娜
Nala...

922
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:41,660
我会抓住你的
I'm gonna get ya!

923
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:43,670
我会抓住你的  我抓住了  抓住了
I'm gonna get ya! Oh, I got ya! I got ya!

924
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,420
辛巴  是你
Simba! It's you!

925
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,210
你看到了吗
Did you see that?

926
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:50,170
那只蝴蝶就在那里
Man, that butterfly was right there!

927
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:51,260
我差点就抓住他了
I almost had him.

928
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:52,720
我刚还以为是头狮子
I thought it was a lion.

929
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,470
就是  那种狮子
You know, the other kind of lion.

930
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,140
真正的狮子
You know, a real lion?

931
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,510
不是说你不是狮子
I mean, not that you're not a real lion.

932
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:58,850
我是说那种会吃...
But you know, the kind that eats...

933
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:00,810
我还是走吧
I'm gonna go.

934
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:03,310
你去哪儿
Hey, where you going?

935
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,150
你要吃虫子吗
You wanna get some grubs?

936
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:09,940
那家伙怎么了
What's up with that guy?

937
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:11,860
辛巴
Simba...

938
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:13,950
我该怎么说呢
How can I say this?

939
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,070
-他是猎物  -嗯
- He's prey. - Yeah.

940
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:20,410
他绝不想跟一个食肉动物玩耍
And he is never gonna want to frolic with a carnivore.

941
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:22,580
对  你们俩绝不会一起玩耍的
No. You two will never frolic.

942
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:23,830
为什么不行
Why not?

943
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:28,960
大自然的平衡是很微妙的
You see, in nature there's a delicate balance.

944
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:30,710
对  生命轮回  我知道
Yeah. The circle of life. I know that.

945
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:32,340
不  不  不
No. No, no, no.

946
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,970
我不知道你从哪里听说的"轮回"
I don't know where you're getting "circle" from.

947
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:35,180
对  才没有什么生命轮回
No, yeah. There's no circle of life.

948
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:36,800
-没什么轮回之说  -完全没有
- No, it's no circle. - No, not at all.

949
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,310
-事实恰恰相反  -对
- In fact, it's the opposite. - Yeah.

950
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:40,520
-是一条直线  -对
- It's a line. - Yeah.

951
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:43,020
一条无差别无意义的直线
It's a meaningless line of indifference.

952
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:45,730
我们都只是朝着直线走向终点
And we're all just running towards the end of the line.

953
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:48,770
总有一天我们会到达终点  就此结束
And then one day we'll reach the end, and that'll be it.

954
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:50,270
仅此而已  生命终结
That's it. Line over!

955
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,990
-什么都不会发生  -没错
- Nothing. - Nada.

956
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,690
你完全可以
And you can really just kinda...

957
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,320
做自己想做的事  只关心自己
do your own thing and fend for yourself...

958
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,410
因为你的生命之线不会影响到其他人
'cause your line doesn't affect anyone else's lines.

959
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:59,740
生活  然后死亡  就像这家伙一样
You're alive and then you're not. Like this guy.

960
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:02,950
真的不是轮回吗
You sure it's not a circle?

961
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:05,080
不是我们互相关联吗
That we're all connected?

962
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:07,710
轮回是指我们像这样
A circle would mean we're all this.

963
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:10,210
我所做的事会影响到他
That would mean what I do affects him...

964
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:12,590
-影响到那玩意儿  影响到那家伙  -不
- affects that thing, affects that thing. - Yeah. No.

965
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:13,420
-不是这样的  -这就意味着
- That's not how it goes. - Which would make

966
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:15,180
无论我们做什么事
doing whatever we wanted

967
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:16,300
都不怎么潇洒
not that cool.

968
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,140
我说得通俗点吧
Let me simplify this for you.

969
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:19,720
-生命是毫无意义的  -对
- Life is meaningless. - Yes.

970
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,970
所以你只需要关心自己就行了
That's why you just gotta look out for yourself.

971
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:23,470
所以你只要做自己  辛巴
That's why you do you, Simba.

972
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,270
是的  辛巴  这是我们第一次
Yeah, Simba, for the first time...

973
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:28,100
拜托你为我们安排今天的行程
we're entrusting you to make a plan for us today.

974
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:31,190
这很重要  想想你学过的那些
This is important. Think about all you've been taught.

975
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,240
你想做什么
What do you wanna do?

976
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:36,860
当然是  无所事事
Absolutely nothing.

977
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,830
就是这样  他明白了
Exactly! He gets it!

978
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:42,160
太棒了
Jackpot!

979
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,160
别挡着我  别挡着我
Out of my way! Out of my way!

980
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,910
-脆脆的  -开饭啦
- Crunchy! - All right! Time to eat!

981
01:08:58,470 --> 01:08:59,470
好哇
Hello!

982
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:02,140
打得不错  辛巴
Nice one, Simba.

983
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:05,460
谢了  肯定是白蚁吃多了
Thanks. Must've been the termites.

984
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:07,420
或者蟋蟀
Or the crickets.

985
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:11,410
你还好奇我为什么喜欢睡在地下
And you wonder why I prefer to sleep underground.

986
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:13,670
丁满
Timon.

987
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,350
你有没有看着天上
Do you ever look up there

988
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:17,830
好奇那些闪耀的点点是什么
and wonder what those sparkly dots are?

989
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:22,020
彭彭  我不好奇  我知道
Pumbaa. I don't wonder. I know.

990
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:24,040
真的吗  它们是什么
Really? What are they?

991
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:25,990
萤火虫
They're fireflies.

992
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:29,460
萤火虫被卡在那个蓝黑色大东西上了
Fireflies that got stuck on that big, bluish-black thing.

993
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:32,400
好像有些道理
I guess that makes sense.

994
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,620
我一直以为它们是胀满气的气球
I always thought they were balls of gas

995
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:36,920
在亿万里外燃烧
burning billions of miles away.

996
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,540
彭彭  你怎么总是三句不离胀气
Pumbaa, why is everything always gas with you?

997
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:40,640
我知道
I know.

998
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:43,360
-你觉得呢  辛巴  -是啊
- What do you think, Simba? - Yeah.

999
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:44,700
我不知道
I don't know.

1000
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:47,680
但我曾被告知
But somebody once told me...

1001
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:50,430
历史上所有伟大的国王都在星空中
the great kings of the past are up there...

1002
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,110
他们在守护我们
and they're all watching over us.

1003
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,610
不错不错  真疯狂
That's a good one! That's insane!

1004
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,610
真疯狂
That's insane!

1005
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,190
王室亡魂在守护我们
Royal dead guys watching over us!

1006
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:09,450
但愿他们不会从天上掉下来
Well, I hope they don't fall out of the sky!

1007
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:12,030
坚持住  陛下  不要放手
Hang on, Your Majesty! Don't let go!

1008
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:13,730
掉下来就糟了
That would be a mess.

1009
01:10:13,930 --> 01:10:15,900
-天啊  -辛巴  好好想想
- Oh, man! - I mean, Simba, think about it.

1010
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:18,450
为什么一帮国王要守护我们
Why would a bunch of kings be looking out for us?

1011
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:19,180
我们是异类
We're outcasts.

1012
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:20,700
王室疣猪
Royal warthogs!

1013
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:21,840
-我不行了  -我不行了
- I can't! - I can't!

1014
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,320
-我不行了  -我真的不行了
- I can't! - I actually can't.

1015
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:23,880
我不行
I can't.

1016
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:26,390
不  你行  我不行
No, you can. I can't.

1017
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:30,750
是啊  是啊
Yeah. Yeah.

1018
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,700
是啊  是挺蠢的
Yeah. That's... that's stupid.

1019
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:38,620
我去找点虫子吃
I'm gonna go get some grubs or something.

1020
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,660
你跟他说什么了
What did you say to him?

1021
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:48,780
我不知道
I don't know.

1022
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:49,940
你说的时候
As you were saying it,

1023
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:51,690
我就想"这不会有好结果"
I thought, "This won't end well."

1024
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:53,240
你就开始笑
You just start laughing.

1025
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:53,980
你也笑了
You laughed too.

1026
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:56,410
我没有  绝对没有
I did not. I would never.

1027
01:10:57,570 --> 01:10:58,990
老天  我搞砸了
Man, I blew it.

1028
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:06,450
辛巴
Simba.

1029
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,240

Nala, what're you doing? Oh, my...

1063
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,370
真不敢相信
I don't believe it!

1064

抱歉  我想先问一句
I'm so sorry, before we move on,

1073
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:34,820
你们俩是怎么认识的
how do you two know each other?

丁满  彭彭
Timon, Pumbaa...

1075
01:17:35,970 --> 01:17:38,190
来见见我最好的朋友娜娜
I want you to meet my best friend, Nala.

1076
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:40,530
最好的朋友  伤心了
Best friend? Well, that hurts.

Simba, we need to leave.

1081
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:50,030
疤面和鬣狗控制了一切
Scar has taken over with the hyenas.

1082
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,880
你必须继承你的王位
You have to take your place as king.

1083

我们是你忠诚的仆从  向你下跪
We kneel before you as loyal servants.

1085
01:17:58,270 --> 01:18:00,180
彭彭  别激动  她说错了
Pumbaa, relax. She's wrong.

1086
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:01,890
女士  你搞错狮子了
Lady, you've got your lions crossed.

1087
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:02,860
漂亮
Nice.

1088

Seeing you again,

1089

At least let me show you around.

1139
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:36,000
或许可以永远像这样
You know, maybe it could be like this forever.

1140
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:37,600
这里很棒
It's amazing.

1141
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:41,180
但有件事我不明白
But there's something I don't understand.

1142
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:44,090
如果你一直以来都活着
If you've been alive all this time...

1143
01:21:44,110 --> 01:21:45,750
你为什么不回家
why haven't you come home?

1144
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,790
我们真的很需要你
We've really needed you.

1145
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:49,880
他们可以的
They're fine, all right?

1146
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:51,470
根本不需要我
Nobody needs me.

1147
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:52,830
你是国王
You're the king.

1148
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:55,930
娜娜  疤面是国王
Nala, Scar is the king.

1149
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,190
辛巴  他摧毁了荣耀大地
Simba, he's decimated the Pride Lands.

1150
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:01,200
没有食物  没有水
There's no food, no water...

1151
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,790
我无能为力
There's nothing I can do.

1152
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:04,780
那你母亲呢
What about your mother?

1153
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:07,040
这是你的责任
This is your responsibility.

1154
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,570
你必须挑战疤面
You need to challenge Scar.

1155
01:22:08,570 --> 01:22:11,540
我不能回去  永远不能
I can't go back. Ever.

1156
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:12,660
为什么
Why?

1157
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:15,090
因为峡谷里发生的事吗
Because of what happened at the gorge?

1158
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:15,930
疤面告诉我们
Scar told us that...

1159
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:17,400
你不会明白的
You wouldn't understand!

1160
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,970
都不重要了  好吗
None of it matters. Okay?

1161
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:20,540
哈库那玛塔塔
Hakuna matata.

1162
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:21,480
什么
What?

1163
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:23,270
这是我在这里学到的东西
It's something I learned out here, okay?

1164
01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:25,280
坏事无可避免
You see, sometimes bad things happen,

1165
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,240
而你却无能为力
and there's nothing you can do about it.

1166
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,000
那为什么还要操心
So, why worry?

1167
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,710
为什么操心
Why worry?

1168
01:22:30,970 --> 01:22:32,530
你到底怎么了
What happened to you?

1169
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,430
你不是我认识的那个辛巴
You're not the Simba I remember.

1170
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:38,160
我也不会再是了  你满意了吗
And I never will be. Are you satisfied?

1171
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:40,420
不  我很失望
No, I'm disappointed.

1172
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:42,510
你这口气跟我爸一模一样
You know, now you're starting to sound like my father.

1173
01:22:42,510 --> 01:22:45,440
那很好  至少我没有迷失自我
Good. I'm glad one of us does.

1174
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:48,500
你根本不知道我经历了什么
You have no idea what I've been through!

1175
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:50,640
我是来这里寻求帮助的
I came here looking for help.

1176
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:54,680
看来是我错了
I guess I made a mistake.

1177
01:22:56,390 --> 01:22:57,730
再见  辛巴
Goodbye, Simba.

1178
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:16,030
"失望"
"Disappointed"?

1179
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:18,600
她想让我回家
She wants me to go home?

1180
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,350
我已经在家了
I am home.

1181
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:22,910
"最好的朋友"
"Best friend"?

1182
01:23:23,390 --> 01:23:25,850
我不需要最好的朋友  我谁都不需要
I don't need best friends. I don't need anybody.

1183
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,310
从来没需要过
Never did.

1184
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:55,950
走开
Go away.

1185
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:59,650
走开并无法回答这个问题
Going away will not answer the question.

1186
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:02,220
什么问题  你是谁
What question? Who are you?

1187
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,470
我知道我是谁
I know exactly who I am.

1188
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:07,050
问题是  你是谁
The question is, who are you?

1189
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:11,770
无名之辈而已  别烦我  好吗
I'm nobody. So leave me alone. All right?

1190
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:15,870
每个人都有自己的身份  即便是无名之辈
Everybody is somebody. Even a nobody.

1191
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:18,400
我觉得你搞混了
Yeah, I think you're confused.

1192
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:20,890
我搞混了
I am confused?

1193
01:24:21,150 --> 01:24:23,180
你连自己是谁都不知道
You don't even know who you are.

1194
01:24:24,090 --> 01:24:25,620
这么说  你知道
And I suppose you do?

1195
01:24:27,780 --> 01:24:30,230
我抱过木法沙的儿子
I held the son of Mufasa.

1196
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:33,770
你之前认识我父亲
You knew my father?

1197
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:35,020
不对
Correction.

1198
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,880
我现在也认识他
I know your father.

1199
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,150
他很早就死了
He died a long time ago.

1200
01:24:39,150 --> 01:24:40,580
他还活着
He's alive!

1201
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:42,920
我带你去找他
And I can take you to him.

1202
01:24:43,530 --> 01:24:45,320
跟我来  我带你去
Follow me. I will show you!

1203
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:46,270
等等
Whoa. Hey, hey, hey!

1204
01:24:46,270 --> 01:24:48,260
如果你能跟上的话
If you can keep up!

1205
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:49,360
等等
Wait!

1206
01:24:59,290 --> 01:25:00,600
跟着我
Follow me!

1207
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:09,430
快  快  过来
Quickly, quickly! Come through!

1208
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:15,440
你慢点
Slow down!

1209
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:19,760
你最好快一点
You better hurry.

1210
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:22,920
等等  我来了  我来了
Hold on. I'm coming, I'm coming.

1211
01:25:43,530 --> 01:25:44,580
来吧
Come.

1212
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,750
你父亲在等你
Your father is waiting.

1213
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:10,870
你看到他了吗
Do you see him?

1214
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:14,250
我什么也没看到
I don't see anything.

1215
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:18,160
再仔细看看
Look closer.

1216
01:26:23,670 --> 01:26:24,750
看到了吗
You see?

1217
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:28,350
他永远活在你心里
He lives in you.

1218
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:32,970
辛巴
Simba.

1219
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:40,650
爸
Dad?

1220
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:42,970
辛巴
Simba.

1221
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:48,130
你必须要在生命的轮回中找到自己的位置
You must take your place in the circle of life.

1222
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:51,110
我找不到
I can't.

1223
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:53,640
你必须要记住自己是谁
You must remember who you are.

1224
01:26:53,930 --> 01:26:56,410
真正的国王
The one true king.

1225
01:26:57,010 --> 01:26:58,150
对不起
I'm sorry.

1226
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:01,030
我不知道怎样才能像你一样
I don't know how to be like you.

1227
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:05,030
作为国王  我最引以为豪的是一件事
As king, I was most proud of one thing.

1228
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:08,270
就是有你这个儿子
Having you as my son.

1229
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,370
那是很久以前了
That was a long time ago.

1230
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:16,670
不  辛巴  这是永恒的
No, Simba. That is forever.

1231
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:21,260
别
Please.

1232
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:23,350
别再离开我
Don't leave me again.

1233
01:27:23,790 --> 01:27:25,350
我从未离开过你
I never left you.

1234
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:27,400
也永远不会离开你
And never will.

1235
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:32,080
记住自己是谁
Remember who you are.

1236
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:35,990
一定要记住
Remember.

1237
01:27:46,530 --> 01:27:49,050
我再问你一遍
And so, I ask again.

1238
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:50,630
你是谁
Who are you?

1239
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:54,080
我是辛巴
I am Simba.

1240
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:56,850
木法沙的儿子
Son of Mufasa.

I didn't wanna believe you.

1255
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:51,770
那你现在打算怎么办
So, what are you gonna do?

1256
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:53,940
我父亲曾经告诉我  要保护
My father once told me to protect

1257
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:55,580
阳光照耀下的一切
everything the light touches.

1258
01:29:56,110 --> 01:29:58,770
如果我不争取  还有谁愿意去做
If I don't fight for it, who will?

1259
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:01,300
我愿意
I will.

1260
01:30:02,020 --> 01:30:03,610
此行会很危险
It's going to be dangerous.

1261
01:30:03,650 --> 01:30:04,860
危险
Danger?

1262
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:08,600
我对危险嗤之以鼻
I laugh in the face of danger.

1263
01:30:11,570 --> 01:30:13,370
不是吧
It can't be!

1264
01:30:14,730 --> 01:30:15,970
你好  沙祖
Hello, Zazu.

1265
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,450
陛下
Your Majesty.

1266
01:30:19,210 --> 01:30:20,700
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

1267
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:25,030
我们来了
We're here!

1268
01:30:25,030 --> 01:30:26,700
各位稍安勿躁  我们来了
Everyone, calm down. We're here.

1269
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:28,460
支援来了
The backup has arrived!

1270
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:30,230
你们怎么来了
What are you guys doing here?

1271
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:33,590
-我们没有担心  -对  没有担心
- We were not worried! - No, not worried.

1272
01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:35,710
-因为没什么好担心的  -对  哈库那玛塔塔
- 'Cause no worries. - Nope. Hakuna matata.

1273
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:37,240
只是有点在意  因为
We were concerned, because...

1274
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:39,110
因为
Because, you know...

1275
01:30:39,110 --> 01:30:40,350
你是我们的朋友
You're our friend.

1276
01:30:40,590 --> 01:30:42,840
所谓的无差别无意义直线呢
What about the meaningless line of indifference?

1277
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:45,030
我们只是在想
Well, we were thinking...

1278
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:47,210
-线也可以弯曲一点  -说得好
- maybe it curves a little bit. - That's a good point.

1279
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:48,290
辛巴  是这样
I mean, Simba, look,

1280
01:30:48,290 --> 01:30:50,620
我承认彭彭说的观点是错的
I'm happy to admit when Pumbaa's wrong...

1281
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:51,630
这次就是其中之一
and this is one of those instances.

1282
01:30:51,630 --> 01:30:52,790
什么  这才不是我的观点
What? That wasn't my thing.

1283
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:54,120
直线的事是你说的
You told me about the line.

1284
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:55,240
等等
Wait, hold on.

1285
01:30:55,270 --> 01:30:57,910
这就是你要争取的地方吗
Now, this is the place you're fighting for?

1286
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:00,620
是的  丁满  这里是我家
Yes, Timon. This is my home.

1287
01:31:00,670 --> 01:31:02,970
在那个可怕的巨石后吗
Is it behind that terrifying rock?

1288
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:04,700
看来还有待修缮
Talk about your fixer-upper.

1289
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:05,900
现在这样我也挺喜欢的
I like what you've done with it,

1290
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:08,190
不过好像有点尸骸遍野
although a bit heavy on the carcass.

1291
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:10,080
你看  有只鸟
Look. A bird.

1292
01:31:10,290 --> 01:31:13,270
丁满  彭彭  这是沙祖
Timon, Pumbaa, this is Zazu.

1293
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:15,130
居然是海鹦鹉
It's a puffin.

1294
01:31:15,330 --> 01:31:16,410
有趣
Charming.

1295
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:21,150
辛巴  我们会一直支持你
Simba, we are with you until the end.

1296
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:23,600
任您差遣  王上
We are at your service, my liege!

1297
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:25,000
跟我来
Follow me.

1298
01:31:39,770 --> 01:31:41,180
到处都是鬣狗
Hyenas everywhere.

1299
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:42,380
希望能死得痛快点
I hope it's a quick death.

1300
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:44,090
别被咀嚼太久
You know, just not a lot of chewing.

1301
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:45,050
你打算怎么带我们
What's your plan for getting us

1302
01:31:45,050 --> 01:31:46,870
穿过这群恶心的守卫
past the slobbering guards?

1303
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,750
活饵
Live bait.

1304
01:31:53,330 --> 01:31:54,780
真是个好主意
That's a great idea.

1305
01:31:55,090 --> 01:31:57,300
这群家伙对新鲜肉食毫无抵抗力
Those guys could never resist fresh meat.

1306
01:31:57,300 --> 01:32:00,660
我们只需要找一个又大
So all we need to do is find something that's, like, big...

1307
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:02,600
又丰满  又可口的动物
and plump, and juicy.

1308
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,910
比如角马
Maybe like a gnu?

1309
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:08,370
为什么都看着我
Why is everyone looking at me?

1310
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:16,470
我非常荣幸
It is with deepest pride

1311
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:18,500
并且非常高兴
and greatest pleasure...

1312
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:21,050
为你们献上
that we proudly present...

1313
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:24,300
你们的晚餐
your dinner.

1314
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:31,060
♪ 别客气 ♪
♪ Be our guest ♪

1315
01:32:33,370 --> 01:32:35,650
成功了  彭彭
It's working, Pumbaa!

1316
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,350
我的老朋友
My old friend.

1317
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:14,110
沙拉碧  你为什么要为难自己
Sarabi, why put yourself through this?

1318
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:16,440
你只需要答应成为我的王后
All you have to do is be my queen.

1319
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:18,410
你受苦是为了什么
You're suffering for what?

1320
01:33:18,410 --> 01:33:20,200
还在怀念过去的生活吗
The memory of a life you once knew?

1321
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:22,070
还在想念你爱过的国王吗
A king you once loved?

1322
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:27,170
我只是想让你明白  真正的国王是什么样的
I tried to make you understand what a true king can be.

1323
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:31,880
疤面  真正的国王  是具有怜悯之心的
Scar, a true king's power is his compassion.

1324
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:34,170
我比木法沙优秀太多了
I am ten times the king Mufasa was!

1325
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:37,250
你根本不配与木法沙相提并论
You are nothing compared to Mufasa!

1326
01:33:48,270 --> 01:33:49,260
木法沙
Mufasa?

1327
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:50,770
不可能
It can't be.

1328
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:52,600
离我母亲远一点
Get away from my mother.

1329
01:33:55,910 --> 01:33:57,020
辛巴
Simba.

1330
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:01,230
你还活着
You're alive?

1331
01:34:01,830 --> 01:34:04,070
怎么可能
How can that be?

1332
01:34:04,370 --> 01:34:05,740
我来了  母亲
I'm here, Mother.

1333
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:07,400
我回来了
I'm home.

1334
01:34:07,790 --> 01:34:08,860
辛巴
Simba...

1335
01:34:09,290 --> 01:34:11,370
很高兴看见你
I'm so happy to see you.

1336
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:13,080
还活着
Alive.

1337
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:16,010
你最好给我一个理由
Give me one good reason

1338
01:34:16,010 --> 01:34:18,290
能说服我不把你撕烂
why I shouldn't rip you apart.

1339
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:20,330
那我可有很多理由
I can give you more than one.

1340
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:21,580
你看
You see...

1341
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:23,960
他们都认我为王
they think I'm king.

1342
01:34:25,980 --> 01:34:27,550
我们不认
Well, we don't.

1343
01:34:29,150 --> 01:34:31,390
你的统治结束了  疤面
Your reign is over, Scar.

1344
01:34:32,230 --> 01:34:34,310
辛巴才是名正言顺的国王
Simba is the rightful king!

1345
01:34:34,950 --> 01:34:38,020
你要动他  先打败我们
If you wanna get him, you have to get through us.

1346
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:40,650
你们都支持我吗  狮子们
Are you with me, lions?

1347
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:45,820
选择权在你手上  疤面
The choice is yours, Scar.

1348
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:48,150
要么退位  要么战斗
Step down or fight.

1349
01:34:48,290 --> 01:34:51,160
一定要诉诸暴力吗
Must this all end in violence?

1350
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:56,410
我不想摊上杀害家族成员的罪名
I'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member.

1351
01:34:56,510 --> 01:34:58,590
为夺取至亲的生命
To feel the shame of knowing...

1352
01:34:58,590 --> 01:35:02,130
而感到羞耻
I took the life of someone I love.

1353
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:03,560
我已经全抛诸脑后了
I put all that behind me.

1354
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:07,430
但他们对此的想法呢
But have they put it behind them?

1355
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:10,260
你忠实的臣民知道你做了什么吗
Do your faithful subjects know what you've done?

1356
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,150
他在说什么
What is he talking about?

1357
01:35:12,150 --> 01:35:15,100
看来你还没告诉他们你的小秘密
So you haven't told them your little secret?

1358
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:17,390
辛巴
Well, Simba...

1359
01:35:18,110 --> 01:35:20,980
是时候坦白了
now's your chance to confess.

1360
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:25,230
告诉他们  谁该为木法沙的死负责
Tell them who's responsible for Mufasa's death.

1361
01:35:33,250 --> 01:35:34,410
是我
It was me.

1362
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:36,740
这不是真的
It's not true.

1363
01:35:38,260 --> 01:35:40,470
告诉我这不是真的
Tell me it's not true.

1364
01:35:40,470 --> 01:35:42,340
是真的  对不起
It's true. I'm sorry.

1365
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:43,750
他承认了
He admits it.

1366
01:35:44,390 --> 01:35:45,180
凶手
Murderer!

1367
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:47,140
不是的  那是场意外
No, no. It was an accident.

1368
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:49,460
要不是你  国王就还活着
If it weren't for you the king would be alive.

1369
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:52,230
他的死都是你的错  你还敢否认
It's your fault he's dead! Do you deny it?

1370
01:35:52,230 --> 01:35:53,610
我不是凶手
I'm not a murderer.

1371
01:35:53,610 --> 01:35:56,260
他杀死了自己的父亲  我们能相信他吗
We should believe a son who takes the life of a father?

1372
01:35:56,530 --> 01:35:59,200
他杀死了自己的国王  我们能相信他吗
We should believe a son who takes the life of a king?

1373
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:01,350
他还抛弃了自己的母亲
A son who abandons his mother?

1374
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:02,950
不  我
No. I'm...

1375
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:05,910
你什么  说出来  你是国王吗
You're what? Say it! Are you the king?

1376
01:36:05,910 --> 01:36:06,910
不是  我
No. No, I'm...

1377
01:36:06,910 --> 01:36:08,620
-你是国王吗  -不是  我
- Are you the king? - No, I'm...

1378
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:10,490
-你什么  说出来  -我是
- You're what? Say it! - I'm...

1379
01:36:12,170 --> 01:36:13,280
我是无名之辈
I'm nothing.

1380
01:36:13,290 --> 01:36:15,490
那就臣服于你的国王
Then bow to your king!

1381
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,120
辛巴
Simba!

1382
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:36,470
这情景真熟悉
This looks familiar.

1383
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:40,810
我以前在哪见过
Where have I seen this before?

1384
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:44,390
对了  我想起来了
Oh, yes, I remember.

1385
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:48,360
这就是木法沙死前的情景
This is the way Mufasa looked before he died.

1386
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:50,780
我往下看
I looked down...

1387
01:36:51,750 --> 01:36:54,200
看见了他眼中的恐惧
saw the fear in his eyes.

1388
01:36:58,090 --> 01:37:00,620
这就是我的小秘密
And here's my little secret.

1389
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:04,500
是我杀了木法沙
I killed Mufasa.

1390
01:37:10,810 --> 01:37:13,300
不
No!

1391
01:37:18,530 --> 01:37:19,780
我的父亲
My father!

1392
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:20,820
你的哥哥
Your own brother!

1393
01:37:20,820 --> 01:37:22,180
你怎么下得去手
How could you?

1394
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:24,180
他先杀了木法沙
First he kills Mufasa...

1395
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:25,820
现在他还想杀我
and now he wants to kill me!

1396
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:27,230
是你杀了他
You killed him!

1397
01:37:27,410 --> 01:37:28,580
告诉他们真相
Tell them the truth!

1398
01:37:28,580 --> 01:37:30,650
不要相信他的谎言
Don't believe his lies!

1399
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:31,650
疤面
Scar...

1400
01:37:31,910 --> 01:37:34,940
你告诉我们你没能及时赶到峡谷
you told us you didn't get to the gorge in time.

1401
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:36,610
没错
That's true!

1402
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:40,490
那你怎么能看见木法沙眼中的神情
Then how did you see the look in Mufasa's eyes?

1403
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,160
凶手
Murderer!

1404
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:45,290
杀光他们
Kill them all!

1405
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:54,010
狮子们  进攻
Lions, attack!

1406
01:38:08,330 --> 01:38:09,400
辛巴
Simba!

1407
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:17,120
彭彭  我觉得我们甩掉他们了
Pumbaa, I think we lost them.

1408
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:18,660
真是太可怕了
That was terrifying.

1409
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:21,950
你听到低吼声了吗
Do you hear a low growl?

1410
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:25,290
看起来我们晚餐要吃猪肉了
Looks like we'll be having pig for dinner.

1411
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:27,830
肥肥胖胖的
Plump and chubby.

1412
01:38:28,050 --> 01:38:28,960
胖
Chubby?

1413
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:31,250
他刚刚是不是说我胖
Did he just call me chubby?

1414
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:34,390
我真的觉得他刚刚说我"胖"
It sounded a lot like he just said "Chubby".

1415
01:38:34,390 --> 01:38:36,230
这真是大错特错  因为
Which would be a mistake because...

1416
01:38:36,230 --> 01:38:38,940
我不会为真实的自我而感到羞耻
I will not be made to feel ashamed of who I am!

1417
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:39,560
糟糕
Oh, boy.

1418
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:41,690
也许看见鬣狗我会逃跑
I may run from hyenas...

1419
01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:44,600
但是我永远勇于与恶霸斗争
but I will always fight a bully!

1420
01:38:52,450 --> 01:38:53,870
-你感觉好些了吗  彭彭  -是的
- You feel better, Pumbaa? - I do.

1421
01:38:53,870 --> 01:38:54,700
你把怒气都发泄出来了
You got that out of your system?

1422
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:55,730
是的
I did.

1423
01:39:10,390 --> 01:39:13,840
这顿大餐我已经等了一辈子了
Now, this is a meal I've waited my whole life for.

1424
01:39:14,810 --> 01:39:16,590
我也一直在等
I've been waiting too.

1425
01:39:17,020 --> 01:39:19,670
而且我已经不是小狮子了
And I'm not a cub anymore!

1426
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,640
为国王和王国而战
For king and country!

1427
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:29,820
那只鸟
It's the bird!

1428
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:31,350
我能搞定它
I got him! I got him!

1429
01:39:32,870 --> 01:39:34,190
来啊
Tally-ho!

1430
01:39:34,330 --> 01:39:35,490
不  他把我搞定了
No! He's got me!

1431
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:36,690
他把我搞定了
He's got me!

1432
01:39:39,790 --> 01:39:41,070
抓住那只鸟
Get that bird!

1433
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:49,160
拜托  我们好好谈谈
Please! Let's discuss this.

1434
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:23,360
这招永远不会过时
That never gets old!

1435
01:41:35,370 --> 01:41:36,810
都结束了  疤面
It's over, Scar.

1436
01:41:40,540 --> 01:41:42,200
我求你发发慈悲
Have mercy. I beg you.

1437
01:41:42,210 --> 01:41:43,230
慈悲
Mercy?

1438
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,450
你的罪行不可饶恕
After what you did?

1439
01:41:45,670 --> 01:41:47,160
都是鬣狗的错
It was the hyenas.

1440
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:50,130
那些恶心的食腐动物逼我做的
Those revolting scavengers made me do it.

1441
01:41:50,130 --> 01:41:52,120
我本来打算把他们都杀了
I was planning on killing them all.

1442
01:41:53,590 --> 01:41:55,460
你骗了鬣狗
You fooled the hyenas.

1443
01:41:55,930 --> 01:41:57,750
正如你骗了我
Just like you fooled me.

1444
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:01,590
辛巴
Simba...

1445
01:42:02,060 --> 01:42:04,260
你不会杀了自己唯一的叔叔吧
you wouldn't kill your only uncle.

1446
01:42:05,810 --> 01:42:07,050
不会  疤面
No, Scar.

1447
01:42:08,690 --> 01:42:10,470
我和你不同
I'm not like you.

1448
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:12,470
辛巴
Simba...

1449
01:42:13,030 --> 01:42:15,060
你真是太高尚了
you are truly noble.

1450
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:17,140
我会补偿你的
And I will make it up to you.

1451
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:19,940
只要你告诉我该如何证明自己
Just tell me how I can prove myself.

1452
01:42:20,490 --> 01:42:22,400
告诉我你想让我做什么
Tell me what you want me to do.

1453
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:26,490
跑
Run.

1454
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:30,530
逃跑吧  疤面
Run away, Scar.

1455
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:34,660
跑得远远的  再也别回来
Run away and never return.

1456
01:42:36,430 --> 01:42:37,580
是啊
Yes.

1457
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:40,040
当然
Of course.

1458
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:42,790
如你所愿
As you wish...

1459
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:45,260
陛下
Your Majesty.

1460
01:42:57,360 --> 01:42:58,820
你赢不了的  疤面
You can't win, Scar!

1461
01:42:58,820 --> 01:43:00,690
这是我的王国
This is my kingdom!

1462
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:02,440
我的宿命
My destiny!

1463
01:43:55,090 --> 01:43:56,330
朋友们
My friends.

1464
01:43:56,590 --> 01:43:57,880
虽然会花费一些时间
It will take some time,

1465
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:00,720
但只要我们齐心协力  就能建立军队
but together we will build our army.

1466
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:02,040
朋友吗
"Friends", huh?

1467
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:06,520
你不是说我们都是"恶心的食腐动物"吗
I thought you said we were "Revolting scavengers"?

1468
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:09,340
没错  而且你还想杀了我们
Yeah. That you wanted to kill us?

1469
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:10,510
不
No.

1470
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:12,380
不  让我解释
No, let me explain.

1471
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:14,590
我只是想骗他
I was trying to fool him.

1472
01:44:15,190 --> 01:44:16,850
我们将一起统治这个王国
We will rule together!

1473
01:44:17,820 --> 01:44:21,350
疤面  你只说过一句真话
There's only one true thing you ever said, Scar.

1474
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:25,060
"鬣狗的肚子"
"A hyena's belly...

1475
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:27,150
"永远填不饱"
"is never full."

1476
01:44:33,250 --> 01:44:35,200
不
No!

1477
01:45:27,390 --> 01:45:29,790
陛下
Your Majesty.

1478
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:25,060
一定要记住
