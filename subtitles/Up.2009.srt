00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,182
它潜藏在壮丽的天堂瀑布之下

6
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,222
孕育着尚未被发现的动植物

为期一年的远征得以完成

12
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,369
这艘轻便的飞艇由蒙兹本人设计
This lighter-than-air craft was designed by Muntz himself

13
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:25,411
它比22辆头尾相连的警车还长

他与他忠心的狗群形影不离

16
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,881
飞船的设计甚至考虑到了犬类的舒适

17
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,001
它是座名副其实的空中宫殿

18
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,553
设有犬类梳洗和自动跑步设备
complete with doggy bath and mechanical canlne walker

19
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,841
当地人视蒙兹为精神偶像
And, Jiminy Cricket, do the locals consider Muntz the bee's knees

20
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,267
并将他奉为上宾

21
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,724

蒙兹这次又带回了什么?

00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:56,272
先生们 我带来了天堂瀑布的怪兽!

25
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,037
但这是什么动物呢? 科学家们连声称假
But what's this? Scientists cry foul

26
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,285
国家冒险协会指责蒙兹伪造骨架
The National Explorer's Society accuses Muntz

27
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,116
of fabricating the skeleton

28
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,371
不!
No!

29
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,169
蒙兹被协会除名
The organization strips Muntz

30
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,462
of his membership

31
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,135
蒙受巨大羞辱的蒙兹 发誓将重返天堂瀑布
Humiliated, Muntz vows a return to Paradise Falls

32
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,133
并承诺将活捉此怪兽!
and promises to capture the beast alive!

33
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,931
我保证会活捉怪兽
I promise to capture the beast alive,

34
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,720
如果做不到就永世不回来!
and I will not come back until I do!

35
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,769
就这样 我们的冒险家 再次启程以正其名
And so, the explorer's off to clear his name

136
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,665
"下午好 我的名字是罗素"

-''Are you n need of any assistance'' -Thank you,

140

- 'Good afternoon'' -But skip to the end!

看到这些了吗? 这些是我野外探险的徽章
See these? These are my Wilderness Explorer badges

144
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:34,574

You may notice one s m ssing It's my Assisting the Elderly badge.

145
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:39,366

If I get it, I will become a Senior Wilderness Explorer.

146
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,076
"野外探险去啊!"
''The wlderness must be explored!''

147
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,246
嘎 嘎 啊!

It's gonna be great! There's a big ceremony,

149
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,715

150
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,758
所以说你想帮助老人家?

是的! 这样我就能升高级了

00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,601

-You ever heard of a snipe? - Snipe?

153
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,678
一种鸟 眼睛小而圆
Bird Beady eyes

154
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:07,766
每晚都溜进我的院子偷吃杜鹃花
Every night it sneaks in my yard and gobbles my poor azaleas.

155
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:13,567
我又老又弱 抓不到它 如果有人能帮我就好了
I'm elderly and nfrm I can't catch it If on y someone cou d help me.

156
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:17,071
- 我! 我! 我帮您! - 不知你行吗 它可狡猾着呢
- Me me! I' I do it! -I don't know It's awfully crafty.

157
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,118
你得拍三次手才能引它出来
You'd have to cap your hands three times to lure it in

158
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,988
我会找到的 弗雷德里克森先生!
I'll find him Mr Fredricksen!

159
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,456

I think its burrow is two blocks down If you go past

160
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,622
过两条街 知道了 沙锥鸟

163
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,461
沙锥鸟!

164
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,674
好了 再向前 向前
Okay, keep her coming Keep coming

170
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,443
- 离我的邮箱远点! - 嗨 先生 我
-Get away from our mailbox! - Hey Sir, I.

171
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,020
你别碰它!
I don't want you to touch it!

172
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,145
噢!
Ow!

173
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,993
史蒂夫 你还好吗?
Steve, you all right?

174
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,195
抱歉 弗雷德里克森先生
Sorry, Mr Fredricksen

175
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:48,537
我觉得你并不像个危险人物 拿着
You don't seem like a public menace to me. Take this.

176
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,704
荫树橡木的工作人员 明早会来接您的 好吗?
The guys from Shady Oaks will be by to pick you up in the morn ng, okay?

177
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,015
现在该怎么办呢 爱丽?

178
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,436
早啊 先生们

180
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,696
准备得不能再准备了
Ready as I' ever be

181
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,115
能帮我拿下这个吗?
Would you do me a favor and take this?

182
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,538
我们一会儿在车上见
I'll meet you at the van in just a minute

183
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,956
我得好好和老房子告别
I wanna say one ast goodbye to the old place.

184
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,830
当然了 您慢慢来吧

见得多了 他可能要去上第80次厕所
That's typical He's probab y going to the bathroom forthe 80th time.

186
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:09,177
他真该好好收拾收拾呢
You think he'd take better care of his house

187
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:55,470
永别了 小子们! 我会在天堂瀑布给你们寄明信片的
So long, boys! I'I send you a postcard from Paradise Fal s

188
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:44,768
耶!
Heh!

189
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,235
我们上路了 爱丽
Were on ourway, Ellie

190
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,153
呃?
Huh?

191
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,326
哼
Hmm

192
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:39,388
你好 弗雷德里克森先生 是我 罗素
Hi Mr Fredricksen It's me, Russell

193
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,469
你在外头做什么 孩子?
What are you doing out here, kid?

194
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:45,306
我找到了沙锥鸟 跟着它到了您门廊下
I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch,

195
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:50,236
但沙锥鸟有条长尾巴 更像只大老鼠
but th s snipe had a ong tail and looked more like a large mouse.

196
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,742
请让我进去吧
Please let me in

197
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,407
不行

198
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,168
哦 好吧 你可以进
Oh alright, you can come

199
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:08,583
来

200
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,381
呃
Huh

201
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,599
我从没坐过会飞的屋子
I've never been in a floatng house before.

202
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:26,222
风镜啊 看看这玩意 哇哦! 您要去旅行吗?
Goggles Look at th s stuff Wow! You're going on a trip?

203
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:30,025
"天堂瀑布 失落的世界"
''Paradise Falls, a and lost in time''

204
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,852
您要去南美洲啊 弗雷德里克森先生?
You're going to South America, Mr Fredricksen?

205
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,778
别碰那个! 你会弄脏它的
Don't touch that! You'I soil it

206
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,943
大多数人会坐飞机
You know most people take a plane,

207
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:39,368
但您很聪明 因为这样您能带齐 电视 餐具和所有的东西
but you re smart because you will have al your TV and cocks and stuff.

208
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,367
哇 您是这样驾驶房子的?
Whoa Is this how you steer your house?

209
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,868
真的管用吗?
Does it really work?

210
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,367
小孩 你别去碰
Kid would you stop with the

211
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,043
- 这样右转 - 不要动
-This makes it go right -Let go of that...

212
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,621
- 这样就转左了 - 快住手
-And that way's left - Knock it off

213
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,755
嘿 快看! 高楼大厦
Hey, look! Bui dings

214
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:56,760
那楼离这么近 我都能碰到了
That bu Iding's so close I cou d almost touch it

215
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,091
哇! 真棒!
Wow! This is great!

216
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:04,639
您也该来试试 弗雷德里克森先生
You shou d try th s Mr Fredricksen

217
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:08,139
看啊 下面的公车站能送我回家 过两条街就到!
Look, there's a bus that could take me home two blocks away!

218
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,770
嘿 这里能看到您的房子
Hey I can see your house from here

219
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,652
- 别乱动了 小孩 - 哇哦!
Don't jerk around so much, kid Whoa!

220
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,319
这办法恐怕不行
Well, that's not gonna work

221
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,656
我认识那云 是积雨云
I know that coud lts a cumulonimbus

222
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:21,826
您知道吗
Did you know that

223
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,578
当暖气流升到冷气流上面
the cumulonimbus forms

224
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,155
就会形成积雨云了?
when warm air rises over cool air?

225
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,580
整晚充气球为了什么啊?
Stayed up al n ght blowing up balloonsforwhat?

226
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,750
所以就形成了闪电
and that's how we get lightning

227
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,248
- 说得好 孩子 - 弗雷德里克森先生?
-That's nice kid -Mr Fredricksen?

228
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,499
暴风雨要来了 越来越吓人了
Theres a storm coming It's starting to get scary.

229
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:38,253
我们要被吹散了! 我们有大麻烦了!
We're gonna get b own to b ts! We're in big trouble..

230
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,172
- 你在那儿干嘛呢? - 快看
-What are you doing over there? - Look

231
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,982
看到了吗? 积雨云
See? Cumulonimbus.

232
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,057
我的背包!
My pack!

233
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,237
抓到了!
Got ya!

234
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,227
我还以为您死了呢
I thought you were dead

235
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,356
出什么事了?
What happened?

236
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:25,864
我刚在掌舵 我做到了 我能驾驭飞屋了
I steered us I did I steered the house

237
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,034
掌舵?
Steered us?

238
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,864
您把东西抱紧后就睡着了
After you tied your stuff down, you took a nap.

239
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,040
所以我就跑前面掌舵 我们就到了这里
So I went ahead and steered us down here

240
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,829
那是
Yeah. Sure.

241
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,806
我们迷路了
Can't tell where we are.

242
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,892
哦 我们已经在南美了
Oh we're in South Amerca all right

243
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,642
有了我的野外探险GPS 小菜一碟
It was a cinch with my Wilderness Explorer GPS.

244
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:57,399
- GP什么? - 我爸给我的
-GP What? -My dad gave it to me

245
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,818
它能指示我们目前的所在地
It shows exacty where we are on the planet.

246
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,649
有了这宝贝 我们永远不会迷路!
With this baby, we'll never be ost!

247
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,324
哎呀
Oops

248
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,245
放你下去 坐公车回家吧
Well get you down, find a bus stop,

249
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:17,419
你就说要回去找妈妈
you just tell the man you wanna go back to your mother.

250
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:21,169
当然 但我觉得天堂瀑布没公车吧
Sure, but I don't think they have buses in Parad se Falls

251
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,675
好了 这样就行了
There That ought to do it

252
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,596
我再给你些零钱坐车
Here I'll g ve you some change for bus fare.

253
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,175
不用了 我可以用公交卡
No, I'll just use my city bus pass

254
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,932
喔 那得转个无数站
Whoa That's gonna be like a bill on transfers

255
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,684
才能到我家了
to get back to my house

256
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,110
弗雷德里克森先生 要多久着陆啊?
Mr Fredrcksen, how much longer?

257
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:50,035
我们升得挺高的 要花个几小时着落吧
We I we're up pretty high Oould take hours to get down.

258
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,456
那是楼房之类的吧

259
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,959
那是什么 弗雷德里克森先生?
What was that, Mr Fredricksen?

260
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,378
我们应该还没到地吧
We can't be cose to the ground yet

261
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,223
等等! 等等 不 不要! 不要 不要!

00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,905

Oh, it is,because my master is smart

我是个追踪高手
I am a great tracker

404
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:55,009
我的同伴派我来独立执行 一项特殊的任务
My pack sent me on a specia mission all by myself.

405
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,176
你们见过一只鸟吗?

406

我的任务就是来找它 我追踪气味到了这里
I want to find one, and I've been on the scent

407

我是个追踪高手 我之前向你们提过吗?

嘿 就是这只鸟

I have never seen one up close, but th s is the bird

410
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,190
我能把你的鸟作为俘虏 押回营地吗?
May I take your bird back to camp as my prsoner?

411
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:13,270

423
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,979
噢 伙计 主人不会满意的
Oh, man, Masterwill not be pleased

424
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,103
我们最好向他报告 有人抓住那鸟了 对吗 老大?
We betterte him someone took the bird. R ght, Alpha?

425
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:57,904

426
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,825
很快我们就会抓到那只鸟的
Soon enough the bird will be ours yet again

427
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,990
继续追踪气味 我的朋友
Find the scent, my compadres,

428
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,821
没有功劳也有苦劳嘛
and you too shall have much rewardings

429
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,664
主人会多给一点奖赏的
from Masterforthe toil factor you wage.

430
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:11,411
嘿 老大 你的项圈好像有点问题
Hey, Alpha, I think there's something wrong with your collar.

431
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:12,746
你肯定撞到它了
You mustve bumped it

432
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,126
没错 你的声音听起来真滑稽!
Yeah, your vo ce sounds funny!

433
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:23,013
老二! 老三! 或许你们想要  松鼠!
Beta! Gamma! Mayhaps you desire to Squirrel!

434
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,101
或许你们想挑战一下我的权威
ALPHA: Mayhaps you deslre to challenge the ranking

435
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,770
这排位可是凭着 我的力量与智慧获得的
that I have been assigned by my strength and cunning.

436
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:33,645
不 不 不 不过道格或许想试试 你可以问问他
No, no, no But maybe Dug wou d. You might wanna ask him.

437
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:39,572

Yeah I wonder fhe's found the b rd on h s very specia mission

438
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,741
别哪壶不开提哪壶
Do not mention Dug to me at thls time

439
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:47,072
这愚蠢的任务够他忙活的了
His fool's errand will keep him most occupied Most occupied indeed.

440
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:52,210
你们难道不同意我的看法吗?
Do you not agree with that which I am saying to you now?

441
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:56,585
当然同意 可一旦主人发现 你让道格单独行动
Sure, but the second Master finds out you sent Dug out by himself,

442
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,257
我们都没好果子吃
none of us will get a treat

443
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,468
你们都是聪明的家伙 我可靠的伙伴们
You are wise, my trusted lieutenant.

444
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:05,848
我是老大 呼叫道格 快回话 道格

452
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,949

455
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,575
他们在哪里?

道格 不要再烦凯文了!
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

459
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,803
那位先生说我可以带走这只鸟
That man there says I can take the bird,

460
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,638
而且我喜欢那位先生 就像喜欢我主人一样
and I love that man there like he is my master.

461
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,810
我才不是你主人!
I am not your master!

462
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:53,434
我再次警告你 大鸟

490
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,090

噢

493
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,396
搭帐篷真难
Tents are hard

494
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:13,202
你不是超级野外探险家么? 还有那什么GPM和奖章?
Wait Aren't you superwlderness guy, with the GPMs and the badges?

495
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:17,998

- 不 - 好吧 秘密是
-No -AI right. Here t goes.

497
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:25,464
我其实从来没搭过帐篷 好了 我说出来了
I neveractualy bu It a tent before. There, I said it

498
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:28,168
你以前不是野营过吗?
You've been camping before, haven t you?

499
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,719
是的 但是从未在野外
Well, never outside

500
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:34,636
那你为什么不向你爸爸 讨教讨教怎么搭帐篷?
Well, why didn t you ask your dad how to build a tent?

501
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,935
我想他不会跟我聊这些的
I don't th nk he wants to talk about th s stuff

502
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,638
你不问怎么能知道 也许他比你想得更在行噢
Well, why don t you try him sometime Maybe he' I surprise you.

503
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:43,065
他总是出差 我不常见到他
Well, he's away a lot I don't see h m much

504
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,767
他总有回家的时候吧
He's gotta be home sometime

505
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:49,105
我会打电话给他 但菲丽斯说 我这样太打搅他了
Wel , I call, but Phyllis told me I bug him too much.

506
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,613
菲丽斯? 你就这样直呼妈妈的名字
Phyllis? You cal your own mother by her first name?

507
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:54,865
菲丽斯不是我妈妈
Phyllis isn't my mom

508
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,159
噢
Oh.

509
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:09,425
但是他保证会来参加 我的探险家授奖仪式
But he promised hed come to my Exp orer ceremony

510
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:12,299
亲自把助老奖章给我戴上
to pin on my Assist ng the Elderly badge.

511
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,511
到时他就能教我搭帐篷了 对吧?
So, he can show me about tents then, right?

512
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,683
你要不要睡一会?
Hey, why don t you get some sleep?

513
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:29,604
我可不想吵醒这些 逃亡的马戏团成员
Don't wanna wake up the traveling f ea circus.

514
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,149
弗雷德里克森先生?
Mr Fredricksen?

515
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:36,111
道格说他要抓凯文做俘虏
Dug says he wants to take Kev n prisoner.

516
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,953
我们得保护它
We have to protect him

517
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,204
凯文能跟我们一起走吗?
Can Kevin go with us?

518
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,750
好吧 它可以
All rght, he can come

519
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,541
保证你不会丢下它?

00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,265
划十字
Cross my heart

522
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,311
我这是招谁惹谁了我 爱丽?
What have I got myself into, Ellie?

523
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,252
早安 甜心

大鸟走了

00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:46,731
也许罗素不会注意到 好咧 大家都起床吧!
Maybe Russell won't notice All right, everybody up!

527
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:52,028

641
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,151
我真不应该用那个词
I shouldn t have used that word

642
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,980
有朋自远方来 不亦乐乎
Having guests s a delight

643
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:36,943
经常有小偷来偷我东西

644
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:38,072

我花了一生来找它

649
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:03,602
有时候 追着追着 几年就过去了
Sometimes years go by between sightings

650

Ive tried to smoke it out of that death y abyr nth where it ives.

651
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,648
但之后人也就进不去了
You can't go in after it

652
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,362
一旦进去 就出不来了
Once in, there's no way out

653
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:16,948
好多狗都死了
I've lost so many dogs

654
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:24,115
可现在那些恶棍又跑来 说什么那只鸟是他们的
And here they come, these bandits, and think the bird is theirs to take.

655
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:29,833
很快他们就会发现 这座山可是非常危险的
But they soon find that th s mountain is a very dangerous p ace

656
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,674
