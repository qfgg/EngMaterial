{\an5}疯狂动物城

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,820
{\an5}疯狂动物城

21
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,670
恐惧  背叛和嗜血
Fear, treachery, blood lust.

22
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:11,840
数万年前支配着我们的世界
Thousands of years ago these were the forces that ruled our world

23
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,010
那时食草动物惧怕食肉动物
A world where prey were scared of predators.

24
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,570
而食肉动物无法遏制的本能
And predators had an uncontrollable...

25
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,930
让他们捕猎  残杀  还有
biological urge to maim, and maul, and...

26
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,070
流血  血  血
Blood! Blood! Blood!

27
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,860
和死亡
And.. Death!

28
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,050
那时世界分成两部分
Back then, the world was divided in two.

29
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,710
凶残的食肉动物  和温顺的食草动物
Vicious predator, or meek prey.

30
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,610
{\an7}凶残的食肉动物

31
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,610
{\an9}                  温顺的食草动物

32
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,240
但我们也随着时间进化
But over time, we evolved,

33
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,750
将这原始野蛮的生活方式抛在身后
and moved beyond or primitive savage ways.

34
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,820
现在食肉和食草动物和谐共处
Now predator and prey live in harmony.

35
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,360
每只哺乳动物的未来都有了无限可能
And every young mammal has multitudinous opportunities.

36
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,700
我不用再缩在羊群里了
Yeah, I don't have to cower in a a herd anymore.

37
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,700
{\an8}英文的黑羊Black Sheep等于中文的害群之马

38
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,210
我可以做宇航员
Instead, I can be an astronaut.

39
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,610
我不用再孤单地追捕狩猎了
I don't have to be a lonely hunter anymore.

40
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,230
我可以追捕逃税的人
Today I can hunt for tax exemptions.

41
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,940
我要做精算师
I'm gonna be an actuary.

42
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,900
我可以让世界更美好  我要做
And I can make the world a better place. I am going to be...

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,250
警察
A police officer!

44
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,560
兔子警察  简直蠢透了
Bunny cop? That is the most stupidest thing I ever heard!

45
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,760
眼界狭窄的当然觉得不可能
It may seem impossible to small minds.

46
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,910
说的就是你  吉迪恩·格雷
I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey.

47
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:57,370
但是211英里外就是伟大的动物城
But, just 211 miles away, stands the great city of Zootopia.

48
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,800
我们双方的祖先签订和平契约
Where our ancestors first joined together in peace.

And declared that anyone can be anything!

51
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,840
谢谢大家  晚安
Thank you and good night.

52
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,050
朱迪  你想没想过
Judy, you ever wonder how

53
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,580
你妈妈和我为什么这么幸福吗
your mom and me got to be so darn happy?

54
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,190
没有
Nope.

55
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,430
我们放弃了梦想  安定了下来  对吗邦妮
Well, we gave up on our dreams, and we settled. Right, Bon?

56
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,890
是啊  斯图  我们可安定了
Oh, yes. That's right, Stu. We settled hard.

57
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,970
这就是知足常乐  朱迪
You see, that's the beauty of complacency, Jude.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,290
不尝试新的事物  就绝不会失败
If you don't try anything new, you'll never fail.

59
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,010
我挺喜欢尝试的
I like trying, actually.

60
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,200
亲爱的  你爸爸是说
What your father means, hon,

61
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,090
成为警官对你来说非常难
is that it's gonna be difficult, impossible even...

62
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,720
甚至是不可能的
for you to become a police officer.

63
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,330
是啊  还从没有兔子做过警察
Right. There's never been a bunny cop.

64
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,400
-没有  -兔子不做警察
- No. - Bunnies don't do that.

65
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,480
-绝不会  -绝不
- Never. - Never.

66
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,530
那我就是第一个了
Well... Then I guess I'll have to be the first one.

67
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,010
因为我要让世界更美好
Because I am gonna make the world a better place!

68
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,170
或者  这样
Or, heck, you know.

69
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,260
想让世界更美好吗
You wanna talk about making the world a better place,

70
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,350
做个种胡萝卜的农民最好了
no better way to do it than becoming a carrot farmer.

71
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,610
是啊  你爸爸和我  还有你275个兄弟姐妹
Yes! Your dad, me, your 275 brothers and sisters.

72
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,690
我们就是在改变世界
We're changing the world.

73
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,690
-一根胡萝卜一根胡萝卜地拯救  -可不是嘛
- One carrot at a time. - Amen to that.

74
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,110
种胡萝卜是光荣的职业
Carrot farming is a noble profession.

75
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,960
只要把种子
Just pulling their seeds out

76
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,570
撒进土里
And one with the soil...

77
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,540
懂吗  有梦想是好事
You get it, honey? I mean, it's great to have dreams.

78
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,540
只要别陷进去就好
Yeah, just as long as you don't believe in them too much.

79
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,410
她去哪了
Where the heck'd she go?

80
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,260
把票给我
Give me your tickets right now,

81
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,150
不然揍扁你温顺的小屁股
or I'm gonna kick your meek little sheep butt.

82
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,770
住手  吉迪恩
Cut it out, Gideon!

83
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,770
咩咩  你要哭吗
Baah, baah! What are you gonna do, cry?

84
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,650
-听她的  快住手  -戏服不错  小废物
- You heard her. Cut it out. - Nice costume, loser.

85
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,460
你是活在什么地方
What crazy world are you living in

86
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,050
觉得兔子能当警察吗
where you think a bunny could be a cop?

87
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,050
乖乖把票还给他们
Kindly return my friend's tickets.

88
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,470
有种来拿  但是小心点
Come and get them. But watch out.

89
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,550
因为我是狐狸
Cause I'm a fox,

90
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,860
你在那蠢货舞台剧上野说了
and like you said in your dumb little stage play,

91
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,080
以前食肉动物吃食草动物
us predators used to eat prey.

92
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,730
杀手本能还在我们的DANA里
And that killer instinct's still in our DANA.

93
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,180
那个  应该是DNA
Uh, I'm pretty much sure it's pronounced DNA.

94
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,820
我知道  不用你告诉我  崔维斯
Don't tell me what I know, Travis.

95
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,100
我不怕你  吉迪恩
You don't scare me, Gideon.

96
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,580
现在怕了吗
Scared now?

97
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,940
看那鼻子抽的  她怕了呢
Look at her nose twitch, she is scared.

98
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,980
哭吧  小兔兔  哭吧
Cry, little baby bunny! Cry...

99
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,850
你就是不肯放弃是吧
Oh, you don't know when to quit, do you?

100
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,830
你给我记住这一刻
I want you to remember this moment

101
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,670
免得你再不安分
the next time you think you will ever be...

102
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,620
忘了自己就是只种胡萝卜的蠢兔子
anything more than just a stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny.

103
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,440
-好重啊  -你没事吧  朱迪
- That looks bad. - Are you okay, Judy?

104
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,510
我没事  给你
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. Here you go.

105
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,240
-你把票拿回来了  -你真棒  朱迪
- Wow, you got our tickets! - You're awesome, Judy.

106
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,680
吉迪恩·格雷真是胡说八道
Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't know what he's talking about!

107
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,610
有件事他是说对了
Well, he was right about one thing.

108
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,990
我就是不肯放弃
I don't know when to quit.

00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,390
好了  霍普斯警官  笑一个
Okay, Officer Hopps. Let's see those teeth!

145
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,700
霍普斯警官  看这里
Officer Hopps, look here.

146
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,390
-我们真为你骄傲  朱迪  -也有点担心
- We're real proud of you, Judy. - Yeah, and scared too.

147
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,930
-是啊  -又骄傲又担心
- Yes. - Really, it's kind of a proud-scared combo.

148
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,950
动物城啊  那么远  那么大
I mean, Zootopia. So far away, such a big city.

149
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,560
爸妈  我这辈子都在为这一刻努力
Guys, I've been working for this my whole life.

150
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,260
我们知道  我们是替你高兴  也有点害怕
We know. And we're just a little excited for you, but terrified.

151
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,180
除了恐惧  没什么好害怕的
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.

152
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,550
还有熊  熊也要怕
And also bears. We have bears to fear, too.

153
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,090
-更不用说狮子和狼了  -狼
- Say nothing on lions, and wolves. - Wolves?

154
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,140
-黄鼠狼  -你还和黄鼠狼玩过牌
- Weasels. - You played cribbage with a weasel once?

155
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,370
是啊  他那作弊真是没底线
Yeah, he cheats like there's no tomorrow.

156
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,020
说真的  食肉动物都一样
You know what? Pretty much all predators.

157
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,000
-动物城全都是  -斯图
- And Zootopia is full of them. - Oh, Stu.

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,050
狐狸是最差劲的
And foxes are the worst.

159
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,690
你爸爸说的有点道理
Yeah, actually, your father does have a point there.

160
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,710
这是天生的  还记得吉迪恩·格雷吗
It's in their biology. Remember what happened with Gideon Grey?

161
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,360
我才九岁  他是个混蛋  刚好也是只狐狸
When I was nine. Gideon Grey was a jerk who happens to be a fox.

162
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,230
我认识的兔子里也有不少混蛋呢
I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks.

163
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,420
是啊  可不是  可是以防万一
Sure, yeah, we all do, absolutely. But just in case,

164
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,540
我们给你弄了个爱心包
we made you a little care package to take with you.

165
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,880
-放了点点心  -这是震狐器
- I put some snacks in there. - This is fox deterrent.

166
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,880
-拿着挺放心的  -驱狐喷雾
- Yeah, it's safe to have that. - This is fox repellant.

167
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,520
又震慑又驱赶  够了
The deterrent and the repellant, that's all she needs.

168
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,800
-看看这个  -天哪
- Check this out! - Oh, for goodness sake!

169
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,660
不用带电狐器吧  斯图
She has no need for a fox taser, Stu.

170
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,110
得了吧  电狐器总能用得上
Oh, come on. When is there not a need for a fox taser?

171
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,030
好了  好吧  我带着这个  好让你们消停
Well, okay, look, I will take this... To make you stop talking.

172
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,730
太棒了  大家都开心
Terrific! Everyone wins!

173
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,820
进站列车  终点动物城
Arriving, Zootopia Express.

174
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,330
好了  得走了  再见

175

爱你
Love you, too.

177
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,100
天哪  要哭鼻子了
Oh, cripes, here come the waterworks.

178
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,030
斯图  振作点
Oh, Stu. Pull it together.

179
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,400
大家再见

180
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:51,020

181
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,440

182
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:05,630
{\an8}正驶离兔窝镇
人口

183
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:08,850
{\an8}夏奇羚

184
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,520

欢迎来到穿山甲公寓
And welcome to the Grand Pangolin Arms.

187
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,520
魅力四射的豪华公寓
Luxury apartments with charm.

188
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,580
每月一次免费除虱  钥匙别丢了
Complementary delousing once a month. Don't lose your key!

189
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,550
谢谢
Thank you.

190
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,370
-你们好  我是朱迪  新邻居  -我们声音可大了
- Oh, hi! I'm Judy, your new neighbour! - Yeah? Well, we're loud.

191
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,370
也不会道歉的
Don't expect us to apologize for it.

192
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,450
油油的墙
Greasy walls.

193
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,450
晃晃的床
Rickety bed.

194
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,900
疯癫的邻居
Crazy neighbors.

195
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,050
我喜欢
I love it!

196
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,600
别这样  他先露的牙
Come on! He bared his teeth first!

197
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,780
你好
Excuse me!

还真找了只兔子啊
They really did hire a bunny.

201
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,890
天哪  说实话
Ho-whop! I gotta tell you,

202
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,990
你比我想的还要可爱
you're even cuter than I thought you'd be.

203
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,180
你可能不知道
Ooh, ah, you probably didn't know,

204
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,790
兔子可以互相说可爱
but a bunny can call another bunny "Cute",

205
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,870
但是换了其他动物  就有点...
but when other animals do it, that's a little...

206
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,440
真抱歉  我  本杰明·爪豪斯
I am so sorry! Me, Benjamin Clawhauser.

207
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,440
大家都以为我
The guy everyone thinks is

208
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,880
只是爱吃甜甜圈的软萌警察  还给你套刻板印象
just a flabby donut-loving cop, stereotyping you.

209
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,220
没事的
No, it's okay.

210
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,930
你那里有个  那个
You've actually got... there's a...

211
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,210
-什么  -脖子里  领子上面
- A what? - In your neck. The fold.

212
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:21,140
-那个  -你在这啊  小坏蛋
- The... this... - Oh, there you went, you little dickens!

213
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,080
我得去点名了  哪边...
Hehehe, I should get to roll call, so which way do I...

214
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,250
-候补区在那边左侧  -谢谢
- Oh, bull pen's over there to the left. - Great. Thank you!

215
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,680
这小兔子会被生吞活剥的
That poor little bunny's gonna get eaten alive.

216
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,670
我是霍普斯警官  准备好让世界更美好了吗
Officer Hopps. You ready to make the world a better place?

217
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,400
全体都有
Attention!

218
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,890
好了  好了  都坐下
All right. All right. Everybody sit.

219
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,570
我这里有三件事
I've got three items on the docket.

220
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,290
首先来说屋子里的大象

有些新人我得介绍一下
There are some new recruits with us I should introduce,

225
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,890
我就不介绍了  因为  我不在乎
but I'm not going to because... I don't care.

226
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,620
最后  有14起哺乳动物失踪案
Finally, we have 14 missing mammal cases.

227
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,250
全是食肉动物  从大北极熊到小水獭
All predators. From a giant polar bear to a teensy little otter.

228
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,020
市政厅天天追在我屁股后面
And City Hall is right up my tail to find them.

229
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,560

没忘  就是不在乎
Didn't forget. Just don't care.

243
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,430
长官  我可不是只吉祥物
Sir, I'm not just some token bunny.

244
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:31,020
那一天开100张停车罚单应该没问题
Well then, writing a hundred tickets a day should be easy.

245
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,330
100张  我才不开100张呢
100 tickets. I'm not gonna write 100 tickets.

246
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,240
我要开200张  中午之前

看着点路  狐狸
Hey, watch where you're going, fox!

251
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,110
他去哪了
Where'd he go?

252
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,180
我不知道你大白天的
Listen. I know what you're doing

253
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,580
出来晃悠什么呢
skulking around during daylight hours,

254
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,120
但我不想惹麻烦  快走吧

- Listen, buddy. - What?

261
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,910
你那边没有给狐狸开的冰淇淋店吗
There aren't any fox ice cream joints in your part of town?

262
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,780
有啊  有  只是我儿子
No, no. There are, there are. It's just, my boy,

这只小傻狐狸  特别迷大象
this goofy little stinker, he loves all things elephant.

长大了也想当大象
He wants to be one when he grows up.

265
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,350
多可爱啊
Isn't that adorable?

266
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,620
我怎么忍心让他梦想破灭呢
Who the heck am I to crush his little dreams, huh? Right?

267
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,090
你是不识字吗  狐狸  看这个
Look, you probably can't read, fox, but the sign says

268
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:33,460
我们有权拒绝提供服务

你也和其他人一样
Hey, you're gonna have to

273
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,640
得排队等着  交通协管
wait your turn like everyone else, meter maid.

274
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,870
其实我是警员
Actually, I'm an officer.

275
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,380
就问一下
Just have a quick question.

276
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,510
你的顾客们知道
Are your customers aware they're getting

277
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,050
吃的饼干和冰淇淋里有鼻涕吗
snot and mucus with their cookies and cream?

278
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,870
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

279
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,080
我不想惹麻烦
Well. I don't wanna cause you any trouble,

280
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,940
但是不戴鼻套盛冰淇淋
but I believe scooping ice cream with

281
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,210
是严重违反健康条例的
an ungloved trunk is a class 3 health code violation.

282
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,830
这也不是小事了
Which is kind of a big deal.

283
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,720
当然  如果你肯戴上
Of course I could let you off

284
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,880
我是可以给你个警告了事
with a warning if you were to glove those trunks

285
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,270
而且  还得给这位
and... I don't know... finish selling this...

286
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,150
爸爸和他儿子  卖一根  什么
nice dad and his son a... What was it?

287
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,520
大冰棒  拜托了
A Jumbo-Pop. Please.

288
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,840
大冰棒
A Jumbo-Pop.

289
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,860
-15块  -非常感谢  谢谢你
- $15. - Thank you so much. Thank you.

290
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,270
不会吧
Oh no, are you kidding me...

291
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,230
忘带钱包了
I don't have my wallet!

292
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,050
真是就差忘带脑袋了
I'd lose my head if it weren't attached to my neck.

293
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,060
真是啊  天哪  不好意思
That's the truth. Oh, boy. I'm sorry, pal.

294
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,980
大概是你最糟的生日了
Gotta be about the worst birthday ever.

295
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,790
别生我的气  谢谢你
Please don't be mad at me. Thanks anyway.

296
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,070
不用找了
Keep the change.

297
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,030
警官  真是感恩戴德
Officer, I can't thank you enough.

298
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,620
太好了  怎么回报你啊
So kind. Really. Can I pay you back?

299
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,240
不用  我请了
Oh, no. My treat.

300
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,320
主要是听到别人
It's just, you know it burns me up

301
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,120
对狐狸有偏见我就受不了
to see folks with such backward attitudes towards foxes.

302
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,000
我只是想说
I just want to say you're

303
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,770
你是位好父亲  口才真棒
a great dad and just a real articulate fella.

304
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,130
真是过奖了
Well, that is high praise.

305
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,060
我也很少遇到不看低我的人
It's rare that I find someone so non-patronizing.

306
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,300
-警官你叫  -霍普斯  你是
- Officer? - Hopps. Mr..?

307
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,140
王尔德  尼克·王尔德
Wilde. Nick Wilde.

308
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,350
你呢  小家伙  长大了想做大象吗
And you, little guy. You wanna be an elephant when you grow up?

309
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:26,290
那就去做大象好了  这是动物城
You be an elephant. Because this is Zootopia.

310
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,720
谁都能成就无限可能
Anyone can be anything.

311
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,360
我总这么跟他说
I tell him that all the time.

312
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,220
好了  给你  双爪抱住
All right, here you go. Two paws.

313
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,710
看这笑脸  生日快乐真开心
Yeah. Oh, look at that smile, that's a happy birthday smile!

314
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,390
好了  嘟嘟两声道个别吧
All right, give her a little bye-bye toot-toot.

315
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,770
-再见了  -再见
- Bye, now! - Goodbye!

316
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,740
小大象
Hey, little toot-toot...

317
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,200
{\an8}鼠曼兄弟银行

318

319
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,540
来吃爪子冰棍
Get your Pawpsicles.

320
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,200
{\an8}爪子冰棍

321
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,050
-木材送到了  -怎么这个颜色
- Lumber delivery. - What's with the color?

322
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,680
颜色  这是红木
The color? Uh... it's redwood.

323
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,940
39, 40, there you go.

324
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,120
装小孩真厉害  大家伙
Way to work that diaper, big guy.

325
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,730
不跟爸爸吻别吗
No kiss bye-bye for daddy?

326
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,350
再敢亲我  我把你脸咬下来
You kiss me tomorrow, I'll bite your face off!

327
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,060
再见
Ciao.

328
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,810
我为你出头  你却骗了我
Well, I stood up for you, and you lied to me.

329
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,130
骗子
You liar!

330
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,060
这叫智取  亲爱的  
It's called a hustle, Sweetheart.

331
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,550
我可不是骗子  他才是
And I'm not the liar. He is.

332
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,720
好了  狡猾的尼克  你被捕了
All right, Slick-Nick. You're under arrest.

333
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,140
真的吗  为什么
Really? For what?

334
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,790
我也不清楚  无证经营食品吗
Gee, I don't know. How about selling food without a permit?

335
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,070
跨区运输未申报商品
Transporting undeclared commerce across borough lines?

336
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:11,000
-虚假广告  -许可证  商品申报凭证
- False advertizing. - Permit. Receipt of declared commerce.

337
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,570
我没做虚假广告  再会
And I didn't falsely advertize anything. Take care.

338
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,950
你跟老鼠说冰棒棍是红木的
You told that mouse the Pawpsicle sticks were redwood!

339
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,620
是啊  红色的木头  简称就是
That's right. Red wood. With a space in the middle.

340
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,950
红木
Wood that is red.

341
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,070
你动不了我的  萝卜头
You can't touch me, Carrots.

342
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,030
我从小就开始这么干了
I've been doing this since I was born.

343
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,300
不许再叫我萝卜头
You're gonna wanna refrain from calling me Carrots.

344
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
我的错  我只是觉得你
My bad. I just naturally assumed you came...

345
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,430
肯定是从遍地胡萝卜的屯里来的吧
from some little carrot-choked Podunk. No?

346
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,380
不不
Uh, no.

347
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,150
鹿溪才是屯  我在兔窝镇长大
Podunk is in Deerbrooke county and I grew up in Bunnyburrow.

348
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,380
来听听这个故事你熟不熟
Okay. Tell me if this story sounds familiar.

349
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,310
天真的小山妞成绩好  有理想
Naive little hick with good grades and big ideas

350
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:43,140
就觉得  我得去动物城
decides "Hey, look at me, I'm gonna move to Zootopia...

351
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,550
食肉和食草动物和平相处  还一起唱山歌
where predators and prey live in harmony and sing Kumbaya!"

352
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,820
结果呢  哎呀  他们关系并不好
Only to find, whoopsie, we don't all get along.

353
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,980
做大城市警察的梦想
And that dream of becoming a big city cop,

354
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,930
哎呀呀  成了交通协管
double whoopsie, she's a meter maid.

355
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,670
还有哎呀呀呀
And whoopsie number three-sie,

356
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,980
没人关心她和她的梦想
no one cares about her or her dreams.

357
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,700
梦想很快就破灭了
And soon enough those dreams die,

358
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,020
然后身体和精神都消沉下去
and our bunny sinks into emotional and literal squalor

359
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,550
只能住在桥洞里
living in a box under a bridge.

360
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,180
终于发现自己只能选择回家
Till finally she has no choice but to go back home

361
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,200
夹着自己那条
with that cute fuzzy wuzzy

362
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,480
毛茸茸的小尾巴  变成了
little tail between her legs to become...

363
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,450
你是兔窝镇的  对吧
You're from Bunnyburrow, is that what you said?

364
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,230
种胡萝卜的农民
So how about a carrot farmer?

365
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,900
听着不错吧
That sound about right?

366
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,660
小心点  不然就不止是你的梦想被碾碎了
Be careful now, or it won't just be your dreams getting crushed.

367
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,980
没人能告诉我做什么不做什么
No one tells me what I can or can't be.

368
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,350
尤其是个没胆量的混球
Especially not some jerk who never had the guts to

369
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:32,760
只知道智取爪子冰棍
try to be anything more than a Pawpsicle hustler.

370
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,720
好了
All right, look.

371
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,000
大家来到动物城
Everyone comes to Zootopia

372
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,390
觉得能成就无限可能
thinking they can be anything they want.

373
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,720
其实不行  你只能成为自己
Well, you can't. You can only be what you are.

374
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,720
狐狸狡猾  兔子蠢
Sly fox. Dumb bunny.

375
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,180
我不蠢
I'm not a dumb bunny.

376
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,370
好吧  这也不是湿水泥
Right. And that's not wet cement.

377
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,460
你做不了真正的警察的
You'll never be a real cop.

378
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,180
做交通协管倒是挺不错
You're a cute meter maid, though.

379
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,500
没准能做督察员呢  加油
Maybe a supervisor one day. Hang in there.

380
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,030
{\an8}爸爸妈妈

381
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,780
{\an8}一人份胡萝卜

382
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:56,810
-爸爸妈妈  -看她  亲爱的
- Oh, hey, it's my parents! - Oh, there she is! Hi, Sweetheart!

383
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,270
你好啊  厉害的朱迪  
Hey there, Jude the Dude.

384
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,240
第一天做警察怎么样
How was your first day on the force?

385
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,840
-可棒了  -跟想的一样吗
- It was real great! - Yeah? Everything you ever hoped?

386
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,530
当然了  还有呢  
Absolutely. And more.

387
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:09,360
大家都可好了  我觉得
Everyone's so nice, and I feel like...

388
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,260
自己真的有点成就
I'm really making a difference.

389
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,040
等等  天哪  邦妮
Wait a second. Holy cranks, Bonnie.

390
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,410
-看看  -我的天哪
- Look at that! - Oh, my sweet heaven!

391
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,060
朱迪  你是交通协管吗
Judy, are you a meter maid?

392
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,950
这个  只是暂时的
Oh, this.. No! Oh, no. This is just a temporary thing..

393
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,990
-警局最安全的工作  -她不是真警察
- It's the safest job on the force! - She's not a real cop!

394
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,970
-祈祷终于有回音了  -赞美主
- Our prayers have been answered! - Glorious day!

395
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,280
交通协管  交通协管  交通协管
Ho-ho, meter maid, meter maid, meter maid!

396
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,470
-爸爸  爸爸  -交通协管
- Dad! Dad! - Meter maid!

397
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,500
今天很漫长了  我得
You know what, it's been a really long day, I should...

398
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,190
-你休息吧  -好好协管交通去吧
- You get some rest. - Those meters aren't gonna maid themselves.

399
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,640
-再见  -再见
- Bye-bye. - Bye-bye.

400
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,350
兔子  快关了那丧气的歌
Hey, bunny! Turn down that depressing music!

401
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,640
别烦交通协管  没听她说话吗
Leave the meter maid alone, didn't you hear her conversation?

402
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,840
-她觉得自己是废物  -闭嘴
- She feels like a failure! - Oh, shut up!

403
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,390
-你闭嘴  -你闭嘴
- You shut up! - You shut up!

404
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,930
-你闭嘴  -明天又是新的一天
- You shut up! - Tomorrow is another day.

405
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,330
是啊  还可能更糟呢
Yeah, but it might be worse!

406
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,780
我才超了30秒
I was 30 seconds over!

407
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,390
你真厉害  姑娘

539
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,180
丢了一个毛绒玩具
there's a toy store missing its stuffed animal,

540
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,330
所以你赶紧回盒子里待着吧
so why don't you get back to your box?

541
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,620
好吧  看来你是敬酒不吃吃罚酒
Fine. Then we'll have to do this the hard way.

542
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,290
你把我的婴儿车锁住了吗
Did you just boot my stroller?

543
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:44,100
尼古拉斯·王尔德  你被捕了
Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest.

544
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,260
理由呢  伤害你的感情吗
For what? Hurting your feelings?

545
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,800
偷税漏税
Felony tax evasion.

546
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:52,150
从你12岁开始  每年365天  
Yeah.. 200 dollars a day, 365 days a year,

547
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,920
每天200块
since you were 12...

548
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,430
一共是20年  所以乘以20  
that's two decades, so times twenty,

549
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:58,340
也就是146万  应该没错吧
which is 1,460,000, I think.

550
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,360
虽然我只是只蠢兔子  
I mean, I am just a dumb bunny,

551
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,900
不过我们很会算数[繁殖]
but we are good at multiplying.

552
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,510
总而言之  在你的税务报表上
Anyway, according to your tax forms,

553
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,830
你申报了  让我看看  零元的税
you reported, let me see here, zero!

554
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,230
倒霉的是  
Unfortunately,

555
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:11,160
税收表格上作假是重罪
lying on a federal form is a punishable offense.

556
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,500
-要判刑5年  -空口无凭
- 5 years jail time. - Well, it's my word against yours.

557
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,930
小家伙  从我12岁起
200 bucks a day, fluff,

558
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,050
每年365天  每天200块
365 days a year, since I was twelve.

559
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,890
其实呢  我都录下来了
Actually it's your word against yours.

560
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,580
如果你想要这支笔  你就得帮我找到
And if you want this pen you're going to help me

561
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,820
这只失踪的水獭  不然的话
find this poor missing otter, or the only place

562
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,030
你就只能在监狱的食堂里卖冰棒了
you'll be selling Pawpsicles is the prison cafeteria.

563
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,170
这叫智取  亲爱的
It's called a hustle, sweet heart.

564
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,530
她把你给耍了
She hustled you.

565
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,840
好个智取
She hustled you good!

566
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,810
你现在是警察了  尼克
You're a cop now, Nick.

567
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,630
给你张贴纸  你会用得上的
You're gonna need one of these.

568
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,070
祝你和小毛球合作愉快
Have fun working with the fuzz!

569
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,110
开始交代吧
Start talking.

570
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,860
我不知道他在哪  我只看到他往哪去了
I don't know where he is, I only saw where he went.

571
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,910
棒极了  走吧
Great, let's go!

572
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:02,730
那地方可不适合可爱的小兔兔
It's not exactly a place for a cute little bunny.

573
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,080
-不许说我可爱  上车  -好吧  你说了算
- Don't call me cute, get in the car. - Okay. You're the boss.

574
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,200
你好
Hi. Hello?

575
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,550
我是  你好
I'm... Hello?

576
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,020
你好  你好
Hello? Hello?

577
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,320
你好  我是
Hello! My name is...

578
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:41,490
我现在就得打断你
You know, I'm gonna hit the pause button right there.

579
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:44,290
因为我们不需要兔子童子军曲奇饼了
Cause we're all good on bunny scout cookies.

580
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,220
不
Uh, no.

581
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,740
我是动物城警局的霍普斯警官  
I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.

582
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,600
我在寻找一只失踪的哺乳动物
I'm looking for a missing mammal...

583
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,790
艾米特·水獭顿  就是这位
Emmitt Otterton. Right here.

584
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,910
他曾经是这里的常客
He may have frequented this establishment?

585
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,780
没错  老艾米特
Yeah, old Emmitt!

586
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,000
好几周没见到他了
Haven't seen him in a couple of weeks.

587
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,480
但是  你应该找他的瑜伽教练谈谈
But hey, you should talk to his yoga instructor.

588
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,080
我很乐意带你们到后面去
I'd be happy to take you back.

589
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,000
非常感谢
Oh, thank you so much,

590
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,180
真是非常非常感谢你  这真是
I'd appericiate that more than you can imagine, it'd be such...

591
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,950
你没穿衣服  
Oh! You are naked..

592
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,010
当然  我们这里是自然主义俱乐部
Oh, for sure. We're a naturalist club!

593
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,470
没错  在动物城谁都能成就无限可能
Yeah. In Zootopia anyone can be anything.

594
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,950
这些人  他们就喜欢光着
These guys, they be naked.

595
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:27,620
南吉就在欢乐池的另一边
Nangi's just on the other side of the Pleasure Pool.

596
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,680
天啊  这里让你觉得别扭吗
Oh boy. Does this make you uncomfortable?

597
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,980
因为你要是觉得别扭的话  现在放弃还不丢人
Because if so, there's no shame in calling it quits.

598
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,170
很丢人
Yes, there is.

599
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,120
这才像话
Boy, that's the spirit.

600
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,850
没错  有些哺乳动物认为自然主义很奇怪
Yeah, some mammals say the naturalist life is weird.

601
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:52,120
可你知道什么才是奇怪吗
But you know what I say is weird?

602
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,990
动物穿衣服才奇怪呢  找到她了
Clothes on animals! Here we go!

603
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,570
你们也看到了  南吉是头大象
As you can see, Nangi is an elephant,

604
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,300
所以她一定会记得所有细节
so she'll totally remember everything.

605
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,630
南吉
Hey, Nangi.

606
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,250
他们要问你几个水獭艾米特的问题
These dudes have some questions about Emmitt the otter.

607
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,150
谁
Who?

608
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,660
艾米特·水獭顿
Emmitt Otterton.

609
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,760
他上你的瑜伽课上了六年了
Been coming to your yoga class for like six years.

610
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,420
我不记得这只河狸
I have no memory of this beaver.

611
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,190
其实他是只水獭
He's an otter, actually.

612
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,560
他几周前的周三来过  记得吗
He was here a couple of Wednesdays ago. Remember?

613
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,070
不记得
No.

614
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,610
他穿了一件绿色的针织毛衣背心
Yeah, he was wearing a green cable knit sweater vest,

615
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,350
还有一条新买的夸特卫宽松裤
and a new pair of Quarterway slacks.

616
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:27,550
还系了条佩斯利花纹领带  漂亮的温莎结
Oh, and a Paisley tie, sweet Windsor knot.

617
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,480
-可帅了  记得吗  南吉  -不记得
- Real tight. Remember that, Nangi? - No.

618
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,070
没错  咱们俩一块送他出去的
Yeah, and we both walked him out,

619
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,750
然后他上了一辆银边的白色旧车
and he got into this big old white car with a silver trim.

620
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,070
那车该送修了
Needed a tune up.

621
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,130
第三个汽缸都不打火了  记得吗  南吉
The third cylinder wasn't firing. Remember that, Nangi?

622
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,060
不记得
No.

623
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,190
你不会恰好记得车牌号码吧
You didn't happen to catch the licence plate number?

624
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,100
-记得吗  -当然  
- Did you? - Oh, for sure.

625
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:52,030
车牌是29THD03
It was 2-9-T-H-D-0-3.

626
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,600
03  你提供了很多有用的信息  谢谢
0-3. Wow, this is a lot of great info. Thank you.

627
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,180
我就说南吉的记忆力好的很嘛
Told you Nangi has a mind like a steel trap.

628
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:01,140
真希望我也能有大象这么好的记忆力
I wish I had a memory like an elephant.

629
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,110
{\an8}迷泉绿洲

630
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,970
我玩的很开心  你就不用谢我了
Well, I had a ball. You are welcome for the clue.

631
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,910
既然傻瓜都能查到车牌号码
And seeing as any moron can run a plate,

632
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:12,260
那么我就拿上笔跟你道别了
I will take that pen and bid you adieu.

633
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:14,660
车牌号  我查不了车牌号
The plate. I can't run a plate.

634
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,650
我还进不了电脑系统
I'm not in the system yet.

635
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:20,420
-请把笔给我  -你刚才说什么
- Give me the pen, please. - What was it you said?

636
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,640
傻瓜都能查车牌号
Any moron can run a plate?

637
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,470
要是这里有个傻瓜
Gosh, if only there were a moron around

638
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,050
能干这件事就好了
who were up to the task.

639
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,750
兔子  我已经照你说的做了
Rabbit, I did what you asked.

640
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,670
你不能永远抓着我不放
You can't keep me on the hook forever.

641
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,790
不会永远的  
Not forever.

642
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:35,010
我只剩36个小时来破案了
Well, I only have 36 hours left to solve this case.

643
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,460
你到底能不能查车牌号
So can you run the plate or not?

644
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:43,600
我刚想起来  我有个朋友在车管所工作
Actually, I just remembered, I have a pal at the DMV.

645
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:45,700
{\an8}车管所

646
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,730
闪电是这里最快的人
Flash is the fastest guy in there.

647
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,320
你要办事  找他就对了
You need something done, he's on it.

648
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:47,840
希望如此
I hope so.

649
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,200
我们的时间真的很紧  每一分钟都很重要
We are really fighting the clock and every minute counts.

650
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,950
等等  他们全都是树獭吗
Wait. They're all sloths?

651
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:25,180
你说会很快的
You said this was going to be quick!

652
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,710
怎么  就因为他是树獭
What, are you saying just because he's a sloth

653
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,470
他就快不起来吗  
he can't be fast?

654
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:30,950
不是谁都能成就无限可能吗
I thought in Zootopia anyone could be anything.

655
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,960
闪电  闪电  数你最快  
Flash, Flash, Hundred Yard Dash!

656
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,400
哥们  见到你真高兴
Buddy, it's nice to see you.

657
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:41,770
我也  很高兴  见到你
Nice to... see you... too.

658
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:44,080
闪电  给你介绍一下我的朋友
Hey, Flash, I'd love you to meet my friend.

659
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,260
亲爱的  我忘了你叫什么名字了
Ah... Darlin, I've forgotten your name.

660
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:49,220
我是朱迪·霍普斯警官  你好吗
Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD. How are you?

661
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:50,990
我
I am...

662
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,320
过得
doing... just..

663
00:41:55,210 --> 00:42:01,170
-挺好  -还  不错
- Fine? - As well..as..I can..be...

664
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,630
-有什么  -坚持住
- What... - Hang in there.

665
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:05,970
-可以  -我希望你可以帮我查一个车牌
- can I...do... - Well, I was hoping you could run a plate...

666
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,380
-帮你  -我希望你可以
- for you... - Well, I was hoping you could...

667
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,360
的吗
...today?

668
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:14,780
我希望你可以帮我们查一个车牌号码
Well, I was hoping you could run a plate for us.

669
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,990
我们真的很着急
We are in a really big hurry.

670
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:23,310
-当然  车牌号码  是  -29T

骆驼为什么会有三个驼峰
What do you call a three-humped camel?

我敢说你没有搜索令吧
And I will betcha you don't have a warrant to get in, hmm?

704
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:42,280
-该死  真是扫兴  -你故意把耽误了我一天
- Darn it. It's a bummer. - You wasted the day on purpose.

705
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,330
女士  我戴着假警徽
Ma'am, I have a fake badge.

706

我绝不会妨碍你假装调查的

这不是假装调查
It's not a pretend investigation!

708
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:52,460
看  看到他了吗  这只水獭失踪了
Look, see? See him? This otter is missing.

709
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,170
那他们应该派个真警察去找他
Well, then they should have gotten a real cop to find him.

710
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,460
你什么毛病  看到我失败
What is your problem? Does seeing me fail

711
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:00,640
能让你对自己悲哀的生活感觉好些吗
somehow make you feel better about your own sad, miserable life?

712
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,450
是的  当然了
It does, 100 %.

713
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:06,180
既然你没有搜索令
Now, since you're sans warrant.

714
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,360
那咱们两清了吧
I guess we're done?

715

好吧  两清了  给你笔
Fine. We are done. Here's your pen.

716
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,170
首先  你丢东西的动作真像兔子
First off, you throw like a bunny.

717
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:23,320
其次  你真是个输不起的家伙
Second, you're a very sore loser.

718
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:26,290
回头见了  毛茸茸警官  可惜都结束了
See you later, Officer Fluff. So sad this is over.

719
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,910
真希望能多帮上你点忙
I wish I could have helped more.

720
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:29,270
问题是
The thing is,

721
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,430
有正经的理由  就不需要搜查令
you don't need a warrant if you have probable cause,

722
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:32,770
我非常确定我见到了
and I'm pretty sure I saw a...

723
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:35,610
一只贼眉鼠眼的家伙翻过了栅栏
shifty lowlife climbing the fence.

北极熊毛

727
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,890
-天啊  -什么  怎么了
- Oh my God! - What? What?

728
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,820
杰里·沃尔的《丝绒烟斗》
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole!

729
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:04,520
但是是CD  现在谁还听CD啊
But on CD. Who still uses CDs?

730
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:14,430
萝卜头  如果水獭在这待过  他肯定非常难受
Carrots, if your otter was here, he had a very bad day.

731
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,550
那些是爪痕
Those are claw marks.

732
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:21,290
你见过这样的情况吗
You ever seen anything like this?

733
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:23,590
-没有  -等下  看
- No. - Oh, wait. Look!

734
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:30,160
是他  艾米特·水獭顿  他肯定来过这儿
This is him. Emmitt Otterton. He was definitely here.

735
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,820
你觉得出了什么事
What do you think happened?

736
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:39,300
不好  等一下  北极熊毛
Oh no, wait a minute. Polar bear fur...

737
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,170
鼠帮音乐  高档杯子
Rat-pack music. Fancy cup.

738
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,600
我知道这是谁的车了  赶快走
I know whose car this is, we gotta go!

739
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,770
什么  是谁的车
What? Whose car is it?

740
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:46,490
冰原镇里最可怕的黑帮老大
The most feared crime boss in Tundratown.

741
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:48,080
他叫大先生
They call him Mr. Big,

742
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,480
他不喜欢我  所以我们快走吧
and he does not like me. So we gotta go!

743
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,300
我不走  这是犯罪现场
I'm not leaving, this is a crime scene.

744
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,740
要是大先生发现我在这儿
Well, it's gonna be an even bigger crime scene...

745
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:54,730
就会变成更惨烈的犯罪现场
if Mr. Big finds me here,

746
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:56,380
马上走
so we're leaving right now.

747
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,870
雷蒙德  那是凯文吧  好久不见
Raymond! And is that Kevin? Long time, no see.

748
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:06,350
提到"不见"  你们就当没见过我行吗
And speaking of no see, how about you forget you saw me?

749
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,890
看在往日的情面上
For old times sake?

750
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,140
不行
That's a no.

751
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:25,560
你做了什么  让大先生这么生气
What did you do that made Mr. Big so mad at you?

752
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:29,290
可能是因为我曾经卖给他一块昂贵的壁毯
I, uh... I may have sold him a very expensive wall rug

753
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:35,300
它是用臭鼬屁股上的毛做的
that was made from the fur of a skunk's butt.

754
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,990
我的天啊
Oh, sweet cheese 'n crackers.

755
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:55,480
-那是大先生吗  -不
- Is that Mr. Big? - No.

756
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:58,880
-那他呢  是他吗  -不是
- What about him? Is that him? - No.

757
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,080
-这回肯定是他  -别说了
- That's gotta be him. - Stop talking.

758
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,670
别说了  别说了
Stop talking. Stop talking!

759
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:17,030
大先生  这只是一次单纯的误会
Mr. Big, sir, this is a simple misunder...

760
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:18,400
好
Yeah.

761
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:23,000
这只是一次单纯的误会而已
This is a simple misunderstanding.

762
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,330
我女儿结婚这天
You come here unannounced

763
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,250
你不请自来
on the day my daughter is to be married.

764
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:30,060
其实  我们是被人强行带到这儿的  所以...
Well, actually, we were brought here against our will, so...

765
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,990
关键是  我之前不知道那是您的车
Point is, I did not know that it was your car,

766
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:36,430
我也不知道您女儿要结婚
and I certainly did not know about your daughter's wedding!

767
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:39,650
我信任过你  尼克
I trusted you, Nicky.

768
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,850
我邀请你来我家
I welcomed you into my home.

769
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,510
我们还共进晚餐
We broke bread together.

770
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:46,150
奶奶给你做了奶油煎饼卷
Grandmama made you a cannoli.

771
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,830
结果你怎么报答我的好意的
And how did you repay my generosity?

772
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:52,960
拿一块臭鼬屁股毛做的毯子报答我
With a rug made from the butt of a skunk.

773
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:54,800
臭鼬屁股毛皮做的毯子
A skunk-butt rug.

774
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,770
你不尊重我
You disrespected me.

775
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,010
你不尊重我奶奶
You disrespected my grandmama,

776
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,920
我用那块臭鼬屁股毛皮毯子埋葬了她
who I buried in that skunk-butt rug.

777
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,610
我告诉过你  不准再到这儿来了
I told you never to show your face here again,

778
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:06,920
但你还是来了
but here you are.

779
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:08,820
贼眉鼠眼地  跟这个
Snooping around with this...

780
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,580
你是干什么的  演员吗  穿成那样干什么
What are you? A performer? What's with the costume?

781
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,640
-先生  我是警... -哑剧演员
- Sir, I am a co... - Mime!

782
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,780
她是哑剧演员  哑剧演员不能说话
She's a mime. This mime can not speak.

783
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,240
-你是哑剧演员  你不能说话  -不  我是警察
- You can't speak if you're a mime. - No, I am a cop.

784
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,080
我在查艾米特·水獭顿案
And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case.

785
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,700
线索指向了你的车
And my evidence puts him in your car!

786
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,460
随便你怎么威胁我
So intimidate me all you want,

787
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,550
就算这是我这辈子做的最后一件事
I'm going to find out what you did to that otter

788
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:31,110
我也要查出你把水獭怎么样了
if it's the last thing I do.

789
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,800
那我就只剩一个请求了
Then I have only one request.

790
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:38,880
帮我跟奶奶问好
Say hello to Grandmama.

791
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:39,810
做了他们
Ice 'em!

792
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,070
不不不  我什么也没看见  我绝不说出去
No, no, no. I didn't see nothing! I'm not saying nothing!

793
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:44,030
你也不会说出去了
And you never will.

794
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:46,160
求求你  别别别
Please! No, no, no, no!

795
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,500
你要是因为毯子生我的气  我还有更多毯子
If you're mad at me about the rug, I've got more rugs!

796
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,640
爸爸  我们该跳舞了
Daddy! It's time for our dance!

797
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,780
我们不是说好了吗  婚礼上不能做掉谁
What did we say? No icing anyone at my wedding!

798
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:00,710
我不得不这么做  宝贝  爸爸也无奈
I have to, baby, daddy has to.

799
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:02,420
-做掉他们  -不不不
- Ice 'em. - No, no, no!

800
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,020
等下  等下
Wait, wait!

801
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,970
她就是昨天从巨型甜甜圈下
She's the bunny that saved my life yesterday!

802
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,860
救了我一命的兔子
From that giant donut!

803
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:11,700
-这只兔子吗  -对  你好
- This bunny? - Yeah. Hi!

804
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,850
-你好  我喜欢你的裙子  -谢谢
- Hi. I love your dress. - Thank you.

805
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:17,660
放下他们
Put them down.

806
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,730
你帮了我大忙  
You've done me a great service.

807
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:24,840
我会帮你找到水獭
I will help you find the otter.

808
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:29,250
我感谢你的善良  我要报答你
I will take your kindness, and pay it forward.

809
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:02,470
水獭顿是我的花匠  他就像家人一样
Otterton is my florist. He's like a part of the family.

810
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,890
他说有要事想商量
He had something important he wanted to discuss.

811
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,900
所以我派那辆车去接他
That's why I sent that car to pick him up.

812
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:11,260
但他没能到这儿来
But he never arrived.

813
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:13,360
因为他受到了袭击
Because he was attacked.

814
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:16,240
不  是他袭击别人
No, he attacked.

815
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:17,600
水獭顿吗
Otterton?

816
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:18,720
就是水獭顿
Otterton.

817
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:22,370
他发疯了  在车里闹了个底朝天
He went crazy. Ripped up the car.

818
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:25,010
把我的司机吓得半死
Scared my driver half to death.

819
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:27,320
然后消失在夜色中
And disappeared into the night.

820
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,150
可他是一只可爱的水獭
But he's a sweet little otter.

821
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,040
孩子  就算我们进化了
My child, we may be evolved,

822
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:38,720
内心深处也还是动物
but deep down we are still animals.

823
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,100
你想找到水獭顿  就去跟司机谈谈
You wanna find Otterton, talk to the driver of the car.

824
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:48,300
他叫曼查斯  住在热带雨林区
His name is Manchas. Lives in the Rainforest District.

825
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,650
只有他能告诉你更多消息
Only he can tell you more.

826
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:56,370
曼查斯先生
Mr. Manchas?

827
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,720
我是警局的朱迪·霍普斯
Judy Hopps, ZPD.

828
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:02,180
我们想知道艾米特·水獭顿遭遇了什么
We just wanna know what happened to Emmitt Otterton.

829
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:12,420
你应该问我遭遇了什么
You should be asking what happened to me.

830
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:17,820
-这是一只小水獭干的  -发生什么了
- A teensy otter did that? - What happened?

831
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,050
他兽性大发
He was an animal.

832
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:24,560
四爪并用
Down on all fours.

833
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,580
他就是只野兽
He was a savage!

834
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,310
毫无预兆
There was no warning.

835
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:44,330
他一直喊着午夜嚎叫
He just kept yelling about the Night Howlers.

836
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:47,450
一遍又一遍地喊午夜嚎叫
Over and over, the Night Howlers!

837
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:51,060
你也知道午夜嚎叫
So you know about the Night Howlers too?

838
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:54,820
很好  因为我们来这儿
Good, good. Because the Night Howlers are exactly

839
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:58,060
就是想跟你谈谈午夜嚎叫  是不是
what we are here to talk about. Right?

840
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:02,860
对  麻烦你开门  告诉我们你知道什么
Yep, so you just open the door and tell us what you know,

841
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:04,890
我们也把我们知道的告诉你
and we will tell you what we know.

842
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:05,960
好不好
Okay?

843
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:08,370
好吧
Okay.

844
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:11,740
聪明的狐狸
Clever fox.

845
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,280
曼查斯先生
Mr. Manchas?

846
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,860
你没事吧
Are you okay?

847
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:30,070
跑  快跑
Run. Run!

848
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:37,490
-他怎么了  -我不知道
- What is wrong with him?! - I don't know!

849
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,580
跳
Jump!

850
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,250
快跑
Come on!

851
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,210
低头
Head down!

852
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,940
霍普斯警官呼叫
Officer Hopps to dispatch!

853
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,010
你知道夏奇羚吗
Are you familiar with Gazelle?

854
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:00,190
我们时代最伟大的歌手  长角的天使
Greatest singer of our lifetime. Angel with horns.

855
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,110
接着看  继续看
Okay, hold on. Keep watching.

856
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,450
看她旁边那是谁  是谁
Who's that beside her? Who is it?

857
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:07,750
你跳得真棒  本杰明·爪豪斯
Wow,You are one hot dancer, Benjamin Clawhauser.

858
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,260
是我  你觉得像真的吗  看起来好真
It's me! Did you think it was real? It looks so real!

859
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,980
其实不是  只是个新应用而已
It's not, it's just a new app.

860
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,390
-等一下  -爪豪斯
- Hold on a second. - Clawhauser!

861
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:17,390
爪豪斯  听我说
Clawhauser, listen to me.

862
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:20,270
有危险  美洲豹兽性大发
We have a 10-91! Jaguar gone savage!

863
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:23,280
-藤蔓和图军加街口  -是图洪加
- Vine and Tujunga!  - It's Tuhunga!

864
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,490
好的  我们马上派后援
Okay, we're sending backup!

865
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:26,980
霍普斯  霍普斯
Hopps, Hopps!

866
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:31,140
看  那边  往缆车那儿跑
Look, over there! Head for the sky-trams!

867
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:43,360
进去  萝卜头  萝卜头
Get in. Carrots? Carrots!

868
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,340
快跑
Go!

869
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:51,350
哥们  咱食肉动物说句心里话
Buddy, one predator to another.

870
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,950
我能看出你有点紧张
Now I can tell you're a little tense,

871
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:59,570
我就先给你留点私人空间
so I'm just gonna give you a little personal space!

872
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,340
兔子  不管你干什么  都别松手
Rabbit, whatever you do, do not let go!

873
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,580
-我要松手了  -你要干什么
- I'm gonna let go! - You're gonna to what?

874
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,850
一  二
One, two...

875
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:15,160
兔子
Rabbit!

876
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,420
萝卜头  你救了我的命
Carrots, you saved my life.

877
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,580
我们警局就是干这个的
Well, that's what we do at the ZPD...

878
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,100
这下可好
Well, this should be good.

879
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:48,060
我以为只是一起哺乳动物失踪案
I thought this was just a missing mammal case,

880
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,340
可其实要复杂得多
but it's way bigger.

881
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,970
水獭顿先生不仅仅是失踪了
Mr. Otterton did not just disappear.

882
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,830
我认为他和这只美洲豹  他们
I believe he and this jaguar, they...

883
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,220
他们兽性大发了  长官
They went savage, sir.

884
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,970
兽性大发  这不是石器时代了  霍普斯
Savage? This isn't the stone age, Hopps.

885
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,930
动物们不会兽性大发
Animals don't go savage.

886
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:02,560
我之前也这么想
I thought so too.

887
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,400
但我看到了这个
Till I saw this.

888
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,370
什么
What?

889
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:09,160
他明明就在这儿
He was right here!

890
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,050
野蛮的美洲豹
The savage jaguar?

891
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,810
长官  我知道自己看到了什么  他差点杀了我们
Sir, I know what I saw. He almost killed us!

892
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:16,870
或者在兔子眼里  
Or maybe any aggressive predator

893
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:19,370
肉食动物有攻击性就算兽性大发
looks savage to rabbits?

894
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:20,660
走吧
Let's go!

895
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:21,610
等等  长官
Wait! Sir!

896
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,400
不只有我看见了他
I'm not the only one who saw him.

897
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:24,440
尼克
Nick.

898
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:27,840
你觉得我会相信一只狐狸
You think I'm gonna believe a fox?

899
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,420
他是关键目击证人  我...
Well, he was a key witness, and I...

900
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:33,770
两天时间找到水獭  不然你就辞职
Two days to find the otter, or you quit.

901
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,640
我们说好的
That was the deal.

902
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,730
警徽
Badge.

903
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,280
-但是长官  我们  -警徽
- But, sir, we had... - Badge!

904
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,730
不行
Uh, no.

905
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:54,470
你说什么  狐狸  
What did you say, fox?

906
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:57,900
抱歉  我说"不行"
Sorry, what I said was "No...".

907
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,360
她不必给你警徽
She will not be giving you that badge.

908
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:05,040
你给她一件小丑背心和一辆可笑的三轮车
Look, you gave her a clown vest, and a three-wheeled joke-mobile,

909
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,260
给她两天时间
and two days to solve a case

910
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:08,840
让她破你们两周都没破的案子
you guys haven't cracked in two weeks?

911
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,770
难怪她会找狐狸帮忙
Yeah, it's no wonder she needed to get help from a fox.

912
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:14,110
因为你们谁也不打算帮她  是不是
None of you guys were gonna help her, were you?

913
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:15,500
这样  老大
Here's the thing, chief.

914
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,170
你给她48小时  所以严格来说我们还剩下
You gave her the 48 hours, so technically we still have...

915
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:21,470
10小时找到水獭顿先生
ten left to find our Mr. Otterton.

916
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,270
而且我们肯定会找到他的
And that's exactly what we're gonna do.

917
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:24,790
失陪了
So if you'll excuse us,

918
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:28,590
我们要追查重大线索  还有案子要破
we have a very big lead to follow and a case to crack.

919
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:29,870
再见
Good day.

920
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,560
霍普斯警官
Officer Hopps.

921
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:00,770
谢谢
Thank you.

922
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:04,700
别让他们知道自己能影响到你
Never let them see that they get to you.

923
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:07,120
这么说...
So...

924
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:09,860
有人影响过你
Things do get to you?

925
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:11,760
现在不会了
I mean not, not anymore.

926
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,590
但我曾像你一样弱小  
But I was small and emotionally unbalanced

927
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:16,780
情绪失控
like you once.

928
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:19,090
-是吗  -不  真的
- Har har. - No, it's true.

929
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:23,320
我当时大概八九岁
I think I was 8, or maybe 9...

930
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,390
我一心想
And all I wanted to do

931
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:28,690
加入童子军
was join the Junior Ranger Scouts.

932
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:31,300
所以我妈妈设法凑够了钱
So my mom scaped together enough money

933
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,660
给我买了一身崭新的制服
to buy me a brand new uniform.

934
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:36,720
因为我一定要融入进去
Because, by god, I was gonna fit in.

935
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:39,870
{\an8}动物城  少年童子军

936
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,030
哪怕我是队里唯一的食肉动物  唯一一只狐狸
Even if I was the only predator in the troop, the only fox.

937
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:41,840
尼克
Hey, Nick.

938
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,860
我要成为童子军中的一员
I was gonna be part of a pack.

939
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:47,670
-准备好加入了吗  -当然  生来就准备好了
- Ready for initiation? - Yeah. Pretty much born ready.

940
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,520
我太骄傲了
I was so proud.

941
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:56,030
举起你的右爪  宣读誓言
Okay. Now raise your right paw, and deliver the oath.

942
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:59,310
我  尼古拉斯·王尔德  在此起誓
I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave,

943
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:03,170
我将勇敢忠诚  热心可靠
loyal, helpful and trustworthy.

944
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:06,030
即使你是只狐狸吗
Even though you're a fox?

945
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,140
什么
What?

946
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,610
不  我做错什么了  各位
No, no! What did I do wrong, you guys?

947
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:16,800
拜托  我做错了什么了  我干什么了
No, please! What did I do wrong? What did I do?

948
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:21,350
你以为我们会相信一只不戴口套的狐狸
If you thought we would ever trust a fox without a muzzle?

949
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,570
你比你外表的样子还蠢
You're even dumber than you look.

950
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:27,890
他是要哭了吗
Is he gonna cry?

951
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,760
那天我学到了两件事
I learned two things that day.

952
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:51,300
我绝不让别人知道他们影响到了我
One,I was never gonna let anyone see that they got to me.

953
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,450
还有一个呢
And two?

954
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,890
如果整个世界
If the world's only gonna

955
00:59:56,890 --> 01:00:00,500
都觉得狐狸奸诈狡猾
see a fox as shifty and untrustworthy...

956
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:03,280
那我也没必要变成别的样子了
There's no point in trying to be anything else.

957
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:07,780
尼克  你不是这样的人
Nick, you are so much more than that.

958
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:13,290
天哪  瞧瞧下面堵成什么样了
Boy, look at that traffic down there.

959
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:15,630
问问交通局的查克怎么样
How about we go up to Chuck in traffic central?

960
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:17,920
查克  道路监控显示情况如何
Chuck, how are things looking on the jam cams?

961
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,990
尼克  我很高兴你告诉了我
Nick, I'm glad you told me.

962
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:22,790
道路监控
The jam cams...

963
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:25,720
-真的  你不用岔开话题的  -不不不
- Seriously, it's okay. - No, no no!

964
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:30,320
整个天篷到处都是道路监控摄像头
There are traffic cameras everywhere. All over the canopy!

965
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,210
不管那只豹子去了哪
Whatever happened to that jaguar...

966
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:33,560
道路监控都应该拍得到
The traffic cameras would have caught it!

967
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,980
-棒  -哈哈  很狡猾哎  小狐狸
- Bingo! - Ho-ho! Pretty sneaky, slick!

968
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:39,960
但是  你之前都没法查车牌
However, if you didn't have access to the system before,

969
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,760
恐怕现在牛脾气局长也不会给你查
I doubt chief Buffalo Butt is gonna let you into it now.

970
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,040
确实  但我市政厅的有个朋友也许可以
No. But I have a friend at City Hall who might.

971
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,360
先生  能请您看一下这些重要的账单吗
Sir, if we could just review these very important billings.

972
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,600
先生  抱歉  先生
Sir! Oh, I'm sorry. Sir.

973
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,450
好了  我听到了  头羊
Okay! I heard you, Bellwether,

974
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:58,370
你处理就行了
just take care of it!

975
01:00:58,510 --> 01:01:00,960
谢谢  取消我下午的事  我要出去
Please. And clear my afternoon, I'm going out.

976
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:01,570
但是  先生
Oh, no, no.

977
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:05,260
你还约了动物评级公司呢  先生  有点
But, sir, you do have a meeting with Herds and Gradings. Sir, that's just, oh...

978
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,850
我要死了
Oh, mutton chops.

979
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:13,530
头羊市长助理  我们需要你的帮助
Assistant Mayor Bellwether, we need your help.

980
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:16,400
{\an8}市长助理办公室
Office of the assistant mayor

981
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:17,570
我们只想看看道路监控录像
we just need to get into the traffic cam database.

982
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,860
毛茸茸的呢
So fluffy!

983
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,860
绵羊从来不让我靠这么近的
Sheep never let me get this close!

984
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,540
你不能随便摸人家的毛
You can't just touch a sheep's wool!

985
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:33,440
-像棉花糖一样  -住手
- It's like cotton candy. - Stop it!

986
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,690
哪里的
Where to?

987
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:37,910
雨林区  藤蔓和图洪加街口
Rainforest Dsitrict. Vine and Tujunga.

988
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:39,890
就是那  全市的道路监控
There. Traffic cams for the whole city.

989
01:01:38,290 --> 01:01:40,790
{\an8}动物城交通网络

990
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:42,660
这其实蛮刺激的
This is so exiting actually. I mean, well, you know.

991
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:44,530
我还从来没干过这么重要的事呢
I never get to do anything this important.

992
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:47,100
但你可是动物城的市长助理啊
But you're the assistant mayor of Zootopia.

993
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:49,470
其实就是个名头响亮点的秘书而已
I'm more of a glorified secretary.

994
01:01:49,570 --> 01:01:52,180
我觉得狮心市长只是为了拉来绵羊的选票
I think Mayor Lionheart just wanted the sheep vote.

995
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:54,030
但他给了我那个漂亮的咖啡杯呢
But he did give me that nice mug.

996
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,650
{\an8}世界最棒的市长助理(爸爸)

997
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:57,620
被表扬的感觉还是很好的
Feels good to be appreciated.

998
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:59,030
臭羊
Smellwether!

999
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:01,890
就是他给我起的一个有趣外号
That's a fun little name he likes to use.

1000
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:05,310
我叫过他一次狮屁  他一点都不开心
I called him Lionfart once, he did not care for that.

1001
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:06,640
跟你说  那天我可倒了大霉
Let me tell you, it was not a good day for me.

1002
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,010
-是  先生  -我不是说要取消下午的事吗
- Yes, sir. - I thought you were gonna cancel my afternoon.

1003
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:12,570
天哪  我得走了  找到什么告诉我
Oh, dear. I better go. Let me know what you find.

1004
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:15,060
真的很感谢你们能
It was really nice for me to be...

1005
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:17,130
韶华易逝  臭羊
While we're young, Smellwether.

1006
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:21,140
你觉得她睡觉的时候会数自己吗
You think when she goes to sleep she counts herself?

1007
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:23,270
闭嘴  好的  道路监控
Shush. Okay, traffic cams..

1008
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:34,690
{\an8}动物城交通网络

1009
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:24,880
图洪加  图洪加
Tujunga.... Tujunga....

1010
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,100
找到了
We're in.

1011
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:36,340
-他们是谁呀  -森林狼
- Who are these guys? - Timberwolves.

1012
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,520
瞧瞧这些白痴
Look at these dum-dums.

1013
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:44,610
赌一毛钱他们要嚎叫了
Bet you a nickel one of them's gonna howl.

1014
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:46,080
你看吧
And there it is.

1015
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:49,540
你就说狼为什么非要嚎叫呢
I mean, what is it with wolves and the howling, it's...?

1016
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:51,500
狼嚎  午夜嚎叫
Howlings! Night Howlers!

1017
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,040
曼查斯怕的就是这个
That's what Manchas was afraid of,

1018
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,570
狼群  午夜嚎叫指的就是狼群
wolves! The wolves are the Night Howlers!

1019
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:56,520
如果曼查斯是他们带走的
If they took Manchas...

1020
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,390
带走水獭顿的也是他们
I bet they took Otterton too.

1021
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:00,360
只要找到他们去了哪就可以了
All we gotta do is find out where they went.

1022
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:05,090
{\an8}冰原镇

1023
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:08,190
{\an8}热带雨林区

1024
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:09,170
等等  他们去哪了
Wait, where'd they go?

1025
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:09,610
要是我
You know,

1026
01:03:09,610 --> 01:03:13,250
干了违法的事要躲监控摄像头
if I wanted to avoid surveillance because I was doing something illegal,

1027
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:16,460
当然我没干过这种事  我会走6B通道
which I never have, I would use the maintenance tunnel 6B.

1028
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:17,700
{\an8}维修通道

1029
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,600
也就是说他们在  这里
Which would put them out... right there.

1030
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:23,380
瞧瞧你  小侦探
Well, look at you, junior detective.

1031
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,370
我觉得你当警察肯定很厉害
You know, I think you'd actually make a pretty good cop.

1032
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:29,740
你好大胆子
How dare you.

1033
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,930
洋槐小巷  榕树地下通道
Acacia Alley. Ficus Underpass.

1034
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:34,150
南部峡谷
South canyon.

1035
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:35,890
他们是要出城
They're heading out of town.

1036
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:37,630
哪条路通往哪里
Where does that road go?

1037
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:42,400
{\an8}崖边精神病院

1038
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:24,410
加里  别叫  你要引得大家都叫起来了
Gary, quit it! You're gonna start a howl!

1039
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:25,780
不是我先叫的
I didn't start it.

1040
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,300
快走
Come on.

1041
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:44,910
你真是只聪明的小兔子
You are a clever bunny.

1042
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:04,230
看来这儿曾经是所医院
It looks like this was a hospital.

1043
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,790
还是你先请  你是警察嘛
You know, after you, you're the cop.

1044
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,800
好的  安全
Okay, all clear.

1045
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:36,870
这里的设备都是新的
All this equipment is brand new.

1046
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:39,310
萝卜头
Carrots.

1047
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,030
爪痕
Claw marks.

1048
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,510
好大好大的爪痕  是什么
Yeah, huge, huge claw marks. What kind of...

1049
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:06,790
曼查斯先生
Mr. Manchas.

1050
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:20,190
是他  找到水獭了
It's him! We found our otter.

1051
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:24,280
水獭顿先生  我是朱迪·霍普斯警官
Mr. Otterton, my name is Officer Judy Hopps.

1052
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,080
是你妻子让我来找你的
Your wife sent me to find you.

1053
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:27,900
我们现在就救你出去
We're gonna get you out of here now.

1054
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:30,090
还是别出来了
Or not.

1055
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:33,050
他好像不是很着急回家见老婆
Guess he's in no rush to get home to the missus.

1056
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,400
11, 12, 13, 14.

1057
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,830
不算曼查斯的话有14个
Not including Manchas, it's... it's fourteen.

1058
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,660
牛局长分配了14个失踪动物案件
Chief Bogo handed out 14 missing mammal files.

1059
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:43,200
他们都在这儿
They're all here...

1060
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,520
所有失踪动物都在这儿
All the missing mammals are right here.

1061
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:53,200
够了
Enough!

1062
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,910
我不要借口  医生  我要的是答案
I don't want excuses, doctor, I want answers.

1063
01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:59,210
狮心市长  拜托  我们已经尽力了
Mayor Lionheart, please. We're doing everything we can.

1064
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:00,280
是吗
Really?

1065
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,310
因为我面前
Cause I got a dozen and a half animals here

1066
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:03,990
堆着一群疯得没形的动物
who've gone off the rails crazy,

1067
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:06,010
而你连原因都不知道
and you can't tell me why.

1068
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:08,690
我觉得这离尽力还差得远了点
Now I'd call that awfully far from doing everything!

1069
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:12,070
先生  也许该从生物学角度考虑一下了
Sir, it may be time to consider their biology.

1070
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,040
什么  什么叫从生物学角度考虑
What? What do you mean "Biology"?

1071
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,870
只有食肉动物才会变兽性大发
The only animals going savage are predators.

1072
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,260
纸包不住火  我们必须告诉大家
We cannot keep it a secret. We need to come forward.

1073
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:22,750
好主意  告诉民众
Hm, great idea. Tell the public.

1074
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:23,850
你觉得他们会
And how do you think they're

1075
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:28,020
怎么想他们的狮子市长
gonna feel about their mayor who is a lion?!

1076
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:30,630
-我就毁了  -那牛局长怎么说
- I'll be ruined! - Well, what does Chief Bogo say?

1077
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:33,180
牛警长还不知道  
Chief Bogo doesn't know.

1078
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:35,900
我们也不会让他知道
And we are going to keep it that way.

1079
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:36,630
{\an8}爸爸妈妈

1080
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:37,670
糟糕
Oh, no!

1081
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:40,750
-有人在这儿  -先生  你得走了  快
- Someone's here. - Sir, you need to go. Now.

1082
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:42,640
保安  清查本区
Security, sweep the area.

1083
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:51,860
真好  这下死定了
Great, we're dead.

1084
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:55,260
死了  结束  我得死你得死  大家都得死
We're dead. That's it. I'm dead. You're dead. Everybody's dead.

1085
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:56,710
-你会游泳吗  -什么
- Can you swim? - What?

1086
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:59,360
会游泳吗  我会  所以呢
Can I swim? Yes, I can swim. Why?

1087
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:22,900
萝卜头  霍普斯  朱迪
Carrots! Hopps! Judy!

1088
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:25,470
我们得告诉牛局长
We gotta tell Bogo!

1089
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:30,350
您的舞跳的真棒  牛局长
Wow, you are one hot dancer, Chief Bogo.

1090
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,950
-牛局长  -我在忙
- Chief Bogo! - Not now.

1091
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:37,080
-等等  是夏奇羚的声音吗  -不是
- Wait, is that Gazelle? - No!

1092
01:08:37,090 --> 01:08:40,470
我是夏奇羚  你的舞跳的真棒
I'm Gazelle, and you are one hot dancer.

1093
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:44,880
你也在玩那个应用吗  警长
You have the app too? Chief!

1094
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,130
爪豪斯  你没看到
Clawhauser! Can't you see

1095
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:48,200
我正在忙失踪动物案件吗
I'm working on the missing mammal cases?

1096
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:49,810
是的  当然  说到那个案子  长官
Yes, of course. About that, sir.

1097
01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:53,110
霍普斯警官来了电话  14个她都找到了
Officer Hopps just called, she found all of them.

1098
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:55,520
好厉害
Wow, I'm impressed.

1099
01:08:58,290 --> 01:08:59,180
狮心市长
Mayor Lionheart,

1100
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:00,800
你有权保持沉默  但你所说的一切
you have the right to remain silent. Anything you...

1101
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,840
你不理解  我是为了保护这个城市
You don't understand, I was trying to protect the city!

1102
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,060
你只想保住你的工作
You were just trying to protect your job.

1103
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:09,380
不  听着  我们还不知道这是怎么回事
No, listen. We still don't know why this is happening.

1104
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:11,340
它会毁了动物城的
It could destroy Zootopia.

1105
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:13,080
你有权保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent.

1106
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,290
你说的每一句话
Anything you say can and

1107
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:16,090
都将成为呈堂证供
will be used against you in a court of law.

1108
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,270
{\an8}警察局

1109
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:23,120
雌性雄性们
Ladies and gentlemammals,

1110
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:27,240
失踪的14名动物现已全数找回
14 mammals went missing and all 14 have been found...

1111
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:31,020
找到他们的是下面这位新景观
by our newest recruit, who will speak to you in a moment.

1112
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:35,470
-我好紧张  -媒体见面快速入门
- I'm so nervous. - Okay, press conference 101.

1113
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:36,460
你想表现的聪明点
You wanna look smart,

1114
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:38,160
就要用自己的问题回答他们的问题
answer their question with your own question

1115
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,130
然后再回答自己的问题
and then answer that question.

1116
01:09:40,330 --> 01:09:42,910
像这样  请问  霍普斯警官
Like this, "Excuse me, Officer Hopps.

1117
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:44,570
这件案子你有什么可以透露的
What can you tell us about the case?"

1118
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:48,760
这案子不简单吗  确实是  懂了吗
"Well, was this a tough case? Yes, yes it was. You see?"

1119
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,330
你应该跟我一起上台
You should be up there with me.

1120
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:52,060
这是我们一起完成的
We did this together.

1121
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:55,480
我是个警察吗  不  我不是
Well, am I a cop? No. No, I am not.

1122
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:57,440
真巧你说到这了
Funny you should say that.

1123
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:00,220
因为  我一直在想
Because, well, I've been thinking.

1124
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:04,790
要是有个搭档就好了
It would be nice to have a partner.

1125
01:10:09,690 --> 01:10:12,520
给你  如果你需要支笔写字
Here. In case you need something to write with.

1126
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:20,280
霍普斯警官  时间到了
Officer Hopps. It's time.

1127
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:26,600
接下来  有请
So now, I'll turn things over to

1128
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,910
解决了本案件的警官
the officer who cracked the case.

1129
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:31,690
朱迪·霍普斯警官
Officer Judy Hopps.

1130
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:37,040
请讲
Yes?

1131
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:38,930
兽性大发的动物您作何评论
What can you tell us about the animals that went savage?

1132
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:43,060
大家都在疑惑的动物
Well, the animals in question.

1133
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:51,440
他们都是不同种类的吗  没错
Are they all different species? Yes. Yes, they are.

1134
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:54,500
好的  那有什么联系呢
Okay, so what is the connection?

1135
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:55,780
我们只知道
All we know is that

1136
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:58,640
他们都是食肉动物
they are all members of the predator family.

1137
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,710
所以兽性大发的只有食肉动物吗
So predators are the only ones going savage?

1138
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:03,850
没错  确实如此  没错
That is accu.. Yes, that is accurate, yes.

1139
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:07,620
-为什么  怎么会出现这样的事  -还不知道
- Why? Why is this happening? - We still don't know.

1140
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:09,660
但是  
But, emm.

1141
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:13,580
也许和生物学有关
It may have something to do with biology.

1142
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:15,170
您说生物学是什么意思
What do you mean, biology?

1143
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:17,530
就是生物构成  
A biological component.

1144
01:11:17,530 --> 01:11:20,860
在他们的DNA里
You know, something in their DNA.

1145
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:23,850
他们的DNA  您能详细说一下吗
In their DNA, can you elaborate on that, please?

1146
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:28,260
可以  我是说几千年以前
Yes. What I mean is thousands of years ago

1147
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:32,940
食肉动物捕猎的本能
Eh, predators survived through their...

1148
01:11:33,070 --> 01:11:36,200
一直存在着
agressive hunting instincts.

1149
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,800
不知为什么
For whatever reason,

1150
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:41,620
他们好像回归了原始  野蛮的本性
they seem to be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways.

1151
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:48,240
霍普斯警官  怎么会出现这样的事呢
Officer Hopps, could it happen again?

1152
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:51,340
这是有可能的  所以我们需要警惕
It is possible. So, we must be vigilant.

1153
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:53,820
警局也做好了万全准备
And we at the ZPD are prepered

1154
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:54,920
我们会保护好大家
and are here to protect you.

1155
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,330
会有更多动物兽性大发吗
Will more mammals go savage?

1156
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:57,620
您将采取何种措施保护市民
What is being done to protect us?

1157
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:59,930
您会考虑强制隔离食肉动物吗
Have you considered a mandatory quarantine on predators?

1158
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,120
谢谢  霍普斯警官
Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps.

1159
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:05,070
时间到了  请不要再提问了
That's all the time that we have. No more questions.

1160
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:10,180
-我表现如何  -讲得挺好
- Was I okay? - Oh, you did fine.

1161
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:13,500
时间太少了  我还没来得及介绍你
That went so fast, I didn't get a chance to

1162
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,510
介绍我们的
mention you or say anything about how we...

1163
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:18,110
你觉得你说的够多了
Oh, I think you said plenty.

1164
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:19,570
什么意思
What do you mean?

1165
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:22,420
显然是他们的生物构成
"Clearly there's a biological component?"

1166
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:24,780
他们好像回归了原始  
"These predators may be reverting

1167
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:27,450
野蛮的本性
back to their primitive, savage ways?"

1168
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:29,320
你开玩笑吗
Are you serious?

1169
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,910
我只是陈述案件事实
I just stated the facts of the case.

1170
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:34,450
兔子就不可能突然变野蛮
I mean, it's not like a bunny could go savage.

1171
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:36,560
所以狐狸有这种可能
Right, but a fox could? Huh?

1172
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,790
尼克  别这样  你跟他们不一样
Nick, stop it, you're not like them.

1173
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:41,140
他们是指谁
Oh, there's a 'them' now?

1174
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:43,920
我意思是  你不是那种食肉动物
You know what I mean, you're not that kind of predator.

1175
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,490
要带上口套的那种吗
The kind that needs to be muzzled?

1176
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,950
要用防狐喷雾
The kind that makes you think

1177
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:49,840
对付的那种吗
you need to carry around fox repellant?

1178
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:50,630
第一次见面我就发现了
Yeah, don't think I didn't

1179
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,810
你带着那瓶小东西
notice that little item the first time we met.

1180
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,530
我问你个问题  你害怕我吗
Look. Let me ask you a question. Are you afraid of me?

1181
01:12:58,470 --> 01:13:00,100
你觉得我会发疯吗
Do you think I might go nuts?

1182
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:03,140
我会兽性大发吗  
You think I might go savage?

1183
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:07,030
我会不会吃了你
You think I might try to eat you?

1184
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,080
早料到了
I knew it, huh.

1185
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:16,050
还以为真有人会相信我呢
Just when I thought somebody actually believed in me, huh?

1186
01:13:16,510 --> 01:13:20,420
你还是别找食肉动物做搭档了
Probably best if you don't have a predator as a partner.

1187
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:22,970
{\an8}就职申请

1188
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,330
不  尼克  尼克
No, Nick. Nick!

1189
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:30,680
霍普斯警官  那只食肉动物威胁你了吗
Officer Hopps, were you just threatened by that predator?

1190
01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:32,390
不  他是我朋友
No, he's my friend.

1191
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:34,450
我们连朋友都不能相信了吗
We can't even trust our own friends?

1192
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:36,090
我没这么说  请让一让
That is not what I said. Please.

1193
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:39,140
-我们安全吗  -有没有狐狸兽性大发了
- Are we safe? - Have any other foxes gone savage?

1194
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:41,950
更多的恶性事件让全市陷入恐慌
More bad news in this city gripped by fear.

1195
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:55,570
{\an8}最新进展  冰原镇惨剧

1196

一头驯鹿目前生命垂危
A caribou is in critical condition.

1197
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:46,510
起因是遭兽性大发的北极熊袭击
The victim of a mauling by a savage polar bear.

1198
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:48,780
这是继警局的朱迪·霍普斯警官
This, the 27th such attack,

1199
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:51,110
将暴力事件和食肉动物天性关联后
comes just one week after ZPD Officer,

1200
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:52,610
一周以来发生的
Judy Hopps connected the

1204
01:13:57,470 --> 01:14:01,200
组织的和平集会遭到了强烈抵制
organized by popstar Gazelle was marred by protest.

1205
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:05,090
-滚回森林去  食肉动物  -我是大草原来的
- Go back to the forest, predator! - I am from the savannah.

1206
01:14:05,090 --> 01:14:07,090
动物城是个独特的地方
Zootopia is a unique place.

1207
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:14,790
{\an8}夏奇羚呼吁和平

1208
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:10,900
在这个疯狂  美丽  多样化的城市
It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city.

1209
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,110
我们为不同而骄傲
Where we celebrate our differences.

1210
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:15,680
这不是我所熟悉的动物城
This is not the Zootopia I know.

1211
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:19,450
我热爱的动物城不应该是这样
The Zootopia I know is better than this.

1212
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:22,150
大家不会彼此盲目指责
We don't just blindly assign blame.

1213
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:29,630
虽然不知道攻击事件持续发生的原因
We don't know why these attacks keep happening.

1214
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:34,210
但认为所有食肉动物都有兽性是不负责任的
But it's irresponsible to label all predators as savages.

1215
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,760
那不是我的艾米特
It's not my Emmitt.

1216
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,960
我们不能让恐惧分裂彼此
We cannot let fear divide us.

1217
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:52,460
请把我热爱的动物城还给我
Please give me back the Zootopia I love.

1218
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:58,620
来吧  霍普斯  新市长要见我们
Come on, Hopps. The new mayor wants to see us.

1219
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:01,140
新市长要见我  为什么
The mayor? Why?

1220
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,700
你终于功成名就了
It would seem you've arrived.

1221
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,710
爪豪斯  你在干嘛
Clawhauser? What are you doing?

1222
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:15,840
他们说  市民来到警察局
They thought it would be better if a predator

1223
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:19,490
一进门就看到像我这只食肉动物
such as myself wasn't the first face that you see

1224
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,660
似乎不太好
when you walk into the ZPD.

1225
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:23,060
什么
What?

1226
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:27,040
他们把我调去档案室了  在楼下
They're gonna move me to records. It's downstairs.

1227
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:28,950
锅炉房隔壁
It's by the boiler.

1228
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,540
霍普斯
Hopps!

1229
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:38,610
{\an8}正直  诚实  勇敢

1230
01:15:39,890 --> 01:15:41,440
我不太明白
I don't understand.

1231
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:43,960
我们市90%是食草动物  朱迪
Our city is 90 % prey, Judy,

1232
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:47,190
他们现在都吓坏了
and right now they're just really scared.

1233
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,830
你是他们的英雄  他们信任你
You're a hero to them. They trust you.

1234
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:52,690
所以我和牛局长
And so that's why Chief Bogo

1235
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:57,460
希望你来当警局的新形象代言人
and I want you to be the public face of the ZPD.

1236
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:07,000
我不是  不是什么英雄
I'm... not... I'm not a hero.

1237
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:11,150
我来到这里是想让世界更美好  但是
I came here to make the world a better place. But...

1238
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,370
我搞砸了
...I think I broke it.

1239
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:16,780
别太看得起自己  霍普斯
Don't give yourself so much credit, Hopps.

1240
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:21,160
世界一直都是一团糟  所以才需要好警察
The world has always been broken, that's why we need good cops.

1241
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:23,900
正如你
Like you.

1242
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,980
您说的对  长官
With all due respect, sir,

1243
01:16:28,990 --> 01:16:33,900
但好警察应该服务于民  保卫家园
a good cop is supposed to serve and protect.

1244
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:38,550
团结人心而不是分裂大家
Help the city. Not tear it apart.

1245
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,150
-我配不上警徽  -霍普斯
- I don't deserve this badge. - Hopps.

1246
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:49,260
朱迪  你付出那么多努力来到这里
Judy, you've worked so hard to get here.

1247
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:51,730
这是你从小的梦想
It's what you've wanted since you were a kid.

1248
01:16:51,730 --> 01:16:53,390
别放弃啊
You can't quit.

1249
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,670
谢谢你们给我的机会
Thank you for the opportunity.

1250
01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:14,760
{\an8}《动物城时报》  局势动荡  城市分裂

1251
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:18,230
一打胡萝卜  谢谢光临
A dozen carrots. Have a nice day.

1252
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:19,240
走吧
Come on.

1253
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,160
朱迪  厉害的朱迪
Hey there, Jude. Jude the Dude.

1254
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,860
记得这个小名吗  你怎么了
Remember that one? How we doing?

1255
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:34,650
-我很好  -一点都不好  你耷拉着耳朵呢
- I'm fine. - You are not fine, your ears are droopy.

1256
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:38,430
我怎么会妄想自己能改变世界
Why did I think I could make a difference?

1257
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:40,380
因为你敢于尝试
Because you're a trier, that's why.

1258
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:42,070
你从小就爱打破陈规
You've always been a trier.

1259
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:43,800
我的确尝试过了
Oh, I tried.

1260
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:47,920
结果让很多无辜的食肉动物生活更糟糕
And it made life so much worse for so many innocent predators.

1261
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,710
也不是全部  说曹操曹操就到  正是时候
 not all of them, though. Speak of the devil. Right on time.

1262
01:17:50,710 --> 01:17:52,690
{\an8}吉迪恩·格雷糕点店

1263
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:56,310
那是吉迪恩·格雷吗
Is that Gideon Grey?

1264
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,450
没错  就是他  我们一起做生意
Yeah, it sure is. We work with him now.

1265
01:17:58,450 --> 01:18:00,850
他是合作伙伴  要不是你让我们放下成见
He's our partner. And we never would have considered it,

1266
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:02,970
-我们也不会和他合作  -说的对
- had you not opened our minds. - That's right.

1267
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:04,210
他现在是三窝区
I mean, kid's turned into one of

1268
01:18:04,210 --> 01:18:06,440
最棒的糕点师之一
the top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows.

1269
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:12,240
真是了不起啊
That's... That's really cool, you guys.

1270
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:16,250
吉迪恩·格雷  真没想到
Gideon Grey. I'll be darned.

1271
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:16,970
朱迪
Hey, Judy.

1272
01:18:16,970 --> 01:18:18,650
小时候我不懂事  
I'd just like to say I'm sorry

1273
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:20,850
我想向你道歉
for the way I behaved in my youth.

1274
01:18:20,850 --> 01:18:24,050
因为不自信  为了证明自己厉害
I had a lot of self-doubt, and it manifested itself

1275
01:18:24,050 --> 01:18:26,720
才到处惹是生非  欺负弱小
in the form of unchecked rage and agression.

1276
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,930
我真是个混蛋
I was a major jerk.

1277
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:32,790
我有时候也有点混蛋
Well, I know a thing or two about being a jerk.

1278
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:37,570
这些派是给你们的
Anyhow, I brought you all these pies.

1279
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:41,870
当心  孩子们  别踩到午夜嚎叫[拉丁文]
Hey, kids! Don't you run through that midnicampum holicithias.

1280
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:44,760
霍普斯先生  那名字太高级了
Well, now. There's a four-dollar word, Mr. H.

1281
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,500
我们家的人就叫它午夜嚎叫
My family always just call them Night Howlers.

1282
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:50,570
等等  你刚刚说什么
I'm sorry. What did you say?

1283
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:52,560
他是说那些花儿  朱迪
Kid's talking about those flowers, Judy.

1284
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,360
我种了用来驱虫的
I use them to keep the bugs off the produce,

1285
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:55,950
但不能让小家伙们靠近它们
but I don't like the little ones going near them

1286
01:18:55,950 --> 01:18:57,530
不然就会像你特里叔叔那样
on acoount of what happened to your uncle Terry.

1287
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:59,500
我们小时候  特里叔叔吃了一整朵
Yeah, Terry ate one whole when we were kids

1288
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,880
结果就发疯了
and went completely nuts.

1289
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,830
对着你妈妈乱咬一通
He bit the dickens out of your mother.

1290
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:06,080
兔子也会兽性大发
A bunny can go savage.

1291
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,940
兽性  那倒不至于
Savage? Well, that's a strong word.

1292
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:09,420
可真是疼死我了
But it did hurt like the devil.

1293
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:10,320
当然疼
 sure it did.

1294
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:13,530
你手臂咬了个大洞  要我说就是兽性
There's a sizable divot in your arm. I'd call that savage.

1295
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:16,970
午夜嚎叫不是指狼  是指花儿
Night Howlers aren't wolves, they're flowers.

1296
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:19,900
是花儿让食肉动物兽性大发的
The flowers are making the predators go savage.

1297
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:22,960
原来如此  我知道哪里搞错了
That's it! That's what I've been missing!

1298
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,650
钥匙  钥匙  快给我
 keys! Keys! Keys! Keys! Hurry, come on!

1299
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:28,540
谢谢  我爱你们  拜拜
Thank you! I love you, bye!

1300
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:35,810
-你听懂她在说啥吗  邦妮  -完全不懂
- You catch any of that, Bon? - Not one bit.

1301
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:37,500
你们也没懂我就放心了
That makes me feel a little bit better,

1302
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,840
我以为她在说哪国鸟语呢
I thought she was talking in tongues or something.

1303
01:19:56,990 --> 01:19:58,070
谁啊
Who is it?

1304
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:01,130
我得找到尼克  求你了
I need to find Nick. Please.

1305
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:04,250
尼克
Nick?

1306
01:20:04,610 --> 01:20:05,890
尼克
Nick?

1307
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:10,210
尼克
Nick.

1308
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:14,380
午夜嚎叫不是指狼  是指一种有毒的花
Night Howlers aren't wolves, they're toxic flowers.

1309
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:16,380
我觉得有人故意陷害食肉动物
I think someone is targetting predators on purpose

1310
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:18,250
让他们兽性大发
and making them go savage.

1311
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:23,180
真有意思啊
Isn't that interesting?

1312
01:20:25,550 --> 01:20:28,860
等等  请别...我知道你永远不会原谅我了
Wait, please don't.. I know you'll never forgive me.

1313
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,510
我能理解
And I don't blame you.

1314
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,670
我也不会原谅我自己
I wouldn't forgive me either.

1315
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:38,850
我太无知  又不负责任  还心胸狭窄
It was ignorant, and irresponsible, and small-minded.

1316
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:43,000
但食肉动物不该因为我的过失而受苦
But predators shouldn't suffer because of my mistakes.

1317
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:45,280
我得弥补自己犯的错
I have to fix this.

1318
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:48,000
但是没有你  我办不成
But I can't do it without you.

1319
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:52,730
等我们完成这件事
And... And after we're done...

1320
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,280
你怎么恨我
you can hate me. And...

1321
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,220
都没关系
And that'll be fine.

1322
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:03,050
因为我是个差劲的朋友  又伤害了你
Because I was a horrible friend and I hurt you.

1323
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:09,160
从一开始你就是对的
And you can walk away knowing that you were right. All along.

1324
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:13,280
我真是只笨兔子
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1325
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:21,050
我真是只笨兔子
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1326
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:26,440
我真是只笨兔子
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1327
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:31,150
别担心  萝卜头  我会销毁的  给你48小时
Don't worry, Carrots, I'll let you erase it. In 48 hours.

1328
01:21:33,290 --> 01:21:35,420
好了  过来吧
All right, get in here.

1329
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:41,930
你们兔子啊  动不动就哭
Okay. Oh, you bunnies. You're so emotional.

1330
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:44,290
好了  深呼吸
There we go, deep breath.

1331
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,800
你该不是要偷这支笔吧
Are you-Are you just trying to steal the pen?

1332
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,470
说中了吗
Is that what this is?

1333
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:52,450
-你踩到我尾巴了  快挪开  -对不起
- You are standing on my tail, though. Off, off! - I'm sorry.

1334

look who it is, the Duke of Bootleg.

1349
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:26,090
你来干嘛  王尔德
What's it to you, Wilde?

1350
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:28,340
不用捣鼓爪子冰棒了吗
Shouldn't you be melting down a Pawpsicle or something?

1351
01:22:28,930 --> 01:22:30,880
这不是兔兔警官吗
 if it isn't flopsy the copsie.

1352
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:34,170
我们已经知道了  你偷的根本不是洋葱
We both know those weren't only onions I caught you stealing.

1353
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:36,520
你要午夜嚎叫干什么  猥琐屯
What were you gonna do with those Night Howlers, Weselton?

1354
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:40,740
是黄鼠狼  黄鼠狼公爵  我才不告诉你呢  兔子
It's Weaselton, Duke Weaselton. And I ain't talking, rabbit.

1355
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:43,360
你能逼我还是怎么着
And there ain't nothing you can do to make me.

1356
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,020
做了他
Ice him.

1357
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,610
死耗子  干嘛帮她  她是警察
You dirty rat, why are you helping her? She's a cop!

1358
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:54,790
她还是我未来外孙女的教母
And the godmother to my future granddaughter.

1359
01:22:54,790 --> 01:22:57,110
我打算叫她朱迪
I'm gonna name her Judy.

1360
01:22:58,290 --> 01:23:00,030
做了这只黄鼠狼
Ice this weasel.

1361
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:02,230
不要  求你了  我什么都说
All right, all right! Please! I'll talk. I'll talk.

1362
01:23:02,230 --> 01:23:04,040
我偷午夜嚎叫是要卖掉
I stole the Night Howlers so I could sell them.

1363
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:07,050
他们开的价我实在没法拒绝
They offered me what I couldn't refuse: Money.

1364
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:09,200
你把那些花儿卖给谁了
And to whom did you sell them?

1365
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,610
一只叫道格的公羊
A ram named Doug.

1366
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:12,370
我们在地下有个交易点
We got a drop spot underground.

1367
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:15,580
一定要小心  道格绝不是善类
Just watch it. Doug is the opposite of friendly.

1368
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:15,490
{\an8}榕树街地铁站

1369
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:17,760
他一点都不友好
He's unfriendly.

1370
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:28,960
赶紧地
Come on.

1371
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:44,240
黄鼠狼没有说谎
The weasel wasn't lying.

1372
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:47,310
道格垄断了整个午夜嚎叫的市场
Yeah,it looks like old Doug's cornered the market on Night Howlers.

1373
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:34,060
我是道格  目标是谁
You got Doug here. What's the mark?

1374
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:39,090
撒哈拉广场的猎豹  知道了
Cheetah in Sahara Square. Got it.

1375
01:24:39,550 --> 01:24:42,410
什么  我知道他们很快  但我能搞定
Serious? Yeah, I know they're fast, I can hit him.

1376
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:44,500
一只坐在车里的小小水獭
Listen, I hit a tiny little otter

1377
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:47,090
我都能穿过车窗打中
through the open window of a moving car.

1378
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,060
搞定了我打你电话  
Yeah, I'll buzz you when it's done.

1379
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:03,830
或者你直接看新闻
 Or you'll see it on the news.

1380
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:05,720
看那个更快了
You know, whichever comes first.

1381
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:09,360
道格  开门  拿铁来了
Hey, Doug, open up! We've got your latte.

1382
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,000
沃尔特和杰西回来了  
All right, Woolter and Jesse are back,

1383
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,930
我要挂了
so I'm leaving now. Out.

1384
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:13,600
你要去哪里  
Hey. Wait, where you going?

1385
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,830
你要去哪里  回来
Where are you going? Get back here!

1386
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,990
你要干嘛  你会被逮到的
What are you doing? He's gonna see you!

1387
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:19,220
你在看什么
What are you looking at? Hey!

1388
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:20,900
不管你在想什么  别乱来
Whatever you're thinking, stop thinking it.

1389
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:24,060
萝卜头  萝卜头
Carrots. Carrots.

1390
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:26,560
这次让他多加奶泡了吧
You better have the extra foam this time.

1391
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:30,290
开门
Hey! Open up!

1392
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:32,930
你要干嘛  你把我们困在这里了
What are you doing? You just trapped us in here!

1393
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:35,050
我们要把这些证据送到警局
We need to get this evidence to the ZPD.

1394
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:38,250
-装好了  走吧  -要所有的
- Okay, great. Here it is. Got it. - No, all of it.

1395
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:39,640
什么
Wait, what?

1396
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:44,720
你都会开火车了啊
Oh, great, you're a conductor now, huh?

1397
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:45,540
听我说
Hey. Listen.

1398
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,800
要启动这堆废铁除非奇迹发生
It would take a miracle to get this rustbucket going.

1399
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:52,020
好吧  哈利路亚
Well. Hallelujah.

1400
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:56,630
实验室这里出了点状况  是大麻烦
We kinda got a situation at the lab. It just got worse!

1401
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:59,320
任务完成
Mission accomplished.

1402
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,930
现在嘟嘟鸣笛庆祝会不会有点早
Would it be premature for me to do a little victory toot-toot?

1403
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:04,530
好吧  就嘟一下
All right. One toot-toot.

1404
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:09,770
又一个愿望完成了
Well, I can cross that off the bucket list.

1405
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:22,320
那声鸣笛还是取消吧
I may have to rescind that victory toot-toot.

1406
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:25,900
也许只是下冰雹了
Maybe that's just hail.

1407
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:30,660
走开
Back off!

1408
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:36,990
来了
Incoming!

1409
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,480
-萝卜头  -别刹车
- Carrots! - Don't stop! Keep going.

1410
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,870
不  快刹车
No, stop. Please stop!

1411
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:46,220
绝对不要刹车
Do not stop this car!

1412
01:27:08,010 --> 01:27:09,680
加快速度  尼克
Speed up, Nick. Speed up!

1413
01:27:09,690 --> 01:27:11,030
对面有另一辆列车
There's another train coming!

1414
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:13,050
相信我  加速
Trust me, speed up.

1415
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:18,390
停车
Stop the train!

1416
01:27:20,010 --> 01:27:22,090
要帮忙吗
Hey. Need some help?

1417
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:29,030
天啊  太快了  抓住
Oh, no. Oh, no no no. Too fast! Too fast! Hold on!

1418
01:27:41,010 --> 01:27:42,500
我们该下车了
I think this is our stop.

1419
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:54,890
也许  也许还有证据留下来
Okay, maybe... Maybe some of the evidence survived.

1420
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:07,110
全没了  我们搞砸了
Everything is gone. We've lost it all.

1421
01:28:08,230 --> 01:28:11,160
除了这个
Yeah. All, except for this.

1422
01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:13,700
太好了  尼克
Nick! Yes!

1423
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:16,070
走吧  我们赶紧送去警局
Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD.

1424
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:18,740
从自然博物馆穿过去
Cut through the Natural History Museum.

1425
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:34,180
-就在那里  -朱迪  朱迪
- There it is. - Judy. Judy!

1426
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:36,590
头羊市长
Mayor Bellwether.

1427
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,300
我们知道真相了
We found out what's happening.

1428
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:40,400
有人向肉食动物注射血清
Someone's darting predators with a serum.

1429
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,140
所以他们才兽性大发
That's what's making them go savage.

1430
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:45,520
干得真棒 朱迪  我真为你骄傲
I'm so proud of you, Judy. You did just a super job.

1431
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,920
谢谢市长
Thank you, ma'am.

1432
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,360
你是怎么找到我们的
How did you know where to find us?

1433
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,020
我要过去拿箱子了
I'll go ahead and I'll take that case now.

1434
01:28:55,020 --> 01:29:00,350
还是我跟尼克送到警局吧
You know what? I think Nick and I will just take this to the ZPD.

1435
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:05,970
-跑  -跑
- Run. - Run.

1436
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:08,420
抓住他们
Get them!

1437
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:15,590
萝卜头
Carrots!

1438
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,930
我来扶你  赶紧过来
Here, I got you. Get in here.

1439
01:29:21,370 --> 01:29:23,720
先放松下
Okay. Now, just relax.

1440
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:27,120
-吃蓝莓吗  -不用了
- Blueberry? - Pass.

1441
01:29:28,850 --> 01:29:31,040
朱迪
Judy.

1442
01:29:31,290 --> 01:29:33,660
把箱子拿给牛局长
Take the case. Get it to Bogo.

1443
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:35,450
我不会抛下你的
I'm not gonna leave you behind, that's not happening.

1444
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:38,280
-我走不了  -我们会想到办法的
- I can't walk. - Just.. We'll think of something.

1445
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,710
我们都是一样的  朱迪
We're on the same team, Judy.

1446
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:45,000
被人低估  怀才不遇
Underestimated. Underappreciated.

1447
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,340
你还没厌倦这一切吗
Aren't you sick of it?

1448
01:29:49,930 --> 01:29:53,790
食肉动物就算强壮嗓门大
Predators. They may be strong and loud.

1449
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:57,190
但如果食草动物是食肉动物的十倍
But prey outnumber predators 10 to 1.

1450
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:02,220
试想一下
Think about it.

1451
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:07,460
百分之九十的动物联手对付共同的敌人
90% of the population united against a common enemy.

1452
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:09,590
我们将所向披靡
We'll be unstoppable.

1453
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:16,550
在那里
Over there!

1454
01:30:33,490 --> 01:30:36,130
你就该呆在胡萝卜农场里
Well, you should have just stayed on the carrot farm, huh?

1455
01:30:36,410 --> 01:30:39,290
太可惜了  我挺喜欢你的
It really is too bad, I did like you.

1456
01:30:39,290 --> 01:30:41,770
你想干嘛  杀了我吗
What are you gonna do? Kill me?

1457
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,650
当然不是了
No, of course not.

1458
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:46,260
是他
He is.

1459
01:30:46,660 --> 01:30:49,060
不  尼克
No! Oh, Nick?

1460
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:54,300
警官  自然历史博物馆里有只兽性大发的狐狸
Yes, police! There's a savage fox in the Natural History Museum!

1461
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:57,340
霍普斯警官已倒下  赶紧过来
Officer Hopps is down. Please hurry!

1462
01:30:57,810 --> 01:30:59,160
尼克  你要反抗
No, Nick. Don't do this. Fight it.

1463
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:02,290
但他是无法反抗的
Oh, but he can't help it. Can he?

1464
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:07,460
食肉动物的天生就有兽性
Since predators are just biologically predisposed to be savages.

1465
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:20,940
想想明天的头条
Gosh! Think of the headline!

1466
01:31:21,190 --> 01:31:24,860
英雄警官被兽性狐狸所杀害
Hero Cop Killed by Savage Fox.

1467
01:31:25,970 --> 01:31:26,990
你的目的就是这个吗
So that's it?

1468
01:31:26,990 --> 01:31:30,080
食草动物畏惧食肉动物然后你掌权
Prey fears predator, and you stay in power?

1469
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,700
差不多吧
Yeah. Pretty much.

1470
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:33,020
不会得逞的
It won't work.

1471
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:35,580
畏惧总能管用的
Fear always works.

1472
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:38,960
为了这目的  我会给所有肉食动物都打一针
And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia to keep it that way.

1473
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:44,420
尼克  不
Oh, Nick. No.

1474
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:48,850
再见了  小兔子
Bye-bye, bunny.

1475
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:59,450
流血  血  血  和死亡
Blood, blood, blood! And death.

1476
01:31:59,450 --> 01:32:00,770
好了好了  强行抢戏吗
All right, you know you're milking it.

1477
01:32:00,770 --> 01:32:02,680
而且  我觉得我们成功了
Besides, I think we got it. I think we got it.

1478
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:04,900
我们成功了  谢谢你  叨叨羊
We got it up there, thank you, yakety-yak.

1479
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,870
你全盘招认了
You laid it all out beautifully.

1480
01:32:06,870 --> 01:32:07,550
什么
What?

1481
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:09,560
你是在找血清吗
Yeah. Oh, are... are you looking for the serum?

1482
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:10,800
在这呢
Well, it's right here.

1483
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,290
你武器里的
What you've got in the weapon there,

1484
01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:15,070
是我家里农场种的蓝莓
those are blueberries, from my family's farm.

1485
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:18,240
可好吃了  你该尝尝
They are delicious. You should try some.

1486
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:21,650
我陷害了狮心  我也可以陷害你
I framed Lionheart, I can frame you too.

1487
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:24,260
你们空口无凭
It's my word against yours.

1488
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:26,050
其实呢
Actually...

1489
01:32:26,270 --> 01:32:29,630
我会给所有肉食动物都打一针
And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia to keep it that way.

1490
01:32:29,630 --> 01:32:31,510
我都录下来了
It's your word against yours.

1491
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:35,310
这叫智取  亲爱的
It's called a hustle, Sweetheart. Boom!

1492
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:45,260
前任市长晨曦·头羊已入狱
Former mayor, Dawn Bellwether is behind bars today,

1493
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:49,820
{\an8}前市长头羊入狱

1494
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:47,570
罪名是策划了动物城
guilty of masterminding the savage attacks

1495
01:32:47,570 --> 01:32:49,450
食肉动物野蛮袭击事件
that have plagued Zootopia of late.

1496
01:32:49,450 --> 01:32:51,630
她的前任上司  里奥多·狮心
Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart,

1497
01:32:50,590 --> 01:33:03,990
{\an8}狮心终于发声

1498
01:32:51,630 --> 01:32:53,460
否认所有与其密谋的指控
denies any knowledge of her plot,

1499
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:56,050
声称只是为了保护动物城
claiming he was just trying to protect the city.

1500
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:58,490
我囚禁这些动物是错的吗
Did I falsely imprison those animals?

1501
01:32:58,570 --> 01:33:00,080
是的  我确实错了
Well, yes. Yes, I did.

1502
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:00,960
这是经典的
It was a classic

1503
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,940
为了正确的目的做了错事
doing the wrong thing for the right reason kind of a deal.

1504
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:05,680
另外  医生宣称
In related news, doctors say

1505
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:08,940
{\an8}午夜嚎叫解药已见成效

1506
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:08,340
午夜嚎叫的解药
the Night Howlers' antidote is proving effective

1507
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:11,110
已让受害食肉动物逐渐恢复
in rehabilitating the afflicted predators.

1508
01:33:16,230 --> 01:33:18,500
艾米特
Oh, Emmitt!

1509
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:23,080
谢谢
Thank you.

1510
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:27,260
我小时候
When I was a kid,

1511
01:33:27,790 --> 01:33:31,490
我以为动物城是完美的地方
I thought Zootopia was this perfect place.

1512
01:33:31,490 --> 01:33:33,460
人人和谐相处
Where everyone got along,

1513
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,390
谁都能成就无限可能
and anyone could be anything.

1514
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:38,300
现在发现
Turns out,

1515
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:40,440
现实远比宣传口号
real life is a little bit more complicated

1516
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:42,750
要复杂
than a slogan on a bumper sticker.

1517
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:45,480
现实生活是糟糕的
Real life is messy.

1518
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:48,830
我们都有局限性
We all have limitations.

1519
01:33:48,980 --> 01:33:50,650
都会犯错
We all make mistakes.

1520
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:54,820
但是乐观点来说  我们也都很像
Which means, hey, glass half full, we all have a lot in common.

1521
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:57,970
我们越是努力了解别人
And the more we try to understand one another.

1522
01:33:58,130 --> 01:34:00,460
越会变得出色
The more exceptional each of us will be.

1523
01:34:02,010 --> 01:34:03,640
但凡事都要去尝试
But we have to try.

1524
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:07,420
不管你是什么类型的动物
So no matter what type of animal you are.

1525
01:34:07,890 --> 01:34:12,900
从巨大的大象到第一只狐狸警官
From the biggest elephant, to our first fox.

1526
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,100
我恳请你们
I implore you.

1527
01:34:16,810 --> 01:34:21,170
努力尝试  让世界变得更美好
Try... Try to make the world a better place.

1528
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:24,500
{\an8}尼古拉斯·P·王尔德警官

1529
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:29,010
审视自己的内心  从改变自己开始
Look inside yourself and recognize that change starts with you.

1530
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:36,440
从我做起  从我们做起
It starts with me. It starts with all of us.

1531
01:34:36,390 --> 01:34:40,120
{\an8}动物城警察学校

1532
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:46,700
好了好了  安静

01:34:55,170 --> 01:34:57,520
你的话应该印到鸡汤卡片上  长官
You should have your own line of inspirational greeting cards, sir.

1537

Find him. Shut him down.

1546
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:28,310
