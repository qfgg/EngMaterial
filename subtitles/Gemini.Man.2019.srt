Night, Toast.

288
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,600
来看看星星  杰克
You should come look at the stars, Jack.

289
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,340
-你得多练习踢腿  -查理
- We have to work on your kick. - Charlie!

290
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,710
-专心点  亨利  -别这样
- Concentrate, Henry. - Come on!

291
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,670
你都五岁了  这并不难
You're five now, and this isn't hard.

292
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,240
再来
Now, try again.

293
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,910
{\an8}警报
外围被突破

294
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,500
你好  我是杰克  我在航海
Hi, this is Jack. I'm sailing.

295
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,180
拜托告诉我这意味着我们重出江湖了
Please tell me this means we're back in business.

296
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,300
你在哪
Where are you?

297
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,320
-在做该死的监控任务  -快离开那里
- Just some goddamn surveillance. - Get out of there, now.

298
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,690
别回家  别去你女友家
Do not go home. Do not go to your girl's house.

299
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,870
去车站  用现金买张车票
Go to the bus station. Get a ticket in cash.

300
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,660
-该死  -别用提款机
- Shit. - Do not use an ATM.

301
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,570
去一个没人认识你的地方
Go somewhere where nobody knows you.

302
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,110
你确定吗
You sure?

303
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,880
他们就在我的窗户外
They're outside my window.

304
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,840
抱歉  伙计  我让你也成了目标
I'm sorry, man. I made you a loose end.

305
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,210
别这样  我不会有事的  我怎么跟你联系
Come on, man. I'll be fine. How do I get in contact with you?

306
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,380
不联系  谁也别联系
You don't. Don't contact anybody.

307
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,010
尤其是国情局的人
Especially anybody from the DIA.

308
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,700
现在就把你的手机扔了
And get rid of your phone now.

309
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,290
不行  别这样  亨利  别...
Nah, come on, Henry, man. Stop--

310
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,750
马里诺
Marino?

311
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,320
现在不是用枪的时候
It's not gun time.

312
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,030
现在是喝咖啡的时候
It's coffee time.

313
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,370
你有机密文件销毁袋吗
Do you have a burn bag?

314
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,790
先告诉我你来这里做什么
First tell me what you're doing here.

315
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,500
有人刚派了一队人来杀我
Somebody just sent a team to kill me.

316
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,830
而你还在睡觉
And you're still asleep.

317
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,170
说明你并不知情  对吧
So that means you didn't know about it, correct?

318
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,170
我当然不知道  不然我肯定会告诉你
No, of course not. I would've told you.

319
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,350
说明下一个就是你了
That means you're next.

320
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,430
穿好衣服
Get dressed.

321
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,270
那些船都有备用钥匙在办公室吧
All the boats have dupe keys in the office, right?

322
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,060
有快艇吗
Got a fast one?

323
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,660
感受到大海的召唤了吗
Feeling the call of the sea?

324
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,210
他在哪
Where is he?

325
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,170
你可以现在告诉我
You can tell me now--

326
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,000
放下...
Drop--

327
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,880
贱人
Bitch!

328
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,300
你可以现在告诉我
You can tell me now,

329
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,760
或者等五分钟后你少了几颗牙再说
or you can tell me in five minutes minus your teeth.

330
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,090
反正你总会告诉我的
But you're gonna tell me.

331
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,490
我数到有三声  你带了几个人
I counted three. How many did you bring?

332
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,850
谁派你来的
Who sent you?

333
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,980
你可以现在告诉我  或者等五分钟后
You can tell me now, or you can tell me in five minutes

334
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,020
你少了几颗牙再说
minus your teeth.

335
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,730
你没事吧
You good?

336
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,900
-是拉西特  -你怎么知道
- It's Lassiter. - How do you know?

337
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,690
如果你上了这艘船  你就要抛弃
If you get on this boat, you're leaving behind

338
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,520
你认识的一切人和事
everything and everybody you've ever known.

339
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,800
你明白吗
Do you understand that?

340
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,440
害怕是好事
Scared is good.

341
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,320
说明你很警觉
It means you're alert.

342
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,030
我还从来没被追杀过呢
Never had anybody try to kill me before.

343
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,400
重点是他没杀成
Yeah, well, the important thing is he didn't.

344
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:09,370
你怕什么  除了蜜蜂
What scares you? Other than bees.

345
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,500
溺水
Drowning.

346
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,460
你就是这么收拾自己的烂摊子的
So this is you cleaning up your own messes.

347
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,740
别跟我说教了
Spare me the lecture.

348
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,260
这就像看着兴登堡号撞到了泰坦尼克号上
It's like watching the Hindenburg crash into the Titanic.

349
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,090
我们要怎么处理亨利
Tell me what we're going to do about Henry.

350
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,490
亨利·布罗根和其他士兵一样
Henry Brogan is like any other soldier.

351
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,890
当他们年轻而愚昧时
When they're young and stupid,

352
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,220
你说什么他们都信
they believe anything you tell them.

353
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,830
然后他们会变老  会老化
Then they get older. They wear out.

354
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,130
会渐渐生出良知
Grow a conscience.

355
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,550
所以我们需要新品种的士兵
This is why we need a new breed of soldier.

356
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,970
双子会处理的
Gemini will handle this.

357
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,860
抱歉  我不能允许
I'm sorry, I can't allow that.

358
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,570
我不是在征求你的同意
I'm not asking your permission.

359
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,820
你想去找你的上司们吗
You want to go to your bosses?

360
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,270
他们肯定很想听听我们的叛变项目
I'm sure they'd love to hear about our little rogue project.

361
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,060
我会做得像俄国人干的
I'll make it look like a Russian hit.

362
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,480
你给亨利安排国葬
You give Henry a state funeral.

363
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,440
棺材上覆盖国旗  鸣枪21响
Flag on the coffin, 21-gun salute.

364
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,960
你念个感人的致辞  大家都会哭
You give a nice speech. Everyone cries.

365
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,860
他会作为英雄被铭记
He'll be remembered as a hero.

366
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,320
生活会继续下去
Life goes on.

367
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,800
-亨利的生活不会了  -得了吧
- Not for Henry. - Oh, come on.

368
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,120
亨利这样的杂碎生来就是当炮灰的
Mutts like Henry were born to be collateral damage.

369
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,920
咱们就别假装不是这样了
Let's not pretend otherwise.

370
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,460
你有特工就位了吗
Do you have an asset in place?

371
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,800
我有最完美的人选
I have the perfect asset.

372
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,360
-好了  -就...
- All right. - Just--

373
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,390
好了  我没事
All right, I'm good.

374
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:56,680
你饿吗
You hungry?

375
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:00,850
饿死了  但那些东西三年前就过期了
Yeah, I'm starving, but those things expired three years ago.

376
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,860
是吗
Really?

377
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,110
还是挺好吃的
Still taste good.

378
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,280
那人还有牙的时候  他说你叛变了
While he still had teeth, that guy said you were the rogue.

379
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,490
你信了他
And you believed him?

380
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,700
99%确信他是在说谎
99% sure he was lying.

381
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,620
剩的那1%很折磨人  对吧
That 1% sucks, doesn't it?

382
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,500
亨利  这种事在你身上发生过吗
Henry, has this ever happened to you before?

383
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,630
哪部分
Which part?

384
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,050
你自己的政府想杀你
Your own government trying to kill you.

385
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,140
没有  这是新鲜事
Nah, that's new.

386
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,610
你在局里也有一阵子了
You've been Agency a while.

387
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,220
你能猜到是为了什么吗
Can't you guess what this is all about?

388
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:38,820
相信我  如果我能猜到
Trust me, if I could,

389
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,480
我现在就不会跟你一起度这个假了
I would not be on this lovely vacation with you.

390
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,440
好吧
Well...

391
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,750
等我当上局里的老大
when I'm head of the Agency,

392
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,820
我们可不会这么对待退休员工
we're gonna handle retirement very differently.

393
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,590
好兄弟
My man.

394
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,560
巴伦·图尔斯来接布罗根  两位乘客
Baron Tours here to pick up Brogan, party of two!

395
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,440
-很高兴见到你  伙计  -我也是
- Good to see you, man. - You too.

396
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,250
丹妮  这是巴伦
Danny, meet the Baron.

397
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:32,360
中年堕落人士  也是我认识的最棒的飞行员
Middle-aged reprobate and best pilot I've ever known.

398
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,160
丹妮  巴伦
Danny, Baron.

399
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,450
你好  糊妹
Hey, Toast.

400
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,280
按你的要求给你们弄了一次性电话
Got you burners, as requested.

401
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,950
目前你们可以躲在我在卡塔赫纳的家里
For now, you can hole up in my place in Cartagena.

402
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,990
没人认识你们  很安全
You'd be anonymous and safe.

403
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,950
现在情况有点糟  伙计
Yeah, we're kinda in the shit here, man.

404
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,330
我觉得杰克死了
I think Jack is dead.

405
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,710
-天啊  -是啊
- Jesus. - Yeah.

406
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,540
-有人跟踪你吗  -没有
- Anyone follow you? - Nah.

407
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,050
早晚的事  我们走
They will. Let's go.

408
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,710
我能吃点饼干吗
Can I have one of those crackers?

409
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,590
-当然  -谢了
- Sure. - Thanks.

410
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,810
他在家也这样吗
Does he do this at home?

411
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,650
应该不会吧  我不知道
I don't think so. I don't know.

412
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,900
-你会吗  -不会
- Do you? - No.

413
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,030
如果你知道在家做这种事不合适
If it's inappropriate to do this sort of thing at home...

414
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,650
你为什么认为在科学课上做
why would you think it's appropriate to do it

415
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:22,490
就合适呢
in your science class?

416
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,450
说不好  可能是因为科学特别无聊吧
I don't know. Probably because science is so wicked boring.

417
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,330
喂
Hello.

418
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,330
我猜你是真不想让我退休
Guess you really didn't want me to retire.

419
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,920
亨利  你没事  太好了
Henry, you're okay! Thank God!

420
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
少来
Stop it.

421
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,750
马里诺死了吗
Is Marino dead?

422
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,420
是的
Yes.

423
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,920
杰克·威利斯呢
Jack Willis?

424
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,300
不是我干的  都不是我干的  亨利  我发誓
It wasn't me. None of this was me, Henry. I swear it.

425
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,470
我信任过你  德尔
I trusted you, Del.

426
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,810
你仍然可以信任我  我换个号码打给你
You still can. Let me call you on another line.

427
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:56,350
604-555-0131.

428
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,810
你有三十秒时间
You got 30 seconds.

429
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,570
不好意思
Hey, excuse me.

430
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:04,400
要是我给你一百块
Could I borrow your phone

431
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,360
能把你的手机
for five minutes if I give you,

432
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,700
借我用五分钟吗
like, a hundred bucks?

433
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,910
我们先说说是谁下令
We'll start with whose idea it was

434
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,250
派了一队人去扎卡雷斯基的公寓
to send a team to Agent Zakarewski's apartment.

435
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,450
有那个必要吗
Was that necessary?

436
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,710
那也不是我的决定
Also not my call.

437
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:18,000
她是检察长的手下  不是我的手下
She's working for the inspector general, not me.

438
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,920
-她和你在一起吗  -对  但不是自愿的
- Is she with you? - Yes. Not voluntarily.

439
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,380
好  听着  我不想在电话里说这个
Okay, listen. This is not something I want to say over the phone.

440
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,630
我在我孩子的学校里
I'm at my kid's goddamn school.

441
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,510
这都是怎么回事
What the hell is all of this?

442
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,180
我们有个麻烦
We have a problem.

443
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,100
双子
Gemini.

444
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:37,900
你的老友在和简妮特·拉西特一伙人合作
Your old friend, working with Janet Lassiter and her people.

445
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,560
我没法阻止他们
I can't stop them.

446
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,530
好吧  多尔莫夫
Okay. Dormov.

447
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,070
他和双子有关吗
Did he have something to do with Gemini?

448
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,280
多尔莫夫  你说他是俄国恐怖分子
Dormov, the guy that you had me pop on the train

449
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,700
让我在他坐火车时把他干掉了
because you said he was a Russian terrorist.

450
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,330
他曾为双子效力吗
Was he working for Gemini?

451
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,460
曾经是
Once upon a time.

452
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:01,710
所以你让我替克雷·威利斯杀人
So you got me pulling triggers for Clay Verris.

453
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,260
亨利  我也后悔不够坦诚  但是...
Henry, I regret my lack of candor, but listen--

454
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,260
你还骗过我多少次  德尔
How many other times you do this to me, Del?

455
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,550
你篡改过多少次档案
How many times you spike a file,

456
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,470
送我去杀那些罪不至死的人
send me off to AMF somebody who didn't deserve it?

457
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,560
从没有过  只有这一次
Never ever. This was a one-off.

458
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,730
我用我儿子的命发誓
I swear on my son's life.

459
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:23,820
好吧  扎克雷斯基探员与此事无关
All right, look, Agent Zakarewski is not a part of this.

460
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,280
亨利  我们能解决的  我发誓
Henry, we can fix this, I swear.

461
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,950
但我需要你们俩都回来
But I need both of you to come back.

462
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,860
回去什么下场  德尔
To what, Del?

463
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,160
好  双子
Okay. Gemini.

464
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,580
你对它知道多少
What do you know about it?

465
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,040
克雷·威利斯的私人准军事组织
Privatized paramilitary owned by Clay Verris.

466
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,790
局里经常与他们合作  还有别的吗
Agency does a lot of business with them. Is there more?

467
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,300
巴伦和我在海军时是威利斯的手下
Baron and I served under Verris in the marines.

468
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,300
巴拿马  科威特  索马利亚
Panama, Kuwait, Somalia.

469
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,220
他退役之后
After he left the military,

470
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,220
成立了双子
he started Gemini

471
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,180
想雇佣我们
and tried to hire us.

472
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,350
我们都拒绝了
We both told him no.

473
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,010
不过我够聪明  搬到了2400公里之外
Except I was smart enough to move 1,500 miles away.

474
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,850
是啊
Yeah.

475
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,730
我搞砸了
I blew that one.

威利斯不择手段除掉目标
Verris gets billions of dollars a year

478
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:21,080
以此每年获利数十亿美金
to take out targets any way he sees fit.

479
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,120
双子就是做这个的
That's Gemini.

480
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:26,710
暗中绑架  折磨
Off-book kidnappings, tortures.

481
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,750

无声无息地消失

484
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,390
或是想找人训练你的敢死队  联系他们就行
or you want somebody to train your death squads.

485
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,600
学了六周的狙击后

486
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,980
克雷·威利斯带我上船开出海八公里
Clay Verris takes me out on this boat about five miles.

让我能踩水多久就踩多久
tells me tread water as long as I can.

489
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,980
他不知道你害怕...
And he didn't know about your fear of--

490
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,110
他当然知道  就是因为这个
Of course he did. That was the point.

491
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,360
那你做了什么
So what did you do?

492
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,580
我踩水  踩到踩不动
I tread water for as long as I could.

493
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,460
然后我溺水了
And then I drowned.

494
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,670
死了
Dead.

495
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,510
他把我捞上去  按压我的胸膛
He fished me out, paddled my chest.

496
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,060
告诉我  我准备好为他效力了

501
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,110
我们早上再想办法
We'll figure it out in the morning.

502
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,870
现在我们都需要休息一下
Right now we could use some shut-eye.

503
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:40,330
没问题  你们要一间房还是...

00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,080
两间

505
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,420

00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,170
行  你愿意的话我可以让他睡车库
Well, yeah. I can put him in the garage if you want.

507
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,800
行  两间就可以
All right, two rooms will be fine.

508
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,800
就是让你们选一下  行  这边走

I need you to go with Baron someplace safe. All right?

511
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,560
枪手  在屋顶上
Shooter. On the roof.

512
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,900
你真是个要命的客人  知道吗
You're a shitty houseguest, you know that?

513
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,980
他们怎么找到我们的
How the hell did they find us?

514
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,740
她是好人  真的是好人
She's good. She's really good.

515
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,820
她只是不了解内幕
She just doesn't know what she doesn't know.

516
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,120
照顾好她  行吗
Take care of her, all right?

517
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,030
行
All right.

518
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,920
站住
Stop right there!

519
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,760

Who are you?

520
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,550
我不想朝你开枪
I don't want to shoot you!

521
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,180
行
Fine.

00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,220
别朝我开枪
Don't shoot me.

523
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,140
介意我朝你开枪吗
Mind if I shoot you?

524
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,480
刚刚在屋顶上我本可以杀了你
I could've killed you on the roof!

525
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,320
也许你是该杀了我
Maybe you should have.

526
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,740
他们给你看我的照片了吗
Did they show you a picture of me?

527
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,700
嗯  你看着好老
Yeah. You look old.

528
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,870
小子  你再走近一步
Kid, you take one step closer,

529
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,960
我就别无选择了
you're gonna leave me no choice.

530
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,740
放开  放开
Stop! Stop! Stop!

531
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,790
让开  让开
Move! Move!

532
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,180
别挡路
Get out of the way!

533
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,880
别挡路
Out of the way!

534
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,810
停  停  停
Stop! Stop! Stop!

535
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,850
那到底是谁
Who the hell was that?

536
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:11,030
{\an8}国家警察

539
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,130
-谢谢  队长  -不客气
- Thank you, Captain. - No problem.

540
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,010
你家已经暴露了  给我找个视野开阔的地方
Your place is burned. Get me somewhere I can see him coming.

541
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,810
我想持枪闯进去
I wanted to go in there guns blazing,

542
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:47,890
但她觉得用外交手段更合理
but she thought the diplomatic approach made more sense.

543
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,140
是啊  开枪可能更亲切点
Yeah, gunfire might've been kinder.

544
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,360
做得不错
Great work in there.

545
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:53,520
现在怎么办
What now?

546
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:56,110
我要你送我去布达佩斯
I need you to get me to Budapest.

547
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,030
-布达佩斯有什么  -布达佩斯有什么
- What's in Budapest? - What's in Budapest?

548
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,950
杰克的线人  尤里
Jack's informant, Yuri.

549
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:05,370
他们追杀我不是因为我要退休
These guys aren't trying to kill me because I want to retire.

550
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:06,410
他们追杀我
They're coming after me

551
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:07,290
是因为他们认为
because they think Jack

552
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:09,250
杰克告诉了我机密信息
told me something classified.

553
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,040
尤里应该知道这事
Yuri ought to know about it.

554
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:14,670
抱歉  搭档  我的阿兹特克飞不了那么远
I'm sorry, partner, my Aztec doesn't have that kind of range.

555
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,420
我希望能借一架飞得了的
Well, I was hoping we would borrow something that does.

556
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:19,170
比如湾流飞机
Maybe a G?

557
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,140
借人家的湾流飞机
Taking someone's Gulfstream?

558
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:26,220
得是真爱才能借得出吧
I mean, you'd really have to love a guy to do that.

559
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,390
我刚好认识这么一个人  等我一下
I know just the fella. Give me a minute.

560
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,600
亨利
Henry?

561

就是我们有共同的敌人
is we share a common enemy.

704
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:04,380
克雷·威利斯
Clay Verris.

705
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,930
他把多尔莫夫骗到西方  资助他的实验室
He lured Dormov to the West, funded his lab.

706
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:12,840
现在你也见过了他们孕育的果实
And now you have met the fruits of their labor.

707
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,340
克隆羊多莉诞生于1996年
Dolly the sheep was cloned in '96.

708
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:17,960
-但在1995年  -我是那只羊
- But in '95-- - I was the sheep.

709
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:19,910
把这当成是赞美吧
Take it as a compliment.

710
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:22,010
仅有你一人
And you are the only one.

711
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:26,440
威利斯把你的克隆体当自己的儿子养大
With your DNA, Verris raised the boy as his own son,

712
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:29,460
把他训练成完美杀手
trained him to be the perfect assassin.

713
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,620
那多尔莫夫为什么想要离开
So why was Dormov trying to leave?

714
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,840
我们一直都想诱他回来
For years, we tried to lure him back.

715
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,070
都是徒劳
Nothing.

716
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:38,420
然后在去年  他们闹翻了
Then last year, they had a falling out.

717
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,740
多尔莫夫害怕了  找到了我
Dormov got scared, reached out to me.

718
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:41,820
那我...
So, I--

719
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,580
你还是没解释为什么我被派去杀他
That still doesn't explain why I was sent to kill him.

720
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:49,140
我们有迹象表明多尔莫夫取得了重大突破
We have indications Dormov made a breakthrough.

721
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,440
人类DNA改造
Modified human DNA.

722
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,510
可以批量生产的途径
A path to mass production.

723
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:57,260
多尔莫夫想要士兵更强壮  更聪明
But Dormov wanted soldiers to be stronger, smarter.

724
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,040
但威利斯
Verris...

725
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,970
威利斯想要的是别的
Verris wanted something else.

726
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:05,460
什么别的
What something else?

727
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:07,120
布罗根先生
Mr. Brogan,

728
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:09,610
你是你这行最出色的人
you are the best at what you do.

729
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:13,890
但你也会疲惫  也有恐惧  怀疑
But still you get tired. You have fears, doubts.

730
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:16,650
你会感觉痛苦  或许会懊悔
You feel pain, perhaps remorse.

731
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:19,190
你有良心
You have a conscience.

732
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,740
这让你有人性
This makes you human,

733
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:24,280
但不是最好的士兵
but suboptimal as a soldier.

734
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,090
不够完美
Less than perfect.

735
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:28,220
不够赚钱
Less profitable.

736
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:34,500
克雷顿·威利斯在用DNA扮演上帝的角色
Clayton Verris is playing God with DNA.

737
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,280
必须要阻止他
He must be stopped.

738
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,880
如果有那么危险  为什么不发射导弹
If it's that dangerous, why not send a missile?

739
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:43,540
炸了他的实验室
Blow up his lab.

740
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:46,020
我们就是在这么做
That is what we're doing.

741
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:50,470
只不过现在的导弹是你
Except you are the missile.

742
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,340
祝你好运
I wish you luck.

743
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,060
还有一件事
One last thing.

744
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:00,000
两天前你从家里逃走的那次
Your escape from home two days ago?

745
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,800
真是厉害
Amazing work.

746
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,020
我全程都替你紧张
I was on the edge of my seat.

747
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:07,680
等等  什么
Wait. What?

748
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:10,060
你怎么知道这个
How the hell do you know about that?

749
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:14,370
我可是你的忠实粉丝啊
I'm a big fan. What can I say?

750
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,550
即使他所说的只有一半是真的
If even half of what he's saying is true,

751
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:23,300
我们都要和这个孩子谈谈
we gotta talk to this kid.

752
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:25,410
不然的话你一直都不安全
You're not gonna be safe until you do.

753
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:27,900
如果你的五十岁本体突然出现告诉你
So you think if your 50-year-old self showed up

754
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,210
你是她的克隆体  能让你冷静下来吗
and told you you were her clone, that would make you calmer?

755
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:31,550
五十一岁
Fifty-one.

756
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:33,760
-什么  -随口一说
- What? - Just saying.

757
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,690
你知道你五十一了吧  亨利
You know you're 51, Henry?

758
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:37,330
-四舍五入  -好吧
- I'm rounding. - Right.

759
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,670
他是你不愿看的镜子  亨利
He's the mirror you don't want to look into, Henry.

760
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:44,040
但他是我们找到威利斯的最好机会
But he's our best shot at getting to Verris.

761
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:54,100
简妮特·拉西特
Janet Lassiter?

762
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,250
你是谁
Who wants to know?

763
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,230
我来给你传信  女士
Got a message for you, ma'am,

764
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,890
信息来自一个给我的
from a man who transferred $1,000

765
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:02,250
羽毛币账户转账一千美元的人
into my Feathercoin account just to make sure you got it.

766
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:04,360
这人叫什么名字
Does this person have a name?

767
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:07,290
他叫"给我的羽毛币账户转账一千美元的人"
His name is "$1,000 Into My Feathercoin Account."

768
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:10,910
"你好  简妮特
"Hello, Janet.

769
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:13,530
在你打算再次追杀我之前  考虑一下
Before you try to kill me again, consider this:

770
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:16,920
你家地址是卡罗尔街1362号
Your home address is 1362 Carrol Grove.

771
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:19,860
安全警报器密码是1776
The security alarm code is 1776.

772
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,210
你每天早晨6点12醒来
You awaken at 6:12 every morning

773
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:25,970
6点42去买一杯加浓低因豆奶拿铁
and stop for your decaf soy latte with an extra shot by 6:42.

774
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,810
每晚你都站在你家客厅的大窗户前
Every night you stand in front of your huge living room window,

775
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:31,150
喝一杯金快活玛格丽特
sipping a Jose Cuervo margarita,

776
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,330
电视里放着《法医档案》
with Forensic Files on the TV,

777
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,530
身上穿着舒适的家居服"
wearing your nice, comfy sweatpants."

778
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:42,430
我是拉西特
This is Lassiter.

779
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:44,850
你的十点钟和两点钟方向有枪手
There are shooters at your ten and two.

780
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:47,920
你敢站起来的话  就AMF了
Get up off of that chair, you will be AMF'ed.

781
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:50,600
如果我觉得这个世界还需要一个我
Now, if I thought the world needed another me,

782
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,140
我会生个孩子
I would've had a kid.

783
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:55,100
那个项目在我上任之前就存在了
The program predates my arrival at the Agency.

784
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,100
你要知道这一点
You must know that.

785
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,720
是啊  典型官僚回答  出了问题就甩锅
Yeah, perfect DC answer: Something goes wrong, duck!

786
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:02,470
给骑车小伙小费
Tip the bike guy.

787
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:04,590
你可以走了
You can go.

788
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:09,070
我劫持了你的探员
Now, I have your agent with me against her will.

789
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:11,130
丹妮尔·扎卡雷斯基
Danielle Zakarewski.

790
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,820
她想回去
She wants to come in.

791
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,500
行
Fine.

792
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:16,910
她像我一样是个爱国者
Like me, she is a patriot.

793
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:20,900
与我不同的是  她依旧想在接下来的几十年里
Unlike me, she still wants to spend the next couple decades

794
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,370
为你们这些混蛋卖力工作
scoring touchdowns for you assholes.

795
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:26,160
她的安全无商议余地

796
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,450
十点钟和两点钟方向  简妮特

797
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:30,490
简妮特的加浓低因豆奶拿铁
Decaf soy latte with an extra shot for Janet.

798
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:32,540
我只愿把她交给
The only person I'll turn her over to

799
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:35,040
你们派去卡塔赫纳追杀我的人
is the guy you sent after me in Cartagena.

800
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,650
别想着派别人来
Don't even think about sending anybody else.

801
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:40,590
家人团聚  很温情啊
Family reunion. Very sweet.

802
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:41,960
继续嘴硬
Yeah. Keep it up.

803
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,340
你会成为我第一个免费杀的人
You'll be the first person I ever killed for free.

804
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:47,050
你能让他多快赶到布达佩斯
How quickly can you get him to Budapest?

805
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,970
五分钟
Five minutes?

806
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,860
好
Good.

807
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:58,140
她今晚午夜会在沃伊达奇城堡的庭院里
She'll be in the courtyard of the Vajdahunyad Castle at midnight tonight.

808
00:58:58,310 --> 00:58:59,970
享用你的拿铁吧
Enjoy your latte.

809
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,540
AMF是什么意思
What's AMF?

810
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,350
"再见  狗娘养的"
"Adios, motherfucker."

811
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:07,010
他是怎么知道我们在这里的
How the hell does he know we're here?

812
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,630
会成功的  对吧
This is gonna work, right?

813
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,690
是的
Yes.

814
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:24,550
你怎么知道
How do you know?

815
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,640
我知道他的喜好
I know his taste.

816
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:31,010
等等  你是说你对我有兴趣
Wait, are you saying you're attracted to me?

817
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:34,740
现在的我  当然不会
Me? Now? Hell, no.

818
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:38,260
但我的年轻纯真版  或许会
But the younger, less-mature version, maybe.

819
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:48,170
在乔治亚时我去找你
When I came for you in Georgia,

820
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,530
根本不用思考
I didn't have to think about that.

821
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:52,510
那是本能
It was instinct.

822
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:55,430
他也有那种本能
He was born with that too.

823
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:58,650
再说了  他想杀我
Besides, he wants me.

824
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:09,260
右转
Right.

825
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,050
庭院真漂亮
Lovely courtyard.

826
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:20,970
抱歉  女士
I'm sorry, ma'am.

827
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:23,900
继续进行之前  我需要你脱掉衣服
Before we go any farther, I'm gonna need you to strip.

828
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:26,940
你说什么
Beg your pardon?

829
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:30,150
需要确定你没带监听器
Need to be certain you're not wearing a wire.

830
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:34,490
好吧  首先
Okay, first of all,

831
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:36,060
你叫我"女士"
"Ma'am"?

832
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:39,160
我受的教育是要尊敬长辈
I was raised to respect my elders.

833
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,430
请脱掉衣服
Take your clothes off, please.

834
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:12,660
请转身
Turn around, please.

835
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:44,170
看来你喜欢做事细致
I see you like to be thorough.

836
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,520
谨慎让我能活命
Caution has kept me alive.

837
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:53,190
打给他的一次性电话
Call his burner.

838
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:03,040
谢谢
Thank you.

839
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:05,820
布罗根
Brogan.

840
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:09,470
十二分钟后  我会对她后脑开两枪
In 12 minutes, I'm putting two bullets in the back of her head.

841
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:11,840
你受到的命令是安全交接她
Your orders are to deliver her safely.

842
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,850
我受到的命令是杀了你
My orders are to kill you.

843
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:17,450
你熟悉地下墓穴的石英室吗
Are you familiar with the Quartz Chamber of the catacombs?

844
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:18,190
不行
Negative.

845
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:20,980
要在显眼的地方  让我能看到你
We're doing this someplace visible, where I can see you.

846
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:22,990
现在你只剩十一分钟了
Now you have 11 minutes.

847
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:28,340
穿上衣服  我们开车去
Get dressed. We're taking a ride.

848
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:42,830
出租车真是聪明的主意
Cab was a smart move.

849
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:45,440
你来自哪里
Where are you from?

850
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:48,550
你的礼节  是南方的
Your formality, it's Southern.

851
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:56,470
如果你要拿我当诱饵  还可能杀了我
You know, if you're gonna use me as bait and possibly murder me,

852
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:59,220
那你起码能陪我聊几句
then the least you can do is indulge me in some conversation.

853
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,060
在亚特兰大附近
Just outside Atlanta.

854
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:05,870
你们两个有很多相似点
You two have a lot in common.

855
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:08,000
我表示怀疑
I doubt that.

856
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,840
你会很惊讶的
You'd be surprised.

857
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:13,460
我最开始也是跟踪他
You know, I started following him too.

858
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:14,930
就像你现在这样
Just like you're doing.

859
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:17,100
然后我渐渐了解了他
Then I got to know him.

860
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,130
他心胸宽广  像你一样
He's got a big heart, like you.

861
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,060
你怎么了解我的心
What do you know about my heart?

862
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,470
我知道你有心
I know that you have one.

863
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:29,980
我还知道它在告诉你
And I know that it's telling you

864
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:32,490
你这次被指派的任务不对劲
that something about the job you've been given isn't right.

865
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:34,630
任务就是任务  女士
A job is a job, ma'am.

866
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:50,320
真想知道你付了管理员多少钱
I wonder how much you paid the custodian.

867
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,830
左转
Left.

868
01:04:57,690 --> 01:04:59,130
解开锁链
Undo the chain.

869
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,050
地下室
Basement.

870
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,260
你肯定很了解这个城市
You must really know the city.

871
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,040
我经常看《国家地理》
I watch a lot of Nat Geo.

872
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,390
-上面写着"禁入"  -请
- It says "Off-Limits." - Ma'am.

873
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,070
真想知道有多少人被埋葬在这里
Wonder how many people are buried down here.

874
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:22,600
站在那里
Stand over there.

875
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,180
走
Go.

876
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:56,520
如果你把灯都熄灭了
If you knock out all the lights,

877
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,880
出去时怎么看得到自己布置的绊线
how are you gonna see your own trip wire on the way out?

878
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:01,760
手榴弹可不是闹着玩的  我懂你的想法
A grenade is no joke. I mean, I get the idea.

879
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,650
黑暗让他最强的狙击无法施展
Darkness neutralizes his biggest strength,

880
01:06:03,650 --> 01:06:05,410
近距离对你有利  是吗
and close quarters favors you, right?

881
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:07,750
他扔手榴弹会把我也杀死
I mean, he can't throw a grenade without killing me too.

882
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:09,660
但如果他用毒气呢
But what if he tries gas?

883
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:11,600
或者某种镇静剂
You know? Or some sort of sedative agent?

884
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:14,820
想我前面去了  防毒面具和夜视镜  聪明
Way ahead of me. Gas mask and night vision. Very smart.

885
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:16,810
-那边  -还有索带
- Over there. - And zip ties!

886
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:18,310
肯定是给我准备的
These must be for me.

887
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,090
不过我能问你件事吗
But can I ask you something?

888
01:06:20,090 --> 01:06:23,210
你说个不停真的会给我留出回答的间隙吗
Would you actually stop talking long enough for me to answer?

889
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:25,070
你对他了解多少
How much do you know about him?

890
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:26,550
有人告诉你为什么要杀他吗
Anybody tell you why they wanted him dead?

891
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:27,740
他疯了
Guy cracked.

892
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:30,530
一夜之内杀了八名特工  还有他的探子
Killed eight ops in a single night and his spotter.

893
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:32,210
-他们这么告诉你的吗  -他就是这么做的
- That's what they told you? - That's what he did.

894
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:34,350
不  并不是
No. No, not exactly.

895
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:37,220
那些特工被杀那晚我也在场
I was there the night all those operatives were hit.

896
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:40,380
他们是被双子派去杀他还有我的
They'd been sent to kill him, and me, by Gemini.

897
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:41,350
或许这不算什么
And not that it matters,

898
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:42,920
但他的探子是在维吉尼亚被害
but his spotter was shot in Virginia,

899
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,140
其余人是在萨凡纳丧命
and the rest of those men went down in Savannah.

900
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:51,550
亨利确实能远距离射击  但打不了那么远
Henry can shoot long-distance, but he can't shoot that long.

901
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:58,760
拜托你好好想想  你觉得这说得通吗
Come on. Just think. Does that make any sense to you?

902
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:00,430
你明白我在说什么吗
Do you understand what I'm saying?

903
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:01,800
这不...
It doesn't--

904
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:03,630
好多了
Better.

905
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:05,480
我操
Fuck you!

906
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,540
起来  走
Get up. Go.

907
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:24,150
站住别动
Stay right there.

908
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:33,810
-谢谢  -给
- Thank you. - Here.

909
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:35,810
你知道怎么点吗
You know how to light one of those?

910
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:37,340
老天  亨利
Jesus, Henry.

911
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:46,990
谢谢你提醒我有手榴弹
Thanks for the tip on the grenade.

912
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,960
你一直在和他说话
You were talking to him the whole time.

913
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,180
没错
Yeah.

914
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:54,040
搜身要么搜彻底  要么不搜
You either search somebody or you don't.

915
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,440
事先声明
And for the record...

916
01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:59,930
我不想杀你
I do not want to kill you.

917
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:02,950
但若有必要我绝对会动手
But I absolutely will if I have to.

918
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,570
克雷·威利斯怎么跟你说我的
What did Clay Verris tell you about me?

919
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,810
好吧  我跟你讲讲他的事
Okay. Well, let me tell you about him.

920
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,900
因为我和威利斯先生非常熟悉
Because I know Mr. Verris very well.

921
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:16,350
他怎么开始训练你的
How'd he start you?

922
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:18,250
猎鸟  猎兔吗
Hunting birds? Rabbit?

923
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:20,630
大概十二岁让你升级为猎鹿
About 12 years old, moved you up to deer?

924
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,550
我猜十九或二十岁时
I'm guessing 19, 20 years old

925
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:26,060
他第一次让你对人开枪
the first time he ordered you to shoot a person.

926
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:28,920
我说得对吗
Any of this ringing true?

927
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:31,370
没错
Yeah.

928
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:34,060
他告诉你要"依靠恐惧"
He told you to "lean into your fear,"

929
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:36,230
因为你是"战士
because you were "a warrior,

930
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:39,190
拥有保护弱者的伟大天赋"
blessed with great gifts to defend the weak."

931
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:43,130
但他无法阻止那个声音
But he couldn't stop the noise...

932
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:45,960
你内心深处某一部分总感觉
that secret part of you that always felt

933
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,220
和其他人有点不一样
a little different than everybody else.

934
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:51,020
感觉像个怪胎
Part that felt like a weirdo.

935
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:53,130
你什么也不知道
You don't know shit.

936
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:56,000
小子  你里里外外我都知道
Kid, I know you inside out and backwards.

937
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:59,230
你对蜜蜂过敏  讨厌香菜
You're allergic to bees. You hate cilantro.

938
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:01,500
你总是打四次喷嚏
You always sneeze four times.

939
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,530
谁都讨厌香菜
Everybody hates cilantro.

940
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,240
你小心细致
You're meticulous.

941
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:10,070
周密  有纪律  坚持不懈
Thorough. Disciplined. Relentless.

942
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:12,040
你喜欢解谜
You love puzzles.

943
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:15,740
你下棋  对不对
You're a chess player. Right?

944
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:18,090
我猜下得还挺好
Good, too, I bet.

945
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,930
但你一直受失眠的折磨
But you suffer from insomnia.

946
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:23,130
你的大脑从不让你睡
Your mind never lets you sleep.

947
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:25,420
即使睡了也遭受噩梦困扰
And even when it does, it attacks you with nightmares.

948
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,760
我说的是那种凌晨三点
I'm talking 'bout those three-o'clock-in-the-morning,

949
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:30,660
"快来人救我"那种噩梦
somebody-please-save-me kind of nightmares.

950
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:34,410
还有怀疑  那是最糟糕的
And then there's the doubts, and those are the worst.

951
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:37,170
你讨厌它们  你讨厌自己有怀疑
You hate 'em, and you hate yourself for having 'em.

952
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:38,830
它们让你感觉软弱
They make you feel weak.

953
01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:41,430
真正的士兵不会怀疑  对吗
A real soldier doesn't doubt, right?

954
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:46,570
你唯一真正感到开心的时候
The only time you ever truly feel happy

955
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:49,930
就是趴在地上即将扣下扳机时
is when you're flat on your belly about to squeeze a trigger.

956
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:54,440
那一刻  世界完全说得通了
And in that moment, the world makes perfect sense.

957
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:57,940
你觉得我是怎么知道这些的
How do you think I know all of that?

958
01:10:57,940 --> 01:11:00,080
我才不在乎你怎么知道的
I don't give a shit how you know anything.

959
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,610
看着我  蠢蛋
Look at me, dummy!

960
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:04,580
看看我们
Look at us!

961
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,310
二十五年前
Twenty-five years ago,

962
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:09,620
你父亲偷了我的血用来克隆
your father took my blood and he cloned me.

963
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:12,560
他用我克隆出了你
He made you from me.

964
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,930
我们的DNA完全相同
Our DNA is identical.

965
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,870
他说的是事实
He's telling you the truth.

966
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:18,130
闭嘴
Shut up.

967
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:20,730
他选择我是因为没人能超越我
He chose me 'cause there's never been anybody like me,

968
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:23,900
他知道我总有一天会变老  那时就用上你了
and he knew one day I was gonna get old and then you'd step in.

969
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:26,160
他一直在骗你
He's been lying to you the whole time.

970
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,450
他跟你说你是孤儿
He told you you were an orphan.

971
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:30,770
全世界那么多人追杀我
And of all the people in the world to come after me,

972
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:31,990
为什么他派你来
why would he send you?

973
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:33,660
因为我是最厉害的
Because I'm the best.

974
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:37,300
你显然不是最厉害的
You are obviously not the best.

975
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,760
你真是死脑子
You got a hard-ass head.

976
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:46,720
估计这应该是你生日什么的
Guess this was supposed to be your birthday or something.

977
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,810
我必须死  必须你动手
I had to die, and you had to do it.

978
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:50,940
只要我还活着
As long as I was alive,

979
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:54,500
克雷的小实验就不算完成
somehow Clay's little experiment was incomplete.

980
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,110
你就是在为那个疯子杀人
That's the maniac you're pulling a trigger for.

981
01:11:57,110 --> 01:11:59,010
你别跟我说他
Shut your mouth about him.

982
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:00,460
你只是想让我慌乱
You're just trying to rattle me.

983
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:02,230
我是想救你
I'm trying to save you!

984
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:06,560
你二十三岁了吧
What are you, 23?

985
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:08,850
还是处男吧
Still a virgin, right?

986
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:10,700
看来没错
Yeah.

987
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:13,240
渴望谈恋爱与人相通
Dying to be in a relationship and connect,

988
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:16,220
却又害怕让任何人靠近
but terrified to let anybody near you.

989
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:21,750
因为万一有人看清你的真面目呢
Because what if somebody actually saw who you are?

990
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,960
他们怎么可能爱你
How could they love you?

991
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,250
所以每个人都只是目标
So everybody's just targets,

992
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:29,440
你就只是武器
and you're just a weapon.

993
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,250
别开枪
Don't shoot him!

994
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,340
别开枪
Don't shoot him!

995
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:34,670
不  不要
Don't! No!

996
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,030
放下
Drop it!

997
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,160
放下  不然我开枪了
Drop it! I will shoot you!

998
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:40,570
不  你不会的
No, you won't!

999
01:15:19,630 --> 01:15:21,540
放开他
Get your hands off of him!

1000
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:24,380
放开他
Let him go!

1001
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:27,860
马上
Right now!

1002
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:37,360
我不是你
I'm not you!

1003
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:40,470
听到了吗  老头
You hear me, old man?

1004
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:43,080
我不是你
I'm not you!

1005
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:47,940
-他在哪  -他走了
- Where is he? - He's gone.

1006
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:50,290
-你打中他了吗  -应该是
- Did you hit him? - I think so, yeah.

1007
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:53,240
-打哪了  -好像是肩膀
- Where? - Shoulder, I think.

1008
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:57,100
那他就能恢复
Then he'll recover.

1009
01:15:58,370 --> 01:15:59,810
算是好事吗
Is that a good thing?

1010
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,710
要知道  目睹一个人
You know, it's not every day you see

1011
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:23,460
在两大洲上被自己胖揍
a guy get his ass kicked on two continents

1012
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,080
可不常见
by himself.

1013
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:33,520
去哪
Where to?

1014
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:35,770
乔治亚州
Georgia.

1015
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:38,190
威利斯在那儿
It's where Verris is.

1016
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:53,640
天啊
Man.

1017
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:56,750
可怜的孩子
That poor kid.

1018
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:59,360
他一定吓坏了
He must be terrified.

1019
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:03,760
而回家后等着他的更可怕
And he's going home, walking into a buzz saw.

1020
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:10,960
我得睡一会儿了
I need to get some sleep.

1021
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:12,750
你也是
You too.

1022
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:16,650
我不睡  梦里有鬼魂
Not me. That's where the ghosts are.

1023
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:18,990
睡吧
Sleep.

1024
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:45,780
跟我说说
Tell me something.

1025
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:49,850
为什么杀这个人对你这么难
Why is it so hard for you to kill this man?

1026
01:17:52,430 --> 01:17:56,410
你知道我多讨厌大吊床公园吗  老爹
You know how much I hate Big Hammock Park, Pop?

1027
01:17:57,940 --> 01:17:59,220
什么
What?

1028
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:03,160
从十二岁开始
Ever since I was about 12 years old...

1029
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:08,070
每次过生日都去那打火鸡
we would shoot turkeys there for my birthday.

1030
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,710
我一直都很讨厌
And I always hated it.

1031
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:14,500
可我是个孤儿  对吗
But I was an orphan, right?

1032
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:18,340
那是怎么知道我生日是哪天的呢
So, how would we even know when my birthday was?

1033
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:23,750
可你似乎从未察觉  所以就一直去那儿
But you never seemed to notice, so we just keep going.

1034
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:27,120
好吧  明年生日去吃查克奶酪
Okay, so, next year we'll try Chuck E. Cheese.

1035
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:29,900
好
Yeah.

1036
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:32,310
你  我
You, me,

1037
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:35,350
还有实验室把我造出来的那帮人
and the lab guys who made me.

1038
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,320
对
Yeah.

1039
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:48,350
我
I, um...

1040
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,300
一直认为
always believed...

1041
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:57,090
不让你知道你会更快乐
you'd be happier not knowing.

1042
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:00,970
快乐
Happy.

1043
01:19:02,710 --> 01:19:04,440
你知道我什么时候快乐吗  老爹
You know when I'm happy, Pop?

1044
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:07,800
当我趴在地上
When I'm flat on my belly,

1045
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:10,450
即将扣动扳机的那一刻
about to squeeze a trigger.

1046
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:14,530
那是我唯一快乐的时候
It's the only time I'm happy.

1047
01:19:16,370 --> 01:19:18,940
这都算不上什么失误
And this wasn't even a mistake.

1048
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:22,520
这和你把别人肚子搞大
It's not like you got someone pregnant

1049
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,820
不得不负起责任抚养我不一样
and then had to man up and raise me.

1050
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:29,310
是你  做出了决定
No, you made a decision

1051
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:34,130
让科学家用一个人造出另一个人
to have a scientist make a person out of another person.

1052
01:19:34,130 --> 01:19:35,380
不  事情不是这样的
No, that's not what it was.

1053
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:37,360
就是这么回事
That's exactly what it was.

1054
01:19:38,470 --> 01:19:40,440
然后你派我
Then you sent me...

1055
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:42,770
去杀他
to kill him.

1056
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:44,590
全世界那么多枪手
Of all the shooters in the world,

1057
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:46,190
为什么偏偏派我
why would you send me?

1058
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:49,780
他是你的黑暗  你得靠自己走过去
He's your darkness. You had to walk through this on your own.

1059
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,680
也许你才是我的黑暗
Maybe you're my darkness.

1060
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:58,500
你跟我说的谎
That lie you told me...

1061
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:02,010
说我父母
that my parents...

1062
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:06,260
把我遗弃在消防站
dumped me at a fire station.

1063
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:09,910
我相信了
And I believed that.

1064
01:20:11,450 --> 01:20:13,550
你知道那让我有什么感觉吗
Do you know how that made me feel?

1065
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:15,650
那是不得已的谎言
It was a necessary lie.

1066
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,990
这一切都没有什么不得已
None of this shit is necessary!

1067
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,290
你选择了这样对我
You made a choice to do this to me.

1068
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:23,980
你看不出来我有多难过吗
Can't you see how not okay I am?

1069
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:25,500
胡说
Bullshit!

1070
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,590
你忘了自己是在跟谁说话  小克
You forget who you're talking to, Junior.

1071
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,100
我上过战场
I've seen battle.

1072
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,160
我见过士兵
I've seen soldiers

1073
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,910
因为对他们的要求超出了他们的能力而崩溃
go over the edge because more was being asked of them than they could give.

1074
01:20:33,910 --> 01:20:35,420
但你不会
That's not you.

1075
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:38,210
你的世界既稳定又可靠
Your world is stable and dependable.

1076
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:39,580
我保证了这一点
I made sure of that.

1077
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:42,330
你有亨利从来都没有的东西
You have something that Henry himself never had.

1078
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:46,380
你有一个慈爱  无私  顾家的父亲
You have a loving, dedicated, present father,

1079
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:48,020
每一天都告诉你
who tells you every goddamn day

1080
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:50,060
你有多宝贵  多重要
that you are precious and that you matter.

1081
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:52,030
这件事的意义就在于
Jesus, the whole point of this thing

1082
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:53,760
去除亨利的痛苦  把他全部的天赋
was to give you all of Henry's gifts

1083
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,170
都给你  而且我做到了
without his pain, and I did.

1084
01:20:57,160 --> 01:21:00,750
不要怀疑  小克
Don't doubt, Junior.

1085
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:04,270
你能做得更好
You're better than that.

1086
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,250
过来
Come here.

1087
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:23,500
我爱你  儿子
I love you, son.

1088
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:29,300
别让自己失望
Just don't let yourself down.

1089
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,220
就像我的许多艳遇一样
Like so many of my encounters,

1090
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:02,030
短暂而甜蜜
it was short but sweet.

1091
01:22:02,610 --> 01:22:03,520
谢谢  宝贝
Thanks, baby.

1092
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:18,930
这边应该有辆卡车
There should be a truck here somewhere.

1093
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:29,210
别动
Don't move.

1094
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:35,940
子弹里面是什么
What was in that?

1095
01:22:36,850 --> 01:22:37,730
蜂毒
Bee venom.

1096
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,050
不  不  你不能这样
No. No, you can't do that.

1097
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,650
你不能这么做  他过敏
You can't do that. He's allergic!

1098
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:48,570
亨利  你能呼吸吗
Henry, can you breathe?

1099
01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:50,230
亨利  试着呼吸
Henry, try to breathe.

1100
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:52,320
-你没事吧  -拜托
- You okay? - Please.

1101
01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:55,020
亨利  亨利  你能呼吸吗
Henry. Henry, can you breathe?

1102
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:55,780
求你了
Please!

1103
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:58,330
用力呼吸  亨利  亨利
Try to breathe. Henry! Henry!

1104
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:00,290
呼吸
Breathe!

1105
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:02,960
-你为什么这么做  -加油  亨利
- Why are you doing this? - Come on, Henry.

1106
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:09,190
-你为什么这么做  -亨利  亨利  呼吸
- Why are you doing this? - Henry. Henry, breathe. Come on!

1107
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:12,580
呼吸  亨利
Breathe, Henry.

1108
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:25,220
肾上腺素抗组胺剂
Epinephrine antihistamine.

1109
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:29,710
你会没事的
You'll be fine.

1110
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:34,940
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1111
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:37,240
我得确认一下
I had to be sure.

1112
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:39,360
不用  没事
No, it's all good.

1113
01:23:40,370 --> 01:23:42,370
这破事是挺难让人接受的
This whole shit's been a little difficult.

1114
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:43,980
不好意思插个话
I hate to break up the party,

1115
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:46,800
你为什么总能知道我们在哪
but how the hell do you always know where we are?

1116
01:23:49,530 --> 01:23:50,480
他们在追踪你
They're tracking you.

1117
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:55,160
你相信我吗
Do you trust me?

1118
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:22,660
三年前做手术时  他们给你安了芯片
They chipped you... during your surgery three years ago.

1119
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:28,600
威利斯
Verris.

1120
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:31,630
你也认识他
You know him too?

1121
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:34,910
巴拿马  科威特  索马里
Panama. Kuwait. Somalia.

1122
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:36,800
你能带我们去找他吗
Can you take us to him?

1123
01:24:39,630 --> 01:24:41,030
我们得阻止他
We need to shut him down.

1124
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:42,770
我们两个一起
Both of us.

1125
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:56,670
你在费城长大的吧
You grew up in Philadelphia, right?

1126
01:24:57,290 --> 01:24:59,540
对  在一个叫"底部"的地方
Yep. Place called "The Bottom."

1127
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:01,700
底部
The Bottom.

1128
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:05,160
给我讲讲我母亲
Tell me about my mother.

1129
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:10,050
海伦·杰克逊·布罗根
Helen Jackson Brogan.

1130
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:12,630
做两份工作  做了四十年
Worked two jobs for 40 years.

1131
01:25:13,190 --> 01:25:15,270
以前总打我屁股
That woman used to whup my ass.

1132
01:25:16,410 --> 01:25:18,780
-是不是该打  -通常是
- Did you deserve it? - Usually.

1133
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:21,360
臭脾气还特别蠢
Does being angry and stupid

1134
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:24,460
什么事都不上心是不是该打
and never really trying at anything mean you deserve it?

1135
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:27,400
我们的父亲不常在家
Our father wasn't around much.

1136
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,980
我五岁的时候他就离开了
He left when I was five.

1137
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:33,430
我觉得她每次看到我就仿佛看到了他
And I think every time she looked at me, she just saw him, so...

1138
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:36,060
我必须离开那里
I had to get the hell out of there.

1139
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:37,870
参了军
Joined the corps.

1140
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,550
第一次结交了真正的朋友
First time I ever made any real friends.

1141
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:42,300
陆战队
Oorah.

1142
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:45,930
在那认识了克雷·威利斯
Met Clay Verris there.

1143
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:50,150
发现了自己特别特别擅长的事
Found something I was really, really good at.

1144
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:53,790
退役的时候  勋章挂满了前胸
Time I left, I had medals on my chest,

1145
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:58,170
她已经去世了  我成了这个样子
she was gone, and... I had become this.

1146
01:26:00,770 --> 01:26:03,860
你得趁还能脱身的时候尽早脱身
You gotta walk away while you still can.

1147
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:08,260
-我只会这些  -不  他只教了你这些
- This is all I know. - No, this is all he taught you.

1148
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:12,520
现在收手  你还能有别的作为
Stop now, you can still become something else.

1149
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:15,050
行啊
Sure.

1150
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:18,610
医生  律师
A doctor? Lawyer?

1151
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:21,530
丈夫  父亲
Husband. Father.

1152
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:25,110
所有这份工作让你能逃避的事
All the things this job gives you the excuse not to be.

1153
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,310
我把那些都抛弃了
I threw all of that away.

1154
01:26:30,490 --> 01:26:33,300
第二次机会再浪费这些天赋就太可惜了
It'd be a shame to waste these gifts a second time around.

1155
01:26:38,290 --> 01:26:39,700
抱歉  你叫什么名字
I'm sorry, what is your name?

1156
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:43,410
一直都叫我小克
It's always been Junior.

1157
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:45,520
小克雷
Clay Junior.

1158
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:48,890
我也不知道自己是谁了
I don't really know anymore.

1159
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,470
又一个退出的好理由
That's another really good reason to quit.

1160
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:00,330
你确定要这样吗
You sure about this?

1161
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:02,820
我得跟他谈谈
I need to talk to him.

1162
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:07,640
我们见到他之后要怎么办
So, what happens when we get to him?

1163
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:09,460
他是不会投降的
He's not gonna surrender.

1164
01:27:18,430 --> 01:27:19,160
是他
It's him.

1165
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:20,530
我能跟他通话吗
Can I talk to him?

1166
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:23,240
我想亲口告诉他我们现在是死党了
I want to be the one to tell him we're all BFFs now.

1167
01:27:25,050 --> 01:27:25,790
接吧
Take it.

1168
01:27:27,790 --> 01:27:28,690
我是小克
This is Junior.

1169
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:30,310
你和布罗根在一起吗
Are you with Brogan?

1170
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:33,210
我为什么要跟他在一起  你不是派我去杀他吗
Why would I be with him? You sent me to kill him, didn't you?

1171
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:34,800
不重要了  快跑
Doesn't matter. Just run.

1172
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:37,820
什么
What?

1173
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:39,750
跑  离他远点  快
Run. Get away from him, now.

1174
01:27:40,430 --> 01:27:42,490
小克  我只想让你安全无事
Junior, I just want you safe.

1175
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:43,400
为什么
Why?

1176
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:45,970
因为我是你最爱的实验品
Because I'm your favorite experiment?

1177
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:49,370
不  因为我是你父亲  你要听我的
No, because I'm your father and you need to listen to me.

1178
01:27:49,450 --> 01:27:50,230
快跑
Run!

1179
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:55,000
-下车  -快  快
- Get out of the car! - Go, go!

1180
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:01,390
巴伦
Baron!

1181
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:03,450
不
No!

1182
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:17,080
快走
Come on!

1183
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:26,900
很遗憾  亨利
I'm sorry, Henry.

1184
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:34,560
下车  快  快
Move out. Go! Go!

1185
01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:36,820
-米切尔队长  -请讲
- Chief Mitchell? - Go ahead.

1186
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:39,930
我是克雷·威利斯  我要你的小队撤退
Clay Verris. I need your units to stand down.

1187
01:28:40,050 --> 01:28:40,570
长官
Sir?

1188
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:42,320
我们正在对付一个
We're engaging with a terror cell

1189
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,980
拥有生物武器的恐怖组织
that has a weaponized biological capability.

1190
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:47,370
各单位  立即撤退
All units, fall back immediately.

1191
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:52,440
已经通知联邦当局  他们正在路上
Federal authorities have been notified and are en route.

1192
01:28:52,710 --> 01:28:54,760
收到  保持联络  克雷
Affirmative. Keep me posted, Clay.

1193
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:55,780
好的  长官
Yes, sir.

1194
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,130
你得让手下的人撤退
You gotta stand your men down now.

1195
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:03,330
小克  你做了正确选择  离开了他
You did the right thing, Junior, walking away from him.

1196
01:29:03,330 --> 01:29:05,170
我做了懦夫做的事
I did what a coward would do.

1197
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:06,890
让我恶心
Makes me sick!

1198
01:29:07,190 --> 01:29:09,080
我对你要求过高了
I was asking too much of you.

1199
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:11,050
我现在明白了
I can see that now.

1200
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:14,820
他不该在车上被导弹炸死  老爹
He deserves better than a missile shot into his car, Pop.

1201
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:16,830
他怎么死不重要
It doesn't matter what he deserves.

1202
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:18,030
他必须死
He has to die.

1203
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,180
现在你可以命令那些杀手撤退了吗
Are you gonna call those goons off now?

1204
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:00,920
不  但你可以
No. But you can.

1205
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:04,240
只要开枪  接管指挥
Just fire that. Take command.

1206
01:30:05,310 --> 01:30:06,480
装甲的弱点在接缝处
Armor is weak at the joints.

1207
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,190
击中眼睛和脖子最致命
Eyes and neck are the kill shots.

1208
01:30:08,610 --> 01:30:10,060
你负责右边  我负责左边
Take right, I take left.

1209
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:18,050
记住枪战准则
Muzzle discipline.

1210
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:21,190
注意还剩几发子弹  你装子弹  我进攻
Watch your round count. You set, I spike.

1211
01:30:21,190 --> 01:30:22,520
-准备好了吗  -了解
- Ready? - Roger that.

1212
01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:40,900
-没子弹了  -找掩护
- I'm out. - Take cover.

1213
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:50,280
装好了
Set!

1214
01:31:02,450 --> 01:31:03,220
扔手雷
Frag out!

1215
01:31:21,970 --> 01:31:25,630
我是想让你成为男子汉
I am trying to make you a man!

1216
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:29,940
我该克隆我自己的
I should've cloned myself.

1217
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:41,160
"慈爱  无私  顾家的父亲"
"Loving, dedicated, present father."

1218
01:31:43,710 --> 01:31:44,420
右边
Right side!

1219
01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:50,810
来吧
Go ahead.

1220
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:53,290
动手
Do it.

1221
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:05,950
你还剩多少子弹
How many rounds you got left?

1222
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:10,480
一发
One.

1223
01:32:11,210 --> 01:32:12,090
好吧
Okay.

1224
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:22,500
对不起
I'm sorry.

1225
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:23,800
为什么
For what?

1226
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:25,710
把你卷进这事
For getting you into this.

1227
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:27,590
是我先监视你的
I was the one surveilling you.

1228
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:28,640
是啊
Yeah.

1229
01:32:29,870 --> 01:32:31,960
不过还是对不起
Anyway, sorry.

1230
01:32:33,490 --> 01:32:34,920
现在一起杀出去吧
Now let's fight our way out of this thing.

1231
01:33:11,350 --> 01:33:12,580
你是个很棒的搭档
You're a great partner.

1232
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:43,160
谢谢
Thank you.

1233
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:44,980
抱歉我跑掉了
Sorry I ran.

1234
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:47,440
没关系  今晚战局混乱
Yeah, well, it's been a rough night.

1235
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:48,740
外面还有多少人
How many more out there?

1236
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:50,460
我看没有了
I didn't see any.

1237
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:51,950
威利斯呢
Verris?

1238
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:53,890
昏迷了
Out of commission.

1239
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:56,110
但还活着吗
But still alive?

1240
01:33:59,180 --> 01:33:59,890
对
Yes.

1241
01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:30,640
给你
Here.

1242
01:34:31,470 --> 01:34:32,340
伤势严重吗
How bad is that?

1243
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:33,690
我没事
I'm fine.

1244
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:36,310
你有事
You're not.

1245
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:40,760
在高处守着  我们得保住出口
Hold the elevated position. We're gonna secure an out.

1246
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:52,720
退后
Back off!

1247
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:20,770
你感觉不到痛吗
Don't you feel pain?

1248
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:55,360
我不知道你为何如此生气  亨利
I don't know why you're so angry, Henry.

1249
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:08,560
这一切的灵感都源于你
You were the inspiration for all of this.

1250
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:22,930
你知道我怎么想到的吗  你还好吗
You know where I got the idea? Are you okay?

1251
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,170
卡夫奇
Khafji.

1252
01:38:29,210 --> 01:38:30,420
看着你挨家挨户地战斗
Watching you go house to house,

1253
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:32,280
真希望我能有一支精锐部队
wishing I had a whole division of men

1254
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:33,790
都和你一样优秀
all as good as you.

1255
01:38:34,580 --> 01:38:36,470
我想看看这能不能实现
Wondering if that could be possible.

1256
01:38:37,630 --> 01:38:38,900
你该感到荣幸
You should be flattered.

1257
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:42,790
你该去死
You should be dead.

1258
01:38:43,630 --> 01:38:45,200
你看见当时的情景了
You saw what happened over there.

1259
01:38:46,530 --> 01:38:47,800
血腥暴行
Atrocities.

1260
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:52,430
用棺材把朋友们送回家
Friends being sent home in a pine box.

1261
01:38:52,470 --> 01:38:55,750
如果有更好的出路  我们为什么要接受那一切
Why should we accept that if there's a better way?

1262
01:38:59,130 --> 01:39:01,460
看看我们创造了什么
And look what we created.

1263
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:08,690
他身上有你和我的影子
He's got both of us in him.

1264
01:39:10,530 --> 01:39:14,830
你不觉得祖国值得拥有一个完美版的你吗
Don't you think your country deserves a perfect version of you?

1265
01:39:15,140 --> 01:39:17,280
没有什么完美版的我
There is no perfect version of me.

1266
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:20,370
完美版的他  或是任何人
Or him. Or anybody.

1267
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:21,360
没有吗
No?

1268
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:23,960
他本该前往也门
He was on his way to Yemen.

1269
01:39:23,970 --> 01:39:25,790
现在拜你所赐  某对父母的孩子
Now, thanks to you, his place is gonna be taken

1270
01:39:25,790 --> 01:39:27,380
将代替他征战
by someone with parents.

1271
01:39:27,690 --> 01:39:30,620
这个人能感受到痛苦和恐惧
Someone who feels pain, fear,

1272
01:39:30,890 --> 01:39:32,910
而我们去除了他的这些知觉
which we had edited out of him.

1273
01:39:32,910 --> 01:39:35,440
这个人身上的弱点
Someone with just as many weaknesses

1274
01:39:35,670 --> 01:39:37,130
和我们要杀戮的恐怖分子一样多
as the terrorists that we're trying to kill.

1275
01:39:37,130 --> 01:39:38,610
你要告诉我这样更好吗
And you're gonna tell me that's better?

1276
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:42,380
那干脆造出一整支军队吧
So why not make a whole army of them?

1277
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:44,000
对  为什么不呢
Yeah. Why not?

1278
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:47,620
想想我们能让多少美国家庭免于参战
Think how many American families we could spare.

1279
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:50,680
不用再牺牲谁家的儿子或女儿
Nobody's son or daughter would ever have to die.

1280
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:53,760
不会再有老兵退役回乡  患上创伤后应激障碍再自杀
No vet comes home with PTSD and kills himself.

1281
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:58,890
我们保卫世界安全  也不会带来现实中的不幸
We can keep the whole world safe without any actual grief.

1282
01:39:58,890 --> 01:40:00,880
所以...我伤害了谁
So... who would I be hurting?

1283
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:04,140
你谈论的可是人  克雷
You're talking about people, Clay.

1284
01:40:05,450 --> 01:40:06,190
亨利
Henry.

1285
01:40:07,610 --> 01:40:10,480
这是双子做过的最人道的事
This is the most humane thing that Gemini's ever done.

1286
01:40:11,410 --> 01:40:13,550
还有多少跟我一样的人
How many more of me are running around out there?

1287
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:17,060
只有一个你  小克
There's only one you, Junior.

1288
01:40:18,970 --> 01:40:20,090
他只是个武器
He was a weapon.

1289
01:40:21,370 --> 01:40:22,340
你是我儿子
You're my son.

1290
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:25,850
我爱你
And I love you...

1291
01:40:27,630 --> 01:40:30,910
跟所有爱孩子的父亲一样
as much as any father ever loved any kid.

1292
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:36,900
我没有父亲
I don't have a father.

1293
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:39,640
再见  克雷
Goodbye, Clay.

1294
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:50,910
那我们要怎么做
So what the hell are we gonna do, huh?

1295
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:55,070
将他归罪  他不会受到审讯
Gonna turn him in? They're not gonna try him.

1296
01:40:55,070 --> 01:40:56,770
他们不会关掉他的实验室
They're not gonna shut down his lab.

1297
01:40:57,420 --> 01:40:59,440
我们现在得了结这一切
We have to end this right now.

1298
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:02,300
看着我
Look at me.

1299
01:41:04,650 --> 01:41:05,410
看着我
Look at me.

1300
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:08,740
你扣下扳机
You pull that trigger,

1301
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:11,800
就会破坏你内心的一部分
and you're gonna break something inside of yourself...

1302
01:41:13,340 --> 01:41:15,080
再也无法愈合
that'll never get fixed again.

1303
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:24,830
不要
Don't.

1304
01:41:30,690 --> 01:41:31,390
放手吧
Let it go.

1305
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:33,780
把枪给我
Give it to me.

1306
01:41:40,190 --> 01:41:41,780
你可不想被鬼魂缠上
You don't want those ghosts.

1307
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:43,860
相信我
Trust me.

1308
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:25,510
你知道不该喝酒的
You should know better than that.

1309
01:42:27,450 --> 01:42:28,940
很惊讶你还在乎
Surprised you give a shit.

1310
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:32,440
我们不能做朋友了
Well, we can't be friends anymore.

1311
01:42:33,970 --> 01:42:35,820
因为你没阻止他们杀我
Because you did let them try to kill me.

1312
01:42:36,370 --> 01:42:39,110
但不意味着我想看到你把自己喝死
But doesn't mean I want to see you drink yourself to death.

1313
01:42:41,510 --> 01:42:43,430
双子实验室被拆了
The Gemini lab's been dismantled.

1314
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:45,940
克隆项目已成历史
Cloning program is history.

1315
01:42:48,170 --> 01:42:49,060
那小克呢
And Junior?

1316
01:42:50,410 --> 01:42:51,340
没人能动他
He's untouchable.

1317
01:42:51,950 --> 01:42:54,050
再也不会有人去打扰他
No one will bother him, ever.

1318
01:42:55,370 --> 01:42:57,900
我们查过了  没有其他克隆人了
And we checked, there are no more clones.

1319
01:42:59,090 --> 01:42:59,900
那你呢
What about you?

1320
01:43:01,430 --> 01:43:02,430
检察长来电了
IG called.

1321
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:04,320
我要被起诉了
I'm looking at charges,

1322
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:07,780
但如果我供出简妮特  就能争取脱罪
but if I bury Janet, I can make a deal.

1323
01:43:09,210 --> 01:43:10,110
她活该
Well, she earned it.

1324
01:43:14,410 --> 01:43:16,050
我真的很抱歉  亨利
I'm really sorry, Henry.

1325
01:43:20,450 --> 01:43:21,460
保重  德尔
Take care, Del.

1326
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:22,820
你也是
Yeah, you too.

1327
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:25,090
祝你退休愉快
And happy retirement.

1328
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:46,470
{\an9}六个月后

1329
01:44:03,710 --> 01:44:04,540
很高兴见到你
Good to see you.

1330
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:07,020
恭喜升职
Congrats on the promotion.

1331
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:08,490
我听说他们制定了宏大计划
I hear they got big plans.

1332
01:44:08,490 --> 01:44:11,370
和你经历过这段  没什么是我不能搞定的
Well, after you, pretty sure I can handle anything.

1333
01:44:12,630 --> 01:44:14,470
-你过得怎么样  -很好
- How have you been? - Good.

1334
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:17,180
我刚处理完巴伦的后事
I just, uh, settled Baron's estate,

1335
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:19,240
把他的骨灰撒在了加勒比海
scattered his ashes in the Caribbean.

1336
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:22,210
我不知道  现在我只想
I don't know. All I want to do now is

1337
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:23,650
为世界做点贡献
put some good in the world.

1338
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:25,640
我只是要找到方法
I just got to figure out how.

1339
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:27,350
你会找到的
Yeah, you will.

1340
01:44:28,530 --> 01:44:29,630
你睡得还好吗
You, uh, sleeping okay?

1341
01:44:30,630 --> 01:44:31,330
好些了
Better.

1342
01:44:31,830 --> 01:44:34,410
-没有鬼魂了  -不像以前那样了
- No ghosts? - Not like before.

1343
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:37,420
还有前几天我居然照镜子了
And I actually looked in a mirror the other day.

1344
01:44:37,630 --> 01:44:39,730
-真的吗  -没什么可怕的
- Really? - It wasn't horrendous.

1345
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:42,640
说到镜子...
Speaking of mirrors...

1346
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,850
-待会儿见  -待会儿见
- Catch you later. - See you later, man.

1347
01:45:12,130 --> 01:45:12,880
这是什么
What's this?

1348
01:45:13,170 --> 01:45:14,970
这是你
This is you.

1349
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:15,580
{\an8}护照

1350
01:45:15,230 --> 01:45:18,860
护照  出生证明  驾照
Passport, birth certificate, driver's license.

1351
01:45:18,860 --> 01:45:20,550
显然你的信用记录不错
Apparently you got pretty good credit.

1352
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:23,470
我喜欢你选的这个名字
I love the name you chose.

1353
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:26,410
杰克逊  这是我母亲的名字
Jackson? It was my mother's name.

1354
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:28,700
她先是我的母亲
She was my mother first.

1355
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:29,830
是啊  是啊
Yeah, yeah.

1356
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,230
别敷衍我  年轻人
Don't you "Yeah, yeah" me, young man.

1357
01:45:33,550 --> 01:45:35,480
走吧  我知道一家吃午饭的好餐厅
Come on. I know a great place for lunch.

1358
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:41,330
你选定专业了吗
So you settled on a major yet?

1359
01:45:41,650 --> 01:45:43,110
倾向于选工程学
Leaning towards engineering.

1360
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:44,010
工程学
Engineering?

1361
01:45:45,250 --> 01:45:46,910
对  你该听她的
Yeah, you should listen to her.

1362
01:45:47,650 --> 01:45:48,420
我要是你
If I were you,

1363
01:45:48,590 --> 01:45:50,010
在某种意义上我就是你
which I sort of am,

1364
01:45:50,550 --> 01:45:52,020
我会学计算机科学
I'd go with computer science.

1365
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:54,450
那是读研究生的事了  你该从人文学科起步
Save that for grad school. You want to start in humanities.

1366
01:45:54,460 --> 01:45:56,400
-好吧  还是别听她的  -别听他的才对
- Okay, don't listen to her. - Don't listen to him.

1367
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:57,890
你需要学习经典打基础
You need a grounding in the classics.

1368
01:45:57,900 --> 01:46:00,250
不好意思  我在跟我自己讨论呢
Look, excuse me, I'm trying to talk with myself here.

1369
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:02,280
对  你在自说自话  而不是对他说话
Yeah. You're talking to yourself, but you're not talking to him.

1370
01:46:02,290 --> 01:46:04,770
我年轻时犯过很多错
Look, I just made a lot of mistakes when I was young--

1371
01:46:04,770 --> 01:46:07,650
实际上  有些错误我想自己去经历
And I'd actually like to make some of those mistakes myself.

1372
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:08,940
我想说的是
What I'm trying to say is,

1373
01:46:08,950 --> 01:46:10,580
你不必重蹈我的覆辙
I made them already so you don't have to.

1374
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:11,520
但他不是你
Yeah, but he's not you.

1375
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:15,260
好了二位  冷静冷静
Okay. Everybody, chill the hell out.

1376
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:18,250
我会没事的
I'm gonna be okay.

1377
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:24,360
你没事
If you're okay...

1378
01:46:26,110 --> 01:46:26,890
我就没事
I'm okay.

1379
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:31,410
怎么了
What?

1380
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:35,070
我只是不敢相信三十年后
I just can't believe that in 30 years,

1381
01:46:35,070 --> 01:46:36,860
我会长成你这样
I'm gonna look like you.

1382
01:46:37,620 --> 01:46:39,870
什么  拜托  你倒想呢
What? Please. You wish.

1383
01:46:40,770 --> 01:46:43,590
小子  你最好祈祷三十年后能跟我一样
Boy, you better hope you look like me in 30 years.

1384
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:47,010
站在你面前的是
This is 50-year-old,

1385
01:46:47,180 --> 01:46:50,930
五十岁的成熟猛男
mature man meat you're looking at.

1386
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:51,960
是五十一岁
Fifty-one.

1387
01:46:52,150 --> 01:46:55,330
我认真刷牙  用牙线  我努力工作
I brush. I floss. I work hard.

1388
01:46:55,950 --> 01:46:58,440
等你到了五十岁  我打赌你不会
When you're 50, I bet you won't be dragging your ass

1389
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:00,620
像我一样每天早上爬起来跑步
around the track every morning like I do.

1390
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:03,510
其实我们现在就可以赛跑
In fact, we can race now.

1391
01:47:04,420 --> 01:47:07,200
马上就跑  现在就跑去那个拐角
We can race right now. We'll take it to the corner right now.
