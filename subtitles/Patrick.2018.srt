你是说你在监视我
You mean you were spying on me

4

不，我只是路过

你为什么不能告诉我真相？

真相？行

有人吗？我以为我是你的人

听着，我只是需要一些空间，想想事情

12
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,040
但是我们刚刚搬进来

听着，我会过来收集我的东西

14
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,840
当你平静下来的时候

15
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,010
冷静？哦，我非常平静

21
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,800

是的，谢谢
Yes, thanks

23
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,210

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,920
我想她大概三十三岁了
I think she's probably 33

30
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,060
你到底去了哪里？遗憾的

奶奶的朋友邓肯不得不帮你读书

这群人正在喝茶

41
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,380

至少他准时

45
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,220
你能告诉我洗手间在哪里吗？

你没事吧？是的，亲爱的

51
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,110
无限远，超越莎拉阿姨！

52
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,320
不，厕所不是那样的

53
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,690
哦，这就是你们都藏的地方

54
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,090
我们真的应该整天看电视吗？
Should we really be watching telly, today of all days?

55
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,360
来吧，卡罗琳，他们在外面太无聊了
Come on, Caroline. It's so boring for them out there

56
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,990
总之，这对他们的单身阿姨来说很好

57
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,560
拥抱侄女和侄子
to have an armful of niece and nephew

58
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,130
妈妈对爸爸说，当你真的老了
Mummy said to Daddy that when you're really old,

59
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,730
你将全靠你自己

60
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,040
呃，扎卡里，你介意来吗
Erm, Zachary, would you mind just coming

61
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,100
当你死了，他们只会发现你的骨架
And when you die, all they'll find will be your skeleton

62
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,200
还有很多非常胖的猫

请你注意一下好吗？

64
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,460
虽然我母亲留下了正式遗嘱

65
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,860
她还想让我读出她个人愿望的清单

66
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,960
她希望下面的人去她家
She would like the following people to go to her home

67
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,100
并选择一个项目让他们想起她

68

72
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,980

你了解我，爱他们，离开他们

Well, it's probably for the best I wasn't very taken

77
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,790
我希望当时人们会说些什么
I wish people would say something at the time

78
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,900
而不是等到那个人走了
rather than waiting till the person's gone

79
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,730
我不想干涉

哦，太棒了

00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,260
安全驾驶，亲爱的
Drive safely, darling

141
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,240
好吧，你真的吓坏我了
Okay, you're really freaking me out now

142
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,910
你不能看看窗外吗？很好
Can't you look out the window? It's nice

143
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,170
有一座城堡和一切
There's a castle and everything

144
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,020
慢炖兔子？
Slow-cooked rabbit ragout?

145
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,720
三块九毛九？
￡3.99?

146
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,120
人们很容易受骗，我敢打赌都是一样的东西
People are so gullible I bet it's all the same stuff

147
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,490
把它放回去
Put it back

148
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,130
给我看看你从哪里得到的
Show me where you got it from

149
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,670
哦，坚持住对不起，那不是我的
Oh. Hang on Sorry. That's not mine

150
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,600
不知道这是怎么进来的
Don't know how that got in there

151
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,440
我怀疑一个小家伙有一张可爱的压扁的脸
I suspect a little person with an adorable squashed face

152
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,080
把它放在那里，这样妈妈以后会有一些好吃的
put it in there so Mummy'd have some treats for later

153
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,020
嗯，他可以吃一些妈妈提供的巧克力
Well, he can have some of Mummy's not inconsiderable supply of chocolate instead

154
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,420
你不知道巧克力对他们有毒吗？
Don't you know chocolate's poisonous for them?

155
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,050
真的吗？哦，对妈妈来说尤其如此
Really? Oh, well All the more for Mummy

156
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,630
好吧，你现在吓坏我了，是我开车还是
Okay, you're freaking me out now Is it my driving or is

157
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,000
哦
Oh

158
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,340
停止
Stop

159
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,080
好吧，不要引起你的注意
Okay, don't draw attention to yourself

160
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,220
你好
Hi

161
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,250
租金周四到期
Rent's due Thursday

162
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,260
祝你晚上愉快
Have a nice evening

163
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,500
对，首先，我们要摆脱这套可笑的服装
Right, first thing, we're getting out of this ridiculous outfit

164
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,040
第二，我要在Facebook上和可能在Tinder上公开你的身份
Secondly, I'm putting you up for grabs on Facebook and possibly Tinder

165
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,170
我的意思是，如果有邻居抓到我们，上帝会帮助我们的
I mean, God help us if any of the neighbors catch us

166
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,640
我说真的，帕特里克
I mean it, Patrick

167
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,280
一声咕哝、低吼或在错误的地方吠叫
One grunt, growl or bark in the wrong place

168
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,150
我们都将在里士满公园吃兔肉
and we'll both be in Richmond Park eating rabbit ragout

169
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,220
我知道这听起来不错，但不会
I know that sounds nice, but it won't be

170
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,840
帕特里克
Patrick

171
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,210
现在是早上六点
It's 6:00 in the morning

172
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,760
正确
Right

173
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,630
我们开始吧
Here we go

174
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,540
继续，享受
Go on. Enjoy

175
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,380
来吧，我以为你绝望了
Come on. I thought you were desperate

176
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,380
现在你让我想去
Now you're making me want to go

177
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,130
哦，我的上帝！呃，你在这里做什么？
Oh, my God! Erm What are you doing here?

178
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,800
哦，对不起，我没想到会有客人
Oh, I'm sorry I wasn't expecting company

179
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,900
啊，我明白了，另一个犯法者
Ah. Another law-breaker, I see

180
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:11,140
好吧，你必须小心，你永远不知道谁会告发你
Well, you have to keep an eye out. You never know who might turn you in

181
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,470
名字？
Name?

182
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,310
莎拉·杰西卡·罗斯玛丽·弗朗西斯
Sarah Jessica Rosemary Francis

183
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,440
不，你的狗
No, your dog

184
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,910
帕特里克
Oh, Patrick

185
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,880
他真的不是我的狗
He's not really my dog

186
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,810
我祖母把他留给了我
My grandmother left him to me

187
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,150
我真的需要给他找个家
I really need to find him a home

188
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,480
你不能这么做他是遗产
You can't do that He's a bequest

189
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,450
你不能把他卖给第一个出价人
You can't just pack him off to the first bidder

190
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,390
我是一名教师，我是说，我不能带他一起去
I'm a teacher. I mean, I can't take him with me

191
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,760
我不能把他一个人留在这里
And I can't leave him here on his own

192
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,490
我相信你会找到办法的
Well, I'm sure you'll find a way

193
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,760
谢谢
Thanks

194
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,830
多好的女孩
What a good girl

195
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,130
你来这儿没多久
You haven't been here long

196
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,700
刚搬进来
Just moved in

197
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,500
这里
Here

198
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,600
哦，不，谢谢你
Oh. No, thanks Not for you

199
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:50,340
这是给狗的，你必须捡起帕特里克的便便
It's for the dog. You've got to pick up Patrick's poo

200
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,740
是的，对吧
Yes, right

201
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,840
我是西莉亚
I'm Celia,

202
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,250
这是温迪
and this is Wendy

203
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,180
呃，我们最好离开
Erm. We'd better be off

204
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,420
是的，再见
Yep. See you around

205
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,760
或者没有，眨眼，眨眼
Or not. Wink, wink

206
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,160
帕特里克，这太恶心了
Patrick, that's gross

207
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,270
我知道这是个坏主意
I knew this was a bad idea

208
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,380
我告诉他们了，我告诉他们这行不通，但是他们会听我的吗？
I told them. I told them it wouldn't work, but would they listen to me?

209
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,750
老实说，还有一件事，你就要被解雇了，我受够了
Honestly, one more thing and you're off to the pound. I have had it

210
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,580
电子战！哦
Ew! Oh

211
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,450
哦
Oh

212
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,320
哦，真恶心
Oh, that is disgusting

213
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,260
你怎么了？
What is the matter with you?

214
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,920
我是说，都是食物
I mean, it's all food

215
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,660
如果你饿了，你会吃的
If you were hungry, you would eat it

216
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,960
我不能这么做
I can't be doing

217
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,270
啊！
Ugh!

218
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,680
帕特里克
Patrick

219
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,690
帕特里克？帕特里克？
Patrick? Patrick?

220
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,230
帕特里克！
Patrick!

221
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,330
我刚刚换了床
I've just changed that bed

222
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,430
不不
No. No

223
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,730
我知道奶奶过去惯于宠坏你
I know Granny used to spoil you rotten

224
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,440
但是当你在这里的时候，你处于一个新的政权之下
But while you're here, you're under a new regime

225
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,640
冰箱不准放
The fridge is out of bounds

226
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,440
我不是因为拿走它们而出名
Not that I'm known for taking them,

227
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,540
但是在公园散步可能会增强老年人的食欲
but a walk in the park may sharpen the old appetite

228
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,540
运气好的话，你会筋疲力尽的
With any luck, you'll wear yourself out

229
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
帕特里克脚跟
Patrick, heel

230
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,590
帕特里克
Patrick

231
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,460
脚跟，脚后跟
Heel. Heel

232
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,630
帕特里克
Patrick

233
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,500
帕特里克
Patrick

234
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,540
把事情控制住
Get that thing under control

235
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:29,970
- 对不起，帕特里克  - 你在干什么？
- Sorry. Patrick.  - What are you doing?

236
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,440
帕特里克
Patrick

237
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,570
帕特里克，来这里
Patrick. Come here

238
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,510
帕特里克，我是认真的，我说真的，帕特里克过来
Patrick, I mean it. I mean it, Patrick Come here

239
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,720
哦，上帝，帕特里克！
Oh, God. Patrick!

240
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,920
来吧，好孩子
Come. Good boy

241
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:54,260
好吧，留下来，好孩子，留下来，好孩子
Okay. Stay. Good boy Stay. Good boy

242
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,860
停下！
Stop!

243
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,930
哦，不！
Oh, no!

244
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,780
为什么，奶奶？为什么？
Why, Grandma? Why?

245
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,720
我尽可能来看你
I came to see you whenever I could

246
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,620
我从未打断过你，尽管我已经听过你的故事二十次了
I never interrupted, even though I'd heard your stories 20 times

247
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,690
我做错了什么？
What did I do wrong?

248
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,650
你有机会吗？
Yours by any chance?

249
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,120
差不多，哦，可怜的狗
Sort of. Oh, wretched dog

250
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,480
谢谢你抓住他，没关系
Thanks for catching him That's okay

251
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,020
哦，上帝，多么大的灾难
Oh, God. What a disaster

252
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,450
我已经和祖母的哈巴狗在一起了
I've been landed with my grandmother's pug

253
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,560
我甚至不想要一只我讨厌的狗
I don't even want a dog I hate dogs

254
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,830
你不讨厌狗
You don't hate dogs

255
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,130
不，也许我只是讨厌这个
No. Maybe I just hate this one

256
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,900
你抓他多久了？
How long have you got him for?

257
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,030
呃，我不知道，他九岁了，健康状况非常好
Er, I don't know. He's nine and in annoyingly good health

258
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,770
如果你幸运的话，也许五年
Maybe five years, then, if you're lucky

259
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,900
五年？
Five years?

260
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,110
我会因为持械抢劫得到更少的报酬
I'd get less for armed robbery

261
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,110
哦，这只是出牙的问题
Oh, it's just teething problems

262
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,810
你只需要了解对方
You just need to get to know each other,

263
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,880
形成一种理解，就像任何关系
form an understanding It's like any relationship

264
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,920
真的吗？
Really?

265
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,550
他会期待我捡起他的内裤
He'll be expecting me to pick up his underpants

266
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:24,920
几周后
in a few weeks' time

267
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,820
好吧，你们会互相信任，好吧
Well, you'll get to trust each other and, well,

268
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,720
你会想知道没有他你会怎样生活
you'll wonder how you ever lived without him

269
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,620
你和我有非常不同的感情经历
You and I have very different relationship experiences

270
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,130
但是我可以试试看
But I could give it a go

271
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,460
不要轻易放弃他
Don't give up on him too easily

272
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,960
他是个可爱的小家伙，真的
He's quite a cute little fella, really

273
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
呵
Ooh

274
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,540
我能帮你回到停车场吗？
Can I give you a hand back to the car park?

275
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,440
谢谢你，我可以给它一两分钟
Thank you. I might give it a minute or two

276
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,610
以防其他步行者在我回到车上之前用石头打我
In case the other walkers stone me before I get back to the car

277
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,780
暂时让他领先
Keep him on the lead for the time being

278
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,980
他是个男人，他对明确的指示做出了回应
He's a man. He responds to clear instruction

279
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,080
哦，我会的，谢谢你
Oh. I will. Thank you

280
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,580
好吧，再见？
Well, see you around?

281
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,990
是
Yeah

282
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:15,470
大多数狗带回一只兔子，帕特里克，做得好
Most dogs bring back a rabbit Well done, Patrick

283
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,580
几周后，他会期待我帮他捡起内裤
In a few weeks' time, he'll be expecting me to pick up his underpants.

284
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,800
不，帕特里克
No, Patrick

285
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,760
家具上没有，好吗？
Not on the furniture, okay?

286
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,970
这是新政权的一部分
It's part of the new regime

287
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,600
明天开学第一天
First day of school tomorrow

288
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,970
我要你留在这里，尽情娱乐，直到我回来，好吗？
I want you to stay here and entertain yourself until I get back, okay?

289
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,740
祝我好运
And wish me luck

290
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,850
哦
Oh

291
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,920
谢谢你的支持
Thanks for the support

292
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,200
不
No

293
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,330
不不不不！
No, no, no, no

294
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,130
不不不！不不不！
No, no, no, no, no

295
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,470
我第一天就迟到了
My first day and I'm late

296
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,800
呵
Ooh

297
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,910
好吧，我来了，但是快点
Okay, I'm coming, but be quick

298
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,250
哦！
Oh!

299
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,250
帕特里克，你吃了什么？
Patrick, what have you eaten?

300
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,990
哦，上帝
Oh, God

301
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,890
哦，真恶心
Oh, that is disgusting

302
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,990
哦，上帝，哦，上帝
Oh, God. Oh, God

303
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,030
很高兴它从两端出来
Well, glad it's coming out of both ends

304
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,670
不不
No. No

305
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,270
不，不，帕特里克
No, no, Patrick

306
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:00,810
哦，不
Oh, no

307
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,840
帕特里克
Patrick

308
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,810
帕特里克，就这样，过来来吧，进步
Patrick, that's it. Come here Come on. Come along

好孩子，是啊，好孩子，开始
Good boy. Yeah, good boy. Come on

313
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,790
这是什么？来吧，帕特里克
What's this? Come on Come on, Patrick

314
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,660
是的，是的，是的，是的，是的，是的

315
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,860
开始

316
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,700
帕特里克！
Patrick!

317
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,800
帕特里克，马上来
Patrick, get here right now

318
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:40,850
帕特里克，我真的很生气！
Patrick, I am really very angry!

319
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,350
如果你现在不到这里
And if you don't get here right now,

320
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,790
我第一天就要失业了
I am gonna lose my job on my first day

321
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,690
我必须住在桥下的纸板箱里
And I'm gonna have to live in a cardboard box under a bridge

322
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:55,090
没有人会爱我
and no one's ever gonna love me,

323
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,030
我的生活就要结束了
and my life is gonna be over

324
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,840
抓住了
Gotcha

325
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,440
现在，我将在四点半回来
Now, I'll be back at 4: 30

326
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,950
我不在的时候，请不要碰任何东西
Please don't touch anything while I'm gone

327
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,810
跑吧
And run

328
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,380
对不起，对不起
Sorry, excuse me

329
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,290
对不起，走开，请下车
Excuse me, off. Off, please

330
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,260
早上好！
Good morning!

331
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,270
行
Okay

332
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:16,240
总是管用，早上好，请坐
Always works. Good morning Please take your seats

333
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,710
我是弗朗西斯小姐，你的新英语老师
I'm Miss Francis, your new English teacher

334
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,180
好吧，如果你能向我介绍一下自己，请
Okay. If you could just introduce yourselves to me, please

335
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,050
好吧，那你怎么拼写呢？
Okay. And how do you spell that?

336
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,460
在这么短的时间内，我只能得到她
She was all I could get at such short notice

337
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,330
我打赌你会和弗朗西斯小姐有纪律问题
Well, I'm betting you'll have disciplinary problems with Miss Francis

338
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,370
哦，啊！欢迎
Oh. Ah! Well, welcome

339
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,340
谢谢你
Thank you

340
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,200
嗨，不要以为我们见过我是莎拉·弗朗西斯
Hi. Don't think we've met I'm Sarah Francis

341
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,240
我主修纪律
I major in discipline

342
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,850
好吧，好吧，我一会儿再来找你
Okay, right. Well, I'll catch you later

343
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,350
大错特错，大错特错
Big mistake. Huge mistake

344
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,830
嗨，你一定是莎拉，新来的女孩
Hi. You must be Sarah, the new girl

345
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,400
嗨，是的，我是贝基，开始
Hi. Yeah I'm Becky. Come on

346
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,870
不要让这些阻碍了你
Don't let this lot put you off

347
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,310
请原谅
If you'll excuse me

348
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,540
别介意老彼得斯他不喜欢改变
Don't mind old Peters He doesn't like change

349
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,210
或者英语老师或者金发女郎
Or English teachers Or blondes

350
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,610
让开，莫林，这是莎拉
Budge up, Maureen This is Sarah

351
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,880
你好，她教十一年级英语
Hello. She teaches year 11 English

352
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,550
你想要一块摇滚蛋糕吗？
Would you like a rock cake?

353
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,520
哦，谢谢
Oh. Thanks

354
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,050
你们班做的啊
Your class made those Ah

355
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,990
是的，线索在名字里
Yep. Clue's in the name

356
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,420
让我们希望他们的英语好一点
Let's hope their English is a bit better

357
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,130
我打赌你会想知道我教什么
I bet you're wondering what I teach

358
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,860
啊，让我猜猜，经济学？
Ah. Let me guess. Economics?

359
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,490
关闭，我是游戏老师之一
Close. I'm one of the games teachers

360
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,100
我想这都是莱卡
Thought so It's all the Lycra

361
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,200
我正在为慈善组织一次有趣的跑步
And I'm organizing a fun run for charity

362
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,970
哦？我在想
Oh? And I was wondering

363
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,340
如果你能说服你的班级跑步的话？
if maybe you could persuade your class to run?

364
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,640
我该怎么做？
And how would I do that?

365
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,910
通过进入你自己
By entering yourself

366
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,810
哦
Oh

367
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,510
哦，我真的很抱歉，我不是跑步者，从来没有
Oh, I'm really sorry. I'm not a runner, never have been

368
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,320
我也喜欢游泳，我做了所有正确的动作，只是哪儿也不去
I'm the same with swimming. I do all the right actions, I just don't go anywhere

369
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:42,250
总之，我很难说服我的班级
Anyway, just had huge difficulty trying to persuade my class

370
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,360
读简·爱的第一页，所以
to read page one of Jane Eyre, so,

371
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,260
我不喜欢玩得开心
I don't fancy my chances with a fun run

372
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,530
只有五公里
It's only five kilometers

373
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,060
那是英里，我的意思是，那实际上是一场马拉松
That's miles. I mean, that's practically a marathon

374
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,100
不，不是
No, it's not

375
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,400
你穿过公园，上山，然后回到学校
You go through the park, up the hill and then back into school

376
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,270
因此…你刚才是说上山吗？
So... Did you just say up the hill?

377
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,670
我希望你知道，当人们对我说不的时候，我会将此视为谈判的开始
I hope you know that when people say no to me, I treat that as start of negotiations

378
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,440
嗯，我想你在这里见过你的对手
Well, I think you've met your match here

379
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,380
哦
Oh

380
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,010
哦，没关系
Oh. Doesn't matter

381
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,120
是啊，对不起，谢谢
Yeah, sorry. Thanks

382
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,320
没关系，我会找到一个牙齿好的人
It's all right. I'll find someone with good teeth

383
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,820
是
Yeah

384
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,490
你想再来一块蛋糕吗？
Would you like another cake?

385
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,510
亲爱的，我回来了
Darling, I'm home

386
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,510
哦，不
Oh, no

387
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,370
伙计，你毁了我的生活
You, mate, are ruining my life

388
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:41,940
没有你很难，但是有了你，这是不可能的
It was hard enough without you, but with you, it's impossible

389
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,580
你不能再这样了
Well, you can't do that again

390
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,220
进来吧
Do come in

391
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,620
每当一只流浪儿路过，他都会尖叫着把这个地方推倒
Every time a stray animal wandered by, he screamed the place down

392
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,490
我担心会有一封信
I fear there's going to be a letter

393
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,590
我能给你拿杯茶吗？
Can I get you a tea?

394
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,490
不，我建议你带他去散步
No. And I suggest you take him for a walk

395
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,460
当你离开一整天的狗时，你就是这样做的
That's what you do when you leave a dog all day

396
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,070
是的，当然我正要去
Yeah, of course I was just about to

397
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,070
听着，我会整理一些东西，但是明天你能让他来吗？
Look, I will get something sorted, but could you have him tomorrow?

398
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,640
不，只是为了明天
No Just for tomorrow

399
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,670
不，他表现得太差劲了
No, he's so badly behaved

400
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,240
但是他和同伴在一起会更好
But he'd be so much better with company

401
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,610
你真的会帮我
You'd be really helping me out

402
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:24,350
看看情况如何？求你了？请
Just see how it goes? Please? Please

403
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,580
好吧，就为了明天，但是你必须整理一下自己
Well, just for tomorrow, but you have to sort yourself out

404
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,390
别担心，我会的，谢谢你，西莉亚，谢谢你
Don't worry, I will. Thank you, Celia Thank you

405
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,090
我欠你的是的，你欠我的
I owe you Yes, you do

406
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,130
如果你明天不守规矩
If you don't behave tomorrow,

407
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,170
你真的要去狗家
you really are going to the dog home

408
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,670
来
Coming

409
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:53,110
嗨，我真的不确定这一点
Hi. I'm really not sure about this

410
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,710
温迪和我过着非常平静的生活
Wendy and I lead a very quiet life

411
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,450
哦，这只是为了今天，帕特里克表现得非常好
Oh, it's just for today. And Patrick is very well behaved

412
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,480
我奶奶非常严格
My granny was very strict

413
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,390
她至少和我们在一起
She was with us, at least

414
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,250
我四点半回来
I'll be back at 4:30

415
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:06,320
现在，说声谢谢，并提议洗碗
Now, say thank you and offer to do the washing-up

416
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,360
开始
Come on

417
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,360
妈妈要抛弃你了
Mummy's abandoning you

418
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,500
进来吧
In you come

419
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:17,040
主人公简·爱
Jane Eyre, the protagonist

420
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:22,040
谢谢你
Thank you

421
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,080
它从来不是狗它永远是主人
It's never the dog It's always the owner

422
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,750
那边有场打斗
There's a fight over there

423
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,880
哦，哦，下车，得了
Oh. Oh. Get off. Stop it

424
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,310
你们应该为自己感到羞耻
You should be ashamed of yourselves

425
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:07,790
哦，不
Oh, no

426
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:11,320
你做了什么？哦，亲爱的
What have you done? Oh, my darling

427
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,640
我一直知道你有点奇怪
I always knew you were a little strange

428
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,570
再也不会了哦，对不起
Never again Oh. I'm sorry

429
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,340
这是他的衣领对吗
Here's his collar Right

430
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,780
再见，我真的很抱歉
Goodbye I'm really sorry

431
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,760
嗨
Hi Hi

432
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,670
哦哦
Oh Oh

433
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,370
对不起，不
Sorry Sorry, no

434
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,600
哦，上帝，哦，哈
Oh, God. Ooh, ha

435
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,730
对不起
Sorry Sorry

436
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,410
这一定是我们的错
It's bound to be our fault Yeah

437
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,180
很快就要宣布我们订婚了
Be announcing our engagement soon

438
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,240
他很可爱
He's cute

439
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,210
可爱？停留
Cute? Stick around

440
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,650
我能问问吗，当你养狗的时候，你在想什么？
Can I just ask, when you got a dog, what were you thinking?

441
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:15,420
我喜欢，一点陪伴让自己保持健康
I like 'em. Bit of companionship Keep myself fit

442
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:19,490
像这样走路、思考的时刻
Moments like this Walking, contemplating

443
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,630
是啊，所以你永远也不想抓住它的喉咙，然后把它推到英镑上去？
Yeah, so you never wanna grab it by the throat and march it off to the pound?

444
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,630
他摧毁了什么？
What's he destroyed?

445
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,000
哦，呃，我的生活
Oh. Erm, my life

446
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,330
哇，令人印象深刻的
Wow. Impressive

447
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,140
你和他在一起多久了？
How long have you had him?

448
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:32,440
太长了，这是我祖母的遗赠
Too long. It was a bequest from my grandmother

449
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,140
我希望至少有微波炉
I was hoping for the microwave at least

450
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,680
也许她有理由把他留给你
Maybe she had her reasons for leaving him with you

451
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,010
她九十二岁了，我不确定推理是她的强项
She was 92. I'm not sure reasoning was her strong point

452
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,610
嗯，我认为你应该坚持下去
Well, I think you should stick with it

453
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,320
为什么？
Why?

454
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,590
我不知道，不然你怎么能和一个完全陌生的人在公园里玩Twister呢？
I dunno. How else would you get to play Twister in a park with a complete stranger?

455
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,820
顺便说一下，我是本
Hmm I'm Ben, by the way

456
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,020
哦，莎拉嗨
Oh, Sarah Hi

457
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,720
呃，这是童子军
Er, this is Scout

458
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,790
杀死一只知更鸟
To Kill a Mockingbird

459
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,490
呃，精确地
Er. Precisely

460
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,360
啊
Ah

461
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,530
很高兴见到你我也很高兴见到你
Well, nice meeting you Nice to meet you, too

462
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,900
来吧，童子军，开始
Come on, Scout. Come on

463
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:13,310
嗯，我必须把它交给你，你是一个非常吸引人的宝贝
Hmm. I have to hand it to you, you are quite the babe magnet

464
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,660
哦，好吧，来吧
Oh, all right, come on

465
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,200
不过这只是今晚用的
This is just for tonight, though

466
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:32,800
帕特里克，我该怎么处置你？
Oh, Patrick, what am I gonna do with you?

467
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:37,540
别担心，我会想办法的
Don't worry, I'll think of something

468
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,550
好吧
Right, okay

469
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,770
我，呃，我能帮你吗？
Can I, er Can I help you?

470
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:10,970
嗨，呃，我是莎拉·弗朗西斯，新来的英语老师
Hi. Er, I'm Sarah Francis, the new English teacher

471
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:13,640
我想知道你和我是否能达成协议
I was wondering if you and I could come to an arrangement

472
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,310
你想要什么？
What do you want?

473
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:18,080
你能带这只狗吗？就为了今天
Could you take this dog? Just for today

474
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,310
不
No

475
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,680
我给你十英镑
I'll give you ￡10

476
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,480
- 四十  - 什么？
- ￡40  - What?

477
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,690
他会整天坐在你的房间里
He's just gonna be sitting in your room all day,

478
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:28,450
也许你会在午餐时间带他出去
and maybe you'd take him out at lunchtime

479
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:29,820
那是五十什么？
That's ￡50 What?

480
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,330
现在是六十岁了
Now it's ￡60

481
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,330
我们过夜怎么样
How about we have a sleepover

482
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,830
放学后去购物？
and a bit of shopping after school?

483
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,400
是
Yeah

484
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,340
没关系，小姐在这里
It'll be okay Miss is here

485
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,780
你没事吧？是
You okay? Yeah

486
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,710
不要帮我
Don't help me

487
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,880
是呃，是维克基，不是吗？
It's erm, it's Vikki, isn't it?

488
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,620
我来这里才一周，我也想哭
I've only been here a week and I feel like crying as well

489
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,660
你想谈谈吗？
Do you wanna talk about it?

490
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,830
不，你没事
No, you're all right

491
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,600
已经和学生建立了联系？多么现代
Bonding with the students already? How modern

492
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,700
我看到了
I saw that

493
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,310
我再问一次
I ask again,

494
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,050
罗切斯特先生是什么使他对简·爱如此完美？
what is it about Mr. Rochester that makes him so perfect for Jane Eyre?

495
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,480
她为什么不能摆脱他？
Why can't she get over him?

496
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,750
他的紧身裤？
His tight trousers?

497
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,720
你们怎么了？为什么你决定不把注意力放在你的练习本上？
What is it with you guys? Why are you determined not to focus on your set books?

498
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,830
这些是你的普通中等教育证书
These are your GCSEs

499
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,390
很无聊
It's boring

500
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,130
正确
Right

501
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:45,330
那…不爱
That... No Oi

502
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,530
小姐，我在看简爱的样子
Miss, I was looking at what Jane Eyre looked like

503
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,970
夏洛特没有提供照片
Charlotte hasn't provided pictures

504
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,800
好吧，好吧，让我们试试这个
Right, okay, let's try this

505
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:57,880
简的父母咬了那个大家伙死了，走了，好吗？
Jane's parents bite the big one Dead, gone, okay?

506
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,710
简被打包去和她姑姑住在一起
Jane is packed off to live with her aunt,

507
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:03,880
里德太太，在乡下，谁是一个合适的老家伙
Mrs. Reed, in the country, who is a right old bag

508
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:08,080
然后她拉了个眼罩，把她锁在房间里
And then she pulls a blinder, locks her in a room

509
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,990
和她死去叔叔的鬼魂在一起
with her dead uncle's ghost

510
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,990
哦！
Ooh!

511
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,690
是
Yeah

512
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:14,960
进来
Come in

513
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,430
这是你的狗
Here's your dog

514
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,170
听着，我们能在午餐时间谈这个吗？
Look, can we talk about this at lunchtime?

515
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:29,100
这只小狗吃了我的午餐
This little dog ate my lunch

516
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,010
哦！
Ooh!

517
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:33,140
我会在休息时间出去，给你买个三明治
I'll go out at break time and I'll buy you a sandwich

518
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:37,080
还有一包薯片和士力架
And a packet of crisps and a Snickers

519
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,210
窃笑？
A Snickers?

520
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,080
这正是我需要的
That is just what I need

521
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,150
怎么了，小姐？
What's the matter, miss?

522
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,590
巧克力对狗有毒
Chocolate's poisonous for dogs

523
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,520
哦，生病了，请生病
Oh, be sick. Please be sick

524
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,560
米奇，找到最近的兽医
Mikey, find the nearest vet

525
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,090
好吧，我正在疏通女孩们的厕所
Well, I was unblocking the girls' toilets

526
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,860
最近的兽医在主干道上，四百二十五号
The nearest vet's on the main road, 425

527
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,500

Okay, phone them and tell them what's happened

528

Yeah, yeah, miss, go now, quick Quick. It's gonna get sick

529
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:59,140
听着，我们会读第一章，直到下课
Look, we'll read chapter one until the bell goes

530
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,200
谢谢你，维克基
Thank you, Vikki

531
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,570
快，快，快，就这样
Quick, quick, quick That's it

532

把它装进去，你们很多人

533
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,820
你想当老师吗？那就去当老师吧
Do you wanna be a teacher? Go on then, be a teacher

534
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,950
这还不够好，戴安娜，你必须做得更好
It's not good enough, Diana You must do better

535
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,150
你知道这件事至少有两周了
You've known about this for at least two weeks

536
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,760
弗朗西斯小姐，那是你胳膊下的一只狗吗？
Miss Francis, is that a dog under your arm?

537
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,160
呃
Uh

538
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,460
是
Yes

539
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,060
众所周知，学校不允许养宠物
As you well know, pets are not allowed in school

540
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,070
我可以问一下你要带这条狗去哪里吗？
May I ask where you're taking this dog?

541
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,200
呃
Uh

542
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,740
去生物实验室做实验
To the biology lab for an experiment

543
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,970
青蛙用完了，是吗？
Run out of frogs, have they?

544
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,210
他刚刚吃了一块巧克力棒
He's just eaten a chocolate bar

545
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,870
我要带他去兽医诊所

546
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,950
我可以问谁
And who, may I ask,

547
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,610
当你执行这项重要任务时，你在照顾你的班级吗？
is looking after your class while you perform this important task?

548
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,950
我让维克基·安德鲁斯负责，他们在读书
I've left Vikki Andrews in charge. They're reading

549
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,290
真的吗？是
Really? Yes

550
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,550
维克基是一个非常明智的年轻女性
Vikki is a very sensible young woman

551
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,290
对不起，怎么了？
Sorry, what is the matter?

552
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,890
你为什么反对我？
Why have you taken against me?

553
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,160
我没有反对你
I haven't taken against you

554
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,160
是的，你有
Yes, you have

555
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,700
自从我第一次来，你对我来说一直很可怕
Ever since I first arrived, you've been horrible to me

556
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,130
我是说，我对你做了什么？
I mean, what have I done to you?

557
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,830
对，说实话
Right, to be honest

558
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,270
是的，老实说
Yes, be honest

559
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:11,170
事实上，不太诚实，但请继续
Actually, not too honest, but go ahead

560
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,340
我喜欢一个能管教一个班级的老师
I like a teacher who can discipline a class,

561
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,580
让他们集中精力学习
get them focused and learning

562
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,610
你的类型只想和他们成为朋友
Your type just wants to be friends with them,

563
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,980
在这个学校，有了这个班级，这是行不通的
and with that class, in this school, that won't work

564
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,690
我的类型？你对我或我的教学方法一无所知
My type? You don't know anything about me or my teaching methods

565
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,290
我建议你现在就去我的教室
I suggest you go down to my classroom right now

566
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:29,020
看看我的学生能有多负责和专注
and see just how responsible and focused my students can be

567
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:32,360
现在，我要去兽医诊所，午餐时间我会回来
Now, I'm going to the vet's I'll be back at lunchtime

568
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,630
确保你是
Make sure you are

569
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,930
我只是说我会的
I just said I will be

570
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,170
托塞尔
Tosser

571
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,300
我听说了
I heard that

572
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,670
你是命中注定的
You were meant to

573
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,590
嗯
Hmm

574
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,600
两分钟
Two minutes

575
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,000
记住，记录是三分五秒
Now, remember, the record's three minutes and five seconds

576
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,310
好吧，谢谢你
Okay. Thank you

577
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,180
帕特里克·弗朗西斯
Patrick Francis

578
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,620
哦
Oh

579
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,960
哦，我明白了，你叫这只狗的名字“喔”，真可爱，嗯
Oh. I see. You call the dog's name Aw. That's cute. Um

580
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:37,390
呃，是的，帕特里克·弗朗西斯在这里
Er, yeah, Patrick Francis here

581
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,790
过来
Come on through

582
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,930
小猎鹿人怎么样了？
How is the little deer hunter?

583
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,570
他现在已经放弃了，他现在吃巧克力
He's given that up now. He's now the chocolate eater

584
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,700
你知道巧克力是
You do know that chocolate is

585
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,610
有毒，是啊，这是个错误
Poisonous, yeah It was a mistake

586
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,270
怎么样了？
So how's it going?

587
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,710
呃，一般来说还是和帕特里克一起？
Er, in general or with Patrick?

588
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,080
让我们从帕特里克开始
Let's start with Patrick

589
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,880
哦，呃…嗯，除了我给他放的食物，他什么都吃
Oh. Er... Well, he eats everything except the food I put down for him

590
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,290
呃…当我工作的时候，我已经没有人看他了
Erm... I'm running out of people to watch him while I'm at work

591
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:05,060
我期待着不可避免的驱逐通知
And I'm expecting the inevitable eviction notice

592
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,960
从我刚搬进的公寓
from my flat I've just moved into

593
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,120
因为他们有严格的禁止宠物的政策
because they have a strict no pets policy

594
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,630
否则，太好了
Otherwise, great

595
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:16,900
嗯，我认为这不足以伤害他
Well, I don't think it's enough to do him any harm

596
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,370
我可以帮他洗胃，但我想你不会为此感谢我的，是吗？
I could pump his stomach out, but I don't think you'd thank me for it, would you?

597
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,840
确保他有足够的水
Just make sure he has plenty of water

598
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,080
谢谢，说谢谢，帕特里克
Thanks. Say thank you, Patrick

599
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,710
谢谢你
Thank you

600
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,040
我的荣幸
My pleasure

601
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,720
行
Okay

602
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,920
用伤害打我
Hit me with the damage

603
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,150
他没有指控你
He hasn't charged you

604
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:36,920
你得让他知道帕特里克的近况
You've just gotta let him know how Patrick's doing

605
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:38,660
当你晚上有空吃饭的时候
and when you've got a night free for dinner

606
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,730
哦，正确
Oh. Right

607
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,290
嗯，这很奇怪
Well, that's strange

608
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,960
这不是我通常做生意的方式
It's not how I usually do business

609
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,030
那我付饭钱吗？这是怎么回事吗？
So do I pay for the meal? Is that how this works?

610
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:52,330
我不知道好吧，嗯，再见
I don't know Okay. Um, bye

611
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,100
好吧，再见，拜拜
Okay. Bye. Bye Bye

612
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:06,280
松饼大木头
Muffin Bigwood

613
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,990
- 这很酷  - 是啊
- That's cool.  - Yeah

614
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:11,390
然后他把它放在电脑上
And then he put it on the computer

615
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,920
并把它发给桌上的女孩
and sent it through to the girl on the desk

616
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,790
像小说里的东西
Like something out of a novel

617
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:17,130
哦，给你，叫我有点过时
Oh. There you go. Call me a little bit old-fashioned,

618
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,360
但是这不是最微小的令人毛骨悚然的吗？
but isn't that the tiniest bit creepy?

619
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,260
我总是在约会网站上遇到我的朋友
Well, I always meet mine off dating websites,

620
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,100
所以在我看来，这是比较明智的
so that seems relatively sane to me

621
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:27,340
啊，弗朗西斯小姐，兽医之旅怎么样？
Ah. Miss Francis, how did the trip to the vet go?

622
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,170
哦，比预期的要好，谢谢
Oh. Better than expected, thanks

623
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,280
你们这些女士觉得有什么好笑的？
What are you ladies finding so funny?

624
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,250
哦，没什么
Oh, nothing

625
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:37,850
奶油松饼？
Eclair?

626
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,550
不，谢谢你，莫林
No, thank you, Maureen

627
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,420
约翰？哦，谢谢你
John? Oh. Thank you

628
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,050
干得好
Well done

629
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,550
顺便说一句，弗朗西斯小姐
By the way, Miss Francis,

630
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,360
你知道你现在是唯一的员工吗
are you aware you are now the only member of staff

631
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,290
谁没有参加这场有趣的赛跑？
who is not taking part in the fun run?

632
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,260
什么？
What?

633
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,130
我担心菲利普斯太太会对我们的新老师持相当悲观的看法
I'm afraid Mrs. Phillips will take a rather dim view of our newest teacher

634
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,870
不参加学校活动
not partaking in school activities

635
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,230
呃，那就是你错的地方
Er, well, that's where you're wrong

636
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,170
莎拉今天早上报名参加了有趣的跑步
Sarah signed up to the fun run just this morning

637
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,810
是的，她代表她最喜欢的慈善机构参加竞选
Yes, she's running on behalf of her favorite charity

638
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:07,240
呃…呃帕格救援
Er... Er The Pug Rescue

639
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,480
社会嗯
Society Hmm

640
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:12,020
哦，好吧，那没关系
Oh. Well, that's all right, then

641
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,860
你做了什么？我跑不了五公里
What have you done? I can't run five kilometers

642
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,920
对不起，当他那样对我们大吼大叫的时候，我实在受不了
I'm sorry. I just can't bear it when he crows over us like that

643
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,130
哦，这太可怕了
Oh, this is awful

644
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,530
你在做吗，莫林？
Are you doing it, Maureen?

645
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:28,100
呃，我被豁免了，你怎么被豁免了？
Er, I'm exempt How are you exempt?

646
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,170
哮喘
Asthma

647
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,310
贝基，你为什么不能给我一些虚构的抱怨？
Becky, why couldn't you have given me some sort of fictional complaint?

648
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:38,170
对不起，这是我想到的第一件事
I'm sorry. It was the first thing that came to my head

649
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,280
你会再吃一杯吗？
Will you have another eclair?

650
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:43,050
是的，哦，我现在不行，我得跑五千米
Yeah. Oh. I can't now I've gotta run 5K

651
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,550
哦，继续，发生
Oh, go on. Go on

652
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:45,820
天堂
Heaven

653
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,590
第十一年补救措施在丘克斯的尝试我想我必须
Year 11 remedial's attempt at choux I think I'll have to

654
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,760
我不应该
I shouldn't

655
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,990
喔，我们开始吧
Whoo. Here we go

656
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
我不能这样做
I can't do this

657
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,530
我真的不能这样做，如果我必须跑去公共汽车，我会晕倒
I really can't do this. I faint if I have to run for the bus

658
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:04,570
很抱歉，但我想你必须这么做
Well, I'm sorry, but I think you're gonna have to

659
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,240
如果我这么做
If I'm doing this

660
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,010
你也在这么做
You're doing this too

661
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,250
来吧，弗朗西斯
Come on, Francis

662
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:25,350
我们不能去购物吗？贝基，你喜欢购物，是吗？
Can't we go shopping? You like shopping, don't you, Becky?

663
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,660
来吧，哦，我的上帝
Come on Oh, my God

664
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:32,030
喂，多宾，你能慢一分钟吗？
Oi, Dobbin, can you slow down for just a minute, please?

665
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:33,060
没有痛苦，就没有收获
No pain, no gain

666
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:36,500
我马上就要杀了你，我只是给你一个合理的警告
I'm gonna kill you in a minute I'm just giving you fair warning

667
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,270
哈，相信我，总有一天你会为此感谢我的
Ha. Trust me, you'll thank me for it one day

668
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,040
很多话浮现在脑海中，但感谢不在其中
A lot of words are coming to mind and thank ain't one of 'em

669
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,580
- 天啊  - 噢…
- Oh, God.  - Oh...

670
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:02,020
早上好莎拉
Morning, Sarah

671
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,130
早晨
Morning

672
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,410
所以，简正在为她的大喜日子做准备
So, Jane's getting ready for her big day

673
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:21,610
她买了裙子，蛋糕被预订了
She's got the dress, the cake's booked,

674
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:24,210
伴娘们都穿上了假衣服
the bridesmaids are all getting their fake tans

675
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:27,990
突然，一个家伙打破了聚会
And then suddenly, some bloke breaks up the party

676
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:31,460
宣布罗切斯特先生已经结婚
by announcing that Mr. Rochester is already married

677
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:39,030
情节扭曲，原来他妻子被锁在阁楼里，命运
Plot twist. Turns out his wife is locked up in the attic. Weird

678
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:42,600
罗切斯特先生说，对不起，我们不能成为夫妻
So Mr. Rochester says, Sorry, we can't be husband and wife

679
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:47,240
但是你作为一个非正式的罗切斯特太太继续呆下去怎么样？
But how about you stay on as a sort of unofficial Mrs. Rochester?

680
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,640
就像斯派克的爸爸
Like Spike's dad

681
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,010
哦，关闭
Oh. Shut up

682
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:53,610
简爱他，那么她做什么？
Jane loves him, so what does she do?

683
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,210
维克基？
Vikki?

684
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:05,890
简逃跑是因为她相信道德
Jane flees because she believes in a sense of morality

685
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:08,220
你知道，他已经发过誓了
You know, he's taken his vows

686
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:11,530
尽管这会让她心碎
and even though it would break her heart,

687
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:13,200
她不能和已婚男人勾搭上
she can't hook up with a married guy

688
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,270
那么为什么婚姻对简如此重要呢？
So why is marriage so important to Jane?

689
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:20,240
为什么她的原则比爱更重要？
Why are her principles more important than love?

690
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,270
婚姻为什么是一切？
Why is marriage everything?

691
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:27,050
不过，不是吗？没关系
Well, it's not, though, is it? It doesn't bloody matter

692
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:31,450
呃
Er

693
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:34,050
这不是你的错，小姐，我去接她
It's not your fault, miss I'll go fetch her

694
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,290
好吧，呃…我们继续呃，举起手来
Okay. Erm... We'll just carry on Er, hands up

695
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,300
帕特里克？举起手来？
Patrick? Hand up?

696
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:10,320
我们被驱逐了什么？
We're being evicted What?

697
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,750
我想他发现了温迪，我不敢相信
I think he's found out about Wendy I can't believe it

698
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,630
哦…哦，进来
Oh... Oh, come in

699
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:22,270
我无处可去
I've nowhere to go

700
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:26,100
我在这里已经多年了，我所有的朋友都在这里
I've been here for years All my friends are here

701
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:29,010
我该怎么办？
What am I going to do?

702
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:33,580
这是我们的错
This is our fault

703
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,180
我会告诉房东，讨厌的是帕特里克
I'll tell the landlord that it's Patrick who's the nuisance

704
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:39,280
那你和温迪就可以恢复正常了
Then you and Wendy can go back to normal

705
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,650
哦，谢谢你，莎拉
Oh, thank you, Sarah

706
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:44,190
无论如何，我很难找到他
I'm having trouble re-homing him anyway

707
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:46,420
没有人想要一只更老的狗，包括我
No one wants an older dog, including me

708
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,730
我们会找别的地方住
We'll find somewhere else to live

709
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:50,730
你要去哪里？
Where will you go?

710
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:53,130
嗯，总是有一个公园长椅
Well, there's always a park bench

711
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:55,400
非常喜欢那个公园
Getting quite fond of that park

712
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,370
哦，不
Oh, no

713
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:58,070
哦，我在开玩笑
Oh, I'm joking

714
00:46:58,770 --> 00:46:59,770
哦
Oh

715
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,010
- 来吧  - 你好
- Come on.  - Hiya

716
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:09,880
你来还是去？
Are you coming or going?

717
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,450
哦，只是去
Oh. Just going

718
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,120
哦，不
Oh, no

719
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,120
哦，上帝
Oh, God

720
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,220
哦
Oh

721
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:22,860
上帝，如果这只狗出了问题，它会的
God, if it can go wrong with this dog, it will

722
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,690
哦，我有很多标记要做
Oh, I've got loads of marking to do

723
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,660
继续
Hold on

724
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,530
你们
You

725
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:32,670
啊
Ah

726
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,770
哦
Oh

727
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,310
这是你从一个虚度年华中得到的
This is what you get from a misspent youth

728
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,220
对不起，是我…它是开着的
Sorry. It's I've... It's open

729
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,350
啊，谢谢
Ah. Thanks

730
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:50,750
谢谢，不用担心
Thank you No worries

731
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:11,640
你觉得这有点太讲究了吗？
Do you think this is a bit too dressy?

732
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,810
不，我认为它真的适合你
No, I think it really suits you

733
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,680
我只是不想看起来我已经努力过了
I just don't wanna look like I've tried too hard

734
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,250
你为什么不试穿一下呢？让你看起来很时髦
Why don't you try that on with it? Make you look really funky

735
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:21,820
嗯，我想看起来时髦吗？
Hmm. Do I wanna look funky?

736
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,450
也许他更喜欢勤奋
Maybe he prefers studious

737
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:25,390
你有眼镜吗？不
Well, have you got any glasses? No

738
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:27,090
穿上夹克，好吗
Put the jacket on, then Okay

739
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:33,860
是的，是的，我喜欢
Yes. Yeah. I like

740
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,500
一只很酷的小鸡
One cool chick

741
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,600
你到底要去哪里？
Where are you going, anyway?

742
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,370
哦，桥边那个地方
Ooh, that place by the bridge

743
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:41,840
不错，他付钱吗？
Nice. Expensive Is he paying?

744
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:45,310
我真的希望如此，我现在正式无家可归
I really hope so. I'm now officially homeless,

745
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:46,380
因为帕特里克已经完成了他的使命
since Patrick has made it his mission

746
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,550
提醒房东不要养宠物
to alert the landlord to the no pets policy

747
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,250
你知道吗，我可以在这里帮你
Do you know, I might be able to help you here

748
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,790
真的吗？
Really?

749
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:56,350
我哥哥想在国外工作时出租他的房子
My brother wants to rent out his place while he's working abroad

750
00:48:57,590 --> 00:48:58,820
他只需要支付费用，你有兴趣吗？
He only needs to cover the costs Are you interested?

751
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,230
有兴趣吗？
Interested?

752
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,590
太好了，是
Great. Yes

753
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:06,930
哦，这些？是的，把他们带上
Ooh. These? Yeah. Get 'em on

754
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:07,900
这些？
These ones?

755
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:12,370
嗨，这是一张两个人的桌子，我想是奥利弗的
Hi. It's a table for two I think it's under Oliver

756
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:13,440
是的
Yes Yeah

757
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:16,400
女士，请这边走，谢谢
Please, ma'am, this way Thank you

758
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:18,440
哦，我可以帮你拿外套吗
Oh, can I just take your coat

759
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,580
哦，不，对不起，这是事情的一部分，遗憾的
Oh, no. Sorry. It's part of the thing. Sorry

760
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,650
我的错误对不起，哎呦
My mistake Sorry. Whoops

761
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,250
谢谢这是你的桌子
Thanks Here is your table

762
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:27,420
谢谢你，我会回来的
Thank you I'll be back

763
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,540
遗憾的
Sorry

764
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:55,910
没关系
That's okay

765
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:58,420
老实说，我很抱歉
Honestly I'm sorry

766
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:00,820
不要，别担心，我一直在练习折纸
Don't. Don't worry. I've been practicing my origami

767
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,420
你的什么？
Your what?

768
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,660
没关系，你是在救人吗？
Never mind. Were you saving a life?

769
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,430
对不起？
Sorry?

770
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:11,460
你知道，给我拿一袋血浆，然后通过镊子
You know, get me a bag of plasma and pass the forceps

771
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:14,600
哦，不，我只是在看《权力的游戏》，忘记了时间
Oh, no. I was just watching Game of Thrones and lost track of time

772
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:16,770
嘿
Oh Hey

773
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:18,870
你选择了吗，先生？好的，请给我我平常的
Have you chosen, sir? Yeah, I'll have my usual, please

774
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:19,870
当然可以
Of course

775
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,070
哇，从来没有和一个以前有过老一套的人约会过
Wow. Never been out with a guy who has a usual before

776
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:24,440
你平时做什么？
What's your usual?

777
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:27,740
嗯，是丘拉斯科·德·洛莫，筹码的一面，被一个优秀的马尔贝克冲下来
Well, it's Churrasco de Lomo. Side of chips. Washed down by a good Malbec

778
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:28,940
嗯，听起来不错
Mmm. Sounds good

779
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:30,710
是的，我想吃牛排
Yeah. I was gonna have a steak

780
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:32,450
哦，这是牛排
Oh. It is a steak

781
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:35,320
哦，对了，请给我同样的
Oh, right. I'll have the same, please

782
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,520
稀有的
Rare, please

783
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,320
干得好
Well done

784
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,420
她也会有她的稀有的
She'll have hers rare as well

785
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:41,390
当然相信我
Of course Trust me

786
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,960
行
Okay

787
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:52,370
是的，我一直喜欢科学
Yeah, I've always loved the sciences

788
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:55,100
我在化学、生物和物理方面获得了A星
I got an A star in chemistry, biology and physics

789
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:56,910
真的可以做我想做的任何事情
Could have done anything I wanted to, really

790
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:58,940
但是我的父亲和兄弟是医生
But my father and brothers are doctors

791
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,610
他希望我也这样做
and he wanted me to do the same

792
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:03,620
是的，但是我背叛了，成为了一名兽医
Yeah, but I rebelled, became a vet

793
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:07,350
不过，这并不算什么反叛，是吗？我挣的比我哥哥多
Not much of a rebellion, though, is it? I earn more than my brother

794
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:09,850
但是，我们不做我们为钱做的事，是吗？
Well, we don't do what we do for the money, though, do we?

795
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:10,820
我们这样做是为了有所作为
We do it to make a difference

796
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:12,660
你知道你必须比医生多学习一年吗
Do you know you have to study a year longer than a doctor

797
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:14,330
因为你的病人不能告诉你哪里疼？
cause your patient can't tell you where it hurts?

798
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:18,430
提醒你，你有没有让杜宾犬把牙齿咬进你的胳膊里？
Mind you, have you ever had a Doberman sink its teeth into your arm?

799
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:19,830
嗯
Hmm

800
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:21,470
我想他想告诉我一些事情
I think he was trying to tell me something

801
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:26,400
不管怎样，关于我的事已经够多了，告诉我关于你的事
Anyway, enough about me Tell me about you

802
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,770
告诉我莎拉·弗朗西斯的事
Tell me about Sarah Francis

803
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:31,440
甜点吃什么？
Anything for dessert?

804
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:35,640
莎拉？布丁还是奶酪片？
Sarah? Pudding or slice of cheese?

805
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:36,950
不，不，我很好
No. No, I'm good

806
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:38,910
好吧，好吧，请给我们账单
Okay. Well, we'll have the bill, please

807
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,520
好吧，我会回来的谢谢
Okay. I'll be back Thank you

808
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,490
乐意平分吗？
Happy to go halves?

809
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:45,390
嗯…是
Mmm... Yeah

810
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,060
那我可以送你回家吗？
Then can I walk you home?

811
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:48,960
好的，谢谢
Okay, thanks

812
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,060
伟大的
Great

813
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:51,930
哦，你可以给你的病人一次检查
Oh. You could give your patient the once over

814
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,170
嗯，我有一个不成文的规则
Well, I kind of have this unwritten rule thing

815
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:58,440
我不免费看到约会对象的宠物
where I don't see my dates' pets for free,

816
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,870
不管这个女孩有多漂亮
no matter how pretty the girl is

817
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,470
啊
Ah

818
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:05,510
另一件我擅长的事是运动
The other thing I'm good at is sport

819
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:09,440
这种体格是完全自然的，我真的不需要努力
This physique is entirely natural I really don't have to work at it

820
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:12,080
哇，惊人的嗯
Wow. Amazing Mmm

821
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:17,420
奥利弗，我们能改天再喝咖啡吗？我只是有点累
Actually, Oliver, can we get coffee another time? I'm just a bit tired

822
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,390
你确定？
Are you sure?

823
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,520
是的，我度过了一个美好的夜晚，我只想回家
Yeah, and I've had a nice evening I just wanna go home

824
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:23,090
那么，你下周的工作安排如何？
Well, how are you fixed for next week?

825
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,030
啊…我不确定我是否有点忙
Ah... I'm not sure I'm a bit busy

826
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,430
有…我做错什么了吗？
Have... Have I done something wrong?

827
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,500
呃…真相？
Er... The truth?

828
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,570
说真的，你…你不想再见到我吗？
Seriously, you... You don't wanna see me again?

829
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:38,080
不
No

830
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:42,210
好吧，你约我出去，呃，你迟到了
Okay, you asked me out, er, you were late,

831
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:47,220
我是说，晚了，然后你不停地谈论自己
and, I mean, late, and then you talked nonstop about yourself

832
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,920
然后当我冒昧地暗示你可能会想要
and then when I had the temerity to suggest that you might wanna take

833
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,620
偷看一下你的病人，你说这违反了规定
a peek at your patient, you said it's against the rules

834
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:55,660
但是牛排很好吃，不是吗？
But the steak was good, wasn't it?

835
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,860
为什么要回家去一个空公寓？
And why go home to an empty flat?

836
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,600
谢谢你，奥利弗，但是不，谢谢你
Thanks, Oliver, but no thanks

837
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:05,730
哦，嗯，为了你的信息
Oh, and, um, for your information,

838
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:07,840
我不会回到一个空公寓
I'm not going home to an empty flat

839
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:39,570
哦，你好
Oh, hello

840
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,710
嗨，你一个人在外面干什么？
Hi. What are you doing out here on your own?

841
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,510
马歇尔·克洛斯，麦克斯
Marshall Close. Max.

842
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:49,580
哦，我知道你住在哪里
Oh, I know where you live

843
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:52,210
我们去看看是否有人在家好吗？
Shall we go and see if anyone's at home?

844
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:53,820
是吗？好吧，来吧
Yeah? Okay, come on

845
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,490
来吧，好孩子，开始
Come on Good boy. Come on

846
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:13,200
什么？嗯？
What? Eh?

847
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:14,740
喂？
Hello?

848
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:16,770
你好，孩子，你去哪儿了？
Hello, boy Where have you been?

849
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,840
我希望你能…对不起，门开着
I wish you could... Sorry The door was open

850
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,710
你好
Hi

851
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:22,580
哦，你忘了回家的路，是吗？
Oh. You forgot your way home, did you?

852
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,280
哦！看起来很恶心
Ooh! That looks nasty

853
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,710
你越来越像我了
You're getting just like me

854
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:33,590
我检查了我能想到的所有地方，尽管愚蠢的是
I've checked everywhere I can think of, although, stupidly,

855
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:35,060
忘了检查一下
forgot to check just there

856
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,060
在这里干吗？
What are you doing here?

857
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,560
哦，我认识艾伯特很多年了
Oh, I've known Albert for years

858
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:39,100
是的，如果不是本
Yeah. If it wasn't for Ben,

859
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,600
我应该还躺在那条小路上
I should still be lying on that towpath

860
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,000
你摔倒了吗？
Did you have a fall?

861
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:47,540
不，不，我通常头上戴着鱼手指四处走动，本
No, no, I usually walk about with fish fingers on me head. Ben,

862
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:51,140
把它们放在冰箱里，好吗？明天我要给我喝茶
stick 'em in the freezer, will you? I'll have 'em for me tea tomorrow

863
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,950
好孩子好孩子，你坐
Good boy Good boy. You sit

864
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:57,750
你让我担心生病了，你担心了，我不知道你去了哪里
You had me worried sick, you did I didn't know where you'd gone

865
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:00,580
巧克力消化液不会出错！
And a chocolate digestive wouldn't go amiss!

866
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,720
称自己为救援委员会？嗯
Call yourselves a rescue committee? Huh

867
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:05,790
不客气
You're welcome

868
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:06,960
一定是昏过去了
Must have blacked out

869
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:10,660
顽固的老家伙拒绝去医院
Stubborn old bugger refuses to go to the hospital

870
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:11,630
你看起来不错
You look nice

871
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:13,730
和女孩出去过夜？
Night out with the girls?

872
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:14,600
不，我希望
No. I wish

873
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:20,300
我想他给了自己很大的惊吓
I think he's given himself quite a scare

874
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,140
最糟糕的是失去了马克斯
Worst part was losing Max

875
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:23,770
嗯
Hmm

876
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:24,980
你玩得开心吗？
Did you have a nice time?

877
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:27,280
不见得
Not really

878
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:33,380
我一直告诉他，他需要给自己弄辆摩托车
I keep telling him he needs to get himself a scooter

879
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,620
我买不起
I can't afford one

880
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,150
至少他的听力没有问题
At least there's nothing wrong with his hearing

881
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:38,650
他妻子在哪里？
Where's his wife?

882
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,320
呃，她去年去世了
Er, she died last year

883
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,690
嗯
Hmm

884
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:43,560
结婚五十年了哇
Been married 50 years Wow

885
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:47,260
五十年了，不要以为我会持续一个周末
Fifty years. Don't think I'd last a weekend

886
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,130
燃烧的茶在哪里？
Where's the flaming tea?

887
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:50,570
让这一天成为一天，嗯
Make that a day Hmm

888
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,700
遗憾的
Sorry

889
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:27,770
你真的想在开始之前伸展肌肉，好吗？
You really wanna stretch out the muscles before you start, all right?

890
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:29,970
否则，你最终会拉什么东西
Otherwise, you'll end up pulling something

891
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:31,580
林前，说到哪
Cor, talking of which

892
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:36,110
你好你好
Hello Hello

893
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:40,850
过得愉快
Have a nice day

894
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:42,050
哦
Oh

895
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,890
我通常不会这么快就把它们推迟
I don't usually put them off that quickly

896
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:47,120
他们通常非常热衷，直到他们看到我的毛绒玩具收藏
They're usually quite keen until they see my soft toy collection

897
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,230
不，不是你，是我，是兽医
No, it wasn't you. It was me That was the vet

898
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,190
什么？
What?

899
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,000
哦，你的钱包掉了
Oh. You've dropped your wallet

900
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:00,900
好吧，来吧，这不会让你为五千米做好准备
Right, come on. This isn't gonna get you ready for the 5K

901
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:01,970
弗朗西斯，站起来
On your feet, Francis

902
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:03,210
开始
Come on

903
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:14,480
嗯？
Well?

904
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,050
你怎么想呢？
What do you think?

905
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:17,720
嗯？
Huh?

906
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:23,760
一百万年内不会
Not in a million years

907
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,060
我想我会走五公里吗
am I ever gonna make five kilometers is what I think

908
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,100
没有
No. Of this

909
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,300
这是我哥哥的
Well, it's my brother's,

910
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,140
他离开工作至少两年了
and he's away working for at least two years,

911
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:38,740
我认为这对你和帕特里克来说是完美的
and I thought it would be perfect for you and Patrick

912
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,310
没那么贵
It's not that expensive. I

913
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:42,010
我想那会很好
I thought it'd be nice

914
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,180

天啊，看

922
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,070
哦，帕特里克，看看它
Oh, Patrick, look at it

923
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:21,380
- 伙计们，来吧，说真的  - 我正在转动它
- Guys, come on. Seriously.  - I am turning it.

924
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:22,920
- 你带错工具了  - 好吧
- You've brought the wrong tools.  - Okay.

925
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,720
这是怎么回事？
What is going on here?

926
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:27,360
没什么
Nothing Nothing

927
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:30,060
啊，对我来说这不像什么
Ah. It doesn't look like nothing to me

928
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,430
这是我爸爸的车它需要，呃
This is my dad's car It needs, erm

929
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:33,930
新轮胎，它需要新轮胎，新车轮
New tires. It needs New tires, new wheels

930
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:37,430
很有趣，因为我在这附近什么地方都没看见你爸爸
It's funny, 'cause I don't see your dad anywhere 'round here

931
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,530
但是别担心，我得走了
But don't worry, I've gotta go

932
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:40,870
我会的…我一进学校就给你爸爸打电话
I'll... I'll call your dad when I get into school

933
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:42,470
你不需要给任何人打电话请不要给任何人打电话
You don't need to call anyone Please, don't call anyone

934
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:43,540

所以我再次问你们，先生们，这是怎么回事？
So I ask you again, gentlemen, what is going on here?

937
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,580
小姐，我们在偷车轮
We're stealing the wheels, miss

938
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:51,750
我还能说什么？
What else am I gonna say?

939
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:53,450
你怎么知道怎么做这种事？
How do you even know how to do something like that?

940
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,450
看了几段视频是的
Watched a couple of videos Yeah

941
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:57,750
他哥哥给他看了
His brother showed him Yeah

942
00:58:58,390 --> 00:58:59,420
对，你哥哥在哪里？
Right, where's your brother?

943
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:02,560
- 没关系  - 他在少管所，小姐
- Doesn't matter.  - He's in juvie, miss.

944
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,330
啊，闭嘴，斯派克，对不起
Ah. Shut up, Spike I'm sorry

945
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:05,900
对不起，伙计
Sorry, man

946
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,460
好吧，听着，我不会告诉任何人这件事
Okay, look, I'm not gonna tell anyone about this,

947
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:14,070
好吗？但是如果我再次听到或看到你们中的任何人做这样的事情
okay? But if I hear or catch any of you doing something like this again,

948
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:16,400
我很乐意报警
I will happily call the police

949
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:18,080
哇，哇，哇，哇，哇，你要去哪里？
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa Where are you going?

950
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,610
对不起，你不能逍遥法外
Sorry. You're not getting away with this scot-free

951
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:22,810
小姐，我必须去
Miss, I've got to

952
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,050
这将是我本周第三次被拘留，我会惹上这么多麻烦
It'll be my third detention this week. I'll get in so much trouble

953
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:26,850
哦，不，不，这比拘留更糟糕，斯派克，好吗？
Ooh, no, no. It's way worse than detention, Spike, okay?

954
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:30,290
这是弗朗西斯小姐社区服务，好吗？
This is the Miss Francis community service, okay?

955
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:32,850
你们都要报名参加有趣的跑步
You are all gonna sign up for the fun run

956
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,220
小姐！得到二十英镑的赞助
Aw, miss! And get ￡20 sponsorship

957
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,160
没有争论，和…你现在就要开始训练了
No arguments. And... And you're gonna start your training now

958
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,360
怎么做？
How?

959
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,830
你可以跟着跑
You can run along

960
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:51,440
继续，他们必须被吃掉
Go on. They've got to be eaten

961
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,780
事实上他们一定是
They've actually got to be

962
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:54,410
莫林，这些纸杯蛋糕真漂亮
Maureen, these cupcakes are gorgeous

963
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:55,910
它们不好吃吗？是的，我知道
Aren't they good? Yes, I know

964
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:56,980
让我试试呃，不
Let me try one Er, no

965
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:58,210
直到你跑完了
Not until you've finished the run

966
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:00,050
啊，太不公平了，不
Ah, that's so unfair No

967
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,120
纸杯蛋糕？
Cupcake?

968
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,390
谢谢你
Thank you

969
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,120
哦，这不是一个爱的术语，我给你一个纸杯蛋糕
Oh, it's not a term of endearment I'm offering you a cupcake

970
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,260
不，谢谢你，莫林
No, thank you, Maureen

971
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:12,360
我和我的班级要去公园慢跑，为跑步做准备
My class and I are off for a jog in the park in preparation for the run

972
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,960
校长对投票率印象非常深刻
Head teacher's very impressed with the turnout

973
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:18,000
弗朗西斯小姐，真遗憾你的班级没有这么热心
Such a shame your class aren't as keen, Miss Francis

974
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,400
啊，好吧，那就是你错的地方，彼得斯先生
Ah, well, that's where you're wrong, Mr. Peters

975
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:20,970
我班上所有的男生
All the boys in my class

976
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,410
现在已经签约了，一些女孩也表现出了兴趣
have now signed up and some of the girls are showing interest too

977
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:26,310
你到底用什么威胁他们？没有任何东西
What on Earth did you threaten them with? Nothing

978
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:28,980
他们这么做是因为他们想成为我的朋友
They're doing it 'cause they want to be my friends

979
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:31,450
你要小心，你知道吗
You want to be careful, you know

980
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,520
我听说菲利普斯退休时，他是校长的下一个接班人
I hear he's next in line for the headmaster when Phillips retires

981
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,150
很抱歉，是他先开始的
Well, I'm sorry He started it

982
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:37,550
是的，但是我们希望你留下来
Yeah But we want you to stay

983
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,120
是的，我们有，我们有，我也有
Yes, we do, we do So do I

984
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,420
纸杯蛋糕
Cupcake

985
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:43,290
不，莫琳，住手
No. Maureen, stop it

986
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:46,630
为什么我的东西必须储存起来？
Why is it my stuff that had to go into storage?

987
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:47,930
嗯？
Hmm?

988
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:16,790
那么维多利亚时代的英格兰是什么
So what is it about Victorian England

989
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:20,500
这让罗切斯特太太对社会如此不可接受？
that makes Mrs. Rochester so unacceptable to society?

990
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:27,670
是吗？
Yes?

991
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:50,020
来吧，你这个懒鬼！
Come on, you lazy Oops!

992
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,410
莎拉？
Sarah?

993
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:07,710
不
No

994
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:09,050
等待
Wait

995
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:11,980
不，哦，我的上帝
No. Oh, my God

996
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:14,650
哦，我的上帝，太可爱了
Oh, my God It's so cute

997
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:16,450
进来，进来吧
Come in. Come in There you go

998
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,260
谢谢你，谢谢你
Thank you. Thank you

999
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,390
我是买了一个还是只买了一个
Do I get one of these or is it just

1000
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:26,360
不，恐怕你冒着生命危险
No, you risk your life, I'm afraid

1001
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,460
我注定要淹死
I'm destined to drown

1002
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:45,110
卡莉·威廉姆斯？
Carly Williams?

1003
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,080
礼物
Present

1004
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:47,680
迈克尔·阿齐基瓦？
Michael Azikiwe?

1005
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,650
是
Yeah

1006
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,350
维克·安德鲁斯？
Vikki Andrews?

1007
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:53,390
维克基？
Vikki?

1008
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:57,090
有人知道维克在哪里吗？
Does anyone know where Vikki is?

1009
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,300
开始
Come on

1010
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:03,170
吐出来，午饭前我们有一个英语普通中等教育证书要完成
Spit it out. We've got an English GCSE to accomplish by lunchtime

1011
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:06,730
嗯，维克基的父母一直有问题
Erm, Vikki's mum and dad have been having problems

1012
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:08,140
她并没有真正处理这件事
She's not really handling it

1013
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:09,470
塔里克，那是私人恩怨
Tariq, that's private

1014
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:10,440
遗憾的
Sorry

1015
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,310
她有麻烦吗，小姐？
Is she in trouble, miss?

1016
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:16,310
如果我能帮得上忙就不行了
Not if I can help it

1017
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:19,180
呃，我的奶奶膝盖不舒服
Er, my nan's got dodgy knees

1018
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:20,550
我在想，我也可以被原谅吗？
I was wondering, can I be excused too?

1019
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:25,350
不错的尝试，好，把你的文件翻过来
Nice try. Right, turn over your papers

1020
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:27,220
你有九十分钟，开始
You have 90 minutes. Begin

1021
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,540
嘿，我是维克基
Hey, it's Vikki

1022
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:43,310
请留言，我会给你回电话
Leave a message and I'll call you back

1023
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:54,680
你好
Hello Hi

1024
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,650
我是弗朗西斯小姐，维克基的英语老师
I'm Miss Francis, Vikki's English teacher

1025
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,720
听着，我今天早上想让她参加考试
Look, I tried to get her to that exam this morning

1026
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,460
我告诉她这有多重要
I tell her how important it is

1027
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:05,530
但是我们正在经历一些家庭问题
But we're going through a few family problems

1028
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:07,600
嗯，听到这个消息我很难过
Hmm. I'm so sorry to hear that

1029
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:10,130
哦，我丈夫和我要分手了
Oh. My husband and I are splitting up

1030
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:11,600
你只是喜欢告诉别人，不是吗？
You just love telling people, don't you?

1031
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:15,200
她，嗯，接受得很糟糕
She's, um, taking it quite badly

1032
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:16,340
我的
My

1033
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:20,110
我有麻烦了吗？
Am I in trouble?

1034
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:23,380
不是和我一起，你想和我们一起去散步吗？
Not with me. Do you wanna come for a walk with us?

1035
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:25,180
是啊，我去拿我的外套
Yeah, I'll just grab my coat

1036
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:28,720
哦，我看她问你时你会做些什么
Oh. I see you'll do something when she asks

1037
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,190
是的，她很好地问我
Yeah. She asks me nicely

1038
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:34,590
啊
Ah

1039
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:40,460
看到我反对什么了吗？
See what I'm up against?

1040
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,700
她决定了
And she's decided

1041
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:45,330
她不想来和我和我男朋友住在一起
she doesn't want to come and live with me and my boyfriend

1042
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:46,470
她想留下来
She wants to stay

1043
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:49,840
和她爸爸在一起
With her dad

1044
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,240
哦
Oh

1045
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:53,410
我们马上回来
We'll be right back

1046
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:54,580
行
Okay

1047
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,520
听着，我真的很抱歉
Look, I'm really sorry

1048
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,690
维克基，你擅长英语，好吗？最好的之一
Vikki, you're good at English, okay? One of the best

1049
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:06,790
我为你预测一个七，没问题
I predict a seven for you, no problem

1050
01:05:06,790 --> 01:05:10,290
但是你必须做的一件事是去参加考试
But the one thing you have to do is turn up for the exam

1051
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:12,890
这只是家里的事情
It's just this whole thing at home

1052
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:15,160
我一直感觉很糟糕
I feel so crap all the time

1053
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:17,830
我没有去，因为我不想搞砸
I didn't go 'cause I don't wanna mess up

1054
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:22,940
好吧，我能告诉你一些你必须保密的事情吗？
Okay. Can I tell you something you must keep to yourself?

1055
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:25,410
是的，反正没人听我的
Yeah. No one listens to me anyway

1056
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:27,740
好吧，我有一个姐姐
Okay, well, I have an older sister

1057
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:30,440
我一直生活在她的阴影中
and I have always lived in her shadow

1058
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:32,580
你知道，她什么都有
You know, she's got everything,

1059
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:34,720
她实现了一切
she's achieved everything

1060
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,890
我妈妈总是让我知道这件事
My mum never fails to let me know it

1061
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:40,520
但是我奶奶给了我一个很好的建议
But my granny gave me a really good bit of advice

1062
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,730
她说，只要把一只脚放在另一只脚前面
She said, Just keep putting one foot in front of the other,

1063
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:45,800
最后，感觉就像走路一样
and in the end, it feels like walking.

1064
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:50,870
所以我已经安排你这个星期六来坐你的英文报纸
So I've arranged for you to come in this Saturday and sit your English paper

1065
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:52,930
你是认真的吗？
Are you serious?

1066
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:54,300
你为我做的？
You've done that for me?

1067
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,400
当然，你不能和任何人讨论你的论文
Of course. You mustn't discuss your paper with anyone else

1068
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:58,480
明白吗？
Understood?

1069
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,240
我会知道你以前是否见过这些问题，好吗？我很奇怪
I will know if you've seen the questions before, okay? I'm weird like that

1070
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,780
我发誓，穿过我的心，希望死去
I absolutely swear. Cross my heart and hope to die

1071
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:05,850
不要走那么远
Don't go that far

1072
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,680
好吧，我们应该把你带回来
Right, we should get you back

1073
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,790
那么，来吧
Come on, then

1074
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:14,320
这个星期六你没有任何计划，是吗？
You didn't have any plans this Saturday, did you?

1075
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,760
不，我什么都不做
No, I never do anything

1076
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:34,310
喂？
Hello?

1077
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:35,450
你好，莎拉？
Hello. Sarah?

1078
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:37,250
本？
Ben?

1079
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:38,750
是你吗？
Is that you?

1080
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,490
我又失望了
I disappoint again

1081
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:45,650
和平提议？
Peace offering?

1082
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:46,760
开始
Come on

1083
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:51,330
那么，是什么让你来到了威兰德利亚的船民？
So, what brings you to the Boat People of Wetlandia?

1084
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:54,400
我来是因为我一直在想你那天晚上说的话
I came because I've been thinking about what you said the other night

1085
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,960
我听说你跑得很开心
And I hear you're doing a fun run

1086
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:59,030
啊，嗯，你说得对一半，我正在跑步
Ah. Well, you're half right I am running

1087
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:01,370
那太好了，我很愿意赞助你
That's great I'd love to sponsor you

1088
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:04,770
我认为你这样做是有原因的？
I take it you're doing it for a good cause?

1089
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:08,610
也许是社会不健全的兽医的康复？
Maybe the rehabilitation of hopelessly socially inadequate vets?

1090
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,050
像这样的事情
Something like that

1091
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:13,780
当然，嗯，你几乎可以保证不用付钱
Of course, um, you're almost guaranteed not to have to pay

1092
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:16,080
因为我完成五千米的可能性非常小
as the likelihood of me finishing 5K is pretty slim

1093
01:07:19,590 --> 01:07:20,620
行
Okay

1094
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,690
哦！
Oh!

1095
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:26,430
哇，你确定？这很慷慨
Wow. Are you sure? That is very generous

1096
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:27,600
那是我
That's me

1097
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,660
不足但慷慨
Inadequate but generous

1098
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:33,070
我现在真的要这么做了，不是吗？
I'm really gonna have to do this now, aren't I?

1099
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:34,640
害怕如此
Afraid so

1100
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:43,880
呃，我第一个学期就活了下来
Ugh. I've survived my first term

1101
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,680
你已经活下来了，你已经有所作为了
You've more than survived You've made a difference

1102
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,380
对谁？给孩子们
To who? To the kids

1103
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:49,720
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

1104
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,850
哦，莫林
Oh. Maureen

1105
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:53,090
你要去哪里？
Are you going on somewhere?

1106
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:56,860
啊…哦，不，不，有人告诉我这是一件漂亮的衣服
Eh... Oh. No, no. Someone told me it was fancy dress

1107
01:07:58,460 --> 01:07:59,830
我觉得你看起来很棒
Well, I think you look fabulous

1108
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:00,800
我知道
I know

1109
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:05,070
恭喜你，弗朗西斯小姐
Congratulations, Miss Francis

1110
01:08:05,070 --> 01:08:07,100
你没有我预测的那么糟糕
You're not doing as badly as I predicted you would

1111
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:10,500
哦，我被微弱的赞美所诅咒谢谢你，彼得斯先生
Oh. I feel damned by faint praise Thank you, Mr. Peters

1112
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:11,770
我想
I think

1113
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:13,380
你准备好参加五千米赛跑了吗？
Are you ready for the 5K run?

1114
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,480
到达那里
Getting there

1115
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:18,910
你不是真的在参加帕格救援队吧？
You're not really running for the Pug Rescue, are you?

1116
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:20,580
嗯，一只狗和它有关系
Well, a dog's got something to do with it

1117
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:22,720
聪明的屁股
Wise arse

1118
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:23,720
我听说了
I heard that

1119
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:25,520
是啊，你是命中注定的
Yeah, you were meant to

1120
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:26,790
正确
Right

1121
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:29,290
五，六，一失踪
Five, six One missing

1122
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:41,730
帕特里克！
Patrick!

1123
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:44,670
帕特里克？
Patrick?

1124
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:50,410
帕特里克，你在哪里？
Patrick, where are you?

1125
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:52,840
帕特里克？
Patrick?

1126
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:55,550
帕特里克！
Patrick!

1127
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:04,020
嗯，他有微缺口吗？
Well, is he micro-chipped?

1128
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:04,990
我不知道
I don't know

1129
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:06,890
哦，听着，我肯定我们会找到他的
Oh, look, I'm sure we're gonna find him

1130
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:08,660
你到底基于什么？
What are you basing that on exactly?

1131
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:10,890
他真是个可爱的小伙子
Well, he's such a lovely chap

1132
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:12,260
听着，我们为什么不分开
Look, why don't we split up,

1133
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:13,790
然后我们会在这里汇报
and then we'll report back here

1134
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,200
对，行
Right. Okay

1135
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,270
我会得到更多的帮助对吧，所以
I'll get more help Right, so

1136
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:19,230
哦，对不起，对不起，那是我的
Oh, sorry, sorry That was my

1137
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:21,600
对不起，我很抱歉蛋糕！
Sorry. I'm so sorry The cakes!

1138
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,740
我要去普拉提
I'm off to Pilates

1139
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:37,020
哦，你好
Oh. Hi

1140
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:38,550
莎拉，你到处走走

1141
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:39,620
是谁呀？
Who is it?

1142
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:40,720
哦，我在找维克基
Oh, I was looking for Vikki

1143
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:41,690
她在楼上

1144
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:44,160
你好，弗朗西斯小姐，我会帮你找她

1145
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,800
这是本，我丈夫

1146
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,100
我本来想告诉你哦

1147
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,170
弗朗西斯小姐在楼下

1148
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:50,770
呃，不，我的意思是，为什么你要告诉我？
Er, no. I mean, why Why would you tell me?

1149
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:52,830
那绝对好
That's absolutely fine

1150
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,840
好吧，你是维克基的爸爸，我应该知道的
Okay, you're Vikki's dad I should have known that

1151
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:56,970
嘿，弗朗西斯小姐
Hey, Miss Francis

1152
01:10:56,970 --> 01:10:58,040
怎么了？
What's up?

1153
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,110
嗨，呃，我失去了帕特里克
Hi. Erm I've lost Patrick

1154
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:00,710
我想知道你能否帮我找到他
I was wondering if you could help me find him,

1155
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:02,640
如果你不太忙，我当然会去拿外套
if you're not too busy. Of course I'll go and get my coat

1156
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,050
我能帮忙吗？不！我是说
Can I help? No! I mean,

1157
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:06,950
不，没事，我们会没事的

1158
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:09,250
所以，我会再见你的

1159
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:10,690
我们去找帕特里克吧
Let's go and find Patrick

1160
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:11,660
我本来想告诉你的
I was gonna tell you

1161
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,220
哦，不，老实说，请你为什么要告诉我？
Oh. No, honestly, please Why would you tell me?

1162
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:15,960
这很奇怪，如果有的话
That's weird, if anything,

1163
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,130
如果你告诉我
if you'd told me

1164
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:20,630
再见，我的意思是，这甚至不是一件事
Bye. I mean, it's not even a thing

1165
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:22,530
为什么你会认为这是一件事，而不是一件事？
Why would you think it's a thing when it's not even a thing?

1166
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,200
我的意思是，停止自言自语你听起来完全疯了
I mean, stop talking to yourself You sound completely mad

1167
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:25,470
对不起？没有任何东西
Sorry? Nothing

1168
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:53,260
哦，奶奶，我很抱歉
Oh, Granny, I'm so sorry

1169
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:07,980
莎拉，你做了什么？
Sarah, what have you done?

1170
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:10,780
生日快乐，爸爸
Happy birthday, Dad

1171
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,120
那里，那里，布丁
There, there, pudding

1172
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,880
他会出现的
He'll turn up

1173
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:18,150
开始
Come on

1174
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:20,090
不要告诉卡罗琳我哭了
Don't tell Caroline I cried

1175
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:21,630
不，当然不是
No, of course not

1176
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,360
太妃糖布丁？他们是你最喜欢的
Toffee, pudding? They're your favorite

1177
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:26,630
哦，我不会的
Oh. I won't

1178
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,300
我明天应该跑五公里
I'm supposed to be running five kilometers tomorrow

1179
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:30,130
为什么？你偷了什么东西吗？
Why? Have you stolen something?

1180
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,000
老实说，无论如何，我都不想这么做
To be honest, I don't feel much like doing it anyway

1181
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:36,100
为什么？
Why?

1182
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:37,200
我想念帕特里克
I'm missing Patrick

1183
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:38,170
莎拉
Oh, Sarah

1184
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:41,040
他咕哝和打鼾，但他在我身上渐渐长大
He grunts and snores, but he's kind of growing on me

1185
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,910
我也有魔法
I have that magic too

1186
01:12:42,910 --> 01:12:44,410
听起来和我很般配
Sounds like a perfect match to me

1187
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:47,250
闭嘴，老实说，你失去了他，我并不感到惊讶
Oh, shut up. Honestly, I'm not surprised you lost him

1188
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:48,780
啊，现在，这不公平
Ah, now, that's not fair

1189
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:51,050
不，莎拉非常努力
No. Sarah tries very hard

1190
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:53,390
是的，有一天她会成功的
Yes, and one day she's going to succeed

1191
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:56,190
对不起，请你们都别这么屈尊俯就好吗？
Sorry, can you all stop being so patronizing, please?

1192
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:00,190
爸爸，有什么喝的吗？
Dad, is there anything to drink?

1193
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,260
当然，布丁你想要什么？
Of course, pudding What would you like?

1194
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:04,360
一品脱玻璃杯里的任何东西，请
Anything that comes in a pint glass. Please

1195
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:06,070
杜松子酒和滋补品听起来不错
Gin and tonic Sounds great

1196
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:07,940
第二个想法，拿着补药
Second thoughts, hold the tonic

1197
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:10,040
我以为你明天会跑得很开心
I thought you were meant to be doing a fun run tomorrow

1198
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:12,740
现在，如果你不介意的话
Now, if you'll excuse me,

1199
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:14,980
我要去厨房庆祝我爸爸的生日
I'm going to the kitchen to celebrate my dad's birthday

1200
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:19,820
老实说，你不能对她说什么她太敏感了
Honestly, you can't say anything to her She's so sensitive

1201
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:22,320
什么？
What?

1202
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:30,230
哦，谢谢你
Aw. Thank you

1203
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:32,700
哦
Oh

1204
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:30,120
莎拉？喂？
Sarah? Hello?

1205
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:32,760
我是本
It's Ben

1206
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:51,810
对，谁给爸爸的煎饼？
Right, who's for Daddy's pancakes?

1207
01:14:51,810 --> 01:14:53,310
我，我，我哦，是的，求你了，爸爸
Me, me, me Ooh, yes, please, Daddy

1208
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:54,680
为什么没人叫醒我？
Why did no one wake me?

1209
01:14:56,010 --> 01:14:57,910
我要迟到了，因为我有赞助商和一切
I'm gonna be late for my run I've got sponsors and everything

1210
01:14:58,310 --> 01:15:00,350
我是赞助商，我不介意
I'm a sponsor and I don't mind

1211
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:02,220
你需要睡觉，亲爱的
You needed your sleep, darling

1212
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:04,950
哦，这对我很重要
Oh. This is important to me

1213
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:06,460
你确定杜松子酒不在你的系统里吗？
Are you sure that gin's out of your system?

1214
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:09,960
你能说点什么帮助你一生中的一次吗？
Could you say something helpful for just once in your life?

1215
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:12,130
什么？我做了什么？
What? What have I done?

1216
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:24,210
什么？什么？
What? What?

1217
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:28,110
有人死于事故吗？
Has someone died in an accident?

1218
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:33,350
奇怪，好吧，来吧，哦，上帝
Weird. Okay Come on. Oh, God

1219
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:43,090
哦
Oh

1220
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,890
我真的会筋疲力尽的
I am actually gonna be exhausted

1221
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:48,030
在这场愚蠢的比赛开始之前
before this stupid race even starts

1222
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,800
啊…不！
Ah... No!

1223
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,110
你错过了他们二十分钟前离开的
You've missed it They left 20 minutes ago

1224
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,070
老实说
Honestly,

1225
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:03,910
我不能得到任何正确的东西，我完全没有用
I can't get anything right I am utterly useless

1226
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,420
你为什么不跑？
Well, why aren't you running?

1227
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:11,020
拉伤腿筋
Pulled a hamstring

1228
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:13,890
典型的
Typical

1229
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:15,960
在对我大吼大叫之后，你连跑步都没有
After all that crowing over me and you're not even running

1230
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,190
不
No

1231
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:19,430
我们需要把这些放进车里
We need to get these in the cars

1232
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:21,900
我的赞助会让一个老人非常开心
My sponsorship was gonna make an old man very happy,

1233
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:23,200
或者至少不那么悲惨
or at least a bit less miserable

1234
01:16:24,130 --> 01:16:25,930
哦，老实说，我会哭的
Oh, honestly, I could weep

1235
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:30,270
弗朗西斯小姐
Miss Francis

1236
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:32,040
莎拉
Sarah

1237
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,780
我可以担保你开始
I could vouch for you starting

1238
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:39,420
我是菲利普斯太太的副手
I am Mrs. Phillips' deputy

1239
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,950
哦，谢谢你，呃
Oh, thank you. Erm

1240
01:16:43,990 --> 01:16:45,120
游隼
Peregrine

1241
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:48,320
像猎鹰一样？
Like the falcon?

1242
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:50,330
是
Yes

1243
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,560
谢谢你，呃，佩里格林
Thank you, er, Peregrine

1244
01:16:58,930 --> 01:17:00,870
请回到队伍后面
Back behind the line, please

1245
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:04,610
好像这将会改变五公里的距离
As if that's gonna make a difference over five kilometers

1246
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:06,880
好吧，我们还是好好做吧
Well, we might as well do it properly

1247
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,010
三个
Three,

1248
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:14,380
二，一，哇！
two, one. Waah!

1249
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:17,280
那是什么？
What was that?

1250
01:17:17,290 --> 01:17:18,590
菲利普斯太太喝了一瓶可乐
Mrs. Phillips had a klaxon

1251
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:21,120
行
Okay

1252
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,860
让我们做这件事
Let's do this thing

1253
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:55,230
行
Okay

1254
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,970
过来，狗狗
Come here, doggy

1255
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:07,030
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

1256
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,340
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

1257
01:18:12,210 --> 01:18:13,980
你确定你没事吗？
Are you sure you're okay?

1258
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,640
是的，是的，我很好
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine

1259
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:20,340
我可以做个安全记录吗？
Could I just make a safety note?

1260
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:22,380
请不要靠在障碍物上
Please do not lean on the barriers

1261
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:23,780
我们今天发生了一些事件
We have had a number of incidents today

1262
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:27,250
我们也有很多
And we also do have a lot

1263
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:29,480
继续，米奇，发生
Go on, Mikey. Go on

1264
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,580
获胜者是迈克尔·阿齐基瓦
And the winner is Michael Azikiwe

1265
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:34,660
我为你感到骄傲

哦，干得好，迈克尔，恭喜
Oh, well done, Michael. Congratulations

1269
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:42,700
哦，我不知道你是个跑步者
Oh, I didn't know you were a runner

1270
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,200
你为什么不告诉我你可以这样跑？
Why didn't you tell me you could run like that?

1271
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,100
我不知道，弗朗西斯小姐让我做的
I don't know. Miss Francis made me do it

1272
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:50,500
你一定要感谢弗朗西斯小姐
Well, you make sure you thank Miss Francis

1273
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:51,740
你有天赋

1274
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:04,520
我们取消了
We have canceled

1275
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,520
恐怕是海绵老师游戏
the sponge-a-teacher game I'm afraid

1276
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:08,760
如果人们能多一点
If people could be a little more

1277
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,060
维克基！维克基！

1278

嘿！嘿！嘿！

很抱歉，我最近一直很困难

哦…别担心

1284
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:27,640
这对我们所有人来说都很难
It's been hard on all of us

1285
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,480
现在妈妈走了会更容易
It'll be easier now Mum's gone

1286
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,380
这对她更好

1287
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:35,020
你和我，我们会处理得很好

嗨
Oh, hi

01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,740
有点晚了，不是吗？
Little bit late, aren't we?

1291
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:57,870
不，只是明年初
No, just early for next year

1292
01:20:57,870 --> 01:21:00,240
如果你愿意，我可以和你一起跑一会儿
I can run with you for a bit if you like

1293
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:02,310
减轻找个人谈话的痛苦
Eases the pain to have someone to talk to

1294
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:04,280

1295
01:21:05,650 --> 01:21:07,350
肖小姐！

是的，菲利普斯太太？
Yes, Mrs. Phillips?

1297
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:09,790
我只是…哦

1298
01:21:10,850 --> 01:21:12,320
我刚收到彼得斯先生的留言
I've, erm, I've just had a message from Mr. Peters

1299

弗朗西斯小姐正在跑步
Miss Francis is running

1300
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:16,490
她迟到了，但她确实开始了

1301
01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:17,460
聪明的
Brilliant

1302
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:20,490
我能借你的扬声器吗？
Can I borrow your loudhailer?

1303
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,460
我只是想

我的朋友莎拉开始了比赛
My friend Sarah started the race

1312

She's raised sponsorship of ￡1,000 to buy an old man a mobility scooter

1313
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:56,200
如果有人能抽出一点时间
If anyone could just spare a little bit of time

为了让她回家高兴，请留下来

如果她有什么感觉

01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:34,400
她会停下来喝杯咖啡和一块蛋糕
