1
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:05,172
You're dead, bitch!

2
00:01:14,888 --> 00:01:16,685
What the hell you lookin' at?

3
00:01:31,638 --> 00:01:33,538
Fuckin' hell.

4
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,854
Looks like you are
shit outta luck, beautiful.

5
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,953
Now I'm gonna give you
your C-section.

6
00:01:53,627 --> 00:01:54,855
You son of a bi…

7
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,057
Eat your vegetables.

8
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:02,728
She's in here!

9
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:04,202
Come on!

10
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,804
Where is she?

11
00:02:09,943 --> 00:02:11,035
There she is!

12
00:02:12,712 --> 00:02:14,270
— Get out of here!
— Over there!

13
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:17,381
Kill her on sight!

14
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:24,521
Who the fuck is that?

15
00:02:24,558 --> 00:02:26,253
Where the hell is the girl?

16
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:33,399
Get him!

17
00:02:41,608 --> 00:02:43,667
Jesus!

18
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:53,743
Oh, God! Fuck!

19
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:09,633
Come on, push. Push!

20
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:17,937
My hand!

21
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:22,273
— Do you know what I hate?
— No.

22
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:25,842
I hate these 40-year-old jack-holes
wearing ponytails.

23
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,447
— That ponytail doesn't make you look hip…
— Come on.

24
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:31,389
… young, or cool.

25
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:35,290
OK, it's comin'. Come on.

26
00:03:35,328 --> 00:03:36,386
Give me one big push.

27
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:49,706
What the fuck?

28
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:58,180
I'm bleedin'. I'm bleedin' out.

29
00:03:58,218 --> 00:04:00,379
Quit squirming,
you're ruining my shot.

30
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:06,151
What a piece of crap.

31
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:10,890
We're outta here.

32
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:18,630
Sorry about
the messy delivery, Mom.

33
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:28,510
We need quiet.

34
00:04:28,548 --> 00:04:29,708
Give Junior something to drink.

35
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:56,342
Bravo, Mr. Hero. Bravo.

36
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:57,968
Why you tryin' to kill this woman?

37
00:05:00,347 --> 00:05:01,814
Something funny?

38
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:04,339
Oh, I was just remembering
a limerick.

39
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:06,875
Well, «There once was a woman
who was quite begat…

40
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,650
She had three babies
named Nat, Pat and Tat…

41
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:11,156
She said it was fun
at the breeding…

42
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:13,591
But found it was hell
in the feeding…

43
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:17,188
When she saw there was
no tit for Tat.»

44
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,358
You have caused me
no end of trouble.

45
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,766
But now I shall return the favor.

46
00:05:22,802 --> 00:05:24,565
Tit for tat, right?

47
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,940
Now, see, that's the latest thing.

48
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:30,772
The gun will only fire
when it recognizes…

49
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,402
the thumbprint of the owner.

50
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:35,812
It makes firearms safer
and it cuts down the crime too.

51
00:05:36,783 --> 00:05:37,977
Get him!

52
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:49,755
Who are you?

53
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:52,162
Lady, what's your name?

54
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,489
Nice knockers.

55
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,435
God damn it!

56
00:07:24,057 --> 00:07:26,116
Fuck you, ya fuckin' fuckers.

57
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:51,417
Tit for tat, Mr. Hero.

58
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:53,078
Tit for tat.

59
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:59,122
Grab his legs.

60
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,524
Get him in there. Come on.

61
00:08:02,095 --> 00:08:03,528
I was goin' back for her, boss.

62
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:05,690
No, I got it.

63
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:08,462
Hey, I'm not the head honcho
who sits on his hands…

64
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:10,059
warming them
with his own exhaust…

65
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:11,502
while everybody else
does the work.

66
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:13,335
Every second counts, right?

67
00:08:17,877 --> 00:08:20,641
Now, how the heck
did this happen, huh?

68
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:27,318
Everything was goin' smooth
at the safe house…

69
00:08:27,954 --> 00:08:29,182
… when the woman draws a gun.

70
00:08:29,222 --> 00:08:32,214
I mean, who expects a pregnant
lady to pull a piece on ya, eh?

71
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:34,556
And who was this man
who was with her?

72
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:35,993
I don't know.

73
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:37,963
After the woman escaped,
we tracked her here.

74
00:08:37,997 --> 00:08:39,487
This guy, he was hangin' around…

75
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:40,760
at the bus stop.

76
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,665
I mean, so we decided
that we'd deal with him later…

77
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:44,101
but we go after the woman…

78
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:46,196
he gets in on the action. You know?

79
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:48,537
He took a gun,
he started shootin' at us,

80
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:50,008
and that's…
that's when y…

81
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:51,374
— Oh. OK.
— … you arrived.

82
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:53,379
Take it easy. Sit down.

83
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:54,573
All right.

84
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:55,842
Oh, you all right?

85
00:08:56,216 --> 00:08:57,478
OK.

86
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:00,075
Are you tryin' to tell me…

87
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:03,577
that some bum
came to her rescue?

88
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:06,649
Well, well, well,
this is a fine mess, huh?

89
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,057
I won't make
this mistake again.

90
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:12,187
Well, I got a piece of lead
in my butt as a reminder.

91
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:13,256
OK.

92
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:15,961
I can appreciate that.

93
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:18,226
My ass!

94
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:21,699
And let that be a reminder
never to fail me again.

95
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:32,400
Damn.

96
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:11,239
Don't make me kill you
to get the baby.

97
00:12:05,838 --> 00:12:07,806
Back off.

98
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:01,991
Sweetie, this deal is almost done.

99
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:05,464
Look, I've already booked
my flight home.

100
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:07,329
OK?

101
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:08,958
OK.

102
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:10,992
I love you too.

103
00:13:11,037 --> 00:13:12,868
Yeah. Bye-bye.

104
00:13:15,908 --> 00:13:18,638
You know why a gun
is better than a wife?

105
00:13:20,546 --> 00:13:21,535
Don't know.

106
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:25,108
Well, you can put
a silencer on a gun.

107
00:13:31,357 --> 00:13:32,551
Sir, we spotted the target…

108
00:13:32,592 --> 00:13:34,560
at Third and Jefferson heading
toward the park.

109
00:13:34,594 --> 00:13:35,618
Turn us around.

110
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,731
Come on! Dad!

111
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:45,362
— Come on.
— All right.

112
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:47,497
Who's Daddy's little girl?

113
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:09,626
Don't worry, kid.
Someone good'll find you.

114
00:14:20,506 --> 00:14:22,303
Oh, my God, look at this.

115
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:26,203
Someone left a baby.

116
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:33,340
Oops.

117
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,977
Fuck me sideways.

118
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:35,775
Welcome back, Mr. Smith.

119
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:37,305
Where's Quintana?

120
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,376
Wait, Smith, Mistress Donna's
with a customer.

121
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:41,443
Wait, you can't go up there.

122
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:42,818
Oh, yeah, baby.

123
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:44,618
— Smith?
— You like that, huh?

124
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:46,682
Besides, I thought Mistress Mary
was more your type.

125
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:48,523
You can't go up there.

126
00:15:58,237 --> 00:15:59,795
— Come 'ere!

127
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:31,526
Sorry, pal, the bar's closed.

128
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:41,674
Wait your turn, Smith.

129
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:43,011
There's plenty to go around.

130
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:46,018
Not for me, thanks.
I'm lactose intolerant.

131
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:48,452
Just tell me
what you want, Smith.

132
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:01,455
Kinky.

133
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,298
I want you to take care of this
baby for a while.

134
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:05,599
Five grand.

135
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:07,697
That should keep you off your
back for a couple of weeks.

136
00:17:10,543 --> 00:17:11,840
Are you clean?

137
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:14,710
You know
I'm a good Girl Scout.

138
00:17:14,747 --> 00:17:15,805
So you'll do it.

139
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:18,942
Vaffanculo.
Screw yourself, Smith.

140
00:17:18,984 --> 00:17:21,452
For all I know,
you snatched the kid.

141
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:23,387
I don't want to be an accessory
for kidnapping.

142
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:25,151
I didn't steal the kid, trust me.

143
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:27,352
Trust you?

144
00:17:27,393 --> 00:17:30,556
I don't even know your real name.

145
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:32,188
Who are you really, Smith?

146
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:35,156
I'm a British nanny…

147
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:36,498
and I'm dangerous.

148
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:50,405
Just keep the baby for one day
and you can keep the whole roll.

149
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:05,222
Forget it, Dad.

150
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:10,330
Fine.

151
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:14,772
Ciao.

152
00:19:09,762 --> 00:19:11,320
Breast milk.

153
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:15,993
Let's go.

154
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:18,600
This lady's baby needs to be fed.

155
00:19:18,637 --> 00:19:21,435
Find me every wet nurse,
lactating hooker…

156
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:23,908
and mammary on tap
in the city.

157
00:19:26,345 --> 00:19:29,212
I already told you, Smith,
you're not welcome…

158
00:19:29,248 --> 00:19:31,148
in the land of milk and honey.

159
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,721
I need a little cream for
my coffee and some answers.

160
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:43,361
I'm sorry.

161
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,995
Scram, fellas.

162
00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:50,399
Give me a moment alone
here with, uh…

163
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:52,597
Caffe La Mamma.

164
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:56,335
Relax. Relax.

165
00:19:58,377 --> 00:20:00,811
Mia piccola troietta.

166
00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:10,749
There was a man here
with a baby not too long ago.

167
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:12,848
Yes. A real jerk.

168
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:16,551
He wanted me
to take care of the kid.

169
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,396
And what is this man's name?

170
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,963
Smith.

171
00:20:23,002 --> 00:20:24,936
Mr. Smith.

172
00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:32,339
How the hell
do I know his real name?

173
00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:34,505
He saw me a couple of times…

174
00:20:34,547 --> 00:20:36,674
when I was pulling straight tricks.

175
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:39,149
He always used
the same name — Smith.

176
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:43,010
I don't believe you.

177
00:20:46,025 --> 00:20:49,188
I think you know
more about this man.

178
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:54,565
He was a lousy tipper.

179
00:20:58,437 --> 00:21:01,429
It gets hotter the more times it's fired.

180
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:08,742
If I had anything on him,
I'd tell you.

181
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:19,953
And it gets a lot more
painful the closer I get.

182
00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:26,894
What's up, Doc?

183
00:21:26,932 --> 00:21:30,459
Oh, you're a «wascally wabbit».

184
00:21:33,405 --> 00:21:35,635
But you're not «wascally» enough.

185
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:37,767
Yeah?

186
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,744
That's a six-shooter.

187
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:42,572
I just counted six shots.

188
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:46,416
You've blown your load.

189
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,115
Yeah, well, what about you?

190
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,992
Your 9-millimeter is empty too.

191
00:21:57,029 --> 00:22:00,226
Yeah, you fired 8 on the rooftop,
one in the men's room…

192
00:22:00,265 --> 00:22:03,257
and your second cartridge
was expended at the playground.

193
00:22:03,302 --> 00:22:05,998
And you won't be getting it up
with that gun you took off my man.

194
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:08,199
Oh, no. Well, you see,
like my weapon…

195
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,334
it also has the thumbprint
safety device.

196
00:22:11,377 --> 00:22:13,174
Oh, really?

197
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:15,408
Wanna bet?

198
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,093
Nothin' like a good hand job.

199
00:22:47,046 --> 00:22:50,277
Get your things. We're goin'.

200
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,651
I don't understand a word
you're going on about…

201
00:22:59,692 --> 00:23:02,661
but I know exactly what you're saying
and I refuse to apologize.

202
00:23:02,695 --> 00:23:05,664
Damn you, Smith. I could have
been snuffed back there.

203
00:23:05,698 --> 00:23:08,360
Yeah, you should be thanking me
for saving your sweet back door.

204
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,561
Why did you wait so goddamn long?

205
00:23:10,602 --> 00:23:12,627
You're a bad girl,
you deserve to be punished.

206
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:14,639
Which car do you want?

207
00:23:14,673 --> 00:23:16,868
— What?
— I'm tired of walking.

208
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:20,707
Look at this.

209
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,647
You wanna know the difference…

210
00:23:26,685 --> 00:23:29,518
between this luxury car
and a porcupine?

211
00:23:29,555 --> 00:23:30,613
I give up.

212
00:23:32,057 --> 00:23:34,321
With the car,
the pricks are on the inside.

213
00:23:35,661 --> 00:23:37,652
Tell me about it.

214
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,443
Hello, honey.

215
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,550
Oh, good, good, I'm glad…

216
00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:01,815
I'm glad you liked the flowers.
Good.

217
00:24:02,654 --> 00:24:04,622
Listen, sweetie…

218
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:07,056
I've run into a small hitch.

219
00:24:09,027 --> 00:24:11,723
I think I'm gonna have to be
out here for a while longer.

220
00:24:11,764 --> 00:24:14,062
But don't worry.

221
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:16,397
I will be back in time
for Timmy's birthday party…

222
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:18,062
I swear to you.

223
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:19,832
Hugs and kisses.

224
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:21,533
Bye-bye.

225
00:24:22,674 --> 00:24:24,403
So, what was I supposed to do?

226
00:24:24,443 --> 00:24:26,536
These guys were stalking
this pregnant lady.

227
00:24:26,578 --> 00:24:27,738
I couldn't just stand there.

228
00:24:30,215 --> 00:24:32,843
Did you see that?
I fuckin' hate that.

229
00:24:32,885 --> 00:24:34,614
— What?
— This guy, changin' lanes…

230
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:35,881
without signaling.

231
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:37,855
I mean, how hard is it
to use your signal?

232
00:24:39,658 --> 00:24:42,092
So you started shooting at them?

233
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:44,459
No, I don't carry a piece.

234
00:24:44,496 --> 00:24:46,430
I went to the woman. She had a gun.

235
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:48,592
They started firing, I shot back.

236
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:50,727
He's done it again.

237
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:52,760
I move my finger one inch…

238
00:24:52,805 --> 00:24:54,272
to use my turn signal.

239
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:55,796
Why are these assholes so lazy…

240
00:24:55,841 --> 00:24:58,776
they can't move their finger
one fucking measly inch…

241
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:00,176
to drive more safely?

242
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:03,239
— You wanna know why?
— Not particularly.

243
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:04,647
Because these rich bastards
have to…

244
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:06,275
be callous and inconsiderate
in the first place…

245
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:08,013
to make all that money,
so when they get on the road…

246
00:25:08,053 --> 00:25:09,452
they can't help themselves.
They've gotta be…

247
00:25:09,488 --> 00:25:11,649
callous and inconsiderate
drivers too.

248
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,748
It's in their nature.

249
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:14,520
Why don't you take the baby
to the police?

250
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,290
— I can't go to the police.
— Why not?

251
00:25:17,329 --> 00:25:18,853
I'm the Unabomber.

252
00:25:18,897 --> 00:25:20,831
They caught the Unabomber.

253
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:21,958
That's what they think.

254
00:25:23,135 --> 00:25:25,035
Stupid…

255
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,697
Right. That's it.

256
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:39,313
You are the angriest man
in the world.

257
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:42,684
If I remember right,
you used to like it like that.

258
00:25:46,058 --> 00:25:48,390
Well, how many freelancers
have you got?

259
00:25:49,695 --> 00:25:51,925
Yeah? How many local boys?

260
00:25:52,998 --> 00:25:54,693
I need men, you understand?

261
00:25:56,535 --> 00:25:58,127
I need a lot more men.

262
00:26:14,186 --> 00:26:15,585
I want four mags…

263
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:18,522
a box of 9-millimeter
147 hollow-points…

264
00:26:19,992 --> 00:26:21,857
… and give me 50 FMJs.

265
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:30,128
You're a little short.

266
00:26:30,168 --> 00:26:34,070
You lied. You said you had $5,000.

267
00:26:34,106 --> 00:26:36,438
How about we make up the
difference with food stamps?

268
00:26:36,475 --> 00:26:38,966
You wanna buy bullets
with food stamps?

269
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:40,035
It's as good as cash.

270
00:26:40,078 --> 00:26:41,705
You're pathetic, Smith.

271
00:26:41,747 --> 00:26:44,272
We'll wait for you outside.

272
00:26:44,316 --> 00:26:47,251
Look, why don't I sign over this check
I got at the blood bank to you?

273
00:26:47,286 --> 00:26:49,345
It'll more than cover it.

274
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:51,549
Throw in that check you got
from the sperm bank…

275
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,114
and got yourself a deal.

276
00:26:53,158 --> 00:26:55,092
I don't get that check
till Wednesday.

277
00:26:55,727 --> 00:26:57,922
Listen, why don't you take
a half-a box of shells…

278
00:26:57,963 --> 00:26:59,157
and I'll give you the other half…

279
00:26:59,197 --> 00:27:01,097
when you bring me the rest
of the money on Wednesday.

280
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:02,691
Deal.

281
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,719
Damn it, Smith!

282
00:27:30,762 --> 00:27:32,127
What the hell are you doing?

283
00:27:32,164 --> 00:27:33,426
Making some money.

284
00:27:33,465 --> 00:27:34,989
— Making some money?
— Well, yeah.

285
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:37,058
To buy something for the baby.

286
00:27:37,102 --> 00:27:38,797
Something for the baby?

287
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:46,576
A bulletproof vest is a better
investment than a crib.

288
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,240
Makes me think what you'd do
to get him in the right school.

289
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:54,743
So this is it.

290
00:27:55,787 --> 00:27:58,347
It's not the Ritz but it's home.

291
00:27:59,658 --> 00:28:01,523
Same old Smith.

292
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,788
Down and dirty.

293
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:04,989
Glad you like it.

294
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:14,365
Say hello to Mickey.

295
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:25,712
Maybe I should take the baby
to the police.

296
00:28:25,751 --> 00:28:27,343
No, you'd never make it.

297
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:28,876
They'll be watching
all the precincts…

298
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,218
probably got some of the boys in blue
on payola too.

299
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:47,295
I've rounded up 50 guys.

300
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:49,034
Well, I guess that's just
gonna have to do, huh?

301
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,684
Stop the car. He was here.

302
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:02,584
Come on, what makes
you think he was here?

303
00:29:02,621 --> 00:29:05,385
Trust me. I know what people do
and I know what people think.

304
00:29:05,424 --> 00:29:08,882
I always have.
Even as a kid, I had this gift.

305
00:29:08,927 --> 00:29:11,191
Yeah, you shoulda seen
the playground hurt I laid down…

306
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:13,197
playin' rock, paper, scissors, buddy.

307
00:29:13,231 --> 00:29:15,392
Now stop the car.

308
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:18,696
Who do you think
wants this baby dead?

309
00:29:18,737 --> 00:29:21,035
I've no idea who's tryin' to kill it.

310
00:29:21,073 --> 00:29:22,904
Don't call him an «it».

311
00:29:22,941 --> 00:29:24,602
It's an «it» to me.

312
00:29:28,613 --> 00:29:31,548
Tell me, Smith,
is there anything you like?

313
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:33,710
Yeah, my privacy.

314
00:29:38,457 --> 00:29:41,119
Tell me something I don't know
per una volta…

315
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:42,558
brutto figlio di puttana bastardo.

316
00:29:42,594 --> 00:29:45,119
I love it when you talk like that.

317
00:29:46,064 --> 00:29:47,895
Can I offer you anything?

318
00:29:49,534 --> 00:29:50,933
Carrot?

319
00:29:52,471 --> 00:29:54,405
It's good for your eyesight.

320
00:29:59,277 --> 00:30:00,744
Of all the squats in the city…

321
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,713
how does he know
Smith's in this one?

322
00:30:02,747 --> 00:30:04,339
Another lucky guess?

323
00:30:04,382 --> 00:30:06,145
Nah, he doesn't guess.

324
00:30:06,184 --> 00:30:08,118
He sees things we don't.

325
00:30:08,153 --> 00:30:11,145
He was once an FBl profiler.

326
00:30:11,189 --> 00:30:14,056
Forensic behavior consultant.

327
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:17,061
My God, how many times
do I have to tell you guys?

328
00:30:17,095 --> 00:30:18,562
Details…

329
00:30:20,098 --> 00:30:23,659
… make all the difference
in this business.

330
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:25,226
Hey, but…

331
00:30:26,138 --> 00:30:28,231
Don't… you think
you should hang back, sir?

332
00:30:28,273 --> 00:30:31,208
The leader who stays in the rear,
takes it in the rear.

333
00:30:36,014 --> 00:30:37,879
Besides…

334
00:30:42,254 --> 00:30:44,984
violence is one of
the most fun things to watch.

335
00:30:46,024 --> 00:30:47,321
No, no, no, baby, no.

336
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:49,020
We could call him Oliver.

337
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,620
— Oliver?
— Yeah, like Oliver Twist.

338
00:30:51,663 --> 00:30:53,358
Because he's an orphan?

339
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:54,524
'Cause I like the book.

340
00:30:54,566 --> 00:30:56,659
— You like the book.
— I didn't hate it.

341
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:58,396
That's a first.

342
00:31:03,575 --> 00:31:06,271
Which birthday card do
you think I should go with here?

343
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,837
Cute and cuddly?

344
00:31:09,414 --> 00:31:12,440
Or the one that says,
«You're becomin' a man now, son»?

345
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:17,815
So, Mr. Hertz?

346
00:31:17,856 --> 00:31:19,255
How old is your son?

347
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:20,849
He's 8.

348
00:31:20,892 --> 00:31:23,292
Then it had to be
large and powerful and…

349
00:31:24,196 --> 00:31:25,823
Can you believe it?

350
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:26,956
There's nothing on the TV…

351
00:31:26,998 --> 00:31:28,659
— about any of this.
— … without a trace.

352
00:31:32,504 --> 00:31:34,062
… roadside bomb wounded…

353
00:31:34,105 --> 00:31:35,299
We have it in our…

354
00:31:38,143 --> 00:31:40,407
Hey. Do you notice that?

355
00:31:40,445 --> 00:31:41,878
Notice what?

356
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:43,676
Look.

357
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:48,175
Lame-ass politician rants about
gun control, he cries.

358
00:31:49,454 --> 00:31:50,716
— So tonight…
— Switch to this channel…

359
00:31:50,755 --> 00:31:51,915
with this heavy metal music…

360
00:31:54,392 --> 00:31:55,484
… he shuts up.

361
00:31:56,695 --> 00:31:58,128
That's so weird.

362
00:32:01,499 --> 00:32:04,161
He must find it comforting.

363
00:32:04,202 --> 00:32:05,669
— Sir?
— Yeah?

364
00:32:05,704 --> 00:32:09,333
— Men are in place on the roof.
— That's good.

365
00:32:09,374 --> 00:32:12,832
Anybody know what a
Jimmy Cagney love scene is?

366
00:32:13,979 --> 00:32:16,072
It's where Cagney
lets the good guy live.

367
00:32:20,285 --> 00:32:24,016
And if that happens in this show…

368
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:26,717
I'm gonna do a lot more
than ask for my money back.

369
00:32:26,758 --> 00:32:30,819
All right? Let's kill this mother. Go.

370
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:37,296
It doesn't surprise me that
Oliver's into death metal.

371
00:32:37,335 --> 00:32:39,030
Look at his surrogate parents.

372
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,732
No, I'm telling ya, this means…

373
00:32:43,642 --> 00:32:45,041
Go. Back way.

374
00:35:13,091 --> 00:35:15,525
My God, do we really suck…

375
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,790
or is this guy really that good?

376
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:19,421
Come on, boys!

377
00:35:19,464 --> 00:35:21,364
He ain't out of the briar patch yet!

378
00:35:40,418 --> 00:35:42,283
Shoot the dog, shoot the dog.

379
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,582
No.

380
00:35:45,023 --> 00:35:47,048
— Why not?
— I like dogs.

381
00:36:08,546 --> 00:36:10,275
Wait a minute.

382
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:16,085
Oh, that rat bastard.

383
00:36:31,402 --> 00:36:32,528
What is it?

384
00:36:33,204 --> 00:36:34,569
It's the baby's diaper.

385
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:41,977
This idea blows, Smith.

386
00:36:42,013 --> 00:36:43,503
It's the only idea we got.

387
00:36:43,548 --> 00:36:46,039
You actually think
that Oliver's mother…

388
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:48,177
lived near a heavy metal club…

389
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:51,655
… and that he could hear the music
while he was still inside the womb?

390
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:53,088
Yep. That's why he doesn't cry…

391
00:36:53,124 --> 00:36:54,989
when he's listenin' to some
headbanger's bash.

392
00:36:55,026 --> 00:36:56,323
Ridiculous.

393
00:36:56,995 --> 00:36:58,360
Well, he isn't cryin' now.

394
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,663
So this is the only club near where
I encountered the baby's mother.

395
00:37:05,703 --> 00:37:08,171
I still say this is a wild hunch.

396
00:37:08,206 --> 00:37:10,538
Yeah? So how do you explain
all these boxes of diapers?

397
00:37:10,575 --> 00:37:12,440
Somebody's been stocking up.

398
00:37:12,477 --> 00:37:14,240
Let's find out who.

399
00:37:31,496 --> 00:37:34,363
— You the owner of this place?
— Who's askin'?

400
00:37:34,399 --> 00:37:35,957
I am.

401
00:37:38,169 --> 00:37:40,603
— Can I buy you a drink?
— No.

402
00:37:43,141 --> 00:37:45,405
Just as I suspected.

403
00:37:45,443 --> 00:37:47,843
He really is into jewelry.

404
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:52,940
Who occupies the room upstairs?

405
00:37:52,984 --> 00:37:54,383
Go to hell.

406
00:37:54,419 --> 00:37:55,909
Don't mess with me.

407
00:37:55,954 --> 00:37:57,785
You ain't got the cojones.

408
00:38:00,558 --> 00:38:02,082
Oh, God.

409
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:05,492
So who were these guys?

410
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:09,432
I rented the place to some suit
11 months ago.

411
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:11,992
He paid the whole year in cash.

412
00:38:12,036 --> 00:38:13,503
I never saw him again.

413
00:38:13,538 --> 00:38:15,904
I just figured they were
usin' the back way.

414
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,875
Beat it.

415
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,629
Oh, madonna.

416
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:43,125
Che orrore!

417
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:45,633
This is pretty fucked up.

418
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,761
Sir, it's your go-to guy.

419
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:20,334
All the mothers have been killed.

420
00:39:20,371 --> 00:39:22,805
Only one escaped, temporarily.

421
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,276
We found her body and confirmed
that she did deliver a child.

422
00:39:27,578 --> 00:39:29,205
The babies were supposed
to be delivered covertly.

423
00:39:29,247 --> 00:39:30,942
I guess setting up this
maternity factory…

424
00:39:30,982 --> 00:39:33,974
on top of a heavy metal club
wasn't particularly secret.

425
00:39:34,018 --> 00:39:36,816
What a fine lot of
babysitters we turned out to be.

426
00:39:36,854 --> 00:39:39,584
When Mr. Go-To Guy passes,
head to the left.

427
00:39:39,624 --> 00:39:41,216
Yes, sir, I already made the call.

428
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:43,921
Backup should be
arriving any minute.

429
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:45,724
We'll clean this mess up
and try to piece together…

430
00:39:45,763 --> 00:39:46,957
everything that happened.

431
00:39:48,132 --> 00:39:51,226
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate your confidence.

432
00:39:52,403 --> 00:39:54,894
Gentlemen, let's find some answers.

433
00:39:59,043 --> 00:40:01,409
Watch where you step.

434
00:40:01,446 --> 00:40:04,643
— The ice cream is melting.
— What?

435
00:40:04,682 --> 00:40:07,082
I thought donor sperm
was your department.

436
00:40:07,618 --> 00:40:09,483
These freezers are full of samples.

437
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:13,020
This is weird.

438
00:40:13,057 --> 00:40:14,854
There seems to be only one donor.

439
00:40:14,892 --> 00:40:16,416
One donor?

440
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:18,827
Yeah. And a generous one at that.

441
00:40:27,638 --> 00:40:29,401
This is bone marrow blood.

442
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,465
It must be for some kind of cure.

443
00:40:33,511 --> 00:40:34,944
How do you know that, Smith?

444
00:40:34,979 --> 00:40:36,879
You didn't hear about
my Nobel Prize?

445
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:48,386
See, what it is, it's hard to find marrow
that matches that of the recipient.

446
00:40:48,426 --> 00:40:50,792
The odds are much better
if the donor marrow shares…

447
00:40:50,828 --> 00:40:53,388
the same DNA with
the person receiving it.

448
00:40:54,832 --> 00:40:57,699
You mean these people were
harvesting babies…

449
00:40:57,735 --> 00:41:00,067
for some guy's
bone marrow transplant?

450
00:41:00,104 --> 00:41:03,301
Exactly. And somebody
wanted to make sure he didn't get it.

451
00:41:03,808 --> 00:41:06,072
That's why they want Oliver dead.

452
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:33,566
No, my baby, no.

453
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:37,539
So I called that guy I know at NBC.

454
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:39,167
That's good.

455
00:41:40,011 --> 00:41:41,410
And then I got to thinking.

456
00:41:41,445 --> 00:41:44,278
— You know what I hate?
— Here we go again.

457
00:41:44,315 --> 00:41:45,976
I hate those lame action movies…

458
00:41:46,017 --> 00:41:48,645
where the good guy calls
just one person who ends up betrayin' him.

459
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:53,017
Yeah. That's right up there
with killing baby seals.

460
00:41:53,057 --> 00:41:56,925
I called ABC, CBS,
The Post, The Times…

461
00:41:56,961 --> 00:41:59,429
the local news channel, and the FBl.

462
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:03,190
So, what do we do next?

463
00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:05,225
I figure we hang here
and watch the news.

464
00:42:05,269 --> 00:42:07,999
Once the story goes public,
maybe we'll be safe.

465
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,434
Look. He finally went to sleep.

466
00:42:12,476 --> 00:42:14,103
Yeah, you just wait.

467
00:42:14,145 --> 00:42:17,740
The moment you close
your eyes for a nap, he'll start screaming.

468
00:42:17,782 --> 00:42:21,218
You can't take a little pleasure
in anything, can you?

469
00:42:21,252 --> 00:42:23,277
You just hate everything.

470
00:42:23,888 --> 00:42:24,946
I don't hate you.

471
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,280
Is that why you picked me?

472
00:42:27,325 --> 00:42:28,485
You know why I picked you.

473
00:42:29,393 --> 00:42:31,827
You have no idea
what you've done to me.

474
00:42:31,863 --> 00:42:34,093
We're gonna get out of this, trust me.

475
00:42:34,131 --> 00:42:37,066
— You just don't get it.
— What?

476
00:42:38,703 --> 00:42:44,869
You bring me this child
so I can feed him, take care of him.

477
00:42:44,909 --> 00:42:48,072
A baby that could be dead
at any moment.

478
00:42:48,112 --> 00:42:50,376
And you never even think
to ask me…

479
00:42:50,414 --> 00:42:52,314
what happened to my own child.

480
00:42:57,388 --> 00:42:59,015
You're right.

481
00:43:01,459 --> 00:43:02,824
It's unforgivable.

482
00:43:05,863 --> 00:43:08,423
No. lt's my fault.

483
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,226
It's like what my mamma
always said…

484
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:16,070
«Le uova non devono ballare
con le pietre».

485
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:19,167
If I say I'm sorry will
you tell me what that means?

486
00:43:20,311 --> 00:43:23,712
Eggs have no business
dancing with stones.

487
00:43:48,072 --> 00:43:49,937
You know, Smith…

488
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:53,273
I figured out what you hate most…

489
00:43:53,311 --> 00:43:54,903
yourself.

490
00:43:57,915 --> 00:43:59,746
What happened to your baby?

491
00:43:59,784 --> 00:44:01,547
Forget about it.

492
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:03,177
Tell me.

493
00:44:04,055 --> 00:44:06,615
My pimp hit me in the stomach.

494
00:44:07,858 --> 00:44:09,723
My baby…

495
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,785
was delivered stillborn.

496
00:44:16,467 --> 00:44:18,094
— Get off of me!
— Hey.

497
00:44:35,186 --> 00:44:36,744
You like this, do ya?

498
00:44:41,058 --> 00:44:44,027
It's called a gun.

499
00:44:44,061 --> 00:44:49,590
Grip, slide, breech, barrel, trigger.

500
00:44:49,633 --> 00:44:52,500
Now, this is the business end.

501
00:44:52,536 --> 00:44:56,131
You should never point this
at anything you don't intend to kill.

502
00:44:57,508 --> 00:45:01,638
Now, this is important.
This is called your safety.

503
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:05,615
You have to keep this on to make sure
the gun doesn't go off accidentally.

504
00:45:05,649 --> 00:45:10,609
But really, this is
your number one safety.

505
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,925
Are you hungry?

506
00:47:18,582 --> 00:47:20,982
Talk about shootin' your load.

507
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:28,584
Look at this.

508
00:47:29,426 --> 00:47:31,587
This is a Hammerson Nite Tac.

509
00:47:31,629 --> 00:47:33,859
These aren't supposed to
hit the streets for 6 months.

510
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,159
This is weird.

511
00:47:38,202 --> 00:47:40,136
All these guys have got 'em.

512
00:47:45,142 --> 00:47:46,666
Don't even tell me.

513
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:49,270
Do you know how many of our men
he's body-bagged now?

514
00:47:49,313 --> 00:47:53,374
Why should I waste my beautiful mind
on something like that?

515
00:47:53,417 --> 00:47:55,248
Doesn't it piss you off a little?

516
00:47:55,286 --> 00:47:57,345
Getting angry releases an enzyme…

517
00:47:57,388 --> 00:47:58,821
tryptophan hydroxylase…

518
00:47:58,856 --> 00:48:01,552
which can temporarily
reduce the l.Q.

519
00:48:01,592 --> 00:48:03,822
That's something I can't
afford to do right now.

520
00:48:03,861 --> 00:48:06,056
How do you know all that?

521
00:48:06,096 --> 00:48:08,189
My boy's hooked
on the Discovery Channel.

522
00:48:08,232 --> 00:48:10,723
Take me Westside.
I need to report in.

523
00:48:10,768 --> 00:48:13,259
I got a bead
on who our Mr. Hero is.

524
00:48:17,074 --> 00:48:18,302
No more arguments.

525
00:48:18,342 --> 00:48:20,367
I have to do this alone,
and the only way I can do it…

526
00:48:20,411 --> 00:48:22,538
is if I'm positive you two are OK.

527
00:48:24,582 --> 00:48:27,312
This is the only place
I know you'll be safe.

528
00:48:27,351 --> 00:48:30,343
— A tank?
— An M24 tank.

529
00:48:30,387 --> 00:48:32,753
You'll be safe from gunfire
and most explosives.

530
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:35,588
— You're whacked.
— I am.

531
00:48:35,626 --> 00:48:37,253
I'm also serious.

532
00:48:37,294 --> 00:48:39,387
But nobody's allowed to get in it.

533
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:42,695
Don't worry. When I create
a diversion, you climb inside.

534
00:48:44,001 --> 00:48:45,229
You should have
enough of that baby food…

535
00:48:45,269 --> 00:48:47,134
to last you a couple of days.

536
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:49,662
The pureed carrots are the best.

537
00:48:50,808 --> 00:48:52,605
Well, you know
how to use this, right?

538
00:48:54,411 --> 00:48:56,572
Yes, but what if
you don't come back?

539
00:48:57,281 --> 00:48:58,976
That's not gonna happen.

540
00:48:59,016 --> 00:49:00,779
There is no way to be sure.

541
00:49:02,586 --> 00:49:04,110
Yes, there is.

542
00:49:19,036 --> 00:49:22,403
Tu sei una stella, la mia stella.

543
00:49:24,008 --> 00:49:27,068
— But, Mom, I wanna go home!
— Stop whining!

544
00:49:27,111 --> 00:49:29,602
If you don't behave,
I am going to spank you.

545
00:49:29,647 --> 00:49:32,207
— But, Mom, I wanna go home!
— Stop whining.

546
00:49:32,249 --> 00:49:33,511
Stop it!

547
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:34,676
I hate it when parents…

548
00:49:34,718 --> 00:49:36,583
— hit their children.
— Let go of my arm!

549
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,281
Not until you stop hittin' your kid.

550
00:49:38,322 --> 00:49:40,347
I will discipline
my child as I see fit.

551
00:49:40,391 --> 00:49:42,552
How would you like it
if I spanked you?

552
00:49:42,593 --> 00:49:43,582
What…?

553
00:49:44,461 --> 00:49:46,088
— See?
— Help!

554
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:48,428
Doesn't feel so good, does it?

555
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,594
Help!

556
00:49:50,634 --> 00:49:51,828
Help!

557
00:49:52,836 --> 00:49:55,202
What the hell do you think you're doin'?

558
00:49:58,142 --> 00:49:59,473
It's not funny.

559
00:50:14,792 --> 00:50:18,660
So, what you got on this
all-star ground pounder?

560
00:50:18,696 --> 00:50:21,392
Well, anybody this good
had to start out young.

561
00:50:21,432 --> 00:50:24,799
And it's usually because
their pop was good at it too.

562
00:50:24,835 --> 00:50:27,065
You know, like
MacArthur's dad was a general…

563
00:50:27,104 --> 00:50:29,129
and Mickey Mantle's father
played pro ball.

564
00:50:29,173 --> 00:50:30,663
My son is a video game whiz…

565
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:33,142
and I wasn't too bad at
Pong myself.

566
00:50:34,044 --> 00:50:36,740
Just follow me,
if you will, Mr. Hammerson.

567
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:40,773
In '67, the limeys
got hard-ass on gun control.

568
00:50:40,818 --> 00:50:44,515
So a lot of Brit gunsmiths
moved to the States.

569
00:50:44,555 --> 00:50:46,785
Now, I've got an inside man
at lmmigration…

570
00:50:46,824 --> 00:50:49,793
working on which of
these guys had sons…

571
00:50:49,827 --> 00:50:51,886
and if any of the boys
were crack shots.

572
00:50:51,929 --> 00:50:54,295
I think the pucker factor's
gettin' to you.

573
00:50:54,965 --> 00:50:56,489
You got diddly!

574
00:50:58,502 --> 00:51:02,268
Yes, Duchess, you a good girl. Sit.

575
00:51:02,306 --> 00:51:05,104
Yes. Now's your treat.
Now you get your treat.

576
00:51:05,142 --> 00:51:06,837
My man has been
running the name down…

577
00:51:06,877 --> 00:51:10,813
and he recalled one of these
gunsmith kids, actually.

578
00:51:12,216 --> 00:51:14,650
National sports pistol
champion at age 10…

579
00:51:14,685 --> 00:51:17,586
Olympic hopeful,
recruited by the army.

580
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:20,879
— But after that, the kid is…
— Kisses, kisses, kisses.

581
00:51:20,924 --> 00:51:22,892
… never heard from again.

582
00:51:22,926 --> 00:51:25,793
Well, that sounds like Black Ops
got him, trained him.

583
00:51:25,829 --> 00:51:29,026
— This leads me to a theory.
— A theory?

584
00:51:29,066 --> 00:51:31,000
A theory is bull-noogies.

585
00:51:31,034 --> 00:51:34,731
All you got is a man with no name…

586
00:51:34,772 --> 00:51:37,570
ridin' into town on a pale horse…

587
00:51:37,608 --> 00:51:40,236
dispensin' his own brand o' justice.

588
00:52:11,608 --> 00:52:14,975
Hertz, you know why people
in this country love guns?

589
00:52:15,012 --> 00:52:17,139
And it's got nothin' to do
with all that…

590
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:21,140
phallic mumbo jumbo,
like «cockin' your gun».

591
00:52:21,185 --> 00:52:23,415
No, Hertz, people love guns…

592
00:52:23,454 --> 00:52:27,481
because America
is a land of opportunity…

593
00:52:27,524 --> 00:52:30,152
where a poor man can become rich…

594
00:52:31,595 --> 00:52:34,621
… and a pussy can become
a tough guy…

595
00:52:34,665 --> 00:52:37,429
if he's got a gun in his hand.

596
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:43,929
I'm hopin' you're not just
a pussy with a gun in your hand.

597
00:52:43,974 --> 00:52:47,137
Oh, no, sir, no. No, I'm not.

598
00:52:47,177 --> 00:52:49,907
I'm a tough guy with
a pussy in my hand.

599
00:52:55,018 --> 00:52:57,350
I want you to give this guy…

600
00:52:57,387 --> 00:53:00,356
and the kid a dirt nap.

601
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:02,915
Yes, sir.

602
00:53:05,529 --> 00:53:07,121
Right away, sir.

603
00:53:09,533 --> 00:53:10,830
Amore mio.

604
00:53:12,503 --> 00:53:13,834
Don't worry.

605
00:53:13,871 --> 00:53:15,736
Daddy will be back soon.

606
00:53:34,191 --> 00:53:35,681
Hold it! Hold it!

607
00:53:39,496 --> 00:53:40,861
Well, well, well, Mr. Bunny.

608
00:53:40,898 --> 00:53:43,696
You just keep goin',
goin', goin', don't ya?

609
00:53:43,734 --> 00:53:46,794
— So do you.
— I promise to, uh…

610
00:53:46,837 --> 00:53:48,304
to spare your life
if you tell me where…

611
00:53:48,338 --> 00:53:49,771
the woman and child are.

612
00:53:49,806 --> 00:53:51,569
Forget it.

613
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:04,817
Oh, boy.

614
00:54:04,855 --> 00:54:07,255
'Ey, who trained you?

615
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:11,318
N.S.A. Black Ops? ClA?
The army?

616
00:54:11,361 --> 00:54:14,728
Well, whoever. lt seems
you haven't lost your aim, champ.

617
00:54:15,065 --> 00:54:18,091
You think that's good, you should
see me spell my name in the snow.

618
00:54:21,605 --> 00:54:23,266
'Ey, you know, my boss here…

619
00:54:23,307 --> 00:54:26,834
thinks that you're the Lone Ranger
or something.

620
00:54:26,877 --> 00:54:30,369
Well, I believe I have a better idea
about who you are.

621
00:54:31,648 --> 00:54:35,015
I found out how your
wife and son were killed.

622
00:54:35,052 --> 00:54:37,350
My God, what a tragedy.

623
00:54:37,387 --> 00:54:39,787
Some guy walks into a burger joint…

624
00:54:39,823 --> 00:54:42,189
he starts shooting up the place.

625
00:54:42,225 --> 00:54:44,090
Oh, my God, what a shame…

626
00:54:44,127 --> 00:54:45,992
that your wife and son were there…

627
00:54:46,029 --> 00:54:49,521
having their… chicken nuggets.

628
00:54:55,706 --> 00:54:57,936
What's the matter,
ya don't like that story?

629
00:55:01,078 --> 00:55:03,205
Well, then why don't
ya tell me one, hm?

630
00:55:03,246 --> 00:55:05,612
Children's story, please.

631
00:55:05,649 --> 00:55:08,550
Oh, I know. Tell me my favorite, yeah.

632
00:55:08,585 --> 00:55:10,485
Tell me the one about the baby.

633
00:55:11,755 --> 00:55:13,620
Maybe later…

634
00:55:13,657 --> 00:55:15,124
when I put you to sleep.

635
00:55:19,529 --> 00:55:20,655
Go, go!

636
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:32,825
So, what do you think
of this second amendment now?

637
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:34,362
Fuck you!

638
00:56:35,806 --> 00:56:38,400
OK, buddy, drop your weapon.

639
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,882
Think we got him?

640
00:57:15,045 --> 00:57:18,446
God damn it, Smith!

641
00:57:18,582 --> 00:57:20,573
So I found out
who's tryin' to kill our baby.

642
00:57:20,617 --> 00:57:22,710
— Who?
— A man named Hammerson.

643
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:26,015
Born with a silver spoon up his ass.

644
00:57:26,056 --> 00:57:28,024
Inherited the Hammer
Firearms Corporation…

645
00:57:28,058 --> 00:57:30,925
from his old man and
makes millions manufacturing weapons.

646
00:57:30,961 --> 00:57:33,054
Does this give you any new ideas…

647
00:57:33,096 --> 00:57:35,360
about who needs
Oliver's bone marrow?

648
00:57:35,398 --> 00:57:36,729
No.

649
00:57:37,501 --> 00:57:39,526
It's OK, little Oliver.

650
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,902
Shit. lt's him.

651
00:57:45,942 --> 00:57:48,740
Senator Rutledge.

652
00:57:48,779 --> 00:57:51,873
If he's elected president,
he'll put Hammerson out of business.

653
00:57:51,915 --> 00:57:53,974
It makes sense,
but how can you be sure?

654
00:57:54,017 --> 00:57:56,815
Mr. Go-To Guy called his men
a fine lot of babysitters.

655
00:57:56,853 --> 00:58:01,153
The secret service calls their agents
who guard VlPs babysitters.

656
00:58:01,191 --> 00:58:02,749
It's him, Senator Rutledge.

657
00:58:02,793 --> 00:58:04,351
He's the guy that needs this baby.

658
00:58:04,394 --> 00:58:07,329
So we contact this man
and then we're safe.

659
00:58:07,364 --> 00:58:09,127
— lt's over.
— Are you crazy?

660
00:58:09,166 --> 00:58:10,463
This means that
we've got Hammerson…

661
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,764
and the whole of the U.S.
government after us.

662
00:58:12,803 --> 00:58:14,430
I think you two have
gotta get out of town.

663
00:58:15,138 --> 00:58:16,935
Until I get the answers,
you'll never be safe.

664
00:58:16,973 --> 00:58:20,568
They'll be watchin' the trains,
the bus stations and the airports…

665
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:23,078
So I think this is the safest
way to get out of town.

666
00:58:24,581 --> 00:58:26,606
I'm gonna check all of this out,
and if everything's OK…

667
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,481
I'll get you
before you board the bus.

668
00:58:28,518 --> 00:58:31,919
But… What if you don't get
to us before we leave?

669
00:58:31,955 --> 00:58:33,752
Where should I get off?

670
00:58:34,858 --> 00:58:36,189
I think it's better if I don't know.

671
00:58:36,226 --> 00:58:37,659
— What?
— Trust me.

672
00:58:38,929 --> 00:58:40,658
I can't know.

673
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:50,100
Smith, do you really think
this is gonna work?

674
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:53,337
Just stick to the plan
and everything will be all right.

675
00:58:54,678 --> 00:58:56,339
Run!

676
01:01:21,858 --> 01:01:24,190
So much for wearin' your seat belt.

677
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:52,285
What in the hell is that?

678
01:01:53,857 --> 01:01:56,883
Oh, my God, that is twisted.

679
01:01:56,926 --> 01:01:58,894
That sick son of a bitch.

680
01:01:59,763 --> 01:02:02,789
Oh, that sick son of a bitch
suckered us again!

681
01:02:08,004 --> 01:02:10,302
It's time to go, little boy.

682
01:02:14,244 --> 01:02:17,077
Put me through to whoever's
protecting Senator Rutledge.

683
01:02:19,382 --> 01:02:21,873
Just tell him there's a man
with a baby calling.

684
01:02:24,421 --> 01:02:26,582
Hello, is this Smith?

685
01:02:26,623 --> 01:02:29,217
That was a nice job coverin' up
your baby hatchery downtown.

686
01:02:29,259 --> 01:02:31,819
Not a word about it anywhere.

687
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:34,227
Only you guys in Washington
have that kind of pull.

688
01:02:34,264 --> 01:02:37,062
I'm telling you,
we're on the same side.

689
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:40,501
Now, listen, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way.

690
01:02:40,537 --> 01:02:42,027
I wanna see the senator.

691
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:46,871
All right. He wants to see you too.

692
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:50,038
He's leaving for North Carolina.
The primary's in three days.

693
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,982
You can fly with him.
Runway 7, two hours.

694
01:02:54,017 --> 01:02:58,386
I see anythin' I don't like,
I'm blowin' this big time.

695
01:03:11,935 --> 01:03:13,061
What were you doing in there?

696
01:03:15,505 --> 01:03:18,804
— Cleaning my gun.
— Really?

697
01:03:20,176 --> 01:03:22,235
You know, we were
never really trying to kill you.

698
01:03:22,278 --> 01:03:24,439
We only wanted to scare you
into surrendering.

699
01:03:24,481 --> 01:03:27,644
Well, that's one way to explain
why you can't shoot straight.

700
01:03:27,684 --> 01:03:29,276
In the latest poll,
Senator Rutledge…

701
01:03:29,319 --> 01:03:31,219
continues to be the
Democratic frontrunner…

702
01:03:31,254 --> 01:03:33,449
heading into next week's
Super Tuesday primary.

703
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:35,924
He leads his rival by at least 10 points…

704
01:03:39,229 --> 01:03:40,321
I owe you my life.

705
01:03:40,363 --> 01:03:42,558
So this is where you get to do
all those hookers.

706
01:03:45,068 --> 01:03:47,935
— I heard about you.
— You look worse than you do on TV.

707
01:03:47,971 --> 01:03:52,067
Yes, it's amazing
what a little makeup can do.

708
01:03:52,108 --> 01:03:53,803
And a lot of morphine.

709
01:03:57,147 --> 01:04:00,674
So, you've pieced
the whole thing together.

710
01:04:01,751 --> 01:04:04,652
Very clever, Mr. Smith.
Very clever.

711
01:04:04,687 --> 01:04:06,416
Simple.

712
01:04:06,456 --> 01:04:08,447
You're the Democratic
frontrunner for president…

713
01:04:08,491 --> 01:04:10,755
and your sweeping
gun control proposals…

714
01:04:10,793 --> 01:04:13,626
are pissing the wrong people off.

715
01:04:13,663 --> 01:04:17,656
Yes, well, if they're pissed now,
wait until I'm elected president.

716
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,133
We got so many goddamn…

717
01:04:19,169 --> 01:04:20,329
gun lobbies out there…

718
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:23,168
that we're gonna have to set up
just as many commissions.

719
01:04:23,206 --> 01:04:25,572
Then maybe we'll get our bill
passed in the first year.

720
01:04:25,608 --> 01:04:28,168
Unfortunately, you're sick
and the gun Nazis found out.

721
01:04:28,211 --> 01:04:32,011
They discovered your baby hatchery
and, boom, problem solved.

722
01:04:32,048 --> 01:04:35,415
— They kill you by killin' the babies.
— Correct.

723
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:37,279
So, where's my savior?

724
01:04:38,821 --> 01:04:40,413
Oh, my God! Gun!

725
01:04:40,456 --> 01:04:43,391
Easy, easy.

726
01:04:43,426 --> 01:04:45,189
You know what I hate most?

727
01:04:45,228 --> 01:04:46,627
— Liars.
— What the hell you doin'?

728
01:04:46,663 --> 01:04:48,096
You made a deal with Hammerson.

729
01:04:48,131 --> 01:04:49,291
— No, you're crazy.
— Am l?

730
01:04:49,332 --> 01:04:50,697
— Y…
— When you got into bed with him…

731
01:04:50,733 --> 01:04:52,564
you also let his dog up on the mattress.

732
01:04:52,602 --> 01:04:54,069
Lookin' at those dog hairs
on your trousers…

733
01:04:54,103 --> 01:04:56,071
I'd say old Duchess took a likin' to you.

734
01:04:56,105 --> 01:04:57,402
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

735
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,635
Save the line for when
you're in office, Rutledge.

736
01:04:59,676 --> 01:05:01,007
If he ever makes it there.

737
01:05:01,044 --> 01:05:02,671
Do you know what else I hate?

738
01:05:02,712 --> 01:05:04,202
Hypocrites.

739
01:05:04,247 --> 01:05:05,737
And you're the biggest one of all.

740
01:05:05,782 --> 01:05:07,841
Can you blame him
for sellin' out?

741
01:05:07,884 --> 01:05:10,148
His operation to find the baby…

742
01:05:10,186 --> 01:05:12,484
had been tits up from the get-go.

743
01:05:12,522 --> 01:05:14,786
You see, Rutledge called us
and he offered us…

744
01:05:14,824 --> 01:05:18,351
a proposition that we had
never dreamed was possible.

745
01:05:19,195 --> 01:05:20,423
In exchange for his life…

746
01:05:20,463 --> 01:05:22,397
the senator promised
to protect our right…

747
01:05:22,432 --> 01:05:24,161
To go deer hunting with an Uzi.

748
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,828
Oh, come on, Smith. Come on.

749
01:05:26,869 --> 01:05:28,427
Guns don't kill people.

750
01:05:28,471 --> 01:05:29,938
But they sure help.

751
01:05:31,007 --> 01:05:31,871
Back off!

752
01:05:31,908 --> 01:05:33,273
Back off.

753
01:05:33,309 --> 01:05:35,470
— Back off or I'll kill him!
— Oh, please.

754
01:05:35,511 --> 01:05:37,342
Pl… l had to do it.

755
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,940
I want to live.
I am meant to be president.

756
01:05:39,983 --> 01:05:42,918
Yeah? Well, you got what it takes.
You put yourself before the people.

757
01:05:42,952 --> 01:05:45,250
I can still do good in other areas.

758
01:05:45,288 --> 01:05:46,687
How you gonna square it
with the public?

759
01:05:46,723 --> 01:05:49,453
It is a constitutional right.

760
01:05:49,492 --> 01:05:50,959
Back off! Get back!

761
01:05:50,994 --> 01:05:52,689
I've come around
to their way of thinking.

762
01:05:52,729 --> 01:05:54,959
Come around?
They had you at «hello».

763
01:05:56,232 --> 01:05:58,097
Let me give you a piece of advice…

764
01:05:58,134 --> 01:06:00,864
Never trust the people who stand
to profit, plain and simple.

765
01:06:00,903 --> 01:06:03,565
— They're the bad guys.
— Come on, Smith, don't be a fool.

766
01:06:03,606 --> 01:06:06,166
Go-to guy: the game is over.
You rolled the dice, you lost.

767
01:06:35,171 --> 01:06:37,264
Let him go, Smith!
There's no escape!

768
01:06:37,307 --> 01:06:40,276
Maybe not for me, but there
is for the woman and baby.

769
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:44,406
If I kill Rutledge, no one
will need to find them.

770
01:06:44,447 --> 01:06:46,176
They'll be saved.

771
01:06:46,215 --> 01:06:50,208
Your assassination, Rutledge,
will create a public outrage…

772
01:06:50,253 --> 01:06:53,120
and trigger immense support
for your proposals.

773
01:06:53,156 --> 01:06:56,614
The sympathy vote in the congress
will give your anti-gun bills…

774
01:06:56,659 --> 01:06:59,822
passage by a landslide.

775
01:06:59,862 --> 01:07:02,797
Your legacy… will live on.

776
01:07:02,832 --> 01:07:04,265
Don't do it!

777
01:07:05,301 --> 01:07:06,928
Then do it.

778
01:07:06,969 --> 01:07:09,767
Let me regain some honor
with my…

779
01:07:15,878 --> 01:07:17,846
That son of a bitch.

780
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,279
Son of a bitch!

781
01:07:23,853 --> 01:07:25,650
God damn it!

782
01:09:33,382 --> 01:09:35,475
Don't move, Mr. Hero.

783
01:09:38,321 --> 01:09:39,982
Can't talk right now, honey.

784
01:09:40,022 --> 01:09:41,683
I'm right in the middle of somethin'.

785
01:09:41,724 --> 01:09:43,351
Bye-bye.

786
01:10:07,817 --> 01:10:10,047
Don't you worry, Duchess.

787
01:10:10,086 --> 01:10:12,247
This isn't gonna happen to you.

788
01:10:12,288 --> 01:10:14,449
Not for a few years, anyway.

789
01:10:15,658 --> 01:10:17,853
Well, well,
well, well, well.

790
01:10:19,629 --> 01:10:23,429
Somebody gets to be smart,
and somebody gets to be dumb.

791
01:10:23,466 --> 01:10:27,630
Looks like you and I have
finally traded places, huh, sport?

792
01:10:29,305 --> 01:10:30,829
Yes, indeed.

793
01:10:31,908 --> 01:10:34,638
The circle of life.

794
01:10:34,677 --> 01:10:36,804
The circle-a jerk of life.

795
01:10:36,846 --> 01:10:39,906
Oh, you have
such a way with words.

796
01:10:39,949 --> 01:10:42,008
Now…

797
01:10:46,055 --> 01:10:48,853
I want you to tell me…

798
01:10:48,891 --> 01:10:51,689
where the woman
and the child are.

799
01:10:51,727 --> 01:10:54,321
Tell me, or I will be forced
to cause you…

800
01:10:54,363 --> 01:10:56,160
considerable agony.

801
01:10:56,198 --> 01:10:58,530
Believe me…

802
01:10:58,568 --> 01:11:02,163
nothing could be more painful than
listenin' to you jabberin' on and on.

803
01:11:07,243 --> 01:11:09,438
Again, I ask…

804
01:11:09,478 --> 01:11:11,139
where are the woman and child?

805
01:11:14,083 --> 01:11:16,017
That's the last time
you'll be doin' that.

806
01:11:18,988 --> 01:11:20,819
Just tell me what I wanna hear.

807
01:11:20,856 --> 01:11:23,222
It's your choice
when the pain stops.

808
01:11:23,259 --> 01:11:25,625
Why are you doin' this?

809
01:11:25,661 --> 01:11:28,721
— lt's over.
— lt shortly will be, yeah.

810
01:11:30,633 --> 01:11:33,101
No, I really should thank you.

811
01:11:33,135 --> 01:11:37,265
I just got a bigger contract
because of you.

812
01:11:37,306 --> 01:11:40,605
I mean, I wasn't just on
Hammerson's payroll, you know.

813
01:11:40,643 --> 01:11:43,339
What are you babbling
on about now?

814
01:11:43,379 --> 01:11:46,314
Do you really think
the people that employ me…

815
01:11:46,349 --> 01:11:48,783
were just gonna bend over
and take your little stunt…

816
01:11:48,818 --> 01:11:50,080
killing the senator?

817
01:11:50,119 --> 01:11:52,451
There's no way that you can
cover up this whole thing.

818
01:11:52,488 --> 01:11:55,889
No? Haven't you heard
the news?

819
01:11:55,925 --> 01:11:58,257
The senator's plane
crashed into the East River.

820
01:11:58,294 --> 01:12:01,024
They haven't been able to find
the body of Senator Rutledge.

821
01:12:01,063 --> 01:12:03,156
So, you see, once I silence you
and the woman…

822
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:05,099
the cover-up will be complete.

823
01:12:05,134 --> 01:12:07,432
So, once again, I ask you…

824
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:09,233
where are the woman and child?

825
01:12:09,271 --> 01:12:11,205
You know how I'd break
your finger?

826
01:12:12,608 --> 01:12:13,870
My boy told me this one.

827
01:12:13,909 --> 01:12:15,103
You'd punch me in the nose.

828
01:12:15,144 --> 01:12:16,634
I'd kick you in the ass.

829
01:12:17,813 --> 01:12:19,678
Very amusing.

830
01:12:19,715 --> 01:12:22,809
I give that one the ol' thumbs up!

831
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,987
What if you don't
get to us before we leave?

832
01:12:27,023 --> 01:12:29,548
Oh, I know your whole story.

833
01:12:29,592 --> 01:12:32,618
That man who went
on the shooting spree in the restaurant.

834
01:12:32,662 --> 01:12:35,722
He visited the little gun shop
that you inherited from your dad.

835
01:12:35,765 --> 01:12:36,993
I found out how your wife
and son were killed.

836
01:12:37,033 --> 01:12:39,263
You sold him
the pair of shotguns…

837
01:12:39,301 --> 01:12:40,290
Shotguns.

838
01:12:40,336 --> 01:12:42,201
… that killed your own wife and boy.

839
01:12:43,105 --> 01:12:45,369
I'm not telling you…
a goddamn thing.

840
01:12:48,411 --> 01:12:51,107
Where are you, Smith?

841
01:12:53,649 --> 01:12:55,549
Well, well, well, well, well.

842
01:12:55,584 --> 01:12:59,816
We're gonna need somethin'
a little more invasive.

843
01:13:15,071 --> 01:13:16,538
That's it.

844
01:13:37,827 --> 01:13:40,523
Aren't guns just fucking great,
Hammerson?

845
01:14:19,668 --> 01:14:20,965
'Ey.

846
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:23,437
Who's a hotshot now, huh?

847
01:15:01,177 --> 01:15:02,235
Oh, yes, sirree, Bob.

848
01:15:02,278 --> 01:15:03,973
It certainly has been a pleasure.

849
01:15:04,013 --> 01:15:05,878
But before we part ways…

850
01:15:05,915 --> 01:15:07,746
tell me one thing.

851
01:15:08,784 --> 01:15:10,911
I am dead on…

852
01:15:10,953 --> 01:15:13,080
about who you are, right?

853
01:15:13,122 --> 01:15:14,589
Say that again?

854
01:15:14,623 --> 01:15:16,488
I said, I am dead…

855
01:15:16,525 --> 01:15:17,924
Stop.

856
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,087
That part of it you got right.

857
01:15:52,161 --> 01:15:53,287
It's the wife.

858
01:15:57,666 --> 01:15:59,566
Hi, honey.

859
01:16:03,739 --> 01:16:05,036
She's leaving me.

860
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:08,005
You know what I really hate?

861
01:16:34,303 --> 01:16:35,895
What I really hate…

862
01:16:36,839 --> 01:16:39,330
… is a pussy with a gun in his hand.

863
01:17:20,716 --> 01:17:23,947
Investigators discovered
the body of Senator Rutledge today.

864
01:17:23,986 --> 01:17:27,649
The FBl stated an anonymous
tip led them to the remains.

865
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:56,281
Don't worry, little boy.

866
01:17:56,318 --> 01:17:59,253
Mama will be watching you
while she's working.

867
01:18:16,372 --> 01:18:17,805
Oliver.

868
01:18:18,874 --> 01:18:20,501
Hello.

869
01:18:25,381 --> 01:18:26,939
What took you so long?

870
01:18:47,703 --> 01:18:49,227
All right, this is a robbery!

871
01:18:49,271 --> 01:18:51,330
Empty the drawer, all of it.

872
01:18:51,373 --> 01:18:52,738
Everyone else, freeze!

873
01:18:52,775 --> 01:18:55,175
Do it or I'll fucking blow your head off!

874
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:56,837
He said freeze.

875
01:18:56,879 --> 01:18:58,972
That means don't even
pucker your butthole.

876
01:18:59,014 --> 01:19:01,312
That's right.
No puckering, nobody dies.

877
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:02,476
So don't fuckin' move.

878
01:19:02,518 --> 01:19:04,509
We're kinda
in a rush here, man! Come on!

879
01:19:04,553 --> 01:19:07,647
— You know what I hate?
— Shut up and sit on this, asshole.

880
01:19:07,689 --> 01:19:09,213
That's right! You heard him!
