2
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,677
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

3
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:18,910
Oh, I like this.

4
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,646
Maybe this time
we get lucky

5
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:23,483
- and make a baby?
- Let's just have some fun.

6
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:24,916
Oh, I like fun.

7
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,719
Just shut up and kiss me.

8
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,326
- Ow!
- Sorry.

9
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:34,993
Hold on.

10
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:36,664
It's this damn watch.

11
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,569
Come on. Mm-hm.

12
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,376
What's wrong?

13
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,847
You feel that?

14
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:56,785
No...

15
00:02:00,422 --> 00:02:02,254
Huh. It stopped.

16
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:04,390
That's weird,
I didn't feel anything.

17
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:06,859
Hold on!

18
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:08,528
Babe, are you okay?

19
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,397
Yeah. Okay.

20
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:13,399
Okay, what the hell was that?

21
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:15,435
Oh, my God.

22
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:18,270
Look out there.

23
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:20,007
What is that?

24
00:02:21,443 --> 00:02:23,443
<i>There he is.</i>

25
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:25,645
<i>How's our little guy
this morning?</i>

26
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:28,947
<i>Hello, how are you?</i>

27
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,983
<i>Look at you!
Look, you're all sitting up!</i>

28
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,620
<i>Oh, oh! Kick it!</i>

29
00:02:41,463 --> 00:02:43,863
<i>Look at that big smile!</i>

30
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:45,531
<i>So happy!</i>

31
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,805
<i>You're
crawling, look Kyle!</i>

32
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:55,106
<i>Look at him crawl!</i>

33
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,809
<i>Look at these overalls,</i>

34
00:02:56,811 --> 00:02:58,979
<i>he's like a mini you.</i>

35
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:03,649
<i>Look at you, putting your
little butt in the air.</i>

36
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:06,486
<i>Yeah, you're gonna work
on the farm like Daddy?</i>

37
00:03:06,488 --> 00:03:08,356
<i>Yes, just like a Breyer!</i>

38
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:16,896
<i>Okay, I'm gonna turn this off,</i>

39
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:17,996
<i>- say "bye."
- Bye.</i>

40
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,316
Brandon?

41
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:45,326
It's time to get ready
for school.

42
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,165
Got ya!

43
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,815
Not even close.

44
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:12,150
I'm gonna find you.

45
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:14,556
Better not be in that barn!

46
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:14,347
You totally got me!

47
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:16,884
You are getting
too big for this.

48
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,422
You'll always be
my baby boy.

49
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:25,091
- Okay, let's go.
- Took you long enough

50
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:26,093
to find me.

51
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:31,631
- Uh-oh.
- Morning guys.

52
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:33,599
What're ya doing in there?

53
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:35,233
I was just hiding.

54
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:37,436
You know the rules of
the barn, right?

55
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:39,772
- Yeah, I mean...
- All the boards and nails

56
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:42,308
and shit, don't want
you breaking your neck.

57
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,477
He was only in there
for, like, two minutes.

58
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,779
Uh-huh.
Did you eat breakfast?

59
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:48,648
- Not yet.
- Want some waffles?

60
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,650
- Sounds good.
- You're making waffles?

61
00:05:50,652 --> 00:05:52,551
- Yeah.
- What about some bacon?

62
00:05:54,656 --> 00:05:57,490
And that is what we call

63
00:05:57,492 --> 00:05:59,157
a hive.

64
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:02,260
Wasps and bees,

65
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:04,430
members of the same
insect family,

66
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:06,264
both with two pairs
of wings,

67
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:07,767
both with stingers.

68
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:11,072
Can anyone tell me any
differences between them?

69
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:17,812
Mr. Breyer?

70
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:22,615
Uh, well, um,
bees are pollinators,

71
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:24,215
and wasps
are predators.

72
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,852
Good, good. Anybody else?

73
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:29,655
And wasps are more aggressive,
more dangerous.

74
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:31,857
One species,
the Polistes sulcifer,

75
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,826
is what's called
a brood parasite,

76
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:36,062
they've lost the ability
to make nests,

77
00:06:36,064 --> 00:06:37,563
so they use brute force

78
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:40,132
to make other wasp species
raise their young.

79
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:42,668
And they make them feed
their babies things

80
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,470
like beetle larvae
and maggots.

81
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:47,139
Bro, why are you always
talking about maggots?

82
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:49,642
You must be one.

83
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:51,043
Okay, alright.

84
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:52,445
Don't worry,

85
00:06:52,447 --> 00:06:54,415
smart guys end up
ruling the planet.

86
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:29,670
Brandon?

87
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,111
Brandon?

88
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:51,626
Brandon?

89
00:10:04,373 --> 00:10:05,406
Brandon?

90
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,332
Brandon.

91
00:10:37,538 --> 00:10:38,904
Brandon?

92
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:43,410
Brandon.

93
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,480
Brandon...

94
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:51,285
Brandon?

95
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:55,721
Brandon.

96
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:56,889
Hey.

97
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,960
Hey! Shh, hey.

98
00:11:00,962 --> 00:11:03,430
- Hey, it's me. It's mom.
- Where... Where am I?

99
00:11:03,432 --> 00:11:06,299
It's mom. Mom. Look at me.

100
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:10,869
You're all right. Shh, shh, shh.
You're all right.

101
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,074
You were sleepwalking.
I think.

102
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:19,912
Yeah... it was...
these voices or something.

103
00:11:19,914 --> 00:11:23,115
I know,
it'll be okay now.

104
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:24,950
You're okay now.

105
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:27,588
Where's it coming from?

106
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:13,667
Everything all right?

107
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:17,036
Yeah, he was, uh...

108
00:12:17,038 --> 00:12:19,305
sleepwalking,
I guess?

109
00:12:19,307 --> 00:12:20,808
Where?

110
00:12:22,444 --> 00:12:24,643
Nowhere. He was
just downstairs.

111
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:25,746
He's fine.

112
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:28,881
We should
go to bed, yeah?

113
00:12:28,883 --> 00:12:30,616
It's getting so late.

114
00:12:32,053 --> 00:12:34,354
Hold underneath.
Keep it stiff.

115
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,326
All right, I think
that's gonna hold it.

116
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:42,963
- Want one of these?
- Sure.

117
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:48,334
First couple of years
after we adopted you,

118
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:51,036
I had no clue
how to be a dad.

119
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:52,838
Your mom, she was
out one day,

120
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,840
and you were
bawling your eyes out.

121
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:56,575
But I had
a secret weapon.

122
00:12:56,577 --> 00:12:59,379
So you gave me
a piece of candy?

123
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:01,282
Yep.

124
00:13:03,684 --> 00:13:05,617
- Did it work?
- I guess.

125
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,454
You didn't turn
out that bad, did you?

126
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:08,756
Huh?

127
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:12,858
All right. Think you'll
be able to get the lawn?

128
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,828
- I gotta get to the seed store.
- No worries. I'll handle it.

129
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:19,934
Dang it.

130
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:23,735
Come on.

131
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:29,842
Stupid thing!

132
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:34,239
You're not beating me.
I love it!

133
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,241
You can't go
that close.

134
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:39,445
What about this brown one?
I feel he's easy to pick up.

135
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:42,615
You were right in front of it.

136
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:44,417
- This has to be it.
- Oh! Come on!

137
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:01,033
There you go.

138
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:02,468
This is for little kids.

139
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,204
Come on, make a wish,
thank you, Erika.

140
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:07,373
Didn't know
they were gonna bring it,

141
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,075
If you don't want any,
just slide it over here.

142
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:17,350
So Brandon, I hear
you're killing it in school.

143
00:15:17,352 --> 00:15:20,553
- Tested in the top one percent.
- No, he tested in the top

144
00:15:20,555 --> 00:15:22,120
one tenth of one percent.

145
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:24,624
The whole faculty
is talking about him.

146
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:26,693
He's our little super genius.

147
00:15:26,695 --> 00:15:28,494
So a special guy

148
00:15:28,496 --> 00:15:30,829
deserves a very special present.

149
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:35,834
This is from me
and your Aunt Merilee.

150
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:37,903
Go ahead, open it.

151
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:40,908
I shot my first buck
with that very same model.

152
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,545
Whoa, no, no, no.
No guns.

153
00:15:45,547 --> 00:15:47,647
- We talked about this, Tori.
- I know...

154
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:49,515
Come on, he's still
just a kid.

155
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:50,849
I'm 12 years old.

156
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:52,953
I know, exactly,
you're still a child.

157
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,555
Give it to me.

158
00:15:55,557 --> 00:15:57,889
I'm sorry, what did
you just say to me?

159
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:00,328
I said, "give it to me."

160
00:16:01,563 --> 00:16:02,562
Brandon.

161
00:16:02,564 --> 00:16:04,196
Okay, we're done here.

162
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:07,400
We're not having ice cream.
Thank you. Let's go.

163
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:09,302
Brandon, let's go.
Brandon!

164
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:11,036
Up now.

165
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:12,771
Brandon...

166
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:14,108
Listen to your father.

167
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,909
We are leaving,
let's go.

168
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:21,179
So fun, thank you so much.

169
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,115
Okay... sorry.

170
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:25,017
- Don't worry about.
- So sorry.

171
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:27,252
Nope. Yep, bye.

172
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:28,723
I love you guys!

173
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,425
Babe, I told you.

174
00:16:32,427 --> 00:16:34,092
You sure you want kids?

175
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:35,927
I just don't get
that kid.

176
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:38,698
Turns 12, all of sudden
he gets a mouth on him.

177
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,467
So strange,
it was so unlike him.

178
00:16:41,469 --> 00:16:44,771
I worry about him.

179
00:16:44,773 --> 00:16:47,105
Getting older,
changing.

180
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:50,410
We were so much worse
when we were his age.

181
00:16:50,412 --> 00:16:54,112
You remember all the running
around we did, sneaking out.

182
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56,948
Fooling around in
my parents' basement.

183
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,485
My parents knew
exactly what we were doing.

184
00:16:59,487 --> 00:17:02,655
They didn't give a shit,
they'd already written me off.

185
00:17:02,657 --> 00:17:03,855
Oh, babe.

186
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:08,361
We can never
do that to Brandon.

187
00:17:08,363 --> 00:17:11,631
He needs to know
we give a shit.

188
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:13,501
He will.

189
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:18,338
Why don't we go
camping this weekend?

190
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,006
Just the three of us,
go up to Drywood.

191
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:23,175
- We haven't done that in so long.
- Mm-hm.

192
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:26,479
You know what else we
haven't done in a while?

193
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:29,315
- I know what you're thinking,
- A little bit more...

194
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:32,685
gone to church. We have
not gone to church in a while.

195
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:36,154
That's not all
I was thinking about.

196
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:38,190
We need to clean out
the closet,

197
00:17:38,192 --> 00:17:40,660
- that's what you were thinking.
- Nope, no.

198
00:17:40,662 --> 00:17:43,028
Okay,
but you gotta be quiet.

199
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,664
I will be,
I'm always quiet.

200
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,599
- He's not asleep yet.
- Shh.

201
00:17:49,337 --> 00:17:51,371
Here.

202
00:17:51,373 --> 00:17:53,506
What's that,
three or four?

203
00:17:53,508 --> 00:17:55,240
We got three,
we're good.

204
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,876
I'm good.
Go get the flashlight.

205
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:02,013
This needs batteries.

206
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,750
Brandon, it's gonna be cold.

207
00:18:03,752 --> 00:18:06,086
You're gonna need
your warm jacket, okay?

208
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,161
Hey, did you hear
your mother, bud?

209
00:18:19,401 --> 00:18:20,602
Hey.

210
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:28,708
Brandon.

211
00:18:52,534 --> 00:18:54,500
Hey, hon, um...

212
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:56,268
Look what I found.

213
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,806
What is that?

214
00:18:59,808 --> 00:19:01,607
Is that the kid's
idea of porn?

215
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:03,275
- I think so.
- Wow.

216
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:04,877
Bra ads.

217
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:07,747
Guess we knew
this day was coming.

218
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:10,081
The hell is that?

219
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,250
Is this like a guy thing?

220
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,387
No, that's not
a guy thing I know.

221
00:19:14,389 --> 00:19:16,656
Ew.

222
00:19:16,658 --> 00:19:19,761
Maybe we should
have the talk with him.

223
00:19:30,371 --> 00:19:32,405
Hey, Brandon.

224
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:35,441
You know, you just
had your birthday.

225
00:19:35,443 --> 00:19:39,879
Which means that you
are becoming a young man.

226
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:41,647
Your body's changing.

227
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:43,416
Okay.

228
00:19:43,418 --> 00:19:47,052
Well, you're going to
start developing, you know...

229
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:48,788
feelings about women,

230
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,790
women's bodies,

231
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:53,626
I was just like you
when I was your age.

232
00:19:53,628 --> 00:19:57,864
And I also thought about
girls all the time, heh.

233
00:19:57,866 --> 00:20:01,199
You know, nobody was
around to tell me that...

234
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,936
it was okay to, uh...

235
00:20:03,938 --> 00:20:06,708
touch it
or play with it.

236
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:09,677
With what?

237
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:13,815
Uh, you know,
with, uh...

238
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:16,518
Your penis.

239
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:21,888
- Okay.
- Look, the thing about...

240
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,357
you know, sex,
it's not...

241
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:27,560
it's not about organs
or body parts,

242
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:31,531
I mean, it is that too, but...

243
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:34,165
You know, it's about finding
the right person

244
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:35,670
and falling in love.

245
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:39,438
Look, all I'm saying is

246
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,707
you're a guy, you know,

247
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:43,943
and you're gonna have
certain urges,

248
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:46,646
you know, about girls
you see in films,

249
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:49,382
or girls in class
or whatever.

250
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:51,617
I'm just saying that it's okay

251
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:54,387
to give in to them
now and again.

252
00:20:54,389 --> 00:20:56,187
Like, now?

253
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:58,593
What?

254
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,462
Like now?

255
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,764
No, no, no.
Not...

256
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:06,868
not right now, no.

257
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,269
Good talk.

258
00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:33,628
Brandon?

259
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:04,251
Mom?

260
00:23:13,528 --> 00:23:15,293
What's wrong?

261
00:23:15,295 --> 00:23:16,395
What's wrong?

262
00:23:16,397 --> 00:23:18,166
Someone's there,
by the curtain.

263
00:23:41,155 --> 00:23:42,822
Honey, there's no one here.

264
00:23:42,824 --> 00:23:45,891
You have to believe me,
he was right there.

265
00:23:45,893 --> 00:23:48,194
Who was?

266
00:23:48,196 --> 00:23:50,696
Brandon Breyer.

267
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,568
Brandon?

268
00:23:58,539 --> 00:23:59,774
Brandon?

269
00:24:01,476 --> 00:24:03,576
Brandon,
where are you, baby?

270
00:24:03,578 --> 00:24:05,377
Can you hear me?

271
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:07,079
Brandon!

272
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:08,716
Brandon.

273
00:24:11,953 --> 00:24:13,119
Oh, my God.

274
00:24:13,121 --> 00:24:14,854
Oh, my God, Brandon.

275
00:24:14,856 --> 00:24:16,889
Your father and I
were freaked out.

276
00:24:16,891 --> 00:24:20,126
I didn't mean to,
I was just taking a pee.

277
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:31,470
So you don't think I need
to take him to someone,

278
00:24:31,472 --> 00:24:34,740
- like a specialist...
- For what?

279
00:24:34,742 --> 00:24:37,275
For talking back to his dad
and keeping

280
00:24:37,277 --> 00:24:39,912
weird jerk-off material
under his mattress?

281
00:24:39,914 --> 00:24:42,214
It's more than that, Mer.
I don't know,

282
00:24:42,216 --> 00:24:44,750
he's always been
my little sweet guy,

283
00:24:44,752 --> 00:24:46,385
and now...

284
00:24:46,387 --> 00:24:48,923
- he's so different.
- It's called puberty.

285
00:24:50,224 --> 00:24:51,891
I'm overreacting.

286
00:24:51,893 --> 00:24:54,193
- A little bit.
- Obviously, I am.

287
00:24:54,195 --> 00:24:55,895
- I love you.
- Thank you.

288
00:24:55,897 --> 00:24:58,332
- I'll call you.
- Okay, call me later.

289
00:25:05,807 --> 00:25:07,108
What's that?

290
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:12,411
What? I wasn't snooping
or anything.

291
00:25:12,413 --> 00:25:14,680
It was nice line work.

292
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:15,950
It was good shading.

293
00:25:46,747 --> 00:25:48,414
Fucking wolf.

294
00:26:00,294 --> 00:26:01,527
Brandon.

295
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:03,128
Hey, what are
you doing, buddy?

296
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,709
Buddy, it's 10:30
at night.

297
00:26:18,713 --> 00:26:20,349
Are you all right,
buddy?

298
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:28,389
Think so.

299
00:26:31,993 --> 00:26:33,761
Come on, man,
let's get inside.

300
00:27:03,658 --> 00:27:04,924
Oh, my God.

301
00:27:04,926 --> 00:27:07,259
Tori. Tori!

302
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:09,528
- Tori, hey, wake up.
- What is it?

303
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,563
I need you
to come outside.

304
00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:13,968
- You see? Right?
- Oh, shit.

305
00:27:16,371 --> 00:27:20,773
- So the wolf is back.
- No, no, baby, I...

306
00:27:20,775 --> 00:27:22,708
This isn't a wolf,
I mean...

307
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,443
This isn't
an animal. I think,

308
00:27:24,445 --> 00:27:27,079
I think this might
be Brandon.

309
00:27:27,081 --> 00:27:29,214
He was out here
earlier tonight,

310
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:31,283
just staring at them.
The chickens...

311
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:33,154
They were all
fucking going crazy.

312
00:27:35,556 --> 00:27:37,456
Babe, a wolf can't do this!

313
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:40,125
It can't rip a door off
and break a lock.

314
00:27:40,127 --> 00:27:42,828
But our 12-year-old son can?

315
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,632
So you can't explain
it, either?

316
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:48,767
Kyle, stop.
It was the wolf.

317
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:51,270
I'm going to bed.

318
00:27:53,074 --> 00:27:55,442
This game is called
willows in the wind.

319
00:27:55,444 --> 00:27:57,142
It's about working
together,

320
00:27:57,144 --> 00:27:59,278
and building trust.
Lean back,

321
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,814
and depend on your classmates.

322
00:28:01,816 --> 00:28:04,986
Whoa, come on now, focus!

323
00:28:06,954 --> 00:28:09,389
All right, very good guys.

324
00:28:09,391 --> 00:28:10,789
When we trust
each other,

325
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:12,491
good things happen.

326
00:28:12,493 --> 00:28:14,461
All right, you're up next,
big guy.

327
00:28:14,463 --> 00:28:16,095
- Let's hear it for Brandon.
- Loser.

328
00:28:16,097 --> 00:28:17,663
Nothing to be afraid of,

329
00:28:17,665 --> 00:28:19,567
your classmates
have your back.

330
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:28,207
Good job.

331
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:29,675
Ew!

332
00:28:29,677 --> 00:28:31,677
Oh, shit.

333
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,380
Way to trust the floor.

334
00:28:33,382 --> 00:28:34,780
Hey, hey.
Knock it off.

335
00:28:34,782 --> 00:28:36,181
You okay, bud?

336
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:38,185
Damn, Caitlyn,
give him a hand up.

337
00:28:39,954 --> 00:28:42,455
Hey, hold on,
we all on the same team here.

338
00:28:42,457 --> 00:28:44,623
He's a pervert.

339
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:45,791
You lie.

340
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:47,460
- Idiot.
- Caitlyn, help him up.

341
00:28:47,462 --> 00:28:49,130
or you fail this class.

342
00:28:59,374 --> 00:29:00,939
What are you doing?

343
00:29:00,941 --> 00:29:02,308
Brandon!

344
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,976
Let go. Stop it!

345
00:29:03,978 --> 00:29:05,210
Brandon stop!

346
00:29:07,948 --> 00:29:10,182
Erika, he said he's sorry.

347
00:29:10,184 --> 00:29:12,385
It was an accident,
they're just kids.

348
00:29:12,387 --> 00:29:14,820
Did you see
my daughter's hand?

349
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:16,955
He's a goddamn animal,
is what he is.

350
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:18,991
Can we just calm down
here, please?

351
00:29:18,993 --> 00:29:20,427
I want him in handcuffs,

352
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:22,561
- I want him gone.
- We're taking action.

353
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:25,197
- He's going to be suspended for...
- Suspended?

354
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:28,535
- Do you job, arrest him.
- Sorry ma'am, not your call.

355
00:29:28,537 --> 00:29:31,103
After the suspension,
he'll be in sessions

356
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:33,339
with our school counselor
Ms. Merilee.

357
00:29:33,341 --> 00:29:35,542
His aunt. Jesus fucking Christ.

358
00:29:35,544 --> 00:29:38,744
- Right now, she's the only...
- Know what? Her son

359
00:29:38,746 --> 00:29:42,247
was inside my daughter's
bedroom last Saturday night.

360
00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:45,385
He was camping
with us 30 miles away.

361
00:29:49,824 --> 00:29:52,157
Do you even know
who his real mother is?

362
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,693
- I'm his real mother.
- I meant whatever inbred

363
00:29:54,695 --> 00:29:56,929
- psycho gave birth to him.
- Hey.

364
00:29:56,931 --> 00:29:58,664
I know exactly
what you meant.

365
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:01,033
But if trash talking
a 12-year-old child,

366
00:30:01,035 --> 00:30:03,268
lets you sleep better
at night, Erika,

367
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,272
maybe you're the one
who needs help.

368
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:10,676
Sorry about your daughter.

369
00:30:12,746 --> 00:30:14,483
Get up,
let's go.

370
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,398
Shit like that,
breaking a girl's hand?

371
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,066
Goddamn it.

372
00:30:34,068 --> 00:30:36,735
Dad would've
whooped my ass.

373
00:30:36,737 --> 00:30:40,672
Yeah, well, this isn't something
we can ass-whoop away.

374
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:42,074
I just...

375
00:30:43,244 --> 00:30:45,177
I need to tell
you something.

376
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:47,012
The other night when
I found him

377
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:49,582
sleepwalking,
he wasn't downstairs,

378
00:30:49,584 --> 00:30:51,453
He was in the barn.

379
00:30:54,422 --> 00:30:56,054
Did he find it?

380
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:58,625
No... No.

381
00:30:58,627 --> 00:31:01,160
But he was tugging
at the trap door.

382
00:31:01,162 --> 00:31:03,429
How'd he even know
it's in there?

383
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:05,264
I don't think he does.

384
00:31:05,266 --> 00:31:07,567
- It was like he was drawn to it.
- Babe.

385
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:10,269
He may look like us,
and sound like us,

386
00:31:10,271 --> 00:31:11,904
but he's never bled,

387
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:13,573
not once in his
whole life,

388
00:31:13,575 --> 00:31:15,174
he's never been cut,

389
00:31:15,176 --> 00:31:17,176
or broken a bone,
or had a bruise.

390
00:31:17,178 --> 00:31:18,846
And now he's
hurting people.

391
00:31:42,337 --> 00:31:46,173
Take. Take.

392
00:31:48,677 --> 00:31:51,511
<i>"Yychhagaro"</i> means "take".

393
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,614
Brandon!

394
00:33:03,183 --> 00:33:04,552
Oh, God.

395
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,297
Take <i>larum...</i>

396
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,533
Take <i>larum...</i>

397
00:33:20,535 --> 00:33:22,769
Take the...

398
00:33:22,771 --> 00:33:24,637
Oh, God, oh, God.

399
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:26,271
Brandon!

400
00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:28,240
Take the...

401
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:29,509
Take the...

402
00:33:29,511 --> 00:33:32,478
Take the...

403
00:33:33,914 --> 00:33:36,649
Brandon!

404
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:38,787
Oh, God.

405
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,024
Oh, Brandon.

406
00:33:47,928 --> 00:33:50,064
Baby, it's okay.

407
00:33:56,604 --> 00:33:57,739
Baby...

408
00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:03,110
It cut me.

409
00:34:04,312 --> 00:34:05,745
Oh.

410
00:34:05,747 --> 00:34:09,016
Oh, uh, okay.

411
00:34:13,187 --> 00:34:14,454
You'll be okay.

412
00:34:14,456 --> 00:34:16,422
It'll be okay,
it'll be okay.

413
00:34:16,424 --> 00:34:18,090
It'll be okay.

414
00:34:18,092 --> 00:34:19,327
You're okay.

415
00:34:20,829 --> 00:34:22,129
Who am I?

416
00:34:32,307 --> 00:34:33,907
You're our son.

417
00:34:35,543 --> 00:34:38,210
What is this?

418
00:34:38,212 --> 00:34:39,681
Where did I come from?

419
00:34:41,483 --> 00:34:43,181
Listen, baby, I...

420
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:45,585
I know it's been
difficult for you lately,

421
00:34:45,587 --> 00:34:48,423
that you feel different
from other kids.

422
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:52,023
You are different.

423
00:34:52,025 --> 00:34:55,026
After you dad and I
got married, we prayed

424
00:34:55,028 --> 00:34:58,163
and prayed for
a baby for so long,

425
00:34:58,165 --> 00:35:02,702
to God, to the universe,
to anyone that would listen.

426
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:07,005
One night,
one perfect night,

427
00:35:07,007 --> 00:35:09,544
someone listened.

428
00:35:12,246 --> 00:35:15,147
We did not adopt you.

429
00:35:15,149 --> 00:35:17,750
from an agency.

430
00:35:17,752 --> 00:35:19,719
You came here...

431
00:35:19,721 --> 00:35:22,722
arrived here,

432
00:35:22,724 --> 00:35:23,724
in that.

433
00:35:26,927 --> 00:35:29,261
We found you in the woods.

434
00:35:29,263 --> 00:35:32,964
You were just a little guy,
all alone.

435
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:35,233
You could barely breathe,
and so we...

436
00:35:35,235 --> 00:35:37,235
We took you in.

437
00:35:37,237 --> 00:35:40,540
And you have been
a gift,

438
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:42,608
my baby boy.

439
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:46,446
I... I can't even imagine
how overwhelmed

440
00:35:46,448 --> 00:35:48,213
you must feel
right now.

441
00:35:48,215 --> 00:35:51,950
But you have to know,
your dad and I believe

442
00:35:51,952 --> 00:35:54,420
that you came here
for a reason.

443
00:35:54,422 --> 00:35:56,121
That you are special.

444
00:35:56,123 --> 00:35:58,458
And that you're
going to do incredible...

445
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,958
You lied to me!

446
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,993
We just wanted to take
care of you.

447
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:05,364
- And we always planned to tell...
- You lied to me! You lied!

448
00:36:05,366 --> 00:36:07,700
Wait.

449
00:36:07,702 --> 00:36:09,635
I hate you,

450
00:36:09,637 --> 00:36:12,103
you lied to me. You're liars!
You lied.

451
00:36:12,105 --> 00:36:14,373
I hate you! I hate this place.

452
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:16,576
What is going on
in here?

453
00:36:16,578 --> 00:36:18,911
He... He found it.

454
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:22,949
He found it.

455
00:36:27,087 --> 00:36:29,254
Take the <i>ghhol.</i>

456
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:31,657
Take the <i>ghhol.</i>

457
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:33,258
<i>Ghhol.</i>

458
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,495
<i>Ghhol. Ghhol.</i>

459
00:36:35,497 --> 00:36:38,065
Take the world.

460
00:36:40,768 --> 00:36:41,903
Take the world.

461
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,190
Don't scream.

462
00:37:05,192 --> 00:37:07,192
What are you doing here?

463
00:37:07,194 --> 00:37:09,631
I brought you flowers.

464
00:37:11,031 --> 00:37:12,765
You can't be here.

465
00:37:14,134 --> 00:37:16,201
Don't be scared.

466
00:37:16,203 --> 00:37:17,839
I wanna talk to you.

467
00:37:20,008 --> 00:37:22,377
I want to tell you
what I learned tonight.

468
00:37:24,044 --> 00:37:25,778
I learned that

469
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,980
I'm very

470
00:37:27,982 --> 00:37:29,651
special.

471
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:34,286
You're one of the only
people in the world

472
00:37:34,288 --> 00:37:37,055
that knows how
special I am.

473
00:37:37,057 --> 00:37:39,425
But someday...

474
00:37:39,427 --> 00:37:41,429
they will all know.

475
00:37:44,399 --> 00:37:48,668
My mom told
me not to talk to you.

476
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:51,404
I'm gonna take care of that.

477
00:38:06,588 --> 00:38:08,688
Have good one, Gary.

478
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:06,479
Hey, who's messing
with me?

479
00:39:10,084 --> 00:39:11,586
Is that you, Gary?

480
00:40:29,197 --> 00:40:30,730
Get out of here!

481
00:40:36,871 --> 00:40:39,239
Leave me alone!

482
00:41:33,761 --> 00:41:35,060
Is he awake?

483
00:41:35,062 --> 00:41:36,929
I called up two times
already,

484
00:41:36,931 --> 00:41:38,531
I heard him
walking around.

485
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:40,900
Should somebody go
get him, I mean...

486
00:41:40,902 --> 00:41:42,902
Morning.

487
00:41:42,904 --> 00:41:44,703
Hey, bud.

488
00:41:44,705 --> 00:41:47,473
Uh, you know you're
going to be late for school.

489
00:41:47,475 --> 00:41:51,610
Yeah, I know, I was just
up in my room... thinking.

490
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:53,181
Thinking about what?

491
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:56,982
Just about everything.

492
00:41:56,984 --> 00:41:59,954
And, uh,
it's totally cool.

493
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:04,757
I feel good.

494
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,260
I'm glad you
feel that way, buddy.

495
00:42:08,262 --> 00:42:09,428
Me too.

496
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,297
Why don't you grab
a seat?

497
00:42:11,299 --> 00:42:13,432
Ten minutes late never
killed anyone.

498
00:42:18,472 --> 00:42:23,075
You say she hasn't responded
to any calls or texts?

499
00:42:23,077 --> 00:42:25,077
That's correct.

500
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:27,179
This was the last place
she was seen.

501
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:32,351
Doesn't look like
a robbery.

502
00:42:42,296 --> 00:42:43,698
Good, God.

503
00:42:45,132 --> 00:42:47,933
Have you talked
to her daughter?

504
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:50,402
She's a mess right now.

505
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:52,571
Scared shitless.

506
00:42:52,573 --> 00:42:54,442
I barely got two words
out of her.

507
00:42:56,077 --> 00:42:57,346
What is that?

508
00:43:11,492 --> 00:43:14,159
So I know this
is kind of strange,

509
00:43:14,161 --> 00:43:16,729
I'm your aunt,
and I'm also your counselor,

510
00:43:16,731 --> 00:43:19,064
but I'm the only one
the district's got,

511
00:43:19,066 --> 00:43:20,568
so you are stuck with me.

512
00:43:21,836 --> 00:43:23,535
So Brandon,
your mom tells me

513
00:43:23,537 --> 00:43:25,971
that you've been having
some issues lately

514
00:43:25,973 --> 00:43:27,575
about being adopted.

515
00:43:29,176 --> 00:43:30,709
Nothing bad,

516
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:32,044
- only good ones.
- Really?

517
00:43:32,046 --> 00:43:34,413
How so?

518
00:43:34,415 --> 00:43:36,649
I've realized I'm special.

519
00:43:36,651 --> 00:43:40,419
Because my real parents aren't
from a stupid place like here.

520
00:43:40,421 --> 00:43:43,989
You don't think of you mom
and dad as your real parents?

521
00:43:43,991 --> 00:43:46,725
I do, but I just know
I'm something else.

522
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:48,397
Something superior.

523
00:43:52,733 --> 00:43:54,033
Brandon,

524
00:43:54,035 --> 00:43:55,768
do you feel bad

525
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:58,639
about what you did to Caitlyn?

526
00:44:01,108 --> 00:44:02,875
You know,

527
00:44:02,877 --> 00:44:04,543
sometimes

528
00:44:04,545 --> 00:44:06,578
when bad things
happen to people,

529
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,317
it's for a good reason.

530
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:14,119
Brandon,
part of my job

531
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:15,688
is to update the school,

532
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:17,990
and to update your mom
on your progress,

533
00:44:17,992 --> 00:44:20,492
and to let them know
if you are showing any

534
00:44:20,494 --> 00:44:22,261
growth or remorse,
and I...

535
00:44:22,263 --> 00:44:27,068
I can't take it easy on you
because you're my family.

536
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:31,404
I'm giving you an opportunity
to talk to me,

537
00:44:31,406 --> 00:44:33,939
I'm supposed to update
the sheriff tomorrow,

538
00:44:33,941 --> 00:44:36,075
and I have to be
honest with him.

539
00:44:48,155 --> 00:44:50,323
Yeah, my buddy said
the diner was just...

540
00:44:50,325 --> 00:44:53,492
Was just wrecked.
And the waitress Erika

541
00:44:53,494 --> 00:44:55,160
was gone.
It's been 24 hours.

542
00:44:55,162 --> 00:44:57,997
Wow, Kyle, you think
your son could have done it?

543
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,300
- Dude!
- What?

544
00:45:00,302 --> 00:45:02,101
He crushed
her daughter's hand.

545
00:45:02,103 --> 00:45:04,169
That's not funny
right now, okay?

546
00:45:04,171 --> 00:45:06,306
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- So, uh...

547
00:45:06,308 --> 00:45:08,107
What's gonna happen
with all that?

548
00:45:08,109 --> 00:45:10,343
I don't know.
He got suspended for a few days,

549
00:45:10,345 --> 00:45:12,811
and I'm sure I'm gonna get
a call from some lawyer

550
00:45:12,813 --> 00:45:14,780
telling me my son's
a monster, which...

551
00:45:14,782 --> 00:45:16,449
I don't even know anymore.
Maybe he is.

552
00:45:16,451 --> 00:45:18,550
They're all monsters.
I'm going home.

553
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:20,353
Come on. One more.

554
00:45:20,355 --> 00:45:22,554
- One more. Come on.
- No, no. I gotta get home,

555
00:45:22,556 --> 00:45:24,289
- or Merilee's gonna kill me.
- I'll drive you.

556
00:45:24,291 --> 00:45:26,025
It's just a few miles
down the road.

557
00:45:26,027 --> 00:45:28,662
- No, hang. I'll drive.
- Mommy, I'm okay.

558
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:32,166
Brandon!

559
00:45:35,337 --> 00:45:37,339
I'm home.
I got us sesame chicken.

560
00:45:40,808 --> 00:45:41,876
Brandon?

561
00:46:11,172 --> 00:46:12,172
What?

562
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:34,795
<i>Alert. Motion, backyard.</i>

563
00:46:36,431 --> 00:46:37,466
What?

564
00:46:59,387 --> 00:47:00,754
Who the hell?

565
00:47:17,506 --> 00:47:20,105
- Hey.
- Brandon, Jesus.

566
00:47:20,107 --> 00:47:22,007
What are you doing here?

567
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:23,909
I need to talk to you.

568
00:47:23,911 --> 00:47:27,012
I know it's late,
but I promise I won't take long.

569
00:47:27,014 --> 00:47:28,647
Okay. Fine.

570
00:47:28,649 --> 00:47:30,816
Back in your office,
you mentioned something about

571
00:47:30,818 --> 00:47:32,818
talking to
the sheriff tomorrow?

572
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,653
Mm-hmm.
That's right.

573
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,955
Yeah, the thing is...

574
00:47:36,957 --> 00:47:40,125
that can't happen, ever.

575
00:47:40,127 --> 00:47:42,995
It's just not good for anyone.

576
00:47:42,997 --> 00:47:46,231
Not for me,
not for my parents,

577
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:50,102
and it's really,
really not good for you.

578
00:47:50,104 --> 00:47:51,705
At all.

579
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:58,076
Brandon,
listen to me, okay?

580
00:47:58,078 --> 00:47:59,678
I have to do my job.

581
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,515
And to be honest, you showing up
at my house this late

582
00:48:02,517 --> 00:48:04,149
is very inappropriate.

583
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:06,253
I'm gonna need you
to go home now, okay?

584
00:48:07,656 --> 00:48:09,054
Okay.

585
00:48:09,056 --> 00:48:10,492
I'll walk back.

586
00:48:12,893 --> 00:48:14,663
Okay, sweetie.
Be safe.

587
00:48:15,664 --> 00:48:16,830
You too.

588
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,906
<i>Alert. Motion, backyard.</i>

00:48:27,908 --> 00:48:30,643

00:48:30,645 --> 00:48:32,312
<i>Alert.</i>

Brandon, is that you?

593
00:48:43,157 --> 00:48:45,558
This is so annoying.

594
00:48:47,194 --> 00:48:50,363
<i>Alert. Alert. Alert.</i>

595
00:48:50,365 --> 00:48:52,998
- <i>Motion, backyard.</i>
- Ugh, great.

596
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,337
The whole freaking house
is falling apart.

597
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:49,950
Oh, shit.

598
00:51:01,195 --> 00:51:03,796
Brandon? What the fuck
are you doing?

599
00:51:03,798 --> 00:51:05,997
Aunt Merilee was helping me
with my homework.

600
00:51:05,999 --> 00:51:07,367
No, what the fuck
are you doing in my closet

601
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:09,201
- wearing this creepy mask?
- It's not creepy.

602
00:51:09,203 --> 00:51:11,573
You scared the shit out of me,
weirdo! I'm taking you home.

603
00:51:14,509 --> 00:51:17,008
- This is fucking insane, man.
- I didn't do anything.

604
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:18,478
Are you gonna
tell my parents?

605
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,047
You're lucky
if that's all I do!

606
00:51:22,684 --> 00:51:24,049
Get in the truck.

607
00:51:24,051 --> 00:51:25,620
You shouldn't tell my parents.

608
00:51:30,859 --> 00:51:32,694
Brandon, get in the truck!

609
00:51:51,979 --> 00:51:53,078
Shit.

610
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:03,625
What the fuck!

611
00:52:21,609 --> 00:52:22,609
Holy sh...

612
00:52:26,748 --> 00:52:27,780

No, no, no.

615
00:52:33,287 --> 00:52:34,620
Come on, come on, come on.

616
00:52:34,622 --> 00:52:36,322
Ah, man!

617
00:52:36,324 --> 00:52:38,156
Come on, not now!

618
00:52:38,158 --> 00:52:40,292

Come on!

622
00:52:48,101 --> 00:52:49,402
Damn it.

623
00:52:49,404 --> 00:52:52,204
Come on, come on, come on.

Oh, shit. Okay.

626
00:52:59,914 --> 00:53:02,750
Okay, it's time to go.
Come on!

627
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,252
Nope. Mm-mmm.

628
00:53:07,254 --> 00:53:09,622
No, no, no.

629
00:53:09,624 --> 00:53:11,491
Come on!

630
00:53:11,493 --> 00:53:13,693
Get out of here!
Gotta go!

631
00:53:13,695 --> 00:53:15,964
Let's go! Come on!

632
00:53:23,638 --> 00:53:24,937
Uh...

633
00:53:24,939 --> 00:53:26,171
Okay.

634
00:53:26,173 --> 00:53:28,139
Um... uh...

635
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:30,311
This is, uh, really bad.

636
00:53:36,451 --> 00:53:38,551
What the... What the fuck!
No, stop, stop!

637
00:53:38,553 --> 00:53:40,620
Come on, put me down!
Hey, man, stop!

638
00:53:40,622 --> 00:53:43,858
Oh, shit! Oh, fuck.
No, no. Fuck, fuck, fuck!

639
00:53:45,593 --> 00:53:48,159
Oh, shit! Oh, God!

640
00:53:48,161 --> 00:53:49,629
Goddamn it!

641
00:53:49,631 --> 00:53:51,466
God! Fuck!

642
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:17,950
Hi, Merilee. I know
I'm leaving a lot of messages.

643
00:55:17,952 --> 00:55:20,653
It's after 10 now, and we still
haven't seen him, so...

644
00:55:20,655 --> 00:55:22,555
Did she say anything
to him at school?

645
00:55:22,557 --> 00:55:24,790
Maybe he said something
to you at school or...

646
00:55:24,792 --> 00:55:27,393
- Like he got a ride home or...
- Shut up!

647
00:55:27,395 --> 00:55:29,294
...where he
to go after school.

648
00:55:29,296 --> 00:55:32,465
I'm rambling
because I'm freaking out,

649
00:55:32,467 --> 00:55:35,166
so just please call me back.
Thank you, honey.

650
00:55:35,168 --> 00:55:38,306
- Would you please stop?
- I didn't say anything.

651
00:55:40,575 --> 00:55:41,843
Oh, my God, baby!

652
00:55:43,077 --> 00:55:45,176
Where have you been?

653
00:55:45,178 --> 00:55:47,913
Where were you?
What happened to your shirt?

654
00:55:47,915 --> 00:55:49,448
I was playing soccer.

655
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:51,651
You've been playing soccer
this whole time?

656
00:55:51,653 --> 00:55:53,619
Well, after school,

657
00:55:53,621 --> 00:55:56,455
Royce and them asked me
if I wanted to play.

658
00:55:56,457 --> 00:55:59,257
And as soon as
the game started, they were...

659
00:55:59,259 --> 00:56:02,128
They were tripping me
and pushing me to the ground,

660
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:05,398
and, you know,
they were all laughing

661
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,299
because my shirt got ripped.

662
00:56:07,301 --> 00:56:10,235
I just decided I'd walk
all the way home.

663
00:56:10,237 --> 00:56:12,605
I know I should have called.

664
00:56:12,607 --> 00:56:14,440
- Yes.
- Actually, I'm...

665
00:56:14,442 --> 00:56:16,575
I'm just really tired.
I'm gonna go to bed.

666
00:56:16,577 --> 00:56:18,243
Okay, well,
let me take this...

667
00:56:18,245 --> 00:56:20,081
No. No.

668
00:56:21,382 --> 00:56:23,149
Don't worry about it.

669
00:56:23,151 --> 00:56:24,318
It's fine.

670
00:56:30,058 --> 00:56:32,060
I'll come up
in a couple minutes.

671
00:56:35,363 --> 00:56:36,896
- He's lying.
- Yeah, obviously.

672
00:56:36,898 --> 00:56:39,398
If we don't do something,
this is gonna get worse.

673
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,733
- What the fuck do we do?
- I don't know.

674
00:56:40,735 --> 00:56:42,401
Maybe we need
to talk to somebody.

675
00:56:42,403 --> 00:56:43,969
- He needs a specialist.
- What?

676
00:56:43,971 --> 00:56:45,671
- And say what to them?
- I don't know.

677
00:56:45,673 --> 00:56:47,139
"Hello, this is our son.

678
00:56:47,141 --> 00:56:49,041
We found him in a fucking
spaceship in the woods.

679
00:56:49,043 --> 00:56:50,509
Now what?"
No, we should have

680
00:56:50,511 --> 00:56:52,814
done something a long
time ago. This is on us.

681
00:57:01,689 --> 00:57:04,592
<i>Maybe this time,
we get lucky and make a baby?</i>

682
00:57:19,407 --> 00:57:21,006
<i>Just shut up and kiss me.</i>

683
00:57:34,589 --> 00:57:37,189
<i>There's, like,
a light in the woods.</i>

684
00:57:37,191 --> 00:57:38,191
What the...?

685
00:57:41,429 --> 00:57:42,764
Tori?

686
00:57:45,066 --> 00:57:46,434
Tori?

687
00:58:00,448 --> 00:58:01,749
Tori?

688
00:58:09,857 --> 00:58:11,125
Tori?

689
00:58:16,631 --> 00:58:17,631
Hey, baby.

690
00:58:18,933 --> 00:58:19,933
What are you doing?

691
00:58:27,475 --> 00:58:28,810
It's a boy.

692
00:58:38,653 --> 00:58:42,657
Oh, we've tried for so long
to have a baby, and he's here.

693
00:58:46,694 --> 00:58:49,397
He's here. A gift.

694
00:59:11,252 --> 00:59:13,085
Hello?

695
00:59:13,087 --> 00:59:14,889
- Oh, God.
- Hey, hey. Huh?

696
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:19,861
Mer.

697
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:27,366
You all right?

698
00:59:27,368 --> 00:59:29,635
No. They won't let me see him
because his...

699
00:59:29,637 --> 00:59:33,340
They said that his face
is too mangled.

700
00:59:33,342 --> 00:59:35,641
Do they know what happened?

701
00:59:35,643 --> 00:59:38,244
They were...
They found him on Route 18.

702
00:59:38,246 --> 00:59:41,247
They think that he swerved
to not hit a deer, and...

703
00:59:41,249 --> 00:59:43,316
They're doing
the toxicology

704
00:59:43,318 --> 00:59:45,150
to make sure
that he wasn't drinking.

705
00:59:45,152 --> 00:59:46,652
Was he drinking?

706
00:59:46,654 --> 00:59:49,722
No, he just had
like two or three drinks of...

707
00:59:49,724 --> 00:59:51,125
I mean,
I wasn't counting.

708
00:59:53,661 --> 00:59:55,160
How's Brandon?

709
00:59:55,162 --> 00:59:57,096
He's okay.
We didn't tell him anything.

710
00:59:57,098 --> 00:59:58,831
No, but did
he get home okay?

711
00:59:58,833 --> 01:00:00,566
- Yes, he did.
- Okay.

712
01:00:00,568 --> 01:00:02,034
Thank God. Thank God.

713
01:00:02,036 --> 01:00:05,137
He came over and I didn't
remember when he left,

714
01:00:05,139 --> 01:00:06,941
so I'm just glad
that he's okay.

715
01:00:08,242 --> 01:00:09,677
He left you?

716
01:00:22,757 --> 01:00:24,025
Morning, baby.

717
01:00:28,963 --> 01:00:30,029
Um...

718
01:00:31,632 --> 01:00:34,133
There's something that
we need to discuss with you,

719
01:00:34,135 --> 01:00:37,339
and it's probably
gonna be hard to hear.

720
01:00:39,206 --> 01:00:41,440
Last night,
your Uncle Noah...

721
01:00:45,546 --> 01:00:47,081
He died last night.

722
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:50,650
Okay.

723
01:00:54,455 --> 01:00:56,488
Brandon,
do you understand?

724
01:00:56,490 --> 01:01:00,094
Your Uncle Noah passed away.
He's gone.

725
01:01:04,198 --> 01:01:06,366
I feel like you want me to cry
or something.

726
01:01:06,368 --> 01:01:08,968
Do you wanna cry?

727
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:12,441
Brandon, we know you were
at Aunt Merilee's last night.

728
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:19,044
Honey, I'm your mom.

729
01:01:19,046 --> 01:01:21,080
I will always defend you.

730
01:01:21,082 --> 01:01:24,283
But if you know something
about what happened to Noah,

731
01:01:24,285 --> 01:01:25,653
you need to tell us.

732
01:01:32,593 --> 01:01:34,793
I don't know
what happened to him.

733
01:01:34,795 --> 01:01:37,330
But I would never
hurt Uncle Noah.

734
01:01:37,332 --> 01:01:38,699
I love him.

735
01:01:40,101 --> 01:01:42,534
That is bullshit.
He is fucking lying!

736
01:01:42,536 --> 01:01:43,635
Kyle.

737
01:01:43,637 --> 01:01:45,170
Look, we know you were there.

738
01:01:45,172 --> 01:01:46,805
What else are you
lying to us about?

739
01:01:46,807 --> 01:01:48,507
Can you calm down?

740
01:01:48,509 --> 01:01:50,443
- Were you in Caitlyn's bedroom?
- He was camping with us.

741
01:01:50,445 --> 01:01:52,678
Where were you Wednesday
when Caitlyn's mom went missing?

742
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,047
- This is not helping!
- He is lying to our faces!

743
01:01:55,049 --> 01:01:57,484
- I'm gonna go upstairs.
- You're what...

744
01:01:57,486 --> 01:01:59,618
No, you're not.
You are not going anywhere

745
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:01,020
until we get all this
on the table.

746
01:02:01,022 --> 01:02:02,755
- Kyle, I will handle it!
- No, no, no.

747
01:02:02,757 --> 01:02:04,089
Did you hurt Noah?

748
01:02:04,091 --> 01:02:05,290
What did you do to him!

749
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:06,825
He was my friend,
and you just...

750
01:02:06,827 --> 01:02:07,960
Leave me alone!

751
01:02:14,535 --> 01:02:15,836
Brandon.

752
01:02:19,374 --> 01:02:21,341
You need to go to your room.

753
01:02:21,343 --> 01:02:22,941
Just go to your room.

754
01:02:22,943 --> 01:02:24,312
Are you all right?

755
01:02:27,281 --> 01:02:28,847
Honey?

756
01:02:28,849 --> 01:02:30,983
He's hiding that shirt
for some reason.

757
01:02:30,985 --> 01:02:32,551
Honey.

758
01:03:11,025 --> 01:03:12,126
Shit.

759
01:03:17,932 --> 01:03:19,066
Dad?

760
01:03:21,202 --> 01:03:22,404
Hey, bud.

761
01:03:24,271 --> 01:03:26,040
I wanted to apologize.

762
01:03:28,609 --> 01:03:30,878
We've been going through
a lot lately, and...

763
01:03:32,414 --> 01:03:34,815
I shouldn't have said
what I said to you.

764
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:37,150
Okay.

765
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,754
- Come here, get in here.
- What? What?

766
01:03:43,592 --> 01:03:45,624
- It's right there.
- That could be anything.

767
01:03:45,626 --> 01:03:48,260
No. That is why he was hiding
this from us last night.

768
01:03:48,262 --> 01:03:50,929
- That is Noah's blood.
- How?

769
01:03:50,931 --> 01:03:53,433
How could Brandon
have killed Noah

770
01:03:53,435 --> 01:03:55,134
and then made it look
like a car accident?

771
01:03:55,136 --> 01:03:56,735
Who knows what kind
of weird shit he could do?

772
01:03:56,737 --> 01:04:00,072
Noah was drunk
and wrecked the car

773
01:04:00,074 --> 01:04:02,509
- because you let him drive.
- No, that is not what...

774
01:04:02,511 --> 01:04:05,077
And now you are trying
to take out your guilt

775
01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:07,146
- on our 12-year-old son.
- Babe...

776
01:04:07,148 --> 01:04:12,084
You are making
a hard situation impossible.

777
01:04:12,086 --> 01:04:13,886
Babe, we've got
to do something.

778
01:04:13,888 --> 01:04:16,121
If we don't, more people
are gonna get hurt.

779
01:04:16,123 --> 01:04:19,057
More people will die.
You gotta be with me on this.

780
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:21,494
I will never
turn against our son.

781
01:04:21,496 --> 01:04:22,995
He's not our son!

782
01:04:22,997 --> 01:04:25,431
He is some thing
we found in the woods.

783
01:04:25,433 --> 01:04:27,966
How fucking dare
you say that to me.

784
01:04:27,968 --> 01:04:29,602
- How dare you.
- Babe!

785
01:04:29,604 --> 01:04:30,969
How can you
fucking say that to me?

786
01:04:30,971 --> 01:04:33,238
Babe. Come on,
he's killing us.

787
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,608
<i>We now turn to
more somber news tonight</i>

788
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:38,611
<i>as authorities are reaching out
to the public for information</i>

789
01:04:38,613 --> 01:04:41,780
<i>in their search for missing
Darbo's waitress, Erika Connor,</i>

790
01:04:41,782 --> 01:04:46,218
<i>who was last seen at the iconic
Route 74 diner Wednesday.</i>

791
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:48,488
<i>Anyone with information
about her whereabouts</i>

792
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:50,856
<i>is strongly urged
to contact police officials...</i>

793
01:06:04,466 --> 01:06:05,467
You okay?

794
01:06:13,841 --> 01:06:15,375
I think I'm gonna take him...

795
01:06:15,377 --> 01:06:18,010
I'm gonna take him away
this weekend.

796
01:06:18,012 --> 01:06:20,680
Just the two of us.

797
01:06:20,682 --> 01:06:23,583
Take him out to Drywood.

798
01:06:23,585 --> 01:06:25,587
Be his dad.

799
01:06:27,589 --> 01:06:29,624
Let him know I love him.

800
01:06:48,108 --> 01:06:49,975
Here, don't forget these.

801
01:06:49,977 --> 01:06:52,911
- Just wear them for me.
- Okay.

802
01:06:52,913 --> 01:06:54,349
Come here.

803
01:07:01,756 --> 01:07:03,625
You'll always be
my baby boy.

804
01:07:07,127 --> 01:07:09,464
Even though
you're getting so tall.

805
01:07:10,964 --> 01:07:12,467
Go have fun
with your dad, okay?

806
01:07:15,102 --> 01:07:16,136
All right.

807
01:07:18,673 --> 01:07:20,308
- Seat belt.
- Right.

808
01:07:23,977 --> 01:07:25,480
See you Sunday.

809
01:08:28,510 --> 01:08:29,975
Afternoon, Tori.

810
01:08:29,977 --> 01:08:30,977
Hey.

811
01:08:33,147 --> 01:08:34,716
Your boy around,
by chance?

812
01:08:36,016 --> 01:08:37,983
Brandon went hunting
with his dad.

813
01:08:37,985 --> 01:08:39,886
- Hmm.
- Is something wrong?

814
01:08:39,888 --> 01:08:42,357
Maybe you can answer
a question for me.

815
01:08:44,091 --> 01:08:45,693
This look familiar to you?

816
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:49,629
Some kind of signature
left at the spots

817
01:08:49,631 --> 01:08:52,865
where both Erika
went missing and Noah died.

818
01:08:52,867 --> 01:08:53,902
No. Mm-mm.

819
01:08:55,269 --> 01:08:59,305
Doesn't that look
like a "BB," maybe,

820
01:08:59,307 --> 01:09:01,476
as in "Brandon Breyer"?

821
01:09:02,877 --> 01:09:03,977
I don't see it.

822
01:09:07,382 --> 01:09:09,615
Do you mind if I come in,
take a look around?

823
01:09:09,617 --> 01:09:12,152
I do mind. I think,
actually, you should go.

824
01:09:13,287 --> 01:09:14,589
All right.

825
01:09:16,391 --> 01:09:17,659
But you know I'll be back.

826
01:09:37,211 --> 01:09:38,480
These are deer tracks.

827
01:09:54,696 --> 01:09:56,965
Looks like there's more
than one set of tracks.

828
01:10:05,773 --> 01:10:07,138
No.

829
01:10:27,094 --> 01:10:28,830
Oh, God.

830
01:11:11,372 --> 01:11:12,407
Brandon?

831
01:11:14,008 --> 01:11:15,208
Oh, man.

832
01:11:41,669 --> 01:11:42,669
Oh, God.

833
01:11:44,772 --> 01:11:47,573
No. Please stop.

834
01:11:47,575 --> 01:11:48,910
Please. Please.

835
01:11:50,712 --> 01:11:51,813
God... Ah!

836
01:11:55,483 --> 01:11:57,450
Brandon, please, stop, stop.

837
01:11:57,452 --> 01:12:00,151
Don't hurt me, okay?
Brandon, please, please.

838
01:12:00,153 --> 01:12:01,821
Please. Brandon, don't.
Don't.

839
01:12:01,823 --> 01:12:03,055
I'm sorry.

840
01:12:19,073 --> 01:12:20,140
Pick up, pick up.

841
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:23,643
Kyle.

842
01:12:23,645 --> 01:12:25,378
Kyle, I'm sorry.
You were right.

843
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:27,647
Baby, you were right.
He killed Noah.

844
01:12:27,649 --> 01:12:29,548
He... Brandon...

845
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:31,784
Brandon...
He killed Noah.

846
01:12:31,786 --> 01:12:33,153
And...

847
01:12:35,089 --> 01:12:36,491
Kyle?

848
01:12:39,093 --> 01:12:40,826
<i>Mom.</i>

849
01:12:40,828 --> 01:12:42,430
Brandon.

850
01:12:46,901 --> 01:12:48,302
Where's Dad?

851
01:12:50,605 --> 01:12:52,040
<i>He's gone.</i>

852
01:12:53,641 --> 01:12:55,275
Gone where?

853
01:12:57,645 --> 01:12:59,179
<i>You know.</i>

854
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,148
No.

855
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:05,651
No, I don't.
I don't know where.

856
01:13:05,653 --> 01:13:07,889
Where are you?

857
01:13:09,057 --> 01:13:11,025
I'm home, Mom.

858
01:13:25,907 --> 01:13:27,240
Brandon?

859
01:14:07,247 --> 01:14:09,048
Please pick up.
Please pick up.

860
01:14:13,688 --> 01:14:15,389
Please help me.

861
01:14:17,358 --> 01:14:18,459
Please...

862

<i>Got a
call from the Breyer residence.</i>

864
01:14:46,387 --> 01:14:48,254
<i>Tori was screaming,
then the line went dead.</i>

865
01:14:48,256 --> 01:14:49,421
Shit. I'm on my way.

866
01:15:15,449 --> 01:15:16,818
What the fuck?

867
01:15:19,787 --> 01:15:20,788
Yeah.

868
01:15:28,663 --> 01:15:31,664
Tori!
You got the sheriffs here.

869
01:15:31,666 --> 01:15:33,265
Where are you?

870
01:15:33,267 --> 01:15:35,603
Come to the sound
of my voice, Tori.

871
01:15:38,072 --> 01:15:39,405
I'm here, I'm here...

872
01:15:42,944 --> 01:15:44,679
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck was that?

873
01:15:46,013 --> 01:15:47,012
Tori!

874
01:15:47,014 --> 01:15:48,814
I'm here!

875
01:15:48,816 --> 01:15:50,317
- You're safe now.
- No, no.

876
01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:51,617
- We got...
- You need to get...

877
01:15:53,487 --> 01:15:55,287
Go! Take cover!

878
01:15:55,289 --> 01:15:56,755
- No, you don't understand...
- Go!

879
01:15:56,757 --> 01:15:58,657
- Hide! Hide!
- We need to get out.

880
01:15:58,659 --> 01:16:00,759
Oh, my God.

Request for backup

Immediate help.

We have a 217 in progress

Requesting backup.

885
01:16:14,976 --> 01:16:17,643
I repeat, I need backup!

<i>Officer?</i>

892
01:16:58,819 --> 01:17:01,420
If anyone can read me,
I have eyes on the suspect.

893
01:17:01,422 --> 01:17:02,556
He's outside.

894
01:17:20,274 --> 01:17:22,041
<i>Officer?</i>

895
01:17:22,043 --> 01:17:23,642
<i>Officer Ayres, come in.</i>

896
01:17:23,644 --> 01:17:25,444
<i>Come in, Officer Ayres.</i>

897
01:17:25,446 --> 01:17:28,582
<i>Hello?
Officer Ayres, please respond.</i>

898
01:18:46,861 --> 01:18:48,093
The ship.

899
01:18:48,095 --> 01:18:50,399
It cut him.
It cut him, it cut him.

900
01:19:23,197 --> 01:19:24,197
Okay.

901
01:19:41,682 --> 01:19:42,917
Erika.

902
01:19:58,567 --> 01:19:59,900
Brandon?

903

01:20:05,773 --> 01:20:07,574
Brandon?

Brandon.

911
01:21:04,798 --> 01:21:05,966
Listen to me.

912
01:21:07,402 --> 01:21:10,570
I have never
stopped loving you.

913
01:21:10,572 --> 01:21:12,505
I believe...

914
01:21:12,507 --> 01:21:14,507
I still believe

915
01:21:14,509 --> 01:21:17,109
you were a blessing

916
01:21:17,111 --> 01:21:19,414
that fell to this Earth.

917
01:21:32,193 --> 01:21:34,259
When we found you,

918
01:21:34,261 --> 01:21:37,162
you were so tiny and fragile.

919
01:21:37,164 --> 01:21:41,033
And all we could do
was keep you safe.

920
01:21:41,035 --> 01:21:43,438
Whatever you've done,

921
01:21:45,507 --> 01:21:50,445
I know there is good
inside you.

922
01:21:53,481 --> 01:21:55,582
I want to do good, Mom.

923
01:21:55,584 --> 01:21:57,017
I do.

924
01:21:58,486 --> 01:21:59,918
And you will.

925
01:22:05,226 --> 01:22:08,994
You will always be...

926
01:22:13,267 --> 01:22:15,470
...my baby boy.

927
01:22:23,712 --> 01:22:26,346

Oh, Brandon.

A passenger jet has crashed

930
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:05,378
in the small town
of Brightburn, Kansas.

931

Details are still coming in,

Investigators
are not yet sure

935
01:24:14,823 --> 01:24:17,390
what caused the plane
to drop suddenly from the sky

936
01:24:17,392 --> 01:24:19,991
and crash into
this small family farm.

937
01:24:19,993 --> 01:24:23,028
Among the reported dead are
the residents of the farmhouse,

938
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:24,664
Kyle and Tori Breyer.

939
01:24:24,666 --> 01:24:27,866
They are survived by
their 12-year-old son, Brandon.
