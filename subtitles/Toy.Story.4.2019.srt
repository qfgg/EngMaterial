00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,500
建一个家  在里面过日子  成了
You made a house, you lived in it, done.

159
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,480
这是你这周第三次没被选中了
That's the third time you haven't been picked this week.

160
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,770
我不知道  我没有在算
I don't know. I don't keep count.

161
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,420
你不用算
You don't have to.

162
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,770
-我来帮你算  -好  好  我明白
- I'll do it for you. - Okay, okay, okay, I get it.

163
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,610
-是有一阵了  -瞧瞧看
- It's been a while. - Oh, looky there.

164
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,680
你有了第一个灰尘团
You got your first dust bunny.

165
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,700
真可爱
How adorable.

166
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,950
你要给它起什么名字
What you gonna name it?

167
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:15,900
叫尘尘怎么样
What about Dusty?

168
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,030
-弗朗西斯  -哈里
- Francis! - Harry!

169
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,080
-凯伦  -毛球
- Karen! - Fuzzball!

170
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,240
-勒布朗  -不  毛茸茸
- LeBron. - No, Fluffy.

171
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,830
-桑普兔怎么样  -风滚草
- How about Thumper? - Tumbleweed!

172
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,790
"风滚草"  这个好  这个好
"Tumbleweed." Oh, that's good. That's good.

173
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,250
他是个牛仔  因此这个名字很合理
He's a cowboy, so that makes a lot of sense.

174
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,790
选择太多了
So many choices.

175
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,340
我决定不了
I just can't decide!

176
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,070
邦妮
Bonnie?

177
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,710
你在做什么  我们得走了
What are you doing? We got to go.

178
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,010
你不想幼儿园迎新会迟到吧  对吗
You don't wanna be late for kindergarten orientation, do you?

179
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,840
但...我不想去
But... I don't wanna go.

180
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,930
我们聊过的
We talked about this.

181
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,140
我们要去见你的老师们
We're gonna meet your teachers,

182
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,960
-看你的教室  -我能带玩具去吗
- see your classroom... - Can I bring a toy?

183
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,040
玩具不能带去上学  这是规矩
Toys don't go to school, that's the rule.

184
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,440
别动  大家不许动
Freeze! Nobody move!

185
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,730
邦妮总是会忘带什么
Bonnie always forgets something.

186
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,180
她随时都会回来
She'll be back any second.

187
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,610
你也不许动  火腿
That goes for you, too, Hamm.

188
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,800
但这是钱啊
But it's money!

189
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,360
你没事吧  胡迪
You all right, Woody?

190
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,660
下次她一定会选你的
I'm sure she'll pick you next time.

191
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,030
拜托  我没事  没关系
Come on, I'm fine. No problem.

192
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,080
胡迪  给
Woody. Here.

193
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,120
谢谢  杰西
Thanks, Jessie.

194
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,360
我们支持你  伙计
We're here for you, buddy.

195
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,420
-我不想演面包师  -刺毛裤
- I don't want to play the baker. - Pricklepants.

196
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,090
-我天生就该演帽子店老板  -好吧
- The hat shop owner is the role I was born to play! - Okay.

197
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,540
好了  刺毛裤  回你的面包房吧
All right, Pricklepants, back to your bakery.

198
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,300
不好意思  桃莉
Excuse me, Dolly?

199
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,090
胡迪  你没看见我正在恐吓大伙吗
Woody, can't you see I'm threatening everyone?

200
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,080
-回壁橱里去  -我知道  只是...
- Go back to the closet. - Yeah, I know. I know. It's just...

201
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,630
我很担心邦妮
I'm worried about Bonnie.

202
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,470
应该有个玩具陪她去迎新会
A toy should go with her to orientation.

203
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,680
你没听到爸爸说的吗  你会害邦妮惹麻烦的
Didn't you hear Dad? You'll get Bonnie in trouble.

204
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,600
是啊  但幼儿园很不一样
Yeah, but kindergarten is so different.

205
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,180
小孩可能觉得吃不消
It can be too much for a kid.

206
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,490
如果能有个伙伴陪着渡过难关
Having a buddy with them to get through it

207
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,520
会很有帮助的
can really help things.

208
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,600
我记得以前我就会和安迪一起去上学...
I remember with Andy, I would go to school with him...

209
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,630
抱歉  胡迪  我也不想像复读机一样唠叨
I'm sorry, Woody. I hate to sound like a broken record.

210
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,020
但邦妮不是安迪
But Bonnie is not Andy.

211
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,690
对对对  当然了  我明白
No, no, no, of course, I get that.

212
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,180
-但如果你能...  -大家就位
- But if you would just... - Places, everyone!

213
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,030
邦妮
Bonnie?

214
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,660
你躲在这里做什么
What are you doing back there?

215
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,320
快点  我们必须走了
Come on, we have to go.

216
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,890
这才是我的乖女儿
That's my big girl.

217
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,080
快点  我们得赶紧了  好吗
Come on. We got to hurry, okay?

218
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,670
别忘了你的书包
Don't forget your backpack.

219
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,630
会很好玩的
You're gonna have so much fun.

220
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,970
好了  你说到哪了  胡迪
All right. Now what was it you were saying, Woody?

221
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,300
胡迪
Woody?

222
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,810
我们到了
Here we are.

223
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,960
{\an8}欢迎参加迎新会

224
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,250
邦妮  亲爱的  没事的
Bonnie, honey, it'll be okay.

225
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,330
你好  你是邦妮吗
Hi! Are you Bonnie?

226
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,220
我是温迪老师
My name is Miss Wendy.

227
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,290
以后我就是你的幼儿园老师
I'm going to be your kindergarten teacher.

228
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:52,400
我们有个特别的地方给你放书包
We have a special place where you can put your backpack.

229
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,510
想看看吗
You want to see?

230
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,880
就是这里  邦妮  你专用的
Here we are, Bonnie. Just for you.

231
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:19,720
{\an8}迦勒  薇薇安  托尼  邦妮  安东

232
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,050
好了  同学们
Okay, class,

233
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,800
大家在桌子旁边找个位子坐下
let's all find a seat at a table...

234
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,660
我们马上就要开始手工时间了
so we can start craft time.

235
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,220
上学的第一天
On the first day of school,

236
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,470
你们都需要有个地方来放铅笔
you'll need a place to put your pencils.

237
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,920
所以今天  我们就来做笔筒
So, today, we're going to make pencil holders.

238
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,170
现在  每个人拿出一个杯子
Now, everyone take a cup...

239
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,210
然后我们用美术用品来装饰它们
and we'll use the art supplies to decorate them.

240
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,130
你好
Hi.

241
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,270
{\an8}邦妮

242
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,890
邦妮  真有创意
Bonnie. That is so clever.

243
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,780
"你好  我叫叉叉  很高兴认识你"
"Hello, I'm Forky. Nice to meet you!"

244
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,790
你好  叉叉  很高兴认识你
Well, hello, Forky, it's nice to meet you.

245
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,020
我是温迪老师
I'm Miss Wendy.

246
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,040
妈妈  爸爸  看看我做了什么
Mom! Dad! Look what I made!

247
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,490
他叫叉叉
His name is Forky!

248
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,050
棒极了
That is so cool!

249
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,910
我上完幼儿园了
I finished kindergarten!

250
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,880
不  今天只是迎新会
No. That was just orientation.

251
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,470
但你这么勇敢
But for being such a brave girl,

252
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,760
我们要给你个惊喜
we have a surprise for you.

253
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,430
什么惊喜
What is it?

254
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,260
既然还有一周才开学
Since school doesn't start for another week,

255
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,560
那我们就来个自驾游
we are going on a road trip!

256
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,440
-我能带叉叉去吗  -当然可以
- Can I bring Forky? - 'Course you can!

257
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,960
太好了

258
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,850
他们还说我不该跟邦妮去学校
And they said I shouldn't go to school with Bonnie.

259
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,270
幼儿园的情况尽在我们掌控之中  对吧
We got this kindergarten thing under control, eh?

260
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,770
不敢相信我居然在跟叉勺说话
I can't believe I'm talking to a spork.

261
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:00,960
玩具们好
Hi, toys!

262
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,850

- I knew it. - No, no, no, guys, listen...

不  当然不是
No, of course not!

267
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,890
你可能会被没收
You could have been confiscated.

268
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,880
-那是什么意思  -被带走

269
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,270
-不  -还有更吓人的

271
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,480
不不不  各位  听我说

272
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,150
邦妮在幼儿园度过了快乐的一天
Bonnie had a great day in class...

273
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,570
而且我们还要去自驾游

274
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,680
-自驾游  -度假
- Road trip - Vacation!

275
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,030
然后发生了一件怪事
But then something really weird happened.

276
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,860
邦妮在课堂上做了个朋友
Bonnie made a friend in class.

277
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,870
-这孩子真不错  -她已经交上朋友了
- What a kid. - Oh, she's already making friends.

278
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,060
不是  她真的"做"了个新朋友
No, no. She literally made a new friend.

279
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,370
没事的
It's okay.

280
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,820
出来吧  就这样
Come on out. That's it.

281
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,570
没事的  出来吧

282
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,570
来吧  我拉你出来
Come on, let's get you out of there.

283
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,820
你能行的
You got this.

284
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,870
好  很好
Good. Good.

285
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,340
各位  认识一下叉叉
Everyone, I want you to meet Forky.

286
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,100
-我的老天爷  -快看啊

287
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,920
他的胳膊可真长
Look how long his arms are!

288
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,100
-垃圾  -不

289
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,190

290
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,940
他们都是玩具
They're all toys.

291
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,870
玩...玩...垃圾
T-Toy... Trash.

292
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,520
不不不
No, no, no.

293
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,070
那才是垃圾
That's the trash.

294
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,780
这些是你的朋友
These are your friends.

295
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,970
你好
Hi!

296
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:10,810
垃圾
Trash!

297
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,320
-不不  没事的  -垃圾
- No, no, it's okay. - Trash!

298
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,230
胡迪  我有个问题
Woody, I have a question.

299
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,790
实际上  不止一个问题
Well, actually, not just one,

300
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,790
我满脑子都是
I have all of them.

301
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,360
满脑子都是问题
I have all the questions.

302
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,170
他为什么要去垃圾桶那儿
Why does he want to go to the trash?

303
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,080
-因为他是用垃圾做的  -垃圾
- Because he was made from trash. - Trash!

304
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,210
听着  我知道这有点奇怪
Look, I know this is a little strange, but

305
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,800
-但你们要相信我  -垃圾
- you got to trust me on this. - Trash?

306
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,420
叉叉现在是
Forky is the

307
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,300
邦妮心目中最重要的玩具
most important toy to Bonnie right now.

308
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,220
重要
Important?

309
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,090
他是个叉勺
He's a spork.

310
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,220
是的  没错  我知道  但这个叉勺
Yes. Yeah, I know, but this spork...

311
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,430
这个玩具是邦妮适应
this toy is crucial to Bonnie

312
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,460
幼儿园生活的关键
getting adjusted to kindergarten.

313
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,140
胡迪  你这样是不是太小题大做了
Woody, aren't you being a little dramatic about all this?

314
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,690
我知道大家有点不适应
I know this is new to everybody...

315
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,770
但你们应该明白这个小家伙
but you should see how much

316
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,690
对于邦妮来说意义非凡
this little guy means to Bonnie.

317
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,150
当她开始跟他玩时
When she started playing with him...

318
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,450
她脸上的笑容是有史以来最灿烂的
she had the biggest smile on her face.

319
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,740
要是你们能看到就好了
I wish you could have seen it.

320
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,950
邦妮当时真的很难过
Bonnie was really upset...

321
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,700
我发誓  她做好叉叉之后
and I swear, once she made Forky...

322
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,060
就完全变了个人
it was a complete transformation.

323
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,500
-胡迪  -稍等  杰西
- Woody? - Just a second, Jessie.

324
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,750
所以我们都要确保他平安无事
So, we all have to make sure nothing happens to him.

325
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,320
他已经有事了
Something happened to him.

326
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,400
要了老命了
Chutes and Ladders!

327
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,510
-垃圾  -不不不
- Trash. - No, no, no! No! No!

328
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,970
你现在是玩具了  叉叉  别这样
You're a toy now, Forky! Come on!

329
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,280
住手  停下
Stop! Stop it!

330
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,090
-不不不  别这样  -垃圾
- No, no, no! Come on! - Trash!

331
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,300
垃圾  垃圾
Trash! Trash!

332
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,390
好吧  我只能一直看着他
Well, I guess I'll just babysit him

333
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,830
直到他习惯这个房间
till he's used to the room.

334
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,050
叉叉
Forky?

335
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,840
你在哪里  叉叉
Where are you, Forky?

336
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,800
你在这里
There you are!

337
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,140
我以为我把你弄丢了  小傻瓜
I thought I'd lost you, silly.

338
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,940
不不不
No, no, no.

339
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,090
大孩子好可怕
Big girl scary!

340
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,840
我告诉过你  邦妮一点都不可怕
Like I said before, Bonnie's not scary.

341
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,830
她爱你  而且你得...
She loves you and you need to...

342
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,470
叉叉
Forky?

343
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,600
邦妮
Bonnie!

344
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,560
该起床了
Let's go!

345
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,100
太阳晒屁股了
Rise and shine!

346
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,620
谁想去自驾游
Who wants to go on a road trip?

347
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,210
我  我要带桃莉  小奶油
Me! I'm gonna bring Dolly, and Buttercup...

348
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,480
还有叉叉  还有...
and Forky, and...

349
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,400
叉叉  你在哪里
Forky Where are you?

350
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,920
他肯定就在附近
He's got to be here somewhere.

351
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,910
叉叉
Forky?

352
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,700
叉叉
Forky!

353
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,340
走吧  我们吃完早饭就上路
Come on. Let's eat some breakfast and hit the road!

354
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,000
走吧  叉叉
Let's go, Forky!

355
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,640
他还真难对付  胡迪
He's quite a handful, Woody.

356
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,100
自驾游路上你需要帮忙吗
You need help with him on the road trip?

357
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,050
不  不用  我能行  我能行
No. No, no. I got it, I got it.

358
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,980
我们不会离开房车的
We'll just be stuck in an RV.

359
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,050
他走不远的  我能行
He can't get far. I got this.

360
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,050
我能行
I got it.

巴斯
Hey, Buzz.

410
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,970
你还好吗
You doing okay?

411
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,840
我说不好  巴斯
I don't know, Buzz.

412
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,470
我知道安迪小时候你不在
I know you weren't around when Andy was little... but

413
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,060
但我记得他小时候没这么难搞
I don't remember it being this hard.

414
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,580
想让我帮你站下一班岗吗
Want me to take the next watch?

415
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,600
我来盯着叉叉
I'll keep an eye on Forky.

416
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,650
不  不  我得自己来
No, no. I need to do this.

417
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,830
我放弃的话
That little voice inside me

418
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,860
内心的声音就会喋喋不休
would never leave me alone if I gave up.

419
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,070
你觉得是谁
Who do you think it is?

420
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,280
谁
Who?

421
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,120
你内心的声音  你觉得是谁
The voice inside of you. Who do you think it is?

422
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,200
是我
Me?

423
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,290
你知道  是我的良心
You know, my conscience?

424
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,350
良心会为你解释很多事情
That part of you that tells you things?

425
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,670
告诉你自己的真实想法
What you're really thinking?

426
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,800
真奇妙
Fascinating.

427
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,110
内心的声音为你出谋划策
So, your inner voice advises you.

428
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,930
什么
What?

429
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,160
这是在未知领域执行的秘密任务
It's a secret mission in uncharted space.

430
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,970
出发
Let's go.

431
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:49,980
叉叉去哪了
Where's Forky?

432
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,190
不好  叉叉
Oh, no! Forky!

433
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,020
叉叉
Forky!

434
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:54,650
叉叉
Forky!

435
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,670
我不是玩具
I am not a toy!

436
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,590
我是叉勺
I'm a spork.

437
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,340
安静点
Be quiet!

438
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,960
我是用来喝汤  吃沙拉
I was made for soup, salad...

439
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,620
也许还有辣椒酱  最后沦为垃圾的
maybe chili, and then the trash.

440
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,090
我是垃圾
I'm litter!

441
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,120
自由了
Freedom!

442
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,510
火腿  离下一站还有多远
Hamm, how far to our next stop?

443
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,560
8.56公里左右
5.32 miles, give or take.

444
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,680
那我赶得及
I can make that.

445
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,980
咱们房车营地见
I'll meet you at the RV park.

446
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,130
胡迪  等一下  胡迪
Woody, hold on a minute. Woody!

447
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,690
叉叉
Forky!

448
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,280
叉叉  你在哪
Forky, where are you?

449
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,900
叉叉
Forky!

450
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,660
叉叉  你在哪
Forky, where are you?

451
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,180
-抱我走  -不要
- Carry me - No.

452
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,690
我为什么一定要做玩具
Why do I have to be a toy?

453
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,780
因为你的木棍底下
Because you have Bonnie's name

454
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,570
写着邦妮的名字
written on the bottom of your sticks.

455
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,740
为什么我的木棍底下
Why do I have Bonnie's name

456
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,270
写着邦妮的名字
written on the bottom of my sticks?

457
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,520
因为她...
Because she...

458
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:17,150
她经常和你一起玩  对不对
Look, she plays with you all the time, right?

459
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,500
对
Yes.

460
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,460
是谁每晚陪着她入睡
And who does she sleep with every night?

461
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,920
那个大大白白软软的东西
The big white fluffy thing?

462
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,160
不  不是她的枕头
No, not her pillow.

463
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,870
是你
You.

464
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,800
好了  叉叉
All right, Forky.

465
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,410
你要明白自己现在有多幸运
You have to understand how lucky you are right now.

466
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,060
你是邦妮的玩具
You're Bonnie's toy.

467
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,390
你要和她共创欢乐美好的回忆
You are going to help create happy memories...

468
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,090
她的余生都将对此回味无穷
that will last for the rest of her life.

469
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,170
你说什么
What?

470
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,770
我这是为了邦妮
Okay. Doing it for Bonnie.

471
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,320
为了邦妮  你这是为了邦妮
Doing this for Bonnie, you're doing it for Bonnie.

472
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,530
接不接受  你都是个玩具
Okay, like it or not, you are a toy.

473
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,160
就算你不喜欢做玩具
Maybe you don't like being one,

474
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,620
你也注定是个玩具
but you are one nonetheless.

475
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,020
也就是说  在安迪需要你的时候...
Which means you are going to be there for Andy when he...

476
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,020
安迪是谁
Who's Andy?

477
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,290
我是说  邦妮
I mean, Bonnie.

478
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,080
在邦妮需要你的时候不离不弃
You have to be there for Bonnie.

479
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,690
这是你的职责
That is your job.

480
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,210
你的职责是什么
Well, what's your job?

481
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,960
目前就是监督你履行自己的职责
Well, right now, it's to make sure you do yours.

482
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,490
-抱我走  -不要
- Carry me - No.

483
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,620
安迪是谁
Who's Andy?

484
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,580
安迪曾经是我的孩子
Andy was my other kid.

485
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,590
你还有其他孩子
You had another kid?

486
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,020
对啊  对啊
Yeah, yeah.

487
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,510
很长一段时间
For a long time.

488
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,720
一段美好的时光
And it was pretty great.

489
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,720
我还是他最喜欢的玩具  不瞒你说
I was a favorite toy, actually.

490
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,350
我的职责就是统领全局
Running the room was my job.

491
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,870
让所有的玩具恪尽职守
Keeping all the toys in place...

492
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:37,060
他觉得安迪的房间是颗星球
So, he thought Andy's room was a planet?

493
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,250
-真是够蠢的  -可不是吗
- That is messed up. - Right!

494
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,120
他登场的时候我就是这么想的
That's exactly what I thought when he first showed up.

495
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,880
是啊  你们不会觉得他很烦人吗
Yeah. I mean, how is that not annoying?

496
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,170
-谢谢支持  -说真的  这也太...
- Thank you! - Seriously, that is the...

497
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,760
看着孩子们渐渐长大
Well, then you watch 'em grow up

498
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,820
然后长大成人
and become a full person.

499
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,080
最终离我们而去
And then they leave.

500
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,830
他们会离开去做你永远见不到的事情
They go off and do things you'll never see.

501
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,820
别误会  你仍然会为他们感到自豪
Don't get me wrong, you still feel good about it.

502
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,530
但终有一日你会发现
But then somehow you find yourself,

503
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,030
这么多年以来
after all those years...

504
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,480
守在壁橱里  感觉自己...
sitting in a closet just feeling...

505
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,360
百无一用
Useless?

506
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,940
对
Yeah.

507
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,900
你的任务已经完成
Your purpose fulfilled?

508
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,610
没错
Exactly.

509
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,280
胡迪  我知道你的问题在哪了
Woody, I know what your problem is.

510
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,000
你知道
You do?

511
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,410
你和我一样
You're just like me.

512
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,920
垃圾一个
Trash!

513
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,840
你到底和垃圾有什么不解之缘
What is it with you and trash?

514
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,260
-很温暖  -恶心
- It's warm. - Ew.

515
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,680
-很温馨  -可能吧
- It's cozy. - I guess.

516
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,640
充满安全感
And safe!

517
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,470
仿佛有人在你耳边轻声说道
Like somebody's whispering in your ear,

518
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,500
"一切都会好起来的"
"Everything's gonna be okay."

519
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,670
叉叉  就是这样
Forky, that's it.

520
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,650
邦妮和你在一起的时候就是这种感觉
That's how Bonnie feels when she's with you.

521
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,380
-是吗  -没错
- She does - Yes!

522
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,510
让我想想
Wait a sec.

523
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,860
-你是说她觉得我很温暖  -对
- You mean she thinks I'm warm? - Yep.

524
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,200
-很温馨  -没错
- And cozy - Uh-huh.

525
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,560
有时候还黏糊糊的
And sometimes kinda squishy?

526
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,270
这个嘛  对  没错
Well, that, too. Yes.

527
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,900
我现在懂了
I get it now.

528
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,120
我是邦妮的"垃圾"
I'm Bonnie's trash.

529
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,250
对  等等  你说什么
Yes! Wait, what?

530
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,660
我是邦妮的"垃圾"
I am Bonnie's trash!

531
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,460
不  不  不  不至于
No, no, no, not exactly.

532
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,960
我不在她一定很伤心
She must be feeling awful without me.

533
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,740
胡迪  快走  她需要我
Woody, we got to get going, she needs me!

534
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,030
邦妮  我来了
Hey, Bonnie, I'm coming!

535
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,710
叉叉  慢点  叉叉
Forky, slow down! Forky!

536
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,950
邦妮  我来了
Bonnie, I'm coming!

537
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,030

542
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:29,850
快点
Hurry!

543
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,170
胡迪

544
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,510
宝贝
Bo?

545
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:08,980
胡迪
Woody?

546
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,370
我们不去  我们不去找邦妮吗
Aren't we, aren't we going to Bonnie?

547
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,990
我知道我知道  但我朋友可能在里面
I know, I know. But my friend might be in there.

548
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,820
朋友
Friend?

549
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,910
朋友  朋友就是
A friend, uh... Well, a friend is...

550
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,090
朋友就像你和我一样
Well, a friend is like you and me.

551
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,010
-垃圾  -垃圾  就像...没错
- Trash - Trash, like... Yes.

552
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,920
我现在很担心她可能被弄丢了
And I'm very worried that she might be lost.

553
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,090
但是胡迪  邦妮就在那边
But, Woody, Bonnie's right there.

554
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,500
在她醒来前一定送你回去  来吧
Yeah, we'll have you back before she wakes up. Come on.

555

570
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,300
我没看到你的朋友
I don't see your friend.

571
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,660
是啊  好吧
Yeah, okay.

572
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,040
她不在这里
She's not in here.

579
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,150
我们只是出来晨间散步而已
We were just out for my early morning stroll.

580

This is Forky.

586
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,550
我是垃圾
I'm trash.

587
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,540
我们的孩子创造了他
Our kid made him.

588
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,210
孩子  这里的玩具都没有孩子
Kid? Toys around here don't have kids.

589
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,630
你们两个是不是被弄丢了
Are you two lost?

590
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,480
弄丢了  没有  没有
Lost No, no.

591
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,920
我们在找一个被弄丢的玩具
But we are looking for a lost toy.

592
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,070
她是小塑像  曾经在展示窗的那盏灯上
She's a figurine. Used to be on that lamp in the window?

593
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,230
名叫牧羊女宝贝
Name's Bo Peep?

594
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,030
牧羊女宝贝
Bo Peep?

595
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,390
-对  我认识宝贝  -你认识
- Oh, yes, I know Bo. - You do?

596
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,110
坐进来  我们带你们去见她
Hop on in. We'll take you to her.

597
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,520
不用这么麻烦你们
You don't have to do that.

598

本森  对我们的新朋友温柔点

谢谢你的帮助
Thank you for your help.

602
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,430
我已经很多年没见过宝贝了
I haven't seen Bo in years.

603
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,250
冒昧问一句  你产于哪一年
May I ask, when were you made?

604
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,080
我吗
Me?

605
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,630
我不确定  50年代末
I'm not sure. Late '50s?

606
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,500
我也是
Me, too!

607
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,730
老天  我们会不会是同一家工厂生产的
Gee, I wonder if we were made in the same factory.

608
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,130
那样是不是太了不起了
Wouldn't that be something?

609
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,770
不得不说  你护理得非常棒
I got to say, you are in great condition.

610
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,840
我尽量保持活跃

611
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,140
而且你看
And look at that,

612
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,890
你和我一样有个声匣
you have a voice box like me.

613
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,100
本森  给他看看
Benson, show him.

614
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,980
这就不必了
That's really not necessary.

615
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,820
我叫嘉比嘉比
I'm Gabby Gabby

616

00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,610
你这个得修一修了
You need to fix that.

618
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,360
我的录音带是好的
My record works just fine.

619
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,570
是声匣坏了
It's the voice box that's broken.

620
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,120
你的还能用吗
Does yours still work?

621
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,700
我靴子里有条蛇
There's a snake in my boot!

622
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,930
听听这声音  让我看看
Listen to that! Let's see it.

623
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,010
肯定和我是同款
I bet it's the same type.

624
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,080
不用了谢谢  我的缝在体内了
No, thanks, mine's sewn inside.

625
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,170
宝贝在这里吗  我们还得...

626
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,630
商店要开门了
The store is about to open.

00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,230
别担心  我们带你去没人能看到的地方
Don't worry, we'll take you where no one will see us.

628
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,850
不行  我们不能逗留
Oh, no. We can't stay.

629
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,680
你们当然可以
Yes, you can.

630
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,080
我们该走了
We got to go.

631
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,900

You can't leave yet. You have what I need.

632
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,620
就在你身体里面
Right inside there.

633
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,090
第二天就把台灯退回来了
Returned that lamp the next day.

634
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:55,880
你在开玩笑吗
You're kidding me!

635
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,880
妈妈  我们能去公园了吗

636

638
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,970

不过首先  我要唱一首歌
But first, I'm gonna sing a little song.

645
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,220
外婆  看看我找到了什么

It's fine. Nobody buys the toys anyway.

649

657
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,130
也许我们应该用叉子的

勺子更安全

We have to find him, Mom. He needs me.

674
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,540
胡迪是对的
Woody was right.

675
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,620
我们应该轮流守着那餐具

胡迪怎么还没回来

他是不是丢了

678

-巴斯  -胡迪会怎么做

00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,590
从行驶中的车辆上跳下去
Jump out of a moving vehicle.

685
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,790

686
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,640
这是在未知领域执行的秘密任务
It's a secret mission in uncharted space.

687
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,290

Should we all go?

691
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,020
-我们要去吗  -然后呢
- Are we going? - And then what?

692
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,730
没时间解释了  进攻

为什么人人都要从窗户跳出去

696
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,400
胡迪和叉叉之前是在高速公路上

Am I right?

718
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,780
"你好  牛仔先生  近来如何"
"Hello, Mr. Cowboy. How are you today?"

719
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,910
"你喜欢骑马吗"
"Do you like riding horses?"

720
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,960
想玩荡秋千吗
Wanna play on the swings?

721

没想到还能再见到你
I never thought I'd see you again!

728
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,320
-哪个孩子是你的  -哪个是你的

我是说  糟糕才怪
I mean, awfully great...

733
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:34,710
你丢了这件事

你从哪里找到的这些东西
Where did you get all this stuff?

750
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,260
零零碎碎捡的
Here and there.

751
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,430
你懂的  有些小孩玩得比较粗暴
You know, some kids play rougher than others...

752
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,720
所以我尽量做好准备
so I try to be prepared.

753
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,470
你独自在外生活多久了
How long have you been out on your own?

754
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,730
美妙的七年
Seven fantastic years!

755
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:23,270
七年

756
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,970
我见过的东西  你都没法相信
You would not believe the things I've seen.

757
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,050

771
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,010
你好  警长

780
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,570
据说他们准备了两个彩罐玩偶

干得好  士兵

游乐场见  牧羊女
Meet you at the playground, Peep.

792
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,340
战斗兵卡尔要闯入彩罐玩偶派对
Combat Carl's got a pinata party to crash.

793

All right, move out. Hut! Hut! Hut!

794

你现在有孩子

795
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,680
不是安迪吧
It's not Andy, is it?

796
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,680
不是  不是  他去上大学了
No, no, no. He went off to college.

797
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,170
但他把我们给了邦妮
But he gave us to Bonnie.

798
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,650
-你有个小姑娘  -不可能
- You have a little girl. - No way!

799
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,270
对  所以我才在这里
Yeah, yeah. It's why I'm out here.

800
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,480
她的一个玩具
Her other toy is trapped

801
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,980
被困在古董店里了  我得去...
in this antique store, and I have to...

802
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,810
第二机会古董店
Second Chance Antiques?

803
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,150
我们认识那家店
We know that store.

804
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,820
那真好  真棒
That's great. That is great!

805
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,320
你认识那家店的话
If you know the store, you could really

806
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,440
-就可以帮我找到他  -没门
- help me find him... - No way.

807
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:01,620
我们在那家店里浪费了很多年
We wasted years there,

808
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,730
待在架子上  堆积灰尘
just sitting on the shelf, collecting dust.

809
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,020
宝贝  那真糟糕
Bo, that's awful.

810
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,440
但我别无选择
But I don't have a choice.

811
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,190
我得从嘉比那里救回那件玩具
I have to get that toy from Gabby.

812
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,960
离那个怪胎远点
Steer clear of that weirdo.

813
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,210
如果我是你  我就认命回家去
If I were you, I'd cut my losses and go home.

814
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:14,420
但邦妮上幼儿园还需要他
But Bonnie needs him to get through kindergarten.

815
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,760
天天都有小孩弄丢玩具  邦妮会克服的
Kids lose toys every day. Bonnie will get over it.

816
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,370
不不
No, no...

817
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:21,870
邦妮需要他  就像莫莉需要你
You see, Bonnie needs him just like Molly needed you.

818
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,970
不  抱歉  姑娘们
No. Sorry, girls.

819
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,300
莫莉不在这里
Molly's not here.

820
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,690
莫莉  宝贝  我不知道你曾有过孩子
Molly Bo, I didn't know you had a kid.

821
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,050
那是很久之前了
That was a long time ago.

822
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,720
宝贝的孩子很特别
Bo's kid was something special.

823
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,650
她非常可爱
She was the cutest thing...

824
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:36,810
但很怕黑
but so afraid of the dark.

825
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,280
那只是成长的一个阶段
It was just a phase.

826
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,820
最开始没有你
You weren't there in the beginning.

827
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,600
听着莫莉每晚哭泣
Hearing Molly cry each night...

828
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,810
每个玩具都为此心碎
it broke every toy's heart.

829
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:47,320
然后  宝贝来了
And then, Bo came into the room.

830
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,570
只有她的台灯能让莫莉感到安全
Her lamp was the only thing that made Molly feel safe.

831
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,460
妈妈会让她整晚开着宝贝的灯
Mom would let her keep Bo on all night.

832
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,630
谁猜得出你曾经那么温柔呢
Ha! Who knew you were such a softy?

833
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,880
莫莉会握着
And Molly would fall asleep

834
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,260
宝贝的脚入睡
with her hand resting on Bo's feet.

835
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,620
好了  好了  我知道了
Okay! Okay. I get it.

836
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:05,630
宝贝  我的孩子真的很需要这个玩具
Bo, my kid really needs this toy.

837
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:09,170
你能看在旧情的份上帮帮我吗
Will you help me? For old times' sake.

838
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,520
好吧  好吧
All right, all right.

839
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,380
谢谢
Thank you!

840
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,520
-谢谢  -好吧
- Thank you! - All right.

841
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,430
看来我们要行动了  开车吧
Guess we're doing this. Let's ride!

842
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,810
第二机会古董店  出发
Second Chance Antiques, and step on it.

843
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:30,160
{\an8}第二机会古董店

844
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,380
本森  完事没
Benson, are we finished?

845
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,680
感觉好极了
That feels great!

846
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,350
瞧瞧看  完好如新
Look at that! Good as new.

847
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:54,220
是的  谢谢你  本森
Yeah. Thank you, uh, Benson.

848
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,230
好吧  胡迪什么时候回来
So, um, when's Woody coming back?

849
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,890
如我所说  很快
Like I said, soon.

850
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,440
他不会忘了你的
He won't forget about you.

851
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:02,320
你怎么知道
How do you know?

852
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,810
你孩子的名字就在你脚上
You have your child's name written on your feet.

853
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,310
木棍脚
Sticks.

854
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:08,790
所以你是一个非常重要的玩具
That makes you a very important toy.

855
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,570
胡迪也是这样说的
That's exactly what Woody says.

856
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,330
有趣

-会动的老朋友  -巴斯
- My old moving buddy! - Buzz?

997
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,770
见到你真高兴
It's so good to see you!

998
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:13,010
胡迪  是牧羊女宝贝
Woody, it's Bo Peep!

999
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,510
-你在这里做什么  -你在这里做什么
- What are you doing here? - What are you doing here?

1000
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,390
巴斯  巴斯  巴斯
Buzz... Buzz... Buzz...

1001
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:18,610
巴斯光年前来救援
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

1002
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,070
-三年了  -三年了
- Three years! - Three years!

1003
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,570
我们在那里苦苦等待被孩子带走
That's how long we've been hanging up there

1004
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,580
已经三年了
waiting for a kid!

1005
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,620
听着  我很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry about that.

1006
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,820
你毁了我们的人生  可耻
You ruined our lives. Shame on you!

1007
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,360
这些人是谁
Who are these guys?

1008
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:29,120
-光年保证过会帮我们找个孩子  -什么
- Lightyear promised us a kid. - You did what?

1009
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,360
我没有
I did not.

1010
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,280
-等一下  -吃我一记毛腿
- Wait a minute! - Eat my plush!

1011
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:33,750
好了  拜托  别打了
All right now, come on, stop it!

1012
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,500
给我停下
Cut it out now!

1013
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:35,590
拜托  各位  别闹了
Come on, guys, break it up.

1014
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,120
各位  我有孩子
Guys, I have a kid!

1015
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,050
你有孩子
You got a kid?

1016
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:40,340
真的孩子
Like a kid-kid?

1017
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,800
人类孩子  不是山羊孩子
Like a human kid, not a baby goat?

1018
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:45,010
是的  放开巴斯跟我走
Yeah. Now let go of Buzz and come with me.

1019
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,220
我带你们去见邦妮
I'll take you to Bonnie.

1020
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,850
-我们要有孩子了  -太棒了
- We're gettin' a kid! - Yes!

1021
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:48,710
我们要有孩子了
We're gettin' a kid?

到处都找不到他
He's not anywhere.

1030
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:07,520
叉叉不见了
Forky's gone.

1031
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,190
宝贝  真抱歉
Honey, I'm sorry.

1032
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,750
好吧  咱们到外面再找一遍
Okay. Let's look outside one more time.

1033
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,910
但是之后我们就要继续赶路了  好吗
But then we have to keep driving, okay?

1034
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:18,800
他们要离开了
They're about to leave!

1035
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,330
-要走了  -他们不能这么做
- Leaving? - They can't do that!

1036
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,500
我恐慌症发作了
The panic is attacking me!

1037
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,850
-小心点  哥们  -我们该怎么办
- Watch it, buddy! - What do we do?

1038
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:26,310
-我们要阻止他们  -怎么做
- We have to stop them! - How?

1039
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:28,980
我们可以陷害爸爸让他坐牢
We could frame Dad for a crime so he goes to jail.

1040
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,310
或者回到过去  警告胡迪未来发生的事情
Or go back in time and warn Woody about the future.

1041
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:33,190
太疯狂了  时间是个扁平的循环
That's crazy. Time is a flat circle.

1042
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:33,840
杰西
Jessie!

1043
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,180
对不起  邦妮
I'm sorry, Bonnie.

1044
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,150
我们四处都找遍了
We looked everywhere.

1045
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,700
但是我们现在要出发了  好吗
But we need to get going now, okay?

1046
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,160
我们可以给叉叉留个字条吗
Can we please leave a note for Forky...

1047
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,650
这样他就知道我们要去哪了
so he knows where we're going?

1048
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,730
他必须去上幼儿园
He has to go to kindergarten.

1049
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,860
开什么玩笑  我简直...
Are you kidding me, I can't...

1050
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,110
一切都很顺利...我...
Everything is going perfect... I just...

1051
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,750
好了  爸爸需要飚几句话
Okay! Daddy's going to use some words.

1052
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,420
不如我们去嘉年华玩吧
How about we go to the carnival?

1053
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:01,450
或者在镇子上的商店里转转
Or maybe check out some of those shops in town?

1054
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,470
你干什么了
What did you do?

1055
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:05,920
我们哪都去不了了
We're not going anywhere.

1056
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,430
如果你们懂我的意思[尖]If you get my point.

1057
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:08,890
-太棒了  -天才
- Brilliant! - That was genius!

1058
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:09,970
干得漂亮  杰西
Nice work, Jessie!

1059
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,630
巴斯和胡迪一定已经在回来的路上了
I'm sure Buzz and Woody are on their way back right now.

1060
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:18,760
叉叉在那里吗
Forky is in there?

1061
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,470
对
Yeah.

1062
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:20,890
等等  我有个问题
Now, hold on. I have a question.

1063
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:23,860
邦妮会更喜欢谁  小鸭还是我  说我
Who will Bonnie love more? Ducky or me. Say me.

1064
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,280
-不  说小鸭  小鸭  -小兔  小兔
- No, say Ducky. Ducky. - Bunny. Bunny.

1065
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,570
好了伙计们  胡闹的时间结束了
Okay, guys. Playtime is over.

1066
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,020
你们都要听我指挥
You have to follow my lead.

1067
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,080
我们待在一起  保持安静  听懂了吗
We stay together, we stay quiet. Are we clear?

1068
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,530
懂了  带路吧
Absolutely. Lead the way.

1069
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:55,730
-逗我呢吧  -过去点
- Are you kidding me. - Move over.

1070
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:57,270
-你过去点  -别推我了
- You move over. - Quit pushing me.

1071
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:57,930
别闹了
Stop.

1072
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,910
我的老天  这只羊有三个头
Oh, my maker! That sheep has three heads!

1073
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:01,530
不不不
No, no, no!

1074
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:04,200
这六只小眼睛看穿了我的灵魂
What all six eyes just looked into my soul.

1075
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,580
要做噩梦了
Gonna have nightmares.

1076
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,380
你的叉叉应该就是被关在那里了
That's most likely where your Forky is being kept.

1077
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,050
好吧  还不算太糟
All right, this isn't so bad.

1078
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:17,090
只要避免被那些假人看到就行
We just can't be seen by the dummies.

1079
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,470
不光是那些假人
Not just the dummies.

1080
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:22,180
她的橱柜被毫无遮拦的过道环绕
Her cabinet is surrounded by a moat of exposed aisle.

1081
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,310
还有恶龙出没
Where Dragon roams.

1082
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:26,770
-猫我们能应付  -不
- We can handle a cat. - No.

1083
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:27,890
不是这只
Not this one.

1084
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,780
我们的体内就是那样的吗
Is that how we look on the inside?

1085
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:36,820
有好多...绒毛
There's so much... fluff.

1086
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,320
那你觉得我们应该怎么过去
So, how do you propose we get up there?

1087
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,610
我们可以直接穿过去
We could go straight across.

1088
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,370
-怎么做  -这要跳好远
- How. - That's quite a jump.

1089
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:44,700
我们认识最合适的玩具帮手
We know the perfect toy to help.

1090
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:45,740
邦妮  快来看
Bonnie, check it out.

1091
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,830
-看看这些好玩的东西  -邦妮
- Look at all this cool stuff. - Bonnie?

1092
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,420
我们要立刻找到叉叉
We got to get Forky now!

1093
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:50,370
胡迪  别...
Woody, don't...

1094
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,130
-按计划执行  -收到
- Stick to the plan. - 10-4.

1095
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,670
-跟我来  -收到
- Follow me. - Roger that.

1096
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,760
胡迪只能待在壁橱里  没机会玩耍吗
Woody just sits in the closet? With no playtime?

1097
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,140
对  他自己告诉我的  他没用了
Yeah, he told me himself, he's useless.

1098
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,180
太可怜了
That's awful.

1099
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:07,060
头发真好看
Such pretty hair...

1100
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:08,680
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1101
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,770
你得按计划行事
You need to stick to the plan.

1102
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:11,520
但那可是邦妮  她就在...
But it's Bonnie. She's right...

1103
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,310
我们能接着去嘉年华吗
Can we go to the carnival, too?

1104
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,020
那儿
There.

1105
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,480
走吧  不要出声
Come on. Stay quiet.

1106
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,490
你最好祈祷那些假人没有...
You better hope the dummies didn't...

1107
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,900
我的羊
My sheep!

1108
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,530
我怎么说得来着  我带路  你跟着
What did I say? I lead. You follow.

1109
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,240
宝贝  我十分抱歉
Bo, I'm so sorry. Really.

1110
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,370
快告诉我该怎么帮你
Just tell me how to help.

1111
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:11,210
你真的想要帮忙吗
You really wanna help?

1112
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:14,170
别挡着我的路  我要把羊找回来
Then stay out of my way. I'm getting my sheep back.

1113
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,080
那其他人呢
What about the others?

1114
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,750
笑笑知道该怎么做
Giggle knows what to do.

1115
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:22,050
-你看  -那就是我们的目标
- Here you go. - That's our objective.

1116
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:23,590
我们必须拿到那把钥匙
We have to get that key.

1117
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:25,430
这是进入橱柜唯一的办法
It's the only way inside the cabinet.

1118
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:26,890
你没开玩笑吧
You can't be serious.

1119
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:28,560
我们怎么可能做得到
How are we supposed to do that?

1120
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,470
行吧
Okay.

1121
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:30,930
你知道吗  交给我们吧
You know what, leave that to us.

1122
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:32,770
我们很清楚该怎么做
We know exactly what to do.

1123
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,230
你们两个是从哪来的
Where did you two come from?

1124
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,320
钥匙  快给我们  放在哪了
The keys! Give 'em up now! Where are they?

1125
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,610
把钥匙给我们  把钥匙给我们
Give us the keys! Give us the keys!

1126
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:43,700
这个...不能这么办
Well, we're not doing that.

1127
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,030
对  我也同意  太显眼了
Yeah, yeah, I agree, too visible.

1128
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:46,820
你的观点不错  想个妙一点的
It's a good point. Something more subtle.

1129
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,370
不如就用"大吉大利  今晚吃鸡"
What about "winner, winner, chicken dinner"?

1130
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:49,290
好
Yes.

1131
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:57,540
钥匙  快给我们  放在哪了
The keys! Give 'em up now! Where are they?

1132
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:00,050
-开玩笑呢吧  -不是吧
- You're kidding. - Really?

1133
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,710
行吧  行吧  你真是
Okay, okay. You just...

1134
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:03,010
行吧  那个
All right. Well...

1135
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:05,130
不如用那个老方法  "毛绒突袭"
What about the old "Plush Rush"?

1136
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:06,260
就这么办
There you go!

1137
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:21,780
-扯到哪去了  -别打岔
- Where is this going? - Don't interrupt.

1138
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,790
还行  对吧
Okay, right?

1139
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:40,040
不可能  不...行
Not gonna happen. N-O.

1140
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,210
行吧  你到底想不想要钥匙
Okay, do you want the key or not?

1141
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,090
你们到底什么毛病
What is wrong with you?

1142
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:43,880
我们有什么...
What is wrong with...?

1143
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,300
我们刚刚提了三个绝妙的点子
We just gave you three brilliant ideas.

1144
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,590
拒绝是一回事
It's one thing to say no.

1145
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,340
说出原因又是另一回事
It's another to offer a reason...

1146
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:51,310
我们怎样才能拿到那把钥匙
How do we get that key?

1147
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,600
没开玩笑吧
You're kidding!

1148
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:00,520
真的吗
Really?

1149
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,770
胡迪回来了
Woody's back?

1150
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:02,690
胡迪回来了
Woody's back?

1151
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:04,650
你确定牧羊女宝贝和他一起来的
And you're sure it's Bo Peep who's with him?

1152
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,530
谢谢你  本森
Thank you, Benson.

1153
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,200
去让其他人准备好
Make sure the others are ready.

1154
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:11,870
胡迪回来了
Woody's back!

1155
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:13,740
我来了  邦妮
I'm coming, Bonnie!

1156
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:15,830
邦妮
Bonnie.

1157
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:18,120
首先  我们要为他的到来做好准备
First, we must prepare for his arrival.

1158
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:18,710
准备
Prepare?

1159
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:20,670
你玩过捉迷藏吗
Have you ever played hide-and-seek?

1160
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:23,170
没有  但是听起来很复杂
No. But it sounds complicated.

1161
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:23,840
很简单
It's easy.

1162
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,590
-我来教你好吗  -好
- I'll teach you, okay? - Okay.

1163
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:27,340
第一件事就是
The first thing you do is...

1164
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,970
-我们其中一人找地方藏起来  -吓人
- one of us finds a place to hide... - Scary.

1165
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:31,260
另一个人...
the other one...

1166
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,620
我们在做什么
What are we doing.

1167
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:56,580
你就站在那边别出声
Just stand there and be quiet!

1168
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,500
我来负责讲话
I'll do the talking.

1169
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:05,670
你好  锡兵
Hi, Tinny!

1170
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,130
我也很高兴见到你
Nice to see you, too.

1171
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,470
对  他和我一起的
Yeah, he's with me.

1172
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:12,340
我的朋友  不不不
My friend? No, no, no.

1173
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,890
他是我的随从
He's my accessory.

1174
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,390
-你们好啊  -宝贝
- Hey, guys. - Bo!

1175
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:18,270
好久不见
Long time no see.

1176
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:20,020
受不了外面的世界吧
Couldn't take it out there, huh?

1177
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,600
道格  我看到你的半身
Hey, Doug. Saw your better half

1178
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,690
躺在店前面了
at the front of the store.

1179
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:24,900
和猫瞎闹  只能挨挠
Yeah, you mess with the cat, you get the claws.

1180
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:25,940
宝贝回来了
Bo came back!

1181
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,280
魔力八号球说得对
Magic 8-Ball was right!

1182
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,490
-借过  抱歉  -你怎么在这
- Excuse me. Sorry. - What are you doing here?

1183
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:31,820
这家店应该不提供退货服务吧
I thought the store had no return policy!

1184
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,950
宝贝帮帮我
Bo, help me out.

1185
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:34,370
我需要电池
I need a battery.

1186
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:37,370
我们得让车队行动起来
We got to get this wagon train a-movin'!

1187
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:38,870
-同意  -帮我  帮我  帮我
- Agreed. - Help, help, help.

1188
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:39,830
作弊
Cheater.

1189
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,080
你见到公爵了吗
Have you seen Duke?

1190
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,710
他在后面
He's in the back.

1191
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,470
看看这是谁跳了四十回校车
Look who jumped 40 school buses

1192
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:54,180
又落回了我的生活里
and landed back into my life.

1193
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,220
-你好  公爵  -这个牛仔是哪位
- Hi, Duke! - Who's the cowboy?

1194
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,350
公爵  这位是胡迪  胡迪  这位是...
Duke, meet Woody. Woody, meet...

1195
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:01,190
咔嘣公爵  加拿大最出色的特技演员
Duke Caboom. Canada's greatest stuntman.

1196
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:02,690
没错
Oh, yeah!

1197
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,480
他在摆造型
He's posing.

1198
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,480
公爵
Duke?

1199
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:10,610
-公爵  我们需要...  -等等  还有一个
- Duke, we need to... - Hold on. One more.

1200
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:13,360
对了  你怎么回来了  牧羊女
Yeah! What brings you back, Peep?

1201
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,410
我们需要你的帮助
We need your help.

1202
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:17,700
嘉比嘉比抓走了他的玩具还有我的羊
Gabby Gabby has his toy and my sheep.

1203
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,790
不会吧  比利  小羊  怪叫
No. Billy, Goat, and Gruff?

1204
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,330
她们可是我的好姑娘
Those are my girls.

1205
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,830
你怎么和嘉比嘉比搅和到一起了
What were you doing getting tangled up with Gabby Gabby?

1206
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:24,500
你可是个明白人
You know better.

1207
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,040
对  某些玩具觉得大摇大摆走上过道
Yeah, some toy thought it would be a good idea...

1208
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,340
是个好主意
to wander into the aisle.

1209
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:29,840
完全讲不通啊
That doesn't make any sense.

1210
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,880
讲不通  对吧
It doesn't, does it?

1211
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,550
所有人都知道最佳路线在橱柜后面
Everybody knows the best route is behind the shelves.

1212
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:36,220
那本应该是更好的路线  对吧
That would have been a better route, wouldn't it?

1213
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,850
这个玩具听起来就是个彻头彻尾的白痴
This toy sounds like a complete idiot.

1214
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:39,600
就是
He does!

1215
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,770
等等  你就是那个玩具吗
Wait, are you that toy?

1216
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:43,390
计划如下
So, here's the plan.

1217
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:46,100
我们需要跳过过道进入嘉比的橱柜
We need to jump over the aisle to Gabby's cabinet.

1218
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:49,070
-就由你这个玩具来完成  -不行
- And you are the toy to do it. - No.

1219
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:49,980
-公爵  -不行
- Duke. - Nope.

1220
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:50,860
-公爵  -决不
- Duke. - Never.

1221
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:51,570
-公爵  -没门
- Duke. - No way.

1222
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:52,280
-公爵  -不干
- Duke. - Pass.

1223
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,030
-公爵  -拒绝
- Duke. - Negative.

1224
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:54,280
-公爵  -反对
- Duke. - Rejected.

1225
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,530
求你了  咔嘣先生  这真的很重要
Please, Mr. Caboom, this is really important.

1226
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:57,530
我的孩子...
My kid...

1227
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,990
你有孩子
You have a kid?

1228
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:03,120
公爵  再给我们摆几个造型吧  你觉得怎么样
Hey, Duke, show us some more poses, what do you say?

1229
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,210
-我也有过孩子  -不要啊
- I had a kid. - Oh, no.

1230
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:06,210
雷加
Rejean.

1231
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,090
圣诞节后得到我的时候  雷加可开心了
Rejean was so excited when he got me after Christmas.

1232
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,670
那是我一生中最快乐的节礼日
It was the happiest Boxing Day of my life.

1233
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:15,840
这是咔嘣公爵
That's Duke Caboom,

1234
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,470
骑着酷炫的咔嘣特技摩托
riding the amazing Caboom stunt cycle!

1235
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:19,760
咔嘣
Caboom!

1236
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,430
我终于准备要做命中注定要做的事了
I was ready to finally do what I was made to do.

1237
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:25,270
咔嘣
Caboom!

1238
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:27,150
但是等雷加意识到
But when Rejean realized I couldn't jump

1239
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:29,230
我不能跳得像广告里的玩具一样远...
as far as the toy in the commercial...

1240
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:33,150
那是广告  那不是真的
It's a commercial! It's not real!

1241
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:34,780
雷加把我丢弃了
Rejean threw me away!

1242
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,110
这不公平
It's not fair!

1243
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:38,030
为什么  雷加  为什么
Why, Rejean Why?

1244
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:43,040
好了好了  冷静下来  公爵
Okay, okay. Calm down, Duke.

1245
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,870
那已经是很久以前了
That was a long time ago.

1246
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,080
现在  我们需要独一无二的玩具
Right now, we need the only toy

1247
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,920
只有他能带我们撞进嘉比的橱柜
who can crash us onto Gabby's cabinet.

1248
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,630
撞进
Crash?

1249
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:51,460
撞进
Crash?

1250
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,800
随便哪个咔嘣公爵都能着陆
Any Duke Caboom toy can land...

1251
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,880
但只有你可以用独一无二的方式撞车
but you are the only one that can crash the way you do.

1252
00:57:57,890 --> 00:57:59,550
-是吗  -没错
- I am? - Yes!

1253
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:01,970
忘了雷加  忘了那个广告
Forget Rejean. Forget your commercial.

1254
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:04,350
坦然接受现在的自己
Be the Duke you are right now...

1255
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:07,940
跳跃撞车的公爵
the one who jumps and crashes!

1256
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:14,690
坦然接受现在的自己
Be who I am right now.

1257
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:17,990
谁是最好运的法裔加拿大佬
Who's the Canuck with all the luck?

1258
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:19,200
咔嘣
Caboom?

1259
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,450
谁是大白北最伟大的人
Who's the greatest of the Great White North?

1260
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:22,200
咔嘣
Caboom!

1261
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,870
谁是加拿大史上最伟大的冒险家
Who's the most spectacular daredevil Canada has ever seen?

1262
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,460
咔嘣公爵
Duke Caboom!

1263
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:28,920
你能做到这个跳跃吗
Can you do the jump?

1264
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,170
我能做到  加拿大
Yes, I Canada!

1265
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,340
我们找到进去的办法了
We've got our ride.

1266
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,180
咦嗬
Yee-haw!

1267
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,260
宝贝
Yo, Bo!

1268
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,260
笑笑  你们做到了
Gigs! You made it!

1269
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:43,890
干得好
Good work!

1270
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:45,350
你们是怎么拿到的
How'd you get it?

1271
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,560
我们怎样才能拿到那把钥匙
How do we get that key?

1272
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,860
-很艰难  -非常困难
- It was hard. - Very difficult.

1273
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,440
-我们差点就逃不出来了  -没错
- Barely made it out alive. - Yeah.

1274
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,610
所以  不用谢
So, you're welcome.

1275
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,030
好了  我们开始吧
Okay. Let's do this.

1276
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,120
我来帮你把这个包起来
Let me wrap that up for you.

1277
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,950
可不想在回家的路上搞坏了
Don't want anything to happen to it on the way home.

1278
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:07,290
很好  有人买东西  会给我们争取点时间
Good. That sale buys us some time.

1279
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,540
等一下
Wait for it.

1280
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,170
好了  我们走
All right, let's go!

1281
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:19,930
{\an8}电影票

1282
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:44,780
{\an8}咔嘣公爵

1283
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:57,170
那个  你在这里待了多久
So, how long were you in here?

1284
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:59,050
不知道  几年吧
I don't know. Couple years.

1285
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:02,090
我不想一直待在架子上  等着生活发生变化
I didn't wanna sit on a shelf waiting for my life to happen.

1286
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:03,970
所以我离开了
So, I left.

1287
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,720
你远比我更会应对丢失的玩具的生活
You've handled this lost toy life better than I could.

1288
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,220
警长
Sheriff.

1289
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,140
你这是妄自菲薄
You're selling yourself short.

1290
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,560
我觉得你这个丢失的玩具做得很好了
I think you'd make a great lost toy.

1291
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,650
{\an8}{\pos(328.114,3.2)}月球原子爆米花

1292
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:17,780
你真的觉得
You really don't think

1293
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,110
你不会再找一个孩子了吗
you'll ever be in a kid's room again, huh?

1294
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:20,860
没错
Nope.

1295
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:22,400
而现在嘉年华要离开这里了
And now with the carnival traveling through,

1296
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,740
这是我们的机会  搭便车
it's our chance to hop a ride...

1297
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:26,120
-离开这个镇子  -你要走
- and leave town. - You're leaving?

1298
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:26,870
当然了
Sure am.

1299
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:29,330
你有没有想过出去见见世面
You ever think about getting out there, seeing the world?

1300
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:30,580
没有孩子在身边
Without a kid?

1301
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:34,290
没有  我这个老玩具没法接受新理念
No. You can't teach this old toy new tricks.

1302
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:36,000
别这么肯定
You'd be surprised.

1303
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:40,710
你是怎么到这家店里来的呢
So, how'd you end up in this store in the first place?

1304
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,220
我在展示窗看到了你的台灯
Well, I saw your lamp in the window...

1305
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:46,890
我想也许你在里面
and I thought maybe you were inside...

1306
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:48,850
所以我...
and so I, uh...

1307
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:58,270
看看这个
Will you look at that?

1308
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:02,360
这是这家店我唯一喜欢的部分
This is the only part of the store I ever liked.

1309
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:13,830
这次跳跃对你和公爵来说可不简单
That's gonna be quite a jump for you and Duke.

1310
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:16,460
我
For me?

1311
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,670
我没告诉你吗  你要跟他一起去
Didn't I tell you? You're going with him.

1312
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:23,670
是吗
I am?

1313
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:25,380
我们开始咔嘣吧
Let's caboom.

1314
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:27,260
没事的  公爵是最厉害的
It'll be fine, Duke's the best.

1315
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:29,220
是啊  撞车最厉害
Yeah, at crashing.

1316
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:34,430
就是现在
And now!

1317
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:37,480
上
Go!

1318
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:47,990
雷加
Rejean.

1319
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,830
那是广告  那不是真的
It's a commercial. It's not real!

1320
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:53,620
我做不到  对不起  雷加
I can't do this! I'm sorry, Rejean!

1321
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:56,290
不  不  不
No, no, no!

1322
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,420
近来可好  小猫咪
What's new, pussycat?

1323
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:17,980
-叉叉  -姑娘们
- Forky? - Girls?

1324
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:19,770
叉叉  你在哪
Forky, where are you?

1325
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:22,440
{\an8}嘉比嘉比
我们做朋友吧

1326
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,480
你是绝对找不到我的
You're never gonna find me.

1327
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,360
叉叉
Forky?

1328
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:25,940
胡迪  你是怎么找到我的
Woody! How'd you find me?

1329
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,950
-宝贝  我找到他了  -你好
- Bo, I found him! - Hi.

1330
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:30,660
等等  叉叉就是把叉子
Wait, it's an actual fork?

1331
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,410
宝贝  宝贝  宝贝
Bo! Bo! Bo!

1332
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:33,870
巴斯  那些假人不见了
Buzz! The dummies are gone!

1333
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:36,460
什么  他们去哪了
What? Where'd they go?

1334
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,000
好了  我们可以走了
Okay, we can go now!

1335
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,590
-不行  我得找到我的姑娘们  -你好  胡迪
- No. I need to find my girls. - Hello, Woody.

1336
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,790
你好  宝贝
Hi, Bo.

1337
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,090
-我的羊呢  -对啊
- Where are my sheep - Yeah!

1338
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:45,760
看  胡迪找到我了
Look! Woody found me!

1339
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,090
抓那只兔子  我这么可爱  我还不能死
Take the bunny! I'm too cute to die!

1340
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,180
不  不
No, no!

1341
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:53,220
胡迪
Woody!

1342
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,430
我只是想聊聊
I just wanna talk.

1343
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:56,600
是跟我的声匣聊吧
Yeah, with my voice box!

1344
01:02:57,770 --> 01:02:58,520
拉
Pull!

1345
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,980
你是我最爱的警官
You're my favorite deputy.

1346
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,360
有人给水池下毒了
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

1347
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,110
我想加入你们的队伍
I'd like to join your posse.

1348
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:11,070
举起手来
Reach for the sky!

1349
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,250
姑娘们
Girls!

1350
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:24,090
松嘴
Drop it.

1351
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,920
不要  叉叉
No! No! Forky!

1352
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:31,590
-我们得走了  -等等
- We've got to go! - Wait!

1353
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:33,800
叉叉
Forky!

1354
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:37,060
胡迪
Woody!

1355
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,820
邦妮的背包
Bonnie's backpack?

1356
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:00,000
笑笑
Giggle!

1357
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,540
别让胡迪离开
Don't let Woody leave!

1358
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:07,750
抓上
Grab on!

1359
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:14,010
公爵  带我们离开这里
Duke, get us out of here!

1360
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:14,760
好
Oui!

1361
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,640
这边  小猫咪
Here, kitty, kitty!

1362
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,600
等等  我们还没带上叉叉
Wait! We don't have Forky!

1363
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,140
胡迪
Woody!

1364
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,060
叉叉
Forky!

1365
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:46,630
大家都没事吧
Is everyone okay?

1366
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:54,300
-没事了  -没事了
- It's okay. - It's okay.

1367
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,760
小兔  小兔
Bunny? Bunny!

1368
01:04:57,430 --> 01:05:00,430
小兔  不要啊
Bunny! No, no, no, no.

1369
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:04,270
不  不  不
No, no, no, no.

1370
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:06,230
-小兔  -没事了
- Bunny! - It's gonna be okay.

1371
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:07,110
叉叉还在里面
Forky's still in there.

1372
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:07,560
如果我们抓紧
If we hurry,

1373
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,980
就可以在他们把他关起来前救他
we can get him before they lock him up.

1374
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,360
你想让我们再回去
You want us to go back in there?

1375
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,650
我们九死一生才逃出来
We barely got out alive.

1376
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:12,780
胡迪  我们最好等等
Woody, it's better if we wait.

1377
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:15,030
不行  没有时间了  我们很轻易就能回去
No, no, no. There's no time. We can easily get back inside.

1378
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:15,660
但是我看见了邦妮的...
But I saw Bonnie's...

1379
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:17,030
我数了一下  总共只有四个假人
By my count, there were only four dummies.

1380
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:17,370
但是背包...
But the backpack...

1381
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:19,200
他们寡不敌众  所以我们有优势
We outnumber them. So we have the advantage.

1382
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,160
胡迪  看看我们
Woody, look at us!

1383
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:26,500
没人赞成你  事情结束了  好吗
Nobody is with you. It's over, okay?

1384
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:29,170
不  不行  我们在浪费时间  我们能做到的
No. No, no, no. We are wasting time. We can do this.

1385
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:31,090
-拜托  拉绳布偶  -这不值得
- Come on, Pull-string. - It's not worth it.

1386
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:32,420
没错  听听她说的
Yeah, yes, listen to her!

1387
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:34,130
-没有人想这么做  -我想
- Nobody wants this! - I do!

1388
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,470
-为什么  -因为
- Why? - Because!

1389
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:37,220
-为什么  -就是因为
- Why? - Just because!

1390
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:37,800
到底为什么
Why?

1391
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,310
因为这是我唯一能做的了
Because it's all I have left to do!

1392
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,310
除此之外我一无所有
I don't have anything else.

1393
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,770
所以我们对你来说什么都不是吗
So, the rest of us don't count?

1394
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,440
我不是这个意思
That's not what I meant.

1395
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,860
邦妮需要叉叉
Bonnie needs Forky.

1396
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:54,240
不  是你需要邦妮
No. You need Bonnie!

1397
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:55,820
睁大眼睛看看  胡迪
Open your eyes, Woody.

1398
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:57,820
这世上有那么多孩子
There's plenty of kids out there.

1399
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:01,660
你为什么非要抓住这个不放
It can't be just about the one you're still clinging to.

1400
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:03,870
这叫忠诚
It's called loyalty.

1401
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,670
丢失的玩具是不能理解的
Something a lost toy wouldn't understand.

1402
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,170
丢失的玩具不是我
I'm not the one who's lost.

1403
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,930
我们离开这里吧
Let's get out of here.

1404
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:21,430
我们得赶紧回到明天早上就要出发的嘉年华
We've got a carnival that leaves in the morning.

1405
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:22,510
走吧
Come on.

1406
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:25,850
我们会找到自己的孩子的
We'll find our own kid.

1407
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:26,890
你真是疯了
You're crazy.

1408
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,270
宝贝
Bo!

1409
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:34,440
再见胡迪  祝你回到邦妮身边
Bye, Woody. Good luck with Bonnie.

1410
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,030
胡迪  能做的你都做了
Woody, you did all you could.

1411
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:44,870
该回家了
Time to go home.

1412
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:46,410
不
No.

1413
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,540
-胡迪  -我不会把玩具丢下的  巴斯
- Woody. - I don't leave toys behind, Buzz.

1414
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:50,540
是的  但是胡迪  事实上...
Yeah, but, Woody, you're actually leaving...

1415
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,750
现在不会  以后也不会
Not now. Not ever.

1416
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:56,380
然后他把我丢下了
And he left me behind.

1417
01:06:57,590 --> 01:06:59,010
现在怎么办  内心的声音
What now, inner voice?

1418
01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:00,930
任务已完成  返回基地
Mission accomplished. Return to base.

1419
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:03,350
回房车  那胡迪怎么办
Go back to the RV? What about Woody?

1420
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:05,180
我们要回家了  太空游侠
We're going home, space ranger.

1421
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:06,310
退后  这个星球...
Fall back, this planet...

1422
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:07,430
撤退  有太多...
Retreat! There's too...

1423
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:09,810
快走  该起飞了  离开  后退  跑
Go! Time to fly! Exit the... Back... Run...

1424
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:11,560
出去  返回星际总部
Get out! Returning to Star Command.

1425
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,940
好  好
Okay. Okay.

1426
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:17,570
非常感谢  内心的声音
Thanks a lot, inner voice.

1427
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:22,280
哈莫妮  亲爱的  帮外婆关门打烊吧
Harmony, honey, help Grandma close up for the night.

1428
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:25,410
好  然后我们能去嘉年华吗
Okay. Then can we go to the carnival?

1429
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:26,200
可以
Sure.

1430
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:33,250
你好  胡迪
Hello, Woody.

1431
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,050
我就知道你会回来
I knew you'd be back.

1432
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:38,590
你不了解我
You don't know me.

1433
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:39,970
我确实了解
But I do.

1434
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:44,100
你被留在壁橱里  感觉自己毫无用处
You were left in the closet, feeling useless...

1435
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:46,260
怀疑自己还会不会被孩子玩
wondering if you'll ever get played with.

1436
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,310
没有叉叉我是不会走的
I'm not leaving without Forky.

1437
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:50,770
我们能就在一件事上达成共识吗
Can we agree on just one thing?

1438
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:51,890
什么
What?

1439
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,020
陪伴一个孩子
That being there for a child

1440
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:57,110
是玩具能做的最高尚的事
is the most noble thing a toy can do.

1441
01:07:59,070 --> 01:07:59,900
好的
Okay.

1442
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:05,660
我一拆封就有缺陷
I was defective right out of the box.

1443
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:09,580
我只能想象你这样是什么感觉
I can only imagine what it must have been like for you.

1444
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:13,080
你陪伴安迪那么长时间
All that time you spent with Andy...

1445
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,750
第一次和他一起骑自行车
riding a bike with him for the first time...

1446
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,800
他膝盖擦伤时安慰他
comforting him when he skinned his knee...

1447
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,180
骄傲地看他长大
proudly watching him grow up.

1448
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:28,010
然后你又和邦妮有了第二次机会
And then you got a second chance with Bonnie...

1449
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:31,310
当她在学校害怕时给她安慰
giving her comfort when she's scared at school...

1450
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:34,150
在她最需要的时候帮助她
helping her when she needs it most.

1451
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:38,070
他们的悲喜你一直陪伴
You've been there through all their ups and downs.

1452
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,280
拜托
Please.

1453
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:43,410
跟我说实话
Be honest with me.

1454
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,870
真的像听起来那么棒吗
Was it as wonderful as it sounds?

1455
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:52,870
是的
It was.

1456
01:08:56,710 --> 01:09:00,590
我想要的只是其中一个片段
All I want is a chance for just one of those moments.

1457
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:07,010
我愿意付出一切  只求像你那样被爱
I'd give anything to be loved the way you have.

1458
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,890
把叉叉给我
Just leave me Forky.

1459
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:17,610
邦妮需要他
Bonnie needs him.

1460
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:20,570
当然
Of course.

1461
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:31,200
{\an8}大盆地

1462
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,910
爆胎修好了
The flat tire is fixed!

1463
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,250
快啊  胡迪  快点
Come on, Woody, hurry up.

1464
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,540
他在哪
Where is he?

1465
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,300
-巴斯  -巴斯
- Buzz! - Buzz!

1466
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:42,840
-胡迪在哪  -还有叉叉
- Where's Woody? - And Forky?

1467
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:43,800
出事了
We have a situation.

1468
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,800
我们要帮他们从古董店撤离
They need to be extracted from the antique store.

1469
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,050
我们该怎么做
How do we do that?

1470
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:49,390
好了  确保我们没落下什么
Okay, let's make sure we have everything.

1471
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:50,390
终于要走了
Finally.

1472
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:51,560
没事的
It's okay.

1473
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,600
邦妮随时会发现她的背包不见了
Any minute now... Bonnie will notice her backpack is missing.

1474
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,730
她会意识到她把背包落在了古董店
She'll realize she left it at the antique store...

1475
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:58,730
然后我们就会回去
and we'll head back in there.

1476
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:00,360
好了  看起来没忘什么
Okay. Looks like we have everything.

1477
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,070
-你的东西都在吗  邦妮  -是的
- You good, Bonnie? - Yup.

1478
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:03,690
很好  我们走吧
Great. Let's get out of here.

1479
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:06,820
好吧  天才  现在怎么办
Okay, genius, what do we do now?

1480
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:08,820
搜查周边
Scanning perimeter.

1481
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:09,740
最大强度激光
Laser at full power!

1482
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:12,080
-巴斯  你在干什么  -我在思考
- Buzz, what are you doing? - I'm thinking.

1483
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,870
亲爱的  你能把那个玩具的声音关掉吗
Honey, will you please shut that toy off?

1484
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:14,950
好  我来弄
Yeah, I got it.

1485
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,960
攻击  流星雨  小心
Attack! Meteor shower! Look out!

1486
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,790
这是在未知领域执行的秘密任务
It's a secret mission in uncharted space!

1487
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:19,670
出发
Let's go!

1488
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:21,800
巴斯光年前来救援
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

1489
01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:24,460
-邦妮  怎么把这个关掉  -全速向前
- Bonnie, how do you turn this off? - Full speed ahead!

1490
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:26,090

- Open the pod bay doors! - I don't know.

1491
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:28,130
只剩你和我了  学员
It's just you and me now, cadet.

1492
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,180
那个火箭发射了求救信号
A distress signal is coming from that rocket.

1493
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:30,850
扔进柜子就行了
Just toss it in the drawer.

1494
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:34,270
飞向宇宙  浩瀚无垠
To infinity and beyond!

1495
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,770
你的背包在古董店  出发
Your backpack's in the antique store! Let's go!

1496
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:38,440
不好  我的背包
Oh, no, my backpack!

1497
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:41,610
我把背包落在古董店了
I left my backpack in the antique store!

1498
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:42,320
是吗
You did?

1499
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,820
好吧  我们绕道去拿
All right, let's swing by and get it.

1500
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:53,530
那个牛仔居然这么不要脸
I can't believe the nerve of that cowboy.

1501
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:55,410
他以为他是谁
I mean, who does he think he is?

1502
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:56,330
就是
Exactly!

1503
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:58,160
他太过分了
He was way out of line.

1504
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:00,290
你扔下他是正确的决定
You did the right thing leaving him behind.

1505
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:02,710
羊排
Lamb Chops?

1506
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,300
路上安全了
Coast is clear.

1507
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,180
往中心走
Head to the middle.

1508
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:12,470
等明天嘉年华离开的时候
When the carnival leaves tomorrow,

1509
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:14,060
我们就藏在那里
we'll hide right there.

1510
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,890
-没门  -拒绝
- No way! - Stuff that.

1511
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:18,560
真棒
Awesome.

1512
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,060
跟紧我  你们会没事的
Stick with me. You'll be fine.

1513
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:20,850
-准备好了吗  -没有
- Ready? - No!

1514
01:11:20,850 --> 01:11:21,770
我还没说完
And another thing,

1515
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:23,650
-胡迪请求你的帮助  -各就各位
- Woody asked you for help. - On your mark...

1516
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:24,860
然后就那样对待你吗
And he treats you like that?

1517
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:27,190
-预备  -他只关心自己
- Get set... - He only cares about himself.

1518
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:28,110
不
No!

1519
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,110
你错了
You're wrong.

1520
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:31,280
胡迪总是努力做对孩子有利的事
Woody's always trying to do right by his kid.

1521
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,240
把其他人都置于危险中
By putting everyone in danger.

1522
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:35,490
那种疯狂的忠诚真是...
That kind of crazy loyalty just...

1523
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:37,500
让人不得不爱
You got to love him for it.

1524
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,580
你说什么
Say what now?

1525
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:40,960
宝贝  计划是什么
Bo! What's the plan?

1526
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,250
跟我说说
Fill me in here.

1527
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,260
上来  我们要回去了
Get in! We're going back.

1528
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:50,300
我们才刚到这里
We just got here.

1529
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,130
你们听到宝贝的话了  我们要回去
You heard Bo! We're going back!

1530
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,350
绒毛快进来  开车
Move your plush! Let's ride!

1531
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:03,400

1535
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:24,380

Benson! Did you hear that?

1536
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:25,790
是不是很可爱
Isn't that lovely?

1537
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,130
下午茶时间到
Time for tea.

1538
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:29,510
谢谢你  胡迪  谢谢你

1539

It's time, Benson.

1543
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:40,600
再见  叉叉  我会想念和你聊天的
Goodbye, Forky. I'm going to miss our talks.

1544
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,270
我也是  祝你好运  嘉比
Me, too. Good luck, Gabby.

1545

Bye, Gabby! Goodbye, Benson!

1547
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:52,320

He is terrifying.

1548
01:12:53,530 --> 01:12:55,200
-你好  -你好

1549
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,740
-邦妮  -有什么需要帮助的吗

1550
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,580
是的  我们刚刚打过电话问背包
Yeah. We called about the backpack.

1551
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:01,080
是的  我没找到
Yes. I couldn't find it.

1552
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,000
你们可以自己找找
Feel free to look around.

1553
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,500
快  在她发现前进去
Quick! Before she finds it!

1554
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,500
瞧  哈莫妮在那儿
Look! There's Harmony.

1555
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:13,920
你让我如此开心
You make me so happy!

1556
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:15,550
我们做最好的朋友吧
Let's be best friends.

1557
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:17,720
要来了
This is it!

1558
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,180
我们要回家了  叉叉
We're going home, Forky!

1559
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:23,060
叉叉
Forky!

1560
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,730
不不不  胡迪  瞧  真的发生了
No, no, no. Woody, look! It's really happening!

1561
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:36,450
我是嘉比嘉比  我爱你
I'm Gabby Gabby, and I love you.

1562
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,780
我要哭出来了
I'm gonna cry.

1563
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:44,910
你发现了什么
What have you got there?

1564
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,210
我发现了这个旧娃娃
I found this old doll.

1565
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:49,920
如果你想要可以带回家
You can take it home if you want.

1566
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:52,630
算了
Nah.

1567
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:03,180
怎么回事  嘉比本该是她的玩具
What happened? Gabby was supposed to be her toy.

1568
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,680
我的背包在那里
There's my backpack!

1569
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:06,390
妈妈  在这边
Mom, it's over here.

1570
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:12,530
叉叉
Forky!

1571
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:14,150
妈妈  我找到他了
Mom, I found him!

1572
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:15,900
他在这里啊
There he is!

1573
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:17,320
先把他放进去
Now, please leave him in there,

1574
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,070
免得再弄丢了
so he doesn't get lost again.

1575
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,540
可是嘉比怎么办
But what about Gabby?

1576
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:30,840
叉叉  仔细听我说
Forky, listen to me very carefully.

1577
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,000
这很重要
This is important.

1578
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,880
告诉巴斯把房车带到旋转木马那里
Tell Buzz to get the RV to the merry-go-round.

1579
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:35,670
明白吗
You understand?

1580
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:38,510
明白  旋转木马是什么
Absolutely. What is a merry-go-round?

1581
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:41,050
那个有灯有马的旋转圆盘
The spinny ride with lights and horses.

1582
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:42,640
-你是说旋转木马啊  -没错
- You mean a carousel. - Yes!

1583
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:44,850
旋转木马  没错  在旋转木马那里等我
Carousel. Yes! Meet me at the carousel.

1584
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:45,640
明白
Got it.

1585
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,650
{\an8}抱歉  我们打烊了

1586
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:01,740
嘉比  嘉比
Gabby! Gabby!

1587
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:04,630
你可以把声匣拿回去了
You can have your voice box back.

1588
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:07,970
我不需要它了
I don't need it anymore.

1589
01:15:08,110 --> 01:15:09,020
你当然需要
Yes, you do.

1590
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:11,190
哈莫妮不是你的唯一机会  嘉比
Harmony wasn't your only chance, Gabby,

1591
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:12,510
不过我们必须抓紧时间  快走
but we have to hurry. Come on.

1592
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:16,130
不  哈莫妮就是我的机会
No. Harmony was my chance.

1593
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:18,030
我的时间结束了
My time's over.

1594
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:20,310
请你离开
Now, please go away.

1595
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:33,780
你听到了吗
You hear that?

1596
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,290
有个朋友曾告诉我
A friend once told me...

1597
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:44,750
"这世上有那么多孩子"
"There are plenty of kids out there."

1598
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:48,800
其中一个叫邦妮
And one of them is named Bonnie.

1599
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:53,320
她现在正在等你
She's waiting for you, right now.

1600
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:56,460
只是她还不知道
She just doesn't know it yet.

1601
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:00,540
万一你错了呢
What if you're wrong?

1602
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:04,960
如果你下半生都待在架子上
Well, if you sit on a shelf the rest of your life...

1603
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,090
你永远也不会知道  不是吗
you'll never find out, will you?

1604
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:11,620
他说得对
He's right.

1605
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,630
最厉害的玩具教给我的
I learned that from the best.

1606
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:19,980
走吧  嘉比
Come on, Gabby.

1607
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:22,610
我们带你去找邦妮
Let's get you to Bonnie.

1608
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:30,500
旋转木马
The carousel?

1609
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,330
没错  就是那个有灯有马的旋转圆盘
Yeah, it's the spinny ride with lights and horses.

1610
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:35,200
胡迪说在那里等他
Woody said to meet him there.

1611
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,000
-你肯定是在开玩笑  -我们怎么做
- You got to be kidding! - How do we do that?

1612
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:37,910
我们可以...
We could...

1613
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:39,480
我们不能把爸爸送去坐牢
We are not sending Dad to jail.

1614
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,730
你真没劲
You're no fun.

1615
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:43,810
八百米后左转
Left turn in 0.5 miles.

1616
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:46,510
等一下  我有个主意
Wait a second. I have an idea.

1617
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:58,520
臭鼬
Skunk!

1618
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:13,040
人太多了  需要换一条路
Too many people. Gonna need an alternate route.

1619
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,150
我们能及时赶到旋转木马吗
Will we make it to the carousel in time?

1620
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:20,870
我们能行  加拿大
Yes, we Canada!

1621
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,580
什么  怎么了
What? What is it?

1622
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:31,850
重新规划路线  右转
Recalculating. Take a right.

1623
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:33,240
什么  右转
What? A right?

1624
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:35,140
前方右转
Right turn ahead.

1625
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,920
GPS听起来是不是有点奇怪
Does the GPS sound funny to you?

1626
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,860
亲爱的  没事的  开车吧
Honey, it's fine. Just drive.

1627
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:40,390
我觉得挺起来挺奇怪的
I thought it sounded funny.

1628
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:44,650
接着右转
Another right!

1629
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:47,170
-右转  -接着右转
- Right. - Take another right.

1630
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:48,590
接着右转  不是吧
Another right, really?

1631
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:49,760
-右转  -快

1632

01:17:53,070 --> 01:17:55,450
-我们绕回去了  -旋转木马在那边
- We're headin' back. - There's the carousel!

1634
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:57,620
你们觉得胡迪能及时赶到吗
Do you think Woody will get there in time?

1635
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:00,680
不行  没门  决不  不干  拒绝
Nope. Forget it. Never. No. No way. Declined.

1636
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,440
-没戏  反对  -公爵  公爵  你能行的
- No dice. Rejected. - Duke, Duke, you got this.

1637
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,310
这是去旋转木马最快的方法
This is the fastest way to the carousel.

1638
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:05,660
上次你就跳成功了
You made the last jump.

1639
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:07,910
但上次是一米二  这次是十二米
Yeah, but that was 4 feet. This is 40!

1640
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:11,330
没错  咔嘣公爵绝不走回头路
Exactly! Duke Caboom would never repeat a stunt.

1641
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,250
-对  绝不走回头路  -没错  没错
- No. He'd never do that. - No, no, no.

1642
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:16,230
他就是那个玩具  飞跃十二米
He's the toy that went on to crash 40 feet

1643
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:19,000
{\an8}星球探险家

1644
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:18,140
一头撞进目标
into that target!

1645
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,330
对  是啊
Yeah, he is.

1646
01:18:20,710 --> 01:18:22,060
我是咔嘣公爵
I'm Duke Caboom!

1647
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:24,180

我闭着眼就都能做到
I can do it with my eyes closed.

1650
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:27,810
你能做到...什么

1652
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:37,330
-他在干什么  -不要啊
- What is he doing? - Oh, no.

1653
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:50,080
这是献给你的  雷加
This is for you, Rejean.

1654
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:51,220
{\an8}星球探险家

1655
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,620

He did it!

1658
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:03,700
好了  该我们了
All right, our turn!

1659
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:05,500
你们听到警长说的了  我们走
You heard the sheriff. Let's go.

1660
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:17,280
接着右转
Another right!

1661
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:19,120
接着右转  方向不对啊
Another right? That's the wrong way.

1662
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,050
-你确定吗  -租来的破车
- Are you sure? - Stupid rental.

1663
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:22,510
-我要掉头了  -不行
- I'm turning us around. - No!

1664
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:24,060
重新规划路线
Recalculating.

1665
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:25,260
右转
Turn right.

1666
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,940
-肯定是坏了  -不  不
- Must be broken. - No! No!

1667
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:33,360
怎么回事
What is happening?

1668
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,430
亲爱的  你在干什么  慢点
Honey, what are you doing? Slow down!

1669
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,710
我做不到  做不到
I can't! I can't!

1670
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:37,500
-踩刹车  -我在踩
- Press the brake. - I'm trying.

1671
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,200
快踩刹车
Press it!

1672
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:47,250
看到房车了  往南去了
Got a visual on the RV, heading southbound.

1673
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:54,790
嘉比

1674
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:58,110
嘉比
Gabby?

1675
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:03,930

你确定吗
Are you sure?

1677
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:32,720
计划有变
Change of plans.

1678
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:39,760
靠边停车
Pull over.

1679
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:42,290
我做不到  这车是租来的
I can't! This is a rental!

1680
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:44,030
我不明白是怎么回事

1681
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,020
我好紧张
I'm so nervous.

1682
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:58,560
-要是她不喜欢我怎么办  -嘉比
- What if she doesn't like me? - Gabby.

1683

我不确定能不能做到
I don't know if I can do this.

1684
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:02,720
嘉比  就像你说的
Gabby, it's just like you said.

1685
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:06,360
这是一个玩具能做的最高尚的事
This is the most noble thing a toy can do.

1686
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:15,120
好了  稍微往灯光那边挪挪
Okay. Just edge yourself a bit into the light.

1687
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:19,310
别靠太近
Not too far.

1688
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:20,730
就这样
That's it.

1689
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:23,580
好极了
Perfect.

1690
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,110
大吉大利  今晚吃鸡
Winner, winner... Chicken dinner.

1691
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:51,070
你也走丢了吗
Are you lost, too?

1692
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:58,100
我是嘉比嘉比  你愿意做我的朋友吗
I'm Gabby Gabby. Will you be my friend?

1693
01:21:59,010 --> 01:22:00,060
我来帮你
I'll help you.

1694
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:11,300
不好意思  你能帮帮我们吗
Excuse me, can you... Can you help us?

1695
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:12,830
亲爱的  出什么事了
Honey, what's wrong?

1696
01:22:12,830 --> 01:22:14,660
我找不到妈妈爸爸了
I can't find my mom and dad.

1697
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:16,430
没事的  我来帮你找他们
It's okay. I'll help you find them.

1698
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:17,630
他们一定没走远
I'm sure they're not far.

1699
01:22:17,950 --> 01:22:19,280
她就在我们身边
She was right next to us.

1700
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,490
就在我们身边
She was right here!

1701
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,000
然后我一个不留神
And I looked away for one second.

1702
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:22,790
妈妈
Mommy!

1703
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:32,420
我找不到你们
I couldn't find you...

1704
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:34,280
然后我发现了这个娃娃
and then I found this doll.

1705
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:35,190
是吗
You did?

1706
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:37,010
她叫嘉比嘉比
Her name is Gabby Gabby.

1707
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:51,580
我们真的做到了
We actually did that.

1708
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:54,320
-好啊  -太棒了

1709

马上停车

1712
01:23:04,510 --> 01:23:06,360

1715
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:22,020
先生  请你下车好吗

1716
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:24,370
爸爸肯定要坐牢了

1717

1721
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:42,170
搞什么
What the...?

1722
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:45,390
开什么玩笑
You've got to be kidding me.

1723
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:05,050

01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:12,380
这是否意味着胡迪成了丢失的玩具
