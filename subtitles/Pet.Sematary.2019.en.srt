3
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:32,340
So many trees.

4
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:34,174
It's beautiful, right?

5
00:02:34,176 --> 00:02:36,375
Well, it's definitely
not Boston.

6
00:02:36,377 --> 00:02:38,306
No, it's not.

7
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:41,207
Mom, make him stop.
It's not fair to Church.

8
00:02:42,144 --> 00:02:44,441
I'm pretty sure Church is okay.

9
00:02:44,443 --> 00:02:46,508
It's not actually Church
that I'm worried about.

10
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,174
We've still got
another eight hours to go.

11
00:02:48,176 --> 00:02:49,241
What?

12
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,508
Not funny, Dad.

13
00:02:52,044 --> 00:02:53,375
That is so funny.

14
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:55,507
I got you good.

15
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,174
- Gage, did you find that funny?
- I thought it was funny.

16
00:03:35,877 --> 00:03:37,411
What do you think?

17
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:40,811
- Wow.
- "Wow"? That's it?

18
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:42,810
It's pretty incredible,
don't you think?

19
00:03:42,812 --> 00:03:44,678
I even got them
to throw in a whole forest

20
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,411
as a new backyard.

21
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:47,578
This whole place is ours?

22
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,710
This whole place
is the new domain

23
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:51,745
of Ellie-phant
the Great and Terrible.

24
00:03:53,181 --> 00:03:54,344
I'll tell you what.

25
00:03:54,346 --> 00:03:57,444
Do you want
to be the first inside?

26
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,778
Go, go, go.

27
00:04:02,747 --> 00:04:04,379
The movers
were here all morning,

28
00:04:04,381 --> 00:04:06,078
so everything
should be inside.

29
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,512
Good.

30
00:04:10,947 --> 00:04:13,547
Son of a bitch. You okay?

31
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:16,381
Yeah, it just startled me
a little bit.

32
00:04:17,915 --> 00:04:19,313
You okay, Gage?

33
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:21,613
- Big truck, huh?
- Who's a brave boy?

34
00:04:21,615 --> 00:04:23,379
That was a big
truck, wasn't it?

35
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,779
Okay. You ready,
little man?

36
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:32,613
- Here we go. Come on.
- One, two, three!

37
00:04:32,615 --> 00:04:33,512
Home.

38
00:04:33,514 --> 00:04:35,046
Hmm.

39
00:04:35,048 --> 00:04:37,581
Well, he adapted quickly.

40
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:41,413
What about you?
You ready for the country life, Doc?

41
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:44,346
Well, let's find out. Come on.

42
00:04:44,348 --> 00:04:45,581
Mrs. Creed.

43
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:48,713
Wait, the cat's in the car!

44
00:04:58,184 --> 00:05:01,348
This all happened
pretty fast. You gonna miss it?

45
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,548
I don't think anyone really misses
the graveyard shift in the ER.

46
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,115
I don't think that really
answered my question.

47
00:05:08,117 --> 00:05:10,081
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

48
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,615
- Hey.
- Hmm?

49
00:05:15,384 --> 00:05:16,913
You needed this.

50
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,815
We needed this.

51
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:23,750
I get to spend some more
time around the house

52
00:05:25,884 --> 00:05:30,017
- with the kids.
- And your stay-at-home wifey.

53
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:31,781
- Ooh, I didn't even think about that.
- Yeah?

54
00:05:31,783 --> 00:05:33,450
- I may have to rethink that.
- Oh, you will?

55
00:05:33,452 --> 00:05:35,317
You stop that. Don't you do that.

56
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:37,250
Yeah...

57
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:50,216
Good morning, Marcella.

58
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:51,485
Ready for the storm?

59
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,051
We have someone already?

60
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,751
Bloody nose. Room 4.

61
00:05:55,786 --> 00:05:57,384
Sounds serious.

62
00:06:12,353 --> 00:06:13,617
Do you hear that?

63
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:42,786
What are they doing?

64
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:45,153
Looks like some
sort of procession.

65
00:06:48,488 --> 00:06:50,687
What's a procession?

66
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:53,555
It's like a parade,
but not for fun.

67
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:07,488
Hey, let's go back inside
and watch a show.

68
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,687
I'm tired of unpacking boxes.

69
00:07:19,891 --> 00:07:21,688
Sooner than that.

70
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,122
I mean, Ellie's birthday is
coming up in a few months.

71
00:07:46,358 --> 00:07:50,457
Well, I don't know why you're worried, Mom.
No, everything's fine.

72
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:52,223
The kids are really happy.

73
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,690
Yeah.

74
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:56,457
No, it's nice
to slow down a little bit,

75
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:57,723
you know?

76
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,092
Hey, Mom, can I, uh...
Can I talk to you later?

77
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:10,956
Okay, love you. Bye.

78
00:08:15,892 --> 00:08:18,024
Hey, Ellie, are you hungry?

79
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,228
Hey. You get down from there!

80
00:09:54,532 --> 00:09:55,730
The trick is...

81
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,897
To get the stinger out
real quick.

82
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,898
Oh, she's a big 'un.

83
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:05,096
No prize winner...

84
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,331
But she'll do for a ribbon.

85
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:12,896
There you go.

86
00:10:13,265 --> 00:10:14,464
Yeah.

87
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:17,464
Should be starting
to quiet down now.

88
00:10:17,466 --> 00:10:19,498
You're the doctor's
little girl.

89
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,097
Eleanor Creed.
But you can call me Ellie.

90
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:24,364
I'm Judson Crandall.

91
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,765
You can call me Jud.

92
00:10:28,365 --> 00:10:30,965
All right. Up you get.

93
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,931
- What is this place?
- Pet cemetery.

94
00:10:37,933 --> 00:10:41,999
- Didn't you read the sign?
- Yeah. They spelled it wrong.

95
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,531
These are all people's pets?

96
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:49,333
Well, the whole town's been
using this place for generations.

97
00:10:49,335 --> 00:10:50,431
I saw those kids.

98
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:52,300
They were all
wearing those masks.

99
00:10:52,302 --> 00:10:53,766
Yeah.

100
00:10:53,768 --> 00:10:57,834
A lot of folks make a
kind of ritual out of it.

101
00:10:57,836 --> 00:11:01,400
See this one over here?
I carved this myself.

102
00:11:01,402 --> 00:11:04,667
That's my dog, Biffer.

103
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:08,300
And it's true.
He was a hell of a sniffer.

104
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,666
Ellie?

105
00:11:12,668 --> 00:11:17,033
You know better than to wander
off by yourself. Come here.

106
00:11:17,035 --> 00:11:19,834
Mommy, this is Jud,
our neighbor.

107
00:11:19,836 --> 00:11:21,167
I got stung by a bee.

108
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:24,301
He pulled the stinger out.
It was a big 'un.

109
00:11:24,303 --> 00:11:26,300
Hmm. Nice to meet you, ma'am.

110
00:11:26,302 --> 00:11:29,402
Nice to meet you, too.
I'm Rachel, Ellie's mom.

111
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:32,466
You know, these woods...

112
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,435
It's not really all that safe
to go roaming around in 'em.

113
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:40,169
People can get lost up here.

114
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:44,137
Thank you, Jud.
Um, we should get back, okay?

115
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:49,103
Honey, you can't
wander off like that.

116
00:11:49,105 --> 00:11:51,334
I don't know where you are.
I can't do anything...

117
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:56,436
Just wash the mud off and rub
some baking soda on that sting.

118
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,501
<i>Jud...</i>

119
00:12:02,206 --> 00:12:04,370
<i>Come back...</i>

120
00:12:14,971 --> 00:12:17,070
- Dad?
- Yeah?

121
00:12:17,072 --> 00:12:19,202
Why don't pets
live as long as people?

122
00:12:22,273 --> 00:12:23,271
Well...

123
00:12:24,472 --> 00:12:27,270
Do you remember that talk
we had about metabolism?

124
00:12:27,272 --> 00:12:29,938
- The clock in your body?
- Yes.

125
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,238
Humans have
a slow metabolism,

126
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,504
a slow clock,
so we live longer.

127
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,704
Whereas cats and dogs...

128
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:39,637
Well, they have
a fast metabolism.

129
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,604
Which means,
when it runs out...

130
00:12:41,606 --> 00:12:43,538
They die and go
to the pet cemetery.

131
00:12:44,475 --> 00:12:45,439
Yeah.

132
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:47,972
Ellie discovered
a charming little landmark

133
00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:50,406
in the woods today,
right in our backyard.

134
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:54,406
Okay. Well, that doesn't have to
be such a bad thing, does it? Hmm?

135
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:56,637
A place to bury our pets
and remember them.

136
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,271
It might seem scary, but it's not.
It's perfectly natural.

137
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:04,105
Just like dying
is natural. Hmm?

138
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,171
We all die and eventually,
one way or another,

139
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:10,040
we all go back
into the ground.

140
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:11,473
What Daddy's
trying to say

141
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:14,805
is that even though the pet's
body goes in the ground,

142
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:17,472
its soul keeps living
and goes to heaven.

143
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:20,540
Just like Nana Creed.

144
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:23,574
Remember how I told you
she's looking down on you?

145
00:13:23,576 --> 00:13:24,840
Well, we don't
actually know

146
00:13:24,842 --> 00:13:27,906
that it works
exactly like that.

147
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:29,474
What Mommy and Daddy
are trying to say

148
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,739
is that you don't have to worry about
this, sweetheart, okay?

149
00:13:31,741 --> 00:13:35,775
Church and Mommy and me,
we're gonna be around a long, long time.

150
00:13:35,777 --> 00:13:36,906
And Gage?

151
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:39,606
Of course, sweetie.
Gage is just a kid.

152
00:13:42,876 --> 00:13:46,041
But what about
your sister, Mommy?

153
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:49,242
Wasn't she just a kid
when she died?

154
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:32,943
Rachel...

155
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:37,477
Rachel.

156
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,544
You okay?

157
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,009
What was that in there?

158
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,478
Funny, I wanted to ask you
the same thing.

159
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,377
Rachel, Ellie's
almost nine years old.

160
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:53,045
We should be able
to talk to her about this.

161
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:54,978
Ellie's a child.

162
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,344
And death for her is scary.

163
00:14:57,346 --> 00:14:59,246
Please, Rachel, doesn't mean
we should shield her from it.

164
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:01,377
And you think
that's what I'm doing?

165
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:05,312
I think that all this talk
about the afterlife,

166
00:15:06,181 --> 00:15:08,244
about people
looking down on her,

167
00:15:08,246 --> 00:15:10,512
I think...
Yeah, I think it's delaying

168
00:15:10,514 --> 00:15:13,247
getting to the heart
of the matter, yes.

169
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:17,248
So, you... You really don't
think there's anything

170
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:22,678
after we die?
No heaven, no nothing?

171
00:15:26,215 --> 00:15:27,413
No.

172
00:15:28,815 --> 00:15:31,814
Right. We're gonna take a swab
and run a test for strep.

173
00:15:31,816 --> 00:15:33,514
It could be allergies,

174
00:15:34,648 --> 00:15:35,646
but we just want to be sure.

175
00:15:38,582 --> 00:15:40,979
Marcella, please tell me
it's almost lunch.

176
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,647
If I have to look at another
pair of swollen tonsils,

177
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:45,047
- I swear to God...
- Judy went out for sandwiches.

178
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:48,948
His head!

179
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,113
Victor, uh, Pascow.

180
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,848
It's Victor Pascow.
He's a student here.

181
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,281
He was skating and the
car just came out of nowhere!

182
00:15:54,283 --> 00:15:56,180
- He got dragged.
- Call Life Flight to Bangor.

183
00:15:56,182 --> 00:15:57,513
No time for an ambulance.

184
00:15:57,515 --> 00:15:59,614
We need to get his blood type.
We'll need a lot of units.

185
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:01,215
We have to stabilize him
before we can transfer.

186
00:16:01,217 --> 00:16:02,248
He have
a medical bracelet on?

187
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,415
I didn't see anything, no.

188
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:05,548
I'm not gonna
let you die, Victor. Shit.

189
00:16:06,317 --> 00:16:08,114
Type O-positive.
Pulling four units.

190
00:16:08,116 --> 00:16:10,882
Great. Lie back, okay?
Just lie back. Lie back.

191
00:16:10,884 --> 00:16:12,348
Let's hurry up
with those units, okay?

192
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,116
Kelly, we're gonna need to
fit him with a cervical collar

193
00:16:14,118 --> 00:16:15,281
to get him lifted.

194
00:16:15,283 --> 00:16:17,648
His brain. I can see it.

195
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,782
Kelly. Kelly, go!

196
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,815
Victor, please.

197
00:16:20,817 --> 00:16:23,182
Where are we with those units?
He's losing a lot of blood!

198
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,850
No. No, no, no, Victor. No.
You stay with me, Victor.

199
00:16:28,852 --> 00:16:31,916
You stay with me. I'm right here, Victor.
Stay right here...

200
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:40,650
Come...
Come back to me, Victor.

201
00:16:40,652 --> 00:16:42,282
Come on.
Come back to me.

202
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:44,549
Come back. Come back.

203
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:49,450
God damn it.

204
00:17:31,887 --> 00:17:33,920
Louis.

205
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:37,586
The barrier is not
meant to be broken.

206
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:40,519
Louis?

207
00:17:44,989 --> 00:17:46,519
Uh, he's gone.

208
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:33,189
Hey.

209
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:45,822
What happened?

210
00:18:48,392 --> 00:18:50,056
This poor kid
got hit by a car today

211
00:18:50,058 --> 00:18:51,689
right on the campus.

212
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:58,256
He, uh, couldn't have been
more than 20 years old.

213
00:19:01,392 --> 00:19:03,856
His name was Victor Pascow.

214
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:08,924
I sure wasn't expecting
to see any of that up here.

215
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,557
Why don't you come inside?

216
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:18,257
I'll make you some dinner.
You can take a shower. Okay?

217
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:19,723
I'm sorry.

218
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:25,692
He, uh, knew my name.

219
00:19:26,227 --> 00:19:27,891
What?

220
00:19:28,826 --> 00:19:29,825
He...

221
00:19:33,928 --> 00:19:35,659
Nothing. Doesn't matter.

222
00:19:41,228 --> 00:19:44,859
Jud? It's Ellie.
I made cookies.

223
00:19:45,261 --> 00:19:47,292
Are you home?

224
00:20:38,463 --> 00:20:39,760
You in the habit
of going through

225
00:20:39,762 --> 00:20:41,394
other people's things?

226
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:44,695
Sorry.

227
00:20:45,132 --> 00:20:47,129
Is that your wife?

228
00:20:47,131 --> 00:20:50,329
Yeah. Her name was Norma.

229
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:51,696
She's pretty.

230
00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:53,695
What happened to her?

231
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:57,564
Got sick. Passed away.

232
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:01,197
Well, maybe she's
still out there.

233
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:03,197
You know,
watching from heaven?

234
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:05,196
You think so, Ellie?

235
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:06,630
Hey, want to come
meet my cat?

236
00:21:07,664 --> 00:21:09,530
- His name is Church.
- Church?

237
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:11,597
That's short
for Winston Churchill.

238
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:13,230
He's a guy
who lived a long time ago.

239
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:16,096
Oh, I know
who Winston Churchill is.

240
00:21:16,098 --> 00:21:17,698
Wow. You must be really old.

241
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,699
I'm afraid so.

242
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:26,964
Oh-ho!
- Very nice!

243
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,697
Very good.

244
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,332
Nice job. Bravo, sweetheart.

245
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:35,232
- Can you clap? Clap, clap.
- Well done, honey.

246
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:36,831
Thanks, folks,
for having me over.

247
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,530
It's been a long time since
I've had any good home cooking.

248
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,199
How long have you lived here?

249
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:42,665
What, in Ludlow,
or in that house?

250
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:45,097
- Either.
- All my life.

251
00:21:45,099 --> 00:21:46,364
To both questions.

252
00:21:47,434 --> 00:21:49,164
- Whoa, big fella!
- Church!

253
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,199
- He likes you.
- Well, I like him.

254
00:21:51,201 --> 00:21:52,833
Church good kitty.

255
00:21:52,835 --> 00:21:54,065
- Hey!
- Yes.

256
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:56,065
- Church good, good kitty.
- He is.

257
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:58,366
- Yeah.
- I was curious, Jud...

258
00:21:58,368 --> 00:21:59,999
Um, the realtor
said the house came

259
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:02,498
with over 50 acres of woods.

260
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,901
That pet cemetery,
do we own that, too?

261
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:07,401
Well, that's
part of your property.

262
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:11,366
How far back
is the property line?

263
00:22:11,368 --> 00:22:15,800
Well, it's further
than you'd ever care to go.

264
00:22:31,201 --> 00:22:33,933
<i>Louis.</i>

265
00:23:22,471 --> 00:23:24,203
Come on, Doc.

266
00:23:50,574 --> 00:23:52,839
<i>You tried to help me.</i>

267
00:23:53,574 --> 00:23:55,705
<i>Now let me help you.</i>

268
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:19,773
<i>This is the place
where the dead rest.</i>

269
00:24:21,108 --> 00:24:23,474
<i>Do not go on to the place</i>

270
00:24:23,476 --> 00:24:26,041
<i>where the dead walk.</i>

271
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:45,642
Stop! The ground is sour!

272
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:49,039
Wake up, Dada!

273
00:24:49,742 --> 00:24:52,375
Oh, hey, buddy.

274
00:24:52,377 --> 00:24:54,542
Come here,
come here, come here.

275
00:24:54,544 --> 00:24:56,039
Come to Daddy.

276
00:24:57,711 --> 00:25:00,276
- I love you, Daddy.
- Hmm?

277
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:02,674
Oh, man, thank you.

278
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:04,909
Time for Daddy to get up.

279
00:25:12,376 --> 00:25:13,774
Hi.

280
00:25:15,545 --> 00:25:17,344
- Good morning, sleepyhead.
- Hey.

281
00:25:17,346 --> 00:25:19,543
Did you wake up Dada? Huh?

282
00:25:19,545 --> 00:25:21,575
- Did you wake up Dada, huh?
- What time is it?

283
00:25:21,577 --> 00:25:23,041
It's late. You slept in.

284
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:39,242
- Hey, guys!
- Hi, Ellie.

285
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:41,544
What have you guys got?

286
00:25:41,546 --> 00:25:43,111
I've got some candy
corns, lollipops...

287
00:25:43,113 --> 00:25:44,545
They also have
really big gummy bears.

288
00:25:44,547 --> 00:25:48,309
Okay, which one is the sheet
and which one is the gho... Oh!

289
00:25:48,311 --> 00:25:50,478
You look like a ghost, don't you, huh?

290
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,678
You've been busy already.

291
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,910
- You guys look great.
- Thank you.

292
00:25:53,912 --> 00:25:55,144
We have to go
to the Pattersons,

293
00:25:55,146 --> 00:25:57,911
- 'cause they have the biggest candy...
- El, uh...

294
00:25:57,913 --> 00:25:59,644
- Take your broom, honey?
- Yeah.

295
00:25:59,646 --> 00:26:00,812
Talk among yourselves.

296
00:26:00,814 --> 00:26:02,378
- I'll be back, okay?
- Okay.

297
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,877
What are you doing, Jud?
You scaring the kids?

298
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,379
There's something
you need to see.

299
00:26:15,315 --> 00:26:16,313
All right.

300
00:26:27,213 --> 00:26:29,778
Oh, no. Church.

301
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,546
One of those
damn Orinco trucks.

302
00:26:36,548 --> 00:26:39,046
- Dad!
- Oh, shit.

303
00:26:39,048 --> 00:26:41,779
- Dad!
- Uh, we can't let Ellie see this.

304
00:26:43,016 --> 00:26:44,613
Come on, we got to go
trick-or-treating

305
00:26:44,615 --> 00:26:46,313
- with Zoe and Tyler.
- Yeah, honey.

306
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:48,349
I'm just gonna say
a quick hello to Jud.

307
00:26:48,351 --> 00:26:50,047
- Okay?
- I'll put a spell on you.

308
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:52,412
You already have, sweetheart.

309
00:26:52,414 --> 00:26:55,213
You go wait in the car, honey.
I'll be right there.

310
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,847
You, uh...
You go with the kids.

311
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:00,581
Come back later,
we'll take care of this.

312
00:27:04,151 --> 00:27:05,748
Okay.

313
00:27:06,384 --> 00:27:07,682
And, Louis...

314
00:27:09,616 --> 00:27:11,114
We should do this tonight.

315
00:27:13,518 --> 00:27:15,048
Sure, yeah.

316
00:27:19,317 --> 00:27:20,914
You're sure?

317
00:27:22,317 --> 00:27:23,915
Yeah, I'm sure.

318
00:27:24,817 --> 00:27:26,382
I mean, he was all twisted.

319
00:27:29,118 --> 00:27:31,850
Which brings me

320
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:34,984
to the fact
that we have to tell Ellie.

321
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,982
- No, can we just tell her...
- Rachel. No, we need...

322
00:27:36,984 --> 00:27:39,949
Can we just tell her
that he ran away, please?

323
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,783
You know, honey,
I get it, okay?

324
00:27:43,785 --> 00:27:47,351
I get it's difficult
for you to talk about death

325
00:27:47,353 --> 00:27:49,183
after what you went through
with your sister,

326
00:27:49,185 --> 00:27:51,617
but I think it's time
you finally opened up.

327
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:52,850
I'm just...

328
00:27:54,452 --> 00:27:56,484
No, I'm just
upset about Church.

329
00:27:56,486 --> 00:28:00,250
Rachel, talk to me.
We both know this is about Zelda.

330
00:28:00,252 --> 00:28:04,418
<i>Ever since moving here,
I can't stop thinking about her.</i>

331
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,419
<i>She hated me</i>

332
00:28:05,421 --> 00:28:09,151
because my spine
wasn't twisted like hers.

333
00:28:09,153 --> 00:28:13,719
<i>She promised me that one day
I'd end up just like her.</i>

334
00:28:13,721 --> 00:28:16,219
<i>I'd never
get out of bed again.</i>

335
00:28:17,186 --> 00:28:20,018
<i>My parents
left me alone with her.</i>

336
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,518
<i>I was supposed
to bring her dinner.</i>

337
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,085
<i>And so I used the dumbwaiter,
and I knew I wasn't supposed to</i>

338
00:28:26,087 --> 00:28:27,884
<i>because it didn't work
all the time.</i>

339
00:29:10,323 --> 00:29:13,422
She died in there
because of me.

340
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:19,090
I watched them
wheel her body out,

341
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:21,889
but I swear
she was still in the walls.

342
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:26,420
<i>And at night,
I could hear her moving,</i>

343
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,622
<i>calling out my name.</i>

344
00:29:28,624 --> 00:29:31,088
<i>Rachel.</i>

345
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,688
I didn't know who to call.

346
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:35,356
But if I had just gone up to the
room and given her her food...

347
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:39,921
Your parents should never have
left you alone with her. Never.

348
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:41,457
That makes me a monster.

349
00:29:41,459 --> 00:29:42,788
No, no, no, no, no, no,

350
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,289
that does not
make you a monster.

351
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:45,787
Come on. Hey.

352
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:48,422
That does not
make you a monster. Okay?

353
00:29:48,657 --> 00:29:49,855
Mmm?

354
00:29:51,358 --> 00:29:52,824
Tell you what.

355
00:29:52,826 --> 00:29:56,856
Jud and I are gonna take care of
Church tonight. All right? We'll...

356
00:29:56,858 --> 00:30:01,557
We'll just tell Ellie
that he ran away.

357
00:30:02,192 --> 00:30:04,256
- Okay? Yeah?
- Okay.

358
00:30:05,626 --> 00:30:07,490
Just anything but dead.

359
00:30:20,992 --> 00:30:22,889
I got a spot for you.

360
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:31,292
What is it?

361
00:30:33,295 --> 00:30:35,593
Nothing. Let's get this
over with, huh?

362
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,491
It's cold.

363
00:30:42,894 --> 00:30:45,058
<i>Jud...</i>

364
00:30:48,327 --> 00:30:49,226
<i>Jud...</i>

365
00:30:52,994 --> 00:30:55,727
Ellie really loved that cat,
didn't she?

366
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,326
More than anything.

367
00:30:58,429 --> 00:30:59,859
And you love Ellie.

368
00:31:01,662 --> 00:31:03,326
Well, of course.

369
00:31:06,596 --> 00:31:08,460
So, follow me.

370
00:31:08,462 --> 00:31:09,527
What?

371
00:31:10,363 --> 00:31:14,028
- I know all the spots to step.
- Jud, wait.

372
00:31:19,096 --> 00:31:21,160
What's the matter
with right here?

373
00:31:22,596 --> 00:31:24,527
For Chrissakes.

374
00:31:31,397 --> 00:31:32,994
Oh, what the hell am I doing?

375
00:31:43,531 --> 00:31:45,228
Jud, come on, wait up.

376
00:31:51,663 --> 00:31:53,360
What the hell is this place?

377
00:32:16,597 --> 00:32:19,297
Come a long
way to bury a cat.

378
00:32:39,465 --> 00:32:41,029
What was that?

379
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,765
It's just a loon.

380
00:32:45,866 --> 00:32:47,330
Come on.

381
00:33:28,336 --> 00:33:29,601
What is this place?

382
00:33:33,037 --> 00:33:36,202
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

383
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:39,467
Bury your animal.

384
00:33:42,471 --> 00:33:45,501
I'd help you,
but you have to do it yourself.

385
00:33:45,503 --> 00:33:49,268
And use some of these rocks
to make a cairn.

386
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,135
- Kind of like the other ones.
- Okay.

387
00:34:15,273 --> 00:34:17,537
What exactly are we
doing here tonight, Jud?

388
00:34:18,438 --> 00:34:20,336
We're burying
your daughter's cat.

389
00:34:24,907 --> 00:34:25,903
And that's all?

390
00:34:26,771 --> 00:34:28,569
That and nothing but.

391
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:45,636
You did good, Louis.

392
00:34:47,806 --> 00:34:49,404
I knew you would.

393
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,338
What time is it?

394
00:35:04,673 --> 00:35:05,938
It's late.

395
00:35:07,574 --> 00:35:10,173
Did you and Jud
take care of everything?

396
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:11,872
Yeah, it's done.

397
00:35:14,009 --> 00:35:15,472
Thank you.

398
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:19,972
What is it?

399
00:35:22,976 --> 00:35:24,374
It's Church, honey.

400
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:27,805
Yeah.

401
00:35:27,807 --> 00:35:34,072
Daddy and Jud went out last
night to look for Church, and...

402
00:35:34,074 --> 00:35:36,641
Well, we looked
all around and we...

403
00:35:36,643 --> 00:35:38,840
Well, sweetheart,
we couldn't find him.

404
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:41,608
And so we think...

405
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:44,208
We think Church ran away,
sweetheart.

406
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,775
- Yeah.
- He didn't run away.

407
00:35:47,777 --> 00:35:49,641
Well...

408
00:35:49,643 --> 00:35:51,639
He was outside my window
last night.

409
00:35:52,677 --> 00:35:57,407
Honey, maybe you had a dream
that you saw him.

410
00:35:57,409 --> 00:36:00,875
It's okay to be
confused about all this...

411
00:36:06,543 --> 00:36:09,408
You just have to accept
that he might not come home.

412
00:36:10,144 --> 00:36:11,209
I'm sorry, sweetie.

413
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,043
He came back last night.

414
00:36:13,943 --> 00:36:14,942
Look.

415
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,307
He's right there.

416
00:36:37,512 --> 00:36:38,976
I thought you said
he was dead.

417
00:36:39,346 --> 00:36:40,777
He was.

418
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:42,409
He, uh...

419
00:36:44,045 --> 00:36:47,010
He must've been unconscious,
in shock or something.

420
00:36:50,512 --> 00:36:52,710
Good thing
you're not a fucking vet.

421
00:36:58,713 --> 00:36:59,811
Jud.

422
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,878
We, uh...

423
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,478
We need to have
a little talk.

424
00:37:11,014 --> 00:37:13,779
Ellie's cat is walking around
over there like nothing happened.

425
00:37:15,181 --> 00:37:17,012
Well, I'll be damned.

426
00:37:17,014 --> 00:37:19,079
What the fuck does that mean?

427
00:37:19,081 --> 00:37:21,313
Well, isn't that
what you wanted?

428
00:37:21,315 --> 00:37:22,945
Save your daughter
from the truth?

429
00:37:24,315 --> 00:37:25,679
I mean, come on.
You saw as well as I did.

430
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:28,012
- That cat was dead, Jud.
- I never said he wasn't.

431
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,744
- Well, then how do you explain it?
- I don't.

432
00:37:33,382 --> 00:37:35,380
Nobody can.

433
00:37:35,382 --> 00:37:36,780
You're gonna have to do
better than that, Jud.

434
00:37:38,182 --> 00:37:40,347
There are places in this world

435
00:37:42,516 --> 00:37:44,615
that are older
than either of us.

436
00:37:44,617 --> 00:37:47,514
<i>Places that a rational
doctor brain like yours</i>

437
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:49,414
<i>will never understand.</i>

438
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:51,380
<i>Nobody knows
what that place is,</i>

439
00:37:51,382 --> 00:37:54,081
<i>what happens
in that stony ground.</i>

440
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:58,081
<i>But the soil of a man's heart
is stonier, Louis.</i>

441
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:03,847
<i>What we did last night,</i>

442
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,681
<i>we did for Ellie.</i>

443
00:38:08,284 --> 00:38:10,481
<i>But that's your cat now.</i>

444
00:38:19,217 --> 00:38:21,849
"Bull presumed
dead found on main street."

445
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:28,016
"Timothy Baterman..."

446
00:38:28,018 --> 00:38:30,081
"Cadaver disappearance?"

447
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:41,682
What the fuck?

448
00:39:02,251 --> 00:39:04,516
Where did you take me, Jud?

449
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:18,119
Church, you're so stinky.

450
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:19,885
What'd you do out there?

451
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,485
Hang on, Church,
there's something...

452
00:39:26,188 --> 00:39:28,885
Something gross in your fur.

453
00:39:37,521 --> 00:39:39,552
All right, there we go.

454
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:41,586
Give me a look.

455
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,552
Okay. Does that feel okay?

456
00:39:44,422 --> 00:39:46,021
Yeah?

457
00:39:46,023 --> 00:39:48,488
I want to go back
to our old house.

458
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:54,019
Well, Mommy and I,
we moved up here to slow down,

459
00:39:54,021 --> 00:39:58,052
so that we could spend more
time with you, so that...

460
00:39:58,054 --> 00:39:59,720
Lift up.

461
00:39:59,722 --> 00:40:03,588
So that Daddy could be around,
he'd get to tuck you into bed more,

462
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:06,054
make sure you're
all safe and sound.

463
00:40:06,056 --> 00:40:08,588
Give you a little tickle before he says good night.

464
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,220
Okay? Come on.

465
00:40:10,222 --> 00:40:12,121
Okay, honey.

466
00:40:12,123 --> 00:40:15,088
I promise, okay, just like your
arm, it's gonna get better.

467
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,688
All right? Trust me?

468
00:40:17,222 --> 00:40:18,521
Good night.

469
00:40:18,523 --> 00:40:20,155
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

470
00:40:20,157 --> 00:40:24,655
Close the door all the way.
I don't want Church coming in anymore.

471
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:26,855
Okay.

472
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:29,655
I love you.

473
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:34,856
<i>How is she?</i>

474
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:38,189
She's good.
Poor little thing.

475
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:42,889
What about Church?

476
00:40:45,724 --> 00:40:47,856
I don't know.
Must've been the accident.

477
00:40:48,958 --> 00:40:51,690
I'll take him
to the vet tomorrow.

478
00:40:53,626 --> 00:40:55,057
What about you?

479
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,222
I'm good.

480
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:02,924
But...

481
00:41:05,092 --> 00:41:06,289
Come here.

482
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,291
It's been hard,
the past few months.

483
00:41:43,893 --> 00:41:47,392
What? Oh, Jesus!

484
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:49,759
Louis, it's still alive.

485
00:41:53,327 --> 00:41:54,392
Damn it!

486
00:41:56,594 --> 00:41:58,360
Jesus Christ.

487
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,725
Church?

488
00:42:04,496 --> 00:42:05,894
Church?

489
00:42:09,563 --> 00:42:10,726
Come out of there, buddy.

490
00:42:16,597 --> 00:42:17,795
Church...

491
00:42:47,797 --> 00:42:49,563
<i>Your destruction</i>

492
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:55,264
<i>and the destruction of all
you love is very near, Doctor.</i>

493
00:45:03,804 --> 00:45:05,668
Rach, what happened?
You okay?

494
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:06,868
Mmm.

495
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:10,037
I don't want
to talk about it.

496
00:45:12,903 --> 00:45:15,302
- Is it the bird?
- No, it's not the bird.

497
00:45:16,938 --> 00:45:19,903
I think it's a mistake
that we moved here.

498
00:45:21,905 --> 00:45:24,103
It doesn't feel right, Louis.

499
00:45:29,206 --> 00:45:31,170
You remember why we moved here
in the first place?

500
00:45:31,172 --> 00:45:32,370
No, I know.

501
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:39,038
I mean, look, we have
Ellie's birthday coming up.

502
00:45:40,072 --> 00:45:41,403
Why don't we do something
special, hey?

503
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,671
We could throw a party.

504
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:48,005
We could invite some of our
friends from Boston up, all right?

505
00:45:51,007 --> 00:45:52,804
Invite your parents, even.

506
00:45:53,972 --> 00:45:55,237
- Okay?
- Mmm.

507
00:45:58,074 --> 00:45:59,838
We can turn this around.
We can.

508
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,938
We can turn this around.

509
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,438
Ooh,
these are looking good, El.

510
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:27,905
El, what is this?

511
00:46:31,175 --> 00:46:34,040
I don't know.
Gage drew that.

512
00:46:42,376 --> 00:46:43,374
Gage?

513
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:53,608
Come on, Daddy's got you.
Daddy's got you.

514
00:46:56,443 --> 00:46:58,675
I was 11
when I lost Biff.

515
00:46:58,677 --> 00:47:03,842
He'd run over some barbed wire
and the cuts got infected.

516
00:47:03,844 --> 00:47:06,543
Daddy had to put him down
out of mercy.

517
00:47:09,344 --> 00:47:12,441
- Your dad took you up there.
- No, no.

518
00:47:12,443 --> 00:47:15,809
It was an old fella
named Stanny Bouchard.

519
00:47:15,811 --> 00:47:17,275
He told me about it.

520
00:47:21,045 --> 00:47:23,041
The Wendigo.

521
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:25,608
You heard a lot about that

522
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:28,375
all over the north country
back in the old days.

523
00:47:28,945 --> 00:47:30,976
It was a myth

524
00:47:30,978 --> 00:47:35,110
passed down from the local
tribes up this way.

525
00:47:35,112 --> 00:47:38,376
But to them, it wasn't
just some campfire story.

526
00:47:38,378 --> 00:47:40,710
They believed it.
They feared it.

527
00:47:42,846 --> 00:47:44,610
Saw these
on the trees up there.

528
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,512
Yeah, they're warnings.

529
00:47:46,514 --> 00:47:49,346
The local tribes carved them
before they fled.

530
00:47:49,713 --> 00:47:50,577
Fled?

531
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:53,476
Yeah, they knew
the power of that place.

532
00:47:53,478 --> 00:47:56,912
They felt its pull.

533
00:47:56,914 --> 00:48:02,644
They came to believe that
those woods belonged to something else.

534
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:05,378
That the ground was bad.

535
00:48:07,347 --> 00:48:08,478
Sour.

536
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:11,043
The ground is sour.

537
00:48:12,414 --> 00:48:14,012
Yeah.

538
00:48:14,014 --> 00:48:17,713
So, they moved on.
But not before they built that deadfall.

539
00:48:19,181 --> 00:48:21,112
They built it
to keep people out.

540
00:48:21,114 --> 00:48:22,645
But it didn't keep people out.

541
00:48:24,047 --> 00:48:25,845
The Wendigo

542
00:48:25,847 --> 00:48:29,545
may just be
some crazy folktale,

543
00:48:29,547 --> 00:48:31,612
but there is
something up there.

544
00:48:33,782 --> 00:48:35,579
Something
that brings things back.

545
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:39,780
So, what happened
to your dog, Jud?

546
00:48:40,715 --> 00:48:43,248
He came back.

547
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:47,912
Just like Stanny B. said he would.
But he was changed.

548
00:48:47,914 --> 00:48:51,579
It was when he went after my
mother that my daddy put him down.

549
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:54,146
For the second time.

550
00:48:58,615 --> 00:49:03,148
I thought it would be
different with Ellie's cat.

551
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:07,081
I mean, Biff had a mean
streak to begin with.

552
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:10,081
But Church, well...

553
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:12,381
- Was a nice cat...
- He tried to hurt Gage.

554
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:16,615
I'm so sorry, Louis. I am.

555
00:49:19,018 --> 00:49:22,349
Once you feel the power
of that place,

556
00:49:22,351 --> 00:49:25,849
you make up the sweetest-smelling
reasons to go back.

557
00:49:27,717 --> 00:49:29,548
But I was wrong.

558
00:49:31,418 --> 00:49:33,750
Sometimes dead is better.

559
00:49:39,751 --> 00:49:41,150
Come on, hold still.

560
00:49:42,585 --> 00:49:44,318
Hold still, you're just
gonna go to sleep.

561
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,851
Damn it, Church. Come on, just...

562
00:49:51,018 --> 00:49:53,550
God damn it.

563
00:50:08,485 --> 00:50:09,518
Come on.

564
00:50:10,353 --> 00:50:11,219
Hey.

565
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,153
Good luck.

566
00:50:40,188 --> 00:50:44,887

Good job, Ellie.

571
00:51:03,755 --> 00:51:06,320
I want a piece
right from the end.

572
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,320
...big St. Bernard.

573
00:51:11,224 --> 00:51:13,688
He got rabies.
He killed about four people.

574
00:51:20,423 --> 00:51:21,521
Hey.

575
00:51:25,889 --> 00:51:27,887
You still thinking
about Church?

576
00:51:28,822 --> 00:51:31,324
It's my fault he left.

577
00:51:31,326 --> 00:51:33,287
I told him
to get out of my room.

578
00:51:33,289 --> 00:51:35,222
No, honey, no.

579
00:51:35,224 --> 00:51:36,721
Church loves you.

580
00:51:37,657 --> 00:51:41,589
Maybe this might
help cheer you up.

581
00:51:47,226 --> 00:51:48,691
Give him a squeeze.

582
00:51:48,693 --> 00:51:49,755
Hmm?

583
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:53,923
- I love him, Daddy.
- You do? Yeah?

584
00:51:53,925 --> 00:51:55,190
And I love you.

585
00:51:55,192 --> 00:51:58,757
Now go and have
a great birthday, okay?

586
00:51:59,925 --> 00:52:01,691
<i>Six...</i>

587
00:52:01,693 --> 00:52:07,624
Seven, eight, nine, 10!

588
00:52:10,525 --> 00:52:12,556
I'm a monster!

589
00:52:13,692 --> 00:52:17,124
Where is everyone?
Where are you guys? Come on.

590
00:52:22,594 --> 00:52:25,559
Come on! Where is that...
Come on! Come on!

591
00:52:39,061 --> 00:52:40,459
Church?

592
00:52:42,094 --> 00:52:43,492
Church!

593
00:52:50,027 --> 00:52:52,893
Church. You came home.

594
00:53:04,063 --> 00:53:05,427
All right, you're it.

595
00:53:08,896 --> 00:53:10,460
Where's...

596
00:53:11,297 --> 00:53:12,695
Gage!

597
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:22,362
Church!

598
00:56:42,706 --> 00:56:45,005
I keep thinking

599
00:56:45,007 --> 00:56:49,338
that I'm gonna hear her
coming up the stairs,

600
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:52,138
like she's coming home
from school.

601
00:57:00,807 --> 00:57:03,105
I can't be here right now.

602
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:13,673
I'm just gonna
wrap up a few things.

603
00:57:14,141 --> 00:57:16,074
Come soon.

604
00:57:16,076 --> 00:57:18,641
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

605
00:57:22,041 --> 00:57:24,840
Be a good boy, okay, buddy?
Take care of Mommy for me.

606
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:26,306
I'll see you in a couple days.

607
00:58:24,811 --> 00:58:28,143
I saw Rachel and Gage
leaving a little while ago.

608
00:58:29,346 --> 00:58:30,575
Boston.

609
00:58:32,278 --> 00:58:33,876
Parents' house.

610
00:58:38,346 --> 00:58:40,210
So it's just you over there?

611
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:43,543
Yep.

612
00:58:43,545 --> 00:58:44,876
I'll drive down
in a few days.

613
00:58:44,878 --> 00:58:47,944
I got to finish a few things
at the clinic first.

614
00:58:50,447 --> 00:58:52,077
That's good.

615
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,011
It's a tough time
for you folks to be apart.

616
00:58:56,579 --> 00:58:57,944
Yeah.

617
00:59:22,681 --> 00:59:27,947
You know, when you came walking over
here, it was a relief.

618
00:59:28,981 --> 00:59:31,346
I was gonna come to see you.

619
00:59:34,349 --> 00:59:37,414
I should never have
shown you that place.

620
00:59:39,483 --> 00:59:40,947
But you did.

621
00:59:42,449 --> 00:59:45,280
I know what you're
thinking of doing, Louis...

622
00:59:45,282 --> 00:59:49,648
...but she
won't come back the same.

623
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:53,780
I'm so goddamn sorry
I did this.

624
00:59:53,782 --> 00:59:58,713
Ellie is the first person to
touch my heart in a long time.

625
00:59:58,715 --> 01:00:02,048
I didn't want her
to be so sad.

626
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:05,780
It's that goddamn place.
It feeds on your grief,

627
01:00:05,782 --> 01:00:08,181
gets into your mind.

628
01:00:09,882 --> 01:00:11,080
Damn it.

629
01:00:13,284 --> 01:00:16,882
I need to
close my eyes for a minute.

630
01:00:36,117 --> 01:00:37,182
<i>Hey.</i>

631
01:00:37,952 --> 01:00:39,382
<i>Thought you'd be in bed.</i>

632
01:00:39,384 --> 01:00:43,248
I was waiting to hear from you.
I called earlier.

633
01:00:44,418 --> 01:00:46,483
<i>Yeah, I know, I saw that.
I was, uh...</i>

634
01:00:46,485 --> 01:00:50,284
I went over to Jud's.
Had a couple of drinks.

635
01:00:51,784 --> 01:00:54,884
<i>Can you just
come be with us?</i>

636
01:00:57,952 --> 01:01:00,617
Gage needs you and I'm...

637
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:08,184
I'm really wiped out, honey.

638
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:14,084
Is it okay
if we talk tomorrow?

639
01:01:14,086 --> 01:01:15,217
Okay.

640
01:01:16,554 --> 01:01:18,351
I love you.

641
01:01:18,353 --> 01:01:20,083
I love you, too.

642
01:01:20,554 --> 01:01:21,851
Goodbye.

643
01:01:45,755 --> 01:01:47,153
Fuck.

644
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:41,726
<i>Louis, stop.</i>

645
01:03:41,728 --> 01:03:43,392
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

646
01:03:44,661 --> 01:03:46,892
<i>You have to let her go.</i>

647
01:03:46,894 --> 01:03:48,458
But I can fix this.

648
01:03:49,793 --> 01:03:51,126
<i>Pascow!</i>

649
01:03:51,128 --> 01:03:54,260
Pascow! Pascow!

650
01:03:56,561 --> 01:03:58,726
Come here. No, it's okay.

651
01:03:58,728 --> 01:04:01,193
It's okay. It's okay.

652
01:04:03,028 --> 01:04:04,693
<i>Go home.</i>

653
01:04:04,695 --> 01:04:06,959
Pascow says go home.

654
01:04:06,961 --> 01:04:09,059
Mommy, go home!

655
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:12,526
There's nothing there.

656
01:04:23,063 --> 01:04:24,727
There's nothing there.

657
01:04:42,563 --> 01:04:45,630
Daddy's almost there,
almost there.

658
01:05:49,067 --> 01:05:50,731
I'm sorry.

659
01:10:14,148 --> 01:10:15,979
Daddy?

660
01:10:17,515 --> 01:10:19,044
Where am I?

661
01:10:21,114 --> 01:10:23,579
Oh, my... My little girl.

662
01:10:25,881 --> 01:10:27,213
Come here.

663
01:10:27,215 --> 01:10:28,778
Oh, you're home!

664
01:10:32,948 --> 01:10:34,412
Home.

665
01:11:32,951 --> 01:11:34,480
What is it?

666
01:11:35,185 --> 01:11:36,783
Just a tangle.

667
01:11:51,185 --> 01:11:53,250
Where's Mommy and Gage?

668
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,751
They went down
to Grandma and Grandpa's.

669
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:00,849
Are they coming back?

670
01:12:04,087 --> 01:12:05,018
Yeah.

671
01:12:08,786 --> 01:12:11,650
I remember my birthday party.

672
01:12:13,587 --> 01:12:15,551
Church was out on the road.

673
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,851
I was so happy he came home.

674
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,650
There was a truck.

675
01:12:27,621 --> 01:12:29,551
Then everything went black.

676
01:12:30,487 --> 01:12:32,150
Well, it's okay now.

677
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:35,551
Now you're back.

678
01:12:38,421 --> 01:12:40,018
Back from where?

679
01:12:47,354 --> 01:12:51,153
It's time to go to bed, okay?
Turn the light off.

680
01:12:51,155 --> 01:12:53,720
I'm dead, aren't I?

681
01:12:54,222 --> 01:12:56,153
No, honey. No.

682
01:12:57,988 --> 01:12:59,253
You're here.

683
01:13:01,657 --> 01:13:03,654
Will you stay with me?

684
01:13:05,122 --> 01:13:06,253
Of course.

685
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:23,920
I can hear the woods.

686
01:13:26,125 --> 01:13:28,722
The windows are
closed, sweetheart.

687
01:13:29,224 --> 01:13:30,887
Not like that.

688
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:34,922
Inside.

689
01:13:41,823 --> 01:13:44,156
Does Mommy know about me?

690
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:45,755
Please, El...

691
01:13:47,224 --> 01:13:49,689
Close your eyes, okay?

692
01:13:50,625 --> 01:13:52,689
It's gonna be okay.

693
01:14:00,693 --> 01:14:02,423
Love you, Daddy.

694
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:06,255
Love you too, El.

695
01:14:38,461 --> 01:14:39,726
El?

696
01:15:14,496 --> 01:15:15,960
Ellie, careful.

697
01:15:19,095 --> 01:15:22,094
Just stop it. Stop it.
Stop. Ellie, stop it.

698
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:24,461
Stop it!

699
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:36,028
Why'd you put
the dress back on?

700
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:47,763
What are you gonna tell her?

701
01:15:55,798 --> 01:15:58,196
Something happened
last night. I...

702
01:15:58,198 --> 01:16:00,629
Gage was having a nightmare,
or I thought it was a nightmare,

703
01:16:00,631 --> 01:16:03,429
and he just started saying
that boy's name who died.

704
01:16:03,431 --> 01:16:05,794
I'm freaking out,
and Gage is freaking out,

705
01:16:05,796 --> 01:16:07,362
and I... I just need
to talk to you.

706
01:16:07,364 --> 01:16:10,063
Just please call me back.

707
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,430
<i>It's 4:00 p.m. on the dot</i>

708
01:16:11,432 --> 01:16:13,729
<i>and we're coming
to you with a traffic update.</i>

709
01:16:13,731 --> 01:16:15,031
<i>Expect major delays.</i>

710
01:16:15,033 --> 01:16:16,996
<i>Traffic on the I-95
is backed-up for miles.</i>

711
01:16:16,998 --> 01:16:19,330
We're gonna be okay, okay?

712
01:16:19,332 --> 01:16:20,964
- Okay?
- Mama.

713
01:16:20,966 --> 01:16:23,330
- Mama.
- <i>Call Jud.</i>

714
01:16:23,332 --> 01:16:28,330
<i>So far, no fatalities,
but two passengers have been airlifted...</i>

715
01:16:28,332 --> 01:16:30,598
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Jud, hi, it's Rachel.

716
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,798
Rachel. You...

717
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,397
You down at your folks' place?

718
01:16:35,399 --> 01:16:37,299
<i>Yeah, I'm on my way back.
Something's wrong.</i>

719
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:39,097
<i>I'm really worried about
Louis right now.</i>

720
01:16:39,099 --> 01:16:40,964
- Louis?
- Can you just go over there

721
01:16:40,966 --> 01:16:42,665
and check on him, please?

722
01:16:42,667 --> 01:16:45,299
<i>I just... I've been calling him
all morning, and I don't know...</i>

723
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:49,299
What...
He... He's not answering?

724
01:16:49,301 --> 01:16:52,598
No. And I've called him
so many times.

725
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:56,598
- <i>Well, I'll go on over there and check.</i>
- Okay. Thank you, Jud.

726
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,165
<i>I should be there soon, okay?</i>

727
01:16:58,167 --> 01:17:01,098
Yeah,
I'll see you then, Rachel.

728
01:17:10,001 --> 01:17:12,967
Louis? You in there?

729
01:17:17,168 --> 01:17:18,300
Hey, Jud.

730
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:21,500
How's your head today?

731
01:17:21,502 --> 01:17:23,300
Oh.

732
01:17:23,302 --> 01:17:25,233
It's banging
like a drum, Jud.

733
01:17:34,069 --> 01:17:36,467
I don't remember
you leaving last night.

734
01:17:36,469 --> 01:17:38,067
Yeah, you passed out.

735
01:17:40,871 --> 01:17:42,302
Listen,
I got to, uh...

736
01:17:42,304 --> 01:17:44,100
I got to get
back inside. I'm...

737
01:17:45,536 --> 01:17:47,835
I've been waiting for Rachel
to call all morning

738
01:17:47,837 --> 01:17:50,202
and I don't want
to miss it. So...

739
01:17:51,671 --> 01:17:52,868
Okay?

740
01:17:56,703 --> 01:17:58,969
If you've done
something, Louis,

741
01:18:00,171 --> 01:18:02,235
it's not too late
to undo it.

742
01:18:08,938 --> 01:18:11,002
You don't have to worry
about me, Jud.

743
01:18:11,637 --> 01:18:12,970
I'm fine.

744
01:18:14,637 --> 01:18:15,903
Really.

745
01:18:15,905 --> 01:18:17,569
If that's all, I'm gonna...

746
01:18:18,537 --> 01:18:20,001
I'm gonna go.

747
01:20:06,976 --> 01:20:08,740
I know you're up here!

748
01:21:52,516 --> 01:21:54,847
- Hello, Jud.
- Stop it, Ellie.

749
01:21:54,849 --> 01:21:56,913
Now, just slow down.

750
01:21:58,182 --> 01:22:00,380
Your sweet Norma.

751
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:03,315
She's burning down in hell
for what you did to her.

752
01:22:03,317 --> 01:22:05,848
I saw her there, Jud.
I saw her.

753
01:22:05,850 --> 01:22:08,414
Shut up! You don't know
anything about her!

754
01:22:11,817 --> 01:22:13,748
Did you miss me, Judson?

755
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:15,781
That's not my Norma!

756
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:21,949
Ellie's hurting.
You did this to her!

757
01:22:21,951 --> 01:22:24,083
It's not you.
It's not you!

758
01:22:24,085 --> 01:22:26,947
You told Louis
about that place.

759
01:22:26,949 --> 01:22:28,882
And now we're suffering

760
01:22:28,884 --> 01:22:30,747
eternally.

761
01:22:34,318 --> 01:22:38,214
But we're here now
to bring you back

762
01:22:38,216 --> 01:22:40,916
so you can suffer with us.

763
01:22:40,918 --> 01:22:43,617
Just you come
and fucking try!

764
01:22:51,818 --> 01:22:52,949
El?

765
01:23:03,219 --> 01:23:04,583
Oh, shit.

766
01:23:08,219 --> 01:23:09,985
Rachel.

767
01:23:09,987 --> 01:23:11,518
What are you...

768
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,617
You're okay.
Thank God you're okay!

769
01:23:13,619 --> 01:23:15,918
I was so worried,
and I was calling

770
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,117
and you wouldn't
pick up, and

771
01:23:17,119 --> 01:23:18,419
Gage was having
these nightmares

772
01:23:18,421 --> 01:23:21,885
and he was saying the name
of that boy that died.

773
01:23:21,887 --> 01:23:24,985
I'm here right now.
I just need you and no one else.

774
01:23:24,987 --> 01:23:26,251
Just you, me and Gage,

775
01:23:26,253 --> 01:23:28,486
- we can get through this.
- It's okay. It's okay.

776
01:23:28,488 --> 01:23:30,152
Come on, honey, it's okay.

777
01:23:30,154 --> 01:23:31,452
Oh. Oh.

778
01:23:31,454 --> 01:23:33,552
- Look at you, hey? You're Daddy's boy.
- Daddy.

779
01:23:33,554 --> 01:23:35,519
Have you gotten bigger?
Hey? Tell me, come on.

780
01:23:35,521 --> 01:23:37,519
Have you gotten bigger?
I think he has. I think he has.

781
01:23:37,521 --> 01:23:39,419
I think he's gotten
a lot bigger.

782
01:23:39,421 --> 01:23:41,352
Oh, you smell so good! Hmm.

783
01:23:41,354 --> 01:23:43,885
Oh, you smell so good!
Come to Daddy.

784
01:23:43,887 --> 01:23:47,685
Louis, what's going on?

785
01:23:51,890 --> 01:23:54,255
I needed more time with her.

786
01:23:54,890 --> 01:23:57,421
Come here. Come here.

787
01:23:58,755 --> 01:23:59,853
Honey.

788
01:24:01,488 --> 01:24:03,653
I wasn't ready
to say goodbye to her.

789
01:24:04,189 --> 01:24:06,454
You're scaring me.

790
01:24:06,456 --> 01:24:08,586
Just tell me
what you're talking about.

791
01:24:08,588 --> 01:24:10,388
It was my fault
she died, Rach.

792
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:12,320
I had to bring her back.

793
01:24:16,823 --> 01:24:18,153
Ellie-phant.

794
01:24:27,524 --> 01:24:29,622
The Great and Terrible.

795
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:36,055
There's a place, Rach,
deep in the woods

796
01:24:37,091 --> 01:24:39,389
beyond the pet cemetery.

797
01:24:44,059 --> 01:24:45,823
It brings things back.

798
01:24:48,324 --> 01:24:50,690
Aren't you happy, Mommy?

799
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:05,021
Hug your daughter, Rach.

800
01:25:06,259 --> 01:25:07,855
Hug your daughter.

801
01:25:16,958 --> 01:25:19,457
I need to put Gage to bed.

802
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:22,856
Rachel!

803
01:25:23,926 --> 01:25:25,159
She doesn't want me here.

804
01:25:26,327 --> 01:25:28,924
No, no, no, no, no.
Mommy just needs time.

805
01:25:28,926 --> 01:25:32,924
It's okay.
I don't want her here, either.

806
01:25:32,926 --> 01:25:35,259
We're okay. Okay, yes.

807
01:25:35,261 --> 01:25:37,259
Here you go.
Here you go, sweetie.

808
01:25:37,261 --> 01:25:38,857
Rachel.

809
01:25:38,859 --> 01:25:40,790
Rachel, open up. Please.

810
01:25:41,362 --> 01:25:42,958
Just let me explain.

811
01:25:44,228 --> 01:25:46,693
I know. Let me explain.

812
01:25:51,828 --> 01:25:54,459
What is she? What is...

813
01:25:54,461 --> 01:25:55,925
That is Ellie out there.

814
01:25:55,927 --> 01:25:59,593
No. No, we buried her.
We put her in the ground.

815
01:25:59,595 --> 01:26:03,360
She's been given back to us.
We have a second chance.

816
01:26:03,362 --> 01:26:05,393
It doesn't work
that way, Louis.

817
01:26:05,395 --> 01:26:06,826
Yes, it does.
There's a place in the woods.

818
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:08,192
That place
I was telling you about.

819
01:26:08,194 --> 01:26:10,593
I couldn't understand it until
I buried Church up there.

820
01:26:10,595 --> 01:26:12,893
That cat was dead until I
buried him in the ground

821
01:26:12,895 --> 01:26:14,393
and it brought him back.

822
01:26:15,796 --> 01:26:18,427
He wasn't the same
after that.

823
01:26:19,296 --> 01:26:21,260
You saw her.

824
01:26:21,262 --> 01:26:23,294
You touched her.
That is our daughter.

825
01:26:23,296 --> 01:26:24,794
You dug her up?

826
01:26:24,796 --> 01:26:26,826
That is our daughter
down there, honey.

827
01:26:26,828 --> 01:26:28,425
Please, okay?

828
01:26:30,128 --> 01:26:31,593
I did what I think
was right.

829
01:26:31,595 --> 01:26:34,594
Let God take
his own fucking kid!

830
01:26:47,663 --> 01:26:49,661
- Ellie?
- You're okay.

831
01:26:50,698 --> 01:26:51,762
Ellie!

832
01:26:51,764 --> 01:26:55,195
Ellie, baby, Mommy and Daddy
were just...

833
01:26:58,198 --> 01:26:59,463
Shit.

834
01:27:10,431 --> 01:27:12,196
Mama.

835
01:27:12,198 --> 01:27:14,699
It's okay, sweetie.
It's okay.

836
01:27:14,701 --> 01:27:16,963
Mommy's okay. Mommy's...

837
01:27:24,265 --> 01:27:27,630
No. No, no, no.
No, no, no...

838
01:27:29,365 --> 01:27:30,564
No.

839
01:28:36,837 --> 01:28:37,935
Rachel.

840
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:46,269
Now you'll never
get out of bed again.

841
01:28:59,438 --> 01:29:01,468
No! No!

842
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:04,303
Stop struggling,
you useless cow.

843
01:29:05,404 --> 01:29:06,602
Ellie?

844
01:29:13,305 --> 01:29:14,336
Shit.

845
01:29:43,206 --> 01:29:44,237
Jud!

846
01:29:51,541 --> 01:29:53,170
Oh, my God.

847
01:29:53,172 --> 01:29:55,970
Oh, my God. No, Jud.

848
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:03,671
God damn it!

849
01:30:34,475 --> 01:30:36,273
Louis! Take the baby!

850
01:30:36,275 --> 01:30:38,139
- Louis!
- Rachel!

851
01:30:38,141 --> 01:30:40,107
Take the baby!
Ellie's trying to kill me!

852
01:30:40,109 --> 01:30:41,674
- Come on, I got him. Jump!
- Take the baby!

853
01:30:41,676 --> 01:30:44,473
Let him go! Come on,
Daddy's got you.

854
01:30:44,475 --> 01:30:45,806
Come on.

855
01:30:52,509 --> 01:30:54,607
Okay. Okay, Gage.

856
01:30:54,609 --> 01:30:56,474
Daddy needs you
to stay in the car, okay?

857
01:30:56,476 --> 01:30:57,808
Don't open the door
for anyone.

858
01:30:57,810 --> 01:30:59,541
Listen to me, Gage,
not even for Ellie.

859
01:31:03,377 --> 01:31:06,942
You let me die in that road.
You did nothing.

860
01:31:06,944 --> 01:31:09,175
Just like you did
with your sister.

861
01:31:10,644 --> 01:31:12,208
I was scared.

862
01:31:23,179 --> 01:31:25,210
You're a liar.

863
01:31:25,212 --> 01:31:27,477
You prayed
your sister would die.

864
01:31:28,412 --> 01:31:29,844
I did.

865
01:31:31,546 --> 01:31:35,509
Remember when Daddy said
there was nothing after this?

866
01:31:35,511 --> 01:31:37,175
Well, he was wrong.

867
01:31:38,746 --> 01:31:40,843
But it's not heaven.

868
01:31:40,845 --> 01:31:43,777
And you're going there soon,
Mommy.

869
01:31:45,712 --> 01:31:47,976
Don't call me "Mommy."

870
01:31:51,512 --> 01:31:53,810
You're not my daughter.

871
01:31:56,746 --> 01:31:58,243
Ellie's dead.

872
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:01,278
Then go be with her!

873
01:32:03,514 --> 01:32:05,045
Rachel!

874
01:32:09,113 --> 01:32:12,345
Oh, God, Rach.
I got Gage.

875
01:32:12,347 --> 01:32:15,178
Don't bury me in that place.

876
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:16,177
What?

877
01:33:11,483 --> 01:33:13,381
Oh, fuck. Shit.

878
01:33:29,149 --> 01:33:30,447
Rachel!

879
01:33:32,417 --> 01:33:34,282
You're too late.

880
01:33:37,518 --> 01:33:39,249
Where's Mommy?

881
01:33:39,251 --> 01:33:42,417
Mommy's already
feasting on dirt.

882
01:33:43,252 --> 01:33:46,184
What have you done, El?
Come on.

883
01:33:48,051 --> 01:33:50,349
You started this, Daddy.

884
01:33:52,386 --> 01:33:54,384
When you moved us here.

885
01:33:56,685 --> 01:33:58,884
When you buried Church.

886
01:33:58,886 --> 01:34:00,950
When you buried me!

887
01:34:18,487 --> 01:34:20,184
Stop fighting, Daddy.

888
01:34:20,186 --> 01:34:22,117
It will be better this way.

889
01:34:43,454 --> 01:34:46,487
You're dead!
You're dead!

890
01:34:55,055 --> 01:34:57,320
You're dead!

891
01:34:59,055 --> 01:35:01,119
Please,
please, just stop.

892
01:35:06,889 --> 01:35:08,754
Get off!

893
01:35:08,756 --> 01:35:10,220
I thought we could
be a family.

894
01:35:10,222 --> 01:35:11,986
I wanted to be a family.

895
01:35:11,988 --> 01:35:13,554
But we can't.

896
01:35:13,556 --> 01:35:16,188
But we can, Daddy. We can.

897
01:36:40,758 --> 01:36:45,758
