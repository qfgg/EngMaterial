1
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,170
CHILDREN OF IRENA SENDLER

2
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,090
In the memory of all the known and unknown
who are, "Righteous Among the Nations".

3
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,180
Yes?

4
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,010
Yes.

5
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,160
Yes, I will come right away.

6
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,130
I will walk, so twenty minutes.

7
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,220
Please, stay calm.

8
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,070
Irenka?

9
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,200
It's all right, Mama.
Go back to sleep.

10
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,110
- Thank God, you are here.
- Where is she?

11
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,180
In the cupboard.

12
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,020
Tonight, when Krzysztof came home
the way our neighbours looked at him

13
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,030
we were betrayed. I just know.
I'm sorry, Irena.

14
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,140
If the Germans find us hiding a Jew,
they will shoot us.

15
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,150
Hello, Anna, it's Irena.

16
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,210
You do not need to be afraid.
And tonight...

17
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,160
you will stay with me.

18
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,240
Would you like that?

19
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,140
How many mothers do you have?

20
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,040
I just have one.

21
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,050
Already, I had three.

22
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,170
Shh.

23
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,110
Why do they not like me?

24
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,110
Who does not like you?

25
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,240
My mothers.

26
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,030
Your mothers love you.
And I love you.

27
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,080
And I will always love you.

28
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,060
Go to sleep.

29
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,180
- We have to go now.
- Here.

30
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,200
It is safe to take
her out in broad daylight?

31
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,030
She looks like one of us.
Are you worried?

32
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,020
Not one bit.

33
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,120
Mama, hmm?

34
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,010
- Ahh, good.
- Eva will love it.

35
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,060
It's perfect.

36
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,120
Mama! Take your medicine.

37
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,130
Mama, please.

38
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:13,170
You are so funny.
You're a wonderful girl.

39
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,160
The second doll with the long
locks was called Bella.

40
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,180
Come in Anna!

41
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,030
Anna, this is Miss Jadwiga.

42
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,030
Hello, sweetie.
Come in.

43
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,200
Thank you. Come in.

44
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,210
Anna, you can play with
Miss Jadwiga's children while

45
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,070
I find you a lovely place to live.
You're a good girl.

46
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,170
- Take care of her.
- Hello, sweetie.

47
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,090
She has passed outside the ghetto
all this time. There must be

48
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,210
- a Polish family who can take her.
- Not any we know personally.

49
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,160
I'll ask father Godlewski
he will know some we can trust.

50
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,110
- Wait. You mean now?
- His soup kitchen's on my way.

51
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,220
- You're going to the Ghetto?
- Yes. I will see you later.

52
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,160
Get out of here.

53
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,140
Irena Sendler, you work?

54
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,160
Department of Social Services.

55
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,160
I see that, my question is about today,
why are you here?

56
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,180
Inspection of the refugee centers.
Prevent the spread of typhus.

57
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,140
You Poles must solve this problem,
it's a disgrace.

58
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,080
Go in.

59
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,170
Next please, documents.

60
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,080
Only bread today, take it.
Go.

61
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,120
I told you once
I won't tell you again.

62
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,010
You're not hungry?

63
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,170
Please, please buy it from me.

64
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,070
Father Godlewski. Good morning.

65
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,200
Ah, Irena.

66
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,240
What do you hear?

67
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:38,060
In the last two weeks, they have filled
train cars of Jews in Luxemburg and

68
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,040
Vienna, deported them all
to the ghetto in Lodz - and here,

69
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,160
every day they bring more.

70
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,200
You know we are doing all we can to
help Jews survive outside the ghetto.

71
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,140
- Yes, I know, very well.
- And today I have a little girl

72
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,020
- and no Polish family to hide her.
- It's not easy for Poles either.

73
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,160
- Perhaps in your congregation?
- Irena, please...

74
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,170
...of all people you know
the risk for a Polish family.

75
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,020
Even so, is it not possible there are
some or even many Poles who want

76
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,020
to help but don't know how?

77
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,110
Yes, yes, yes. It is possible.

78
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,220
Eva.

79
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,120
Irena.

80
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,190
Come, come.

81
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,230
- Good morning, Hannah.
- Oh, Irenka.

82
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,100
Always such a faithful friend.

83
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,240
God bless you.

84
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,140
Rabbi Rozenfeld.

85
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,130
Dear Irena, how are you this fine day?

86
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,050
Is this work for a Rabbi?

87
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,170
We all must live with dignity,
especially in days of hatred.

88
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,150
Miss Irena! Miss Irena!

89
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:11,230
Karolyna! Or should I say, the famous
Miss Nijinska, Prima ballerina?

90
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,050
Do you know what I learned to do!
Do you want to see?

91
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,010
Of course, you must show me!

92
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,130
Brava!

93
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,010
- How is your mother?
- Well enough, if she behaves.

94
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,170
- And your Jacob?
- Last week he came back into

95
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,020
- the Ghetto to hug his daughter.
- And to kiss you, I'm sure.

96
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,060
Maybe yes, a little.

97
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,000
I brought a few things.

98
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,120
Let me, let me!

99
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,200
And this.

100
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,150
Irena, what do we have here?

101
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,150
You made this?

102
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,120
Can you imagine me putting
two stitches together?

103
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,220
- Then your mother.
- She misses you.

104
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,070
So do I.

105
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,170
My dearest friends in the whole world.

106
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,230
Please thank her.

107
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,230
Eva, I need to talk with you.

108
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,210
Over the last few weeks,
they have deported freight cars

109
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,140
of Jews from Austria to
the ghetto in Lodz.

110
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,000
We heard last night. The Jewish Council
says they will send to workcamps.

111
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,120
Eva, your Jewish Council was appointed by
Germans. How many years have we listened to

112
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,160
their terrible propaganda? What they say
about Jews, what they say

113
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,190
- they have in mind...
- It's just talk, rumor.

114
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,150
Who can believe it? These are
cultured people. Anyway, we're

115
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:05,150
almost five hundred thousand in this
Ghetto. What could they do?

116
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,120
Yes, yes... I know.

117
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,020
It's so confusing.

118
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:33,090
One day somebody says something
is true, another says it's not.

119
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,010
Every day I wake up, my body is cold.

120
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,040
We have to get you all out of here.

121
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,200
They would never leave.
I could never leave them.

122
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,240
I can find Polish families
willing to hide you.

123
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,140
Most people believe it's better
to stay all together, inside the wall.

124
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,010
I want you safe...

125
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,090
...all of you.
- Irena, what is safe?

126
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,170
Where?

127
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,210
Good morning, Miss Irena.

128
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,180
Good morning, Doctor Majkowski,
have you had a chance to consider my...

129
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,030
Yes, I have selected your friend,
Maria Debinska to join your department.

130
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,140
Thank you, doctor.

131
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,170
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Irena.

132
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,030
Maria, welcome to our little
department, thank you.

133
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,120
My thanks to you.

134
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,200
- Good morning, Miss Irena.
- You missed an exciting meeting.

135
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,110
Issued today, the new ration card.

136
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:42,040
2613 calories a day for Germans,
699 calories for Poles,

137
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,090
300 calories for residents of the
ghetto.

138
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,100
So we will have starvation along
with a Typhus epidemic.

139
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,040
And winter almost here.

140
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,230
We'll need to bring in food,
clothing, medicine - Maria,

141
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,150
talk to Doctor Majkowski, see how
much Typhus vaccine you can get.

142
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:00,240
Since The Occupation Jadwiga
has done a brilliant job of trying

143
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,180
to balance an impossible
budget.

144
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,020
But...

145
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,180
But, if we continue to spread our
services over every district in Warsaw,

146
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
we will not be helping anyone.

147
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,160
From now on we must focus
our full attention on the ghetto.

148
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,100
Excuse me, Miss Irena.
The Jewish Quarter is not our problem.

149
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:23,230
Why not?

150
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,030
The Germans put them
there to protect us.

151
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,160
Protect us from what?

152
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,080
Maria, you are a nurse,
you know very well.

153
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,120
What do I know, tell me?

154
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,220
They have lice, spread disease and...

155
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,070
You know what I'm talking about.

156
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:45,130
Danuta, how can half a million cramped
people stay in good health.

157
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,080
One reason, another reason
what does it matter.

158
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:57,150
All I know is I am not going to bring
Typhus home to my family.

159
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,170
Whatever it is you're thinking,

160
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,020
I am sorry - I can't be part of it.

161
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,020
Anyone else who does
not agree with this direction,

162
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,140
I will arrange a department transfer.

163
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,000
Stefania, you have only been
with us two months.

164
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,100
I have not yet been inside the walls,
but I know I must do it.

165
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,180
Stefania. We are at war.

166
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:19,210
You are a soldier now. A soldier
must be tough or she cannot fight.

167
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,210
Oh! Hold her.
Hold her still, good, good.

168
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,100
- Why do you bother?
- Because we want your child to survive.

169
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:18,210
If you want her to live, please,
take her from me, get her out of here.

170
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,130
I'm begging you,
take her outside the wall.

171
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,100
- I'm sorry.
- It's not possible.

172
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,240
Next!

173
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,220
Please, Mama, go back to bed.

174
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,000
I am fine. Do not worry.

175
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,130
What is it?

176
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,130
Tell me.

177
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,130
Irena?

178
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,090
Irenka, tell me what.

179
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:32,020
Today, I understood something.

180
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,130
Something about what?

181
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,210
I thought I was doing all I could

182
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,240
but the truth is I am doing nothing.

183
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,040
Nothing?

184
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,040
Is it my imagination
or was there a little Jewish child

185
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,120
sleeping in your bed last night.

186
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,120
One child is not enough!

187
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,020
Oh Irena, you are so like your father.

188
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,230
Little Anna has always lived
outside the Ghetto.

189
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,120
Inside the wall there are thousands
of children who could be rescued.

190
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,020
Take them out?

191
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,060
Is that what you're thinking?

192
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,230
Past the Gestapo?

193
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,170
German soldiers, Jewish police?

194
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,100
How is that possible?

195
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,120
You are a social worker,

196
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,180
a good social worker

197
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:49,030
with the biggest heart I know but to
risk everything for something you know

198
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,190
nothing about...

199
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,190
I remember what father used to say.

200
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:14,000
You see a man drowning,
you must try to save him,

201
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,210
even if you can't swim.

202
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,230
For you?

203
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,060
Two loaves, please.

204
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,130
- You are a Jew.
- No, I'm not.

205
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,100
One of those filthy little
smugglers from the ghetto.

206
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,150
No, I'm Polish.

207
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,180
Let's see you make
the sign of the cross!

208
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,240
Let's go!

209
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,020
With this red hair,
you do not think you look Jewish?

210
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,190
- And get yourself a cap.
- Yes, miss.

211
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,180
If you want to survive outside
the Ghetto you must lie with

212
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,040
more conviction. And learn how to
cross yourself. Like this. Now, you.

213
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,190
Again. Quickly!

214
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,170
Very good. Get out of here.

215
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,070
Wait!

216
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,240
Who is it?

217
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,050
Hide!
They're coming here. Shh.

218
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,040
I'm afraid.

219
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,160
I want to help children
inside, the, ghetto.

220
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,090
It is very dangerous - too dangerous.

221
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:48,020
Yes, probably, but what would it take?

222
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,240
Well, I suppose an organized network
of people you trust, enough money

223
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,030
for each child's room and board.

224
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:59,090
And if you agree, more Polish families
willing to hide a Jewish child.

225
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,200
- I will try to find some.
- What about identity cards?

226
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:07,130
That shouldn't be hard, if I destroy
some of the parish death certificates,

227
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,170
issue new baptismal certificates.

228
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:13,090
That is all the proof Germans
need for an identity card.

229
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,210
The only thing is,
how to get them out?

230
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,050
There is someone you must talk to...
a young man who smuggles

231
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,140
potatoes from the Aryan side,
he works in Korczak's orphanage.

232
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,130
Ask him to introduce you
to Stefan Zgrzembski.

233
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,040
- Zgrzembski?
- Yes, that's him.

234
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,060
Guten morgen, Father.

235
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,050
Doctor Korczak, how many children
live inside the ghetto?

236
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,100
Including all the ones who live in
the streets? There must be at least

237
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,230
eighty thousand, half under
the age of ten. Be brave now.

238
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,080
Have you ever tried to get any out?

239
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,100
Out to where?

240
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,150
Not so many Poles want to hide
a Jewish child.

241
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:12,060
And how many Jews would let their
children live with Gentiles?

242
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,100
What about orphans, these ones?

243
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,100
Even if you found a way, most of mine
could not survive outside the wall.

244
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,200
- Why not?
- She only speaks Yiddish. Is that not right?

245
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,000
They all speak excellent Yiddish.
Polish, that's another matter.

246
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,190
And they are all beautiful

247
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,140
but most are not passable as Aryan.

248
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,100
Irena?

249
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,180
Oh, Stefan.

250
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,190
It's been a long time.

251
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,080
Irena is here to see you.

252
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,170
You attended my classes together.

253
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,160
Yes, a long time ago.

254
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,190
Let me deal with these

255
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,200
horrible little savages!

256
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:15,190
I have found something here with
Doctor Korczak and the children.

257
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,020
I am glad.
But you still smuggle potatoes.

258
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:26,200
Irena Sendler,
always straight to the point.

259
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,200
Tell me how.

260
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:36,120
I know a few safe ways to get out,
the courthouse has two ways out,

261
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,190
one from the ghetto side
and one from the Aryan side.

262
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,230
That's in the ghetto, from the Aryan
side it's by Ogrodowa street.

263
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,190
I...
I know a man with the key.

264
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,030
- The other ways?
- I can show you.

265
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:25,230
The main sewer line goes all the way down
to the central junction under Gdanski station.

266
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,080
- And from there?
- Anywhere you want.

267
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,180
One line goes under Okopowa Street,

268
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,080
another under goes under Marszalkowska,

269
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,110
third line goes under
New Town and Miodowa Street.

270
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,220
The Germans keep the courts so busy
they have forgotten this entrance.

271
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,220
You remember our summer walks
along the Vistula River?

272
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,060
Every step.

273
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,000
Shall we?

274
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,160
Welcome to Warsaw.

275
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,020
Thank you, Stefan.

276
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,050
We will use this way first.

277
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,070
- Be careful.
- You know me.

278
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:46,140
That is what I mean.
Be careful about yourself.

279
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,030
Hurry up, hurry up.

280
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,140
Hello.

281
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,130
You remember me?
What's your name?

282
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,140
The boy who sits beside
you every day.

283
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,230
Is he your brother?

284
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,110
He died.

285
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,240
I'm very sorry.

286
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,020
Can you tell me where you live?

287
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,120
All right.

288
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,010
Come with me.

289
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,030
We have hot soup.
Just made for you.

290
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,190
Are you going to get her
changed in here?

291
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,040
Yes. I think it's a good idea.

292
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,030
- Oh, you are so hungry.
- All right.

293
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:05,010
We need to do something
about her hair.

294
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:08,160
- Can we braid it?
- Please help if you would. All right.

295
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,030
- Lets take this skirt off.
- Good girl.

296
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:13,190
And try a beret.

297
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,010
It will keep you warm.

298
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:20,180
Ah, much better. Good girl.
You look so beautiful.

299
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,110
Ready for a little walk in the
courthouse?

300
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,060
My name is Miriam.

301
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,230
Come along, sweetie, we must...

302
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,190
Such a little trouble-maker.

303
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,220
You have no idea. Come along,
sweetheart.

304
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,010
- You want to play with this?
- Thank you.

305
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,170
- Rabbi.
- For me?

306
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,220
Such a dashing fashion for a Rabbi.

307
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,240
And for you, Miss Nijinska!

308
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,160
Oh yes, I remember this book!

309
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,020
- Come in. Oh, yes. Come in, come in!
- Thank you Rabbi.

310
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,230
So many people without shelter.

311
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,150
Eva. Hannah, come here.

312
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,210
Take this place.

313
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,040
Shall we read a little bit?

314
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,020
Why do I have to be a Jew?

315
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,010
You were born into the Jewish faith.

316
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:23,210
What if I want to be something else?

317
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,070
I don't like being
hated by everybody.

318
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,150
Everybody does not hate you.

319
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,160
Yes they do. You know it's true.

320
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,130
What did we ever do?

321
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,140
It's not fair.

322
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,170
No, It's not.

323
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:04,200
There are ways to get out of the ghetto,
ways that are still safe.

324
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,220
- I cannot.
- Yes, I know.

325
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,120
But I've been thinking about Karolyna.

326
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,040
Karolyna?

327
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,210
We know Polish families who
can be trusted, several priests,

328
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,200
- convents in the countryside.
- Stop, Irena!

329
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:22,000
Let me ask you one thing,
tell me from your heart.

330
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:26,000
How is it possible
for a mother to give up a child? How?

331
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:31,210
Now I must ask you something -
a terrible thing.

332
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,120
No, no don't, please...

333
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:38,160
If it happened that the rumors are true

334
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:43,070
and if for Karolyna you had to
choose between life and death...

335
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:48,200
- Please, I cannot face it, I cannot.
- You can, Eva - and you must.

336
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,150
Irenka. Do you know what this
author says about life?

337
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:14,080
- Mama, please, I have to go.
- Please.

338
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:18,000
Take one moment to breathe.
Please.

339
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,190
What this writer says is in order
to have a happy life,

340
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,240
you must exercise your own free will.

341
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,220
Interesting. Bye-bye.

342
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:35,010
Which is why I would never tell you
not to do something or suggest

343
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,090
to you that I might possibly be worried.
I would never do such a thing.

344
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,010
No matter what happens.

345
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,020
Thank you, Mama.

346
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,140
Thank you.

347
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,110
- What has happened?
- All the Social Service programs

348
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,110
- have been suspended.
- Who has access?

349
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:13,150
From now on only nurses, doctors,
workers in the Health Department.

350
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:29,180
Today I was told I am officially
responsible for any further spread

351
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,190
of Typhus.

352
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:33,210
You know
it is impossible, what do they...

353
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,200
Of course it's impossible.
That's their point.

354
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:42,050
If I cannot help myself,
how can I help you?

355
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,180
I will need Health Department
work passes, four - no, no

356
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,200
maybe five nurse's uniforms.

357
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,120
It that all?

358
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,200
Perhaps a larger vehicle.

359
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,070
We will seek orphans and homeless
in the market area and specific families

360
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:04,080
we already know are willing
to let us place their children...

361
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:08,240
One of Doctor Majkowski's drivers
has volunteered, Piotr Lipinski.

362
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,030
Miss Irena.

363
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,050
- Hello.
- Hello.

364
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:15,010
Thank you, Piotr.
You understand the risk?

365
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:18,120
Only small problems,
but I am not too worried.

366
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,200
We will take my disinfectant truck.

367
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:30,140
- I beg you, keep them together.
- I'm sorry, it's not possible.

368
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,120
Sister Jolanta, please understand
whatever happens they will always

369
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,020
have each other.

370
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,230
One slip, one word in Yiddish.
They could give each other away.

371
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,060
How will I ever find them?
How will they find each other.

372
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:48,120
The important thing is to survive.

373
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:11,010
Take her. Please go!

374
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,120
Tell me, what do you want
to be when you grow up?

375
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,190
A priest.

376
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,150
Yes, very good, that's perfect!

377
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,030
You can do it.

378
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,180
Papers? Vehicle check.

379
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,160
What do you have in the truck?

380
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:20,120
- We have a problem. Vehicle check.
- All right. Let's go for a walk.

381
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:39,070
Our Father who art in Heaven,

382
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,150
Hallowed be thy name...

383
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:45,110
Thy kingdom come.

384
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:50,120
Thy will be done on earth,
as it is in Heaven.

385
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:56,120
Give us this day our daily bread.

386
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,050
And forgive us our trespasses,

387
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,060
as we forgive those who

388
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,070
trespass against us...

389
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,200
Children!

390
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:23,010
Let's show Miss Irena
how we know our bedtime prayers.

391
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:27,210
Now I lay me down to sleep,

392
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:32,050
I pray the Lord my soul to keep;

393
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:36,140
And if I die before I wake,

394
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:40,180
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

395
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,230
First month. Room and board.

396
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,020
Is there anything else I should know?

397
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,020
She had a brother.

398
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,150
- This is Adam.
- Hello, Adam!

399
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,030
- Does he speak Polish?
- Perfectly.

400
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,210
Irena.

401
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,210
Jacob!

402
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,190
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to frighten you.

403
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,180
Is Eva all right, Karolyna?

404
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,140
Yes, everything's the same.

405
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:28,000
Eva has met with community leaders.
They want to speak about

406
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:30,100
- hiding their children.
- Of course.

407
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,210
You had a good instinct,

408
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,080
to rescue Karolyna,

409
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:40,220
it's risky but there is no other way.

410
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,140
And what if my wife and I do
not survive the war.

411
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,060
Who will claim our son?

412
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,200
I keep a record of every child.

413
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:53,130
And if this record or you are destroyed?

414
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:56,000
What guarantee can you give
our children will survive?

415
00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:00,120
I can't guarantee anything,
not even escape from the Ghetto.

416
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:05,010
Babies pass easily but if they
can speak, they must speak Polish,

417
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,160
know Catholic hymns and prayers.

418
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:09,230
My children only speak Yiddish.

419
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,120
I understand this is very difficult.

420
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,210
They will need to memorize
their new Christian names,

421
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:19,210
their new home address,
the entire history of their new family,

422
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,240
harmless gossip about
their neighbors - all of it.

423
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:26,120
What you are saying is we must
teach our children to lie.

424
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,240
To survive, yes.

425
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:33,130
- What about conversion?
- I make it clear I do not wish this.

426
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:37,160
You may not wish it, but on young,
impressionable minds,

427
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:42,020
time and education will surely
dim any memories of their past.

428
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,070
In this case, he will grow up
a good Christian.

429
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:51,210
For mothers and fathers, to give away
a child is an unthinkable act.

430
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:54,160
This is the truth.

431
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,060
The other truth is Hitler calls Jews
a cancer on the nation and speaks

432
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,000
openly about the annihilation of every
Jew on the continent.

433
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:08,160
Outside these walls there are
Poles prepared to risk their lives

434
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,120
to save your children.

435
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:17,070
We Jews - We Jews have survived
in the hardest times.

436
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:20,140
And now we are faced with
another extinction.

437
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:25,010
Perhaps this time we can only
be saved by a new generation of Jews.

438
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:31,110
How wise are we to take away
the birthright of this new generation?

439
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:37,190
I recommend we
consider this proposal.

440
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,150
Thank you.

441
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,070
I am not in favor of sending our
children into such a dubious world.

442
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:53,110
Now America is in the war. This news
favors our liberation and for this,

443
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:55,230
we should wait.

444
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:03,130
Our dear friend has presented us
with the difficult truths of our time.

445
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:09,110
We should thank
her for her courage to speak.

446
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,230
Quickly.

447
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,010
Jasio go back,
there's another bag!

448
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:59,110
- No! I will not.
- Go get it!

449
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,010
Let me go!!!

450
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:10,220
No, No!!!

451
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:29,110
Sister Jolanta. Walk with me.
Please, please.

452
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:34,000
My name is Michal Laski,
I know who you are and what you do.

453
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,090
The man you saw just now.
He is Untersturmfuhrer Karl Brandt.

454
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:40,160
He is in charge of Jewish Resettlement.
We are told in a few months they will

455
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:43,090
begin to send everyone in the
ghetto to work camps in the East.

456
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:47,130
- Why do you tell me this?
- I have a son - Jasio, 10 years old. His...

457
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,140
His mother died last year.
He has no one.

458
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,200
- He has you.
- He lives with smugglers,

459
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:59,130
goes under the wall at night,
risks his life every day.

460
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:01,230
I want to get him out before
he's caught and shot.

461
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,040
If from time to time I help you,
will you help me?

462
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,200
Mr. Laski, I will help your son
without conditions.

463
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:10,100
If from time to time you help me,
you would be helping many children,

464
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,150
- including your son.
- There's a passage through a brick wall

465
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:16,160
on Twarda Street. On the other side
in the abandoned house.

466
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:19,050
Does your Jasio have red hair like you?

467
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:22,000
Yes but thanks to God
he now wears a cap.

468
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,150
You know about this new German unit
now in charge of the Ghetto.

469
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:36,020
Yes, for work camp resettlement.

470
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,010
Stefan, do not be like this.

471
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,200
You know how many thousands of Jews
have disappeared from the Lodz Ghetto.

472
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:49,150
Vanished. And to where?
Some place they call Resettlement.

473
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:52,140
Doctor Korczak told me to prepare
for the worst.

474
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,190
If there is no other way,
that is what I must do.

475
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:03,170
Where is everyone?
What has happened?

476
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:07,090
Books, bank accounts, invoices,
reciepts they've taken over all of it.

477
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,080
Who?

478
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,210
Guten tag.

479
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,230
Amen.

480
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:47,070
Karolyna, can you tell us why this night
is different from all other nights?

481
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:24,220
Sweetheart?

482
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:29,210
I know why tonight is different.

483
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:34,220
Tonight is different because once
we were slaves and now we are free!

484
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,040
Jacob!

485
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:56,080
Papa!

486
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,200
I am not here for Sedar.

487
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,060
I have some news you must hear.

488
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:06,140
Eva.

489
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:13,030
The underground received information
verified by Polish train machinists,

490
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:16,160
some lucky Jews who escaped,
even from a few good Germans.

491
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:19,030
They all say camps are being built.

492
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:23,130
Concentration camps, work camps.
Auschwitz is like this, we know.

493
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:27,030
You remember the thousands of Jews
who were deported from Lodz,

494
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:28,240
the ones who disappeared.

495
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:34,010
Last week 300 train cars of clothing
returned for sorting.

496
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,090
What else, Jacob?

497
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,190
We hear rumors they are building
another camp. Treblinka.

498
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Only 90 kilometers from Warsaw where
there are fake station platforms,

499
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,230
underground bunkers.

500
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:55,160
One thing they have not
constructed - barracks.

501
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:02,150
No barracks, I do not understand.
Why no barracks?

502
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:05,060
Mama, they do not...

503
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:09,200
In such a camp,
the only purpose is death.

504
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,170
We need to find a way
to get you out of the Ghetto.

505
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:24,010
Get out, you say! Get out how?
Get out to where?

506
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:27,060
Papa,

507
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,220
Irena has made
an offer for Karolyna.

508
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,180
There is a convent in the countryside.

509
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:41,130
This is not possible.
She will be converted! Never!

510
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,020
Chaim!

511
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:48,210
These many months
I have said nothing.

512
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:52,150
Now I will give my opinion.

513
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:59,000
Our dearest Irena has risked
her life for us many times.

514
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,230
Now, she has made an offer for
Karolyna we must accept.

515
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,130
- I believe a convent is best.
- No, it must not be done.

516
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,110
Chaim Rozenfeld!

517
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:14,180
You have loved me since I was a little
girl in pigtails and after these

518
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,090
many years you know very well

519
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:21,070
an opinion from me
is not a suggestion.

520
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,080
Next time,
when you come she will be prepared.

521
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:48,100
Irena, the Underground knows
what you're doing.

522
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,210
They want to help.

523
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:53,030
There's a man you should speak to,
goes by the name Trojan.

524
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:55,030
24 Zurawia Street.

525
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:57,110
Zurawia, 24.

526
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:03,130
For Karolyna, I promise,
I will do everything...

527
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:06,060
We know that, Irena. We know.

528
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:21,020
I'm Trojan.

529
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,020
- And I'm Victor.
- Who do you represent?

530
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,020
- Konrad Zegota.
- Why me? What do you know?

531
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,080
You created an efficient network,
saved many children.

532
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:29,200
So far no one has been betrayed
or exposed.

533
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:32,010
We, with the Underground,
have a good deal of money,

534
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:34,110
and contacts.
It could be a good arrangement.

535
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:38,180
- This money, where does it come from?
- Polish government in exile in London.

536
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,000
- To help Jews?
- Zegota exists only for that.

537
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:44,120
- Who is Konrad Zegota?
- He does not exist.

538
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:47,190
Which makes him hard to find,
especially for Germans

539
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,150
who will never stop looking.

540
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:52,220
What is your proposal?

541
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:57,050
We will help you
rescue children. If you agree.

542
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:03,030
I agree.

543
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:08,030
We'll give you money,
Aryan papers, work records.

544
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:12,000
You'll get them while picking up
the linen from the laundry at Bracka street,

545
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:14,030
near the Three Crosses Square.

546
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,230
This will be our contact point.

547
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:39,210
- Looks like we're back in business.
- Let me count.

548
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,120
Look. Identification cards.

549
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:47,110
Very good work. These will do.

550
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:04,000
- What's going on?
- They're deporting adults and children.

551
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,140
- Orphanages?
- Yes.

552
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,210
Stefan.

553
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,130
Stefan.

554
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:56,200
You must get out.
Do it, for me, for the children.

555
00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:00,100
You must see and remember
and tell the world.

556
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:03,010
- No.
- Go. Go on. Quickly.

557
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:05,010
Now.
Go, go, quickly!

558
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:06,220
You know how to do it.

559
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,160
May God walk with you. Go! Go!

560
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:57,110
Thanks be to God!

561
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:59,090
They took all the children.

562
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:04,180
I saw them, I couldn't
do anything about it.

563
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:07,070
I've heard this news.

564
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,110
Who told you?

565
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:12,100
Your friend.

566
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:44,140
Let's go son, don't be afraid
I'll hide you to keep you warm.

567
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,040
Are you ok?

568
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:32,040
- There is a chance today.
- Please, one more day, just one.

569
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,080
Now it is possible,
tomorrow is uncertain.

570
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:41,110
We can't do it now.
Please, one more day, just one.

571
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:46,020
Now it's possible.
Tomorrow is uncertain.

572
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:49,050
Tomorrow he will be ready,

573
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:50,180
I promise.

574
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:05,200
You mustn't lock the door.

575
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:10,050
Jews who refuse to leave
the building will be executed.

576
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,230
Run downstairs, run.

577
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:01,090
No more courthouse entrance.

578
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:05,110
A big problem.

579
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:32,060
Oh, stop fiddling,
You're making me nervous.

580
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:34,160
You need to get more rest.

581
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:38,080
For Heaven's sake,
if I'd had a stroke, I'd be dead.

582
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:42,020
I'm telling you, I got up too fast,
I fainted. That's all.

583
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,180
You are in bad condition,
I'm not joking.

584
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:51,010
You are a very brave young woman.

585
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:59,090
Stefan?

586
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:07,010
There's room for two.

587
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:08,140
What are you doing?

588
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:11,230
A little carpentry.

589
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:20,240
What do you think?

590
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:25,190
I feel a little bit confined.
I think I need to get out.

591
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:29,190
It's, it's not opening.
It's stuck.

592
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,040
It, it, hmm...

593
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,000
Can you please try? Please.

594
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:38,060
- It's stuck from the outside.
- No. Please, open it. Please.

595
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:55,050
OK. All right, I need to,
we need to get out of here.

596
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:57,150
We must call your mother.

597
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:01,150
Mama?

598
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:03,190
Irenka?

599
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,140
Jasio?

600
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:50,020
Jasio?

601
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:55,090
Do you remember?

602
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:05,110
I can't leave them. I will not.

603
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:09,050
You, you have done a good thing,
Jasio, a very important thing

604
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:12,140
and it may be hard to
understand but the future will

605
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,030
need your compassion
even more than now.

606
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:18,020
Which is why
tomorrow you must save yourself.

607
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,120
You know the coal room?
Where the Rabbis study?

608
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:27,170
Two o'clock tomorrow my friend
will meet you there.

609
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:29,170
She wears bright red lipstick.

610
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:33,190
Be strong, say your good byes.

611
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,000
I will never see you again.

612
01:05:57,050 --> 01:06:00,140
I will never see any of you again,
any of you.

613
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,160
Yes, you will, I promise.

614
01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:08,020
No, you can't promise.
Nobody can promise anything any more!

615
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,180
Darling. Darling, darling,

616
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,160
I love you with all my heart.

617
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:21,050
My love for you is so big and
strong it will never go away.

618
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:23,230
It will always be with you.

619
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:29,150
Whenever you think of me, I will
be there, right over your shoulder.

620
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:31,130
Forever and ever.

621
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:49,170
- Your name?
- Aniela Procowna.

622
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:51,230
- And where are you from?
- Krakow, Poland.

623
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,100
But when I grow up I want
to live in Bavaria.

624
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,140
My uncle says Germany
is much more beautiful...

625
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,120
- Your name?
- Aniela Procowna.

626
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,100
- And where are you from?
- Krakow, Poland.

627
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:04,000
But when I grow up I want
to live in Bavaria. My uncle...

628
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,110
Quick, quick in!

629
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:48,200
Out, out. Get out of here.
Out, get out! Out. Out!

630
01:07:57,090 --> 01:07:58,100
I will not!

631
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:00,160
Jasio?

632
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:18,160
Mr. Laski!

633
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,000
Out, out!

634
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:25,220
You - come with me!

635
01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:28,240
And you, come! Move.

636
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:37,090
Get away from here - but slowly.

637
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:39,220
- I saw Jasio. He will get out.
- Thank you.

638
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:43,050
Maria.

639
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,100
Jasio?

640
01:08:55,150 --> 01:08:56,100
I know.

641
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:58,180
Come. Come.

642
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:11,130
Jasio!

643
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,200
Jasio!

644
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,090
Jasio!

645
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:16,190
Jasio! No!

646
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:20,000
Let me through.

647
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:22,160
Jasio!

648
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:24,220
Jasio!

649
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:26,080
Jasio!

650
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,090
Papa, papa.

651
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:32,160
- I tried to get out but they...
- It's all right, it's all right.

652
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:35,050
All that matters is that
we are together.

653
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:39,210
Hold onto to me so
we don't get separated.

654
01:09:41,070 --> 01:09:42,180
Faster, faster.

655
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:57,190
Hold on to me, hold on to me.
- Simon!

656
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:08,210
There has been a mistake!
No! He's my son!

657
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:11,020
My family is protected!

658
01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:12,120
All Jews inside!

659
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:15,020
My family is protected!

660
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:16,180
Everyone inside!

661
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:19,200
Papa!

662
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,090
Jasio!

663
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,100
Papa! Papa!

664
01:12:07,130 --> 01:12:10,160
Jasio, I understand now why you
lived in the street.

665
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:14,020
It was God's way to make you strong
so you can survive.

666
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,020
Here, give him my sweater.

667
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:26,220
I cannot do it. I'm afraid, Papa.
Please, I can't.

668
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:30,190
- Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
- No. I can't. Please. I'm afraid.

669
01:12:35,170 --> 01:12:37,110
Jasio, listen to me.

670
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,180
Land on your elbows,
keep your head down.

671
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:43,170
- Come with me.
- Keep your head down and stay

672
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:46,060
still until you see the train is gone.

673
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:47,130
I love you, Papa.

674
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:50,210
Then you must run as fast
as you can into the trees.

675
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:54,020
I love you, Papa. Please! Come with me.
I don't want to please!

676
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,170
Shh. Shh! Be quiet! You must be brave.

677
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:03,070
I can't! Papa! I can't.
Please come with me. Please.

678
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:04,160
One.

679
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,200
- No! Please!
- One, two.

680
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:07,220
Papa!

681
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:09,110
Three!

682
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:13,070
...my God.

683
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:30,160
Look at that.

684
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,200
Thank you.

685
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:35,150
My darling.

686
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:03,090
Children! Children, shh.

687
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:06,120
Children, this is Anielka.
She will be joining us.

688
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:18,120
Please don't leave me, please.

689
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:26,210
This war will end and you will survive
to be a mother and tell your story.

690
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:30,160
And one day, if we are both very clever,

691
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:35,220
I will find you.
I promise.

692
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:40,010
Now there is something you
must promise me.

693
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:43,220
You must promise that
you will always remember that

694
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:47,200
you are the famous Miss Nijinska,

695
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:50,080
Prima ballerina.

696
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,110
I love you.

697
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:00,100
Me too.

698
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,240
Go on, now.

699
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:49,070
Shouldn't you have taught
me this as a child?

700
01:16:49,130 --> 01:16:52,140
- Over and under.
- It's beautiful.

701
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:56,210
- You are so mean.
- It is a mess do it again.

702
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:59,210
- He's telling the truth.
- It's hideous.

703
01:17:00,030 --> 01:17:02,040
This is never going to be...

704
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:05,150
I give up.

705
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:11,190
Gestapo.

706
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:20,060
I will do it.

707
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:36,120
Irena Sendler?

708
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:37,170
I am.

709
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:51,130
- Look in the bathroom and kitchen.

710
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:07,090
Do you have Jews here?

711
01:18:08,010 --> 01:18:10,120
Of course not.
It's against the law.

712
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:14,060
We'll find out.

713
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:34,020
You will come with us.

714
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:37,130
Let me get a few things.

715
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,150
There's no need.

716
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:44,110
Irena Sendler, good afternoon.

717
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:49,020
I work for
Department of Social Services.

718
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:50,160
I know. I know.

719
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:08,140
Your father was a doctor,
worked with Jews.

720
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:13,110
- He worked with anyone who was sick.
- Yes. Until the Jews gave him Typhus.

721
01:20:33,130 --> 01:20:35,020
Who is Konrad Zegota?

722
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:37,170
Who?

723
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,200
Who is Konrad Zegota?

724
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:56,080
I don't know.

725
01:20:58,060 --> 01:21:00,060
Who is Konrad Zegota?

726
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:03,070
I don't know.

727
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:08,120
You have been denounced
by many people.

728
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:12,180
For example,
the little shop where you pick up

729
01:21:12,230 --> 01:21:16,060
your laundry on Bracka Street near
Three Crosses Square.

730
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:19,010
We know you are not so involved
with these criminals.

731
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:22,160
And if you tell us where to find
this man you will not be executed.

732
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:13,210
Sendler, out!

733
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:16,020
What does it mean?

734
01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:11,050
Sendler. Dentist.

735
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:26,220
ZEGOTA WILL HELP.
You're wasting your time and mine.

736
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:31,130
I'm ordered to place a dressing,
I place a dressing.

737
01:23:31,190 --> 01:23:34,080
For what? She will be
dead in the morning.

738
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:36,240
I do what I'm told, that's all.

739
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:24,160
Stefania?

740
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:26,180
You're alive!

741
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:31,200
I swear, I told them nothing.
I was quiet as a mouse.

742
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:35,090
- You know I would never betray you.
- As a good soldier.

743
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:38,000
- Yes.
- A good soldier.

744
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:42,100
You have done very well.

745
01:24:45,090 --> 01:24:46,190
Everyone out! Out!

746
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:02,140
Not you!

747
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:04,140
No! No, wait. Wait!

748
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:18,180
Aim!

749
01:25:19,210 --> 01:25:20,180
Fire!

750
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,110
Get away from here! Go! Go!

751
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:28,180
Go!

752
01:25:28,230 --> 01:25:32,040
But, I, I don't have
my identification card!

753
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:36,000
Stupid woman! You are dead! With them.
Go! Run away! Get out!

754
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:59,050
Irena!

755
01:26:05,230 --> 01:26:06,210
Viktor.

756
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:14,080
They'll find out.
And they'll look for you.

757
01:26:15,150 --> 01:26:17,000
I'll be safe.

758
01:26:17,110 --> 01:26:21,020
Your mother is right,
your feet need a specialist.

759
01:26:21,070 --> 01:26:24,100
I know it's hard but please
try not to walk too much.

760
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,150
Promise me...

761
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:45,170
you won't come to my funeral.

762
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:51,170
- Mama, don't say such things.
- Promise me.

763
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,160
Irenka.

764
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:07,200
Can I tell you something.

765
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:09,190
I'm...

766
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:11,030
proud...

767
01:27:11,090 --> 01:27:12,120
of you.

768
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:13,170
Very proud

769
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:18,140
So many I could not save.

770
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:23,090
You've done a good and decent thing.

771
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:27,070
In this world that's not so bad.

772
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:30,080
It's time.

773
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:36,140
We must be in the mountains
before dark.

774
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:43,210
Mama.

775
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,020
Don't worry,

776
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:50,080
I'll be fine.

777
01:27:57,030 --> 01:27:58,060
Go.

778
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:24,220
Wait, Irena.

779
01:28:25,190 --> 01:28:26,120
Trojan.

780
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:28,180
Thank you so much for all
you've done.

781
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:30,160
No. Thank you.

782
01:28:31,170 --> 01:28:35,070
There's something
Konrad Zegota must have.

783
01:28:39,130 --> 01:28:40,200
They're all here.

784
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:43,190
Every child.

785
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:46,120
Where we hid them.

786
01:28:47,070 --> 01:28:48,180
When all this is over,

787
01:28:49,050 --> 01:28:52,160
they must be returned
to whatever remains of their families.

788
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:54,120
I will do it. I promise.

789
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:55,230
Thank you.

790
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:17,210
From now on you are Klara Dabrowska.

791
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:33,030
Once upon a time,
there was a little girl

792
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:39,030
I am so fond of stories
that begin that way.

793
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:55,150
I have kielbasa, bread...

794
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:58,140
- You like?
- Yes, I do.

795
01:29:58,200 --> 01:29:59,170
Good!

796
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:05,030
- First, you must come meet my pigs.
- Really Piotr, that's not necessary.

797
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:12,160
One thing I can say about town folk,
they make terrible farmers.

798
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:14,060
Please, let me down.

799
01:30:32,020 --> 01:30:33,150
Oh, thank God.

800
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:43,210
- Are you all right?
- Now, yes

801
01:30:59,010 --> 01:31:00,220
We must fight for what is good.

802
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:03,150
Good must prevail.

803
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:07,050
It must prevail and I believe in this.

804
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:09,150
As long as I'm alive...

805
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:11,190
as long as I have strength...

806
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,200
I will say good is best.

807
01:31:15,090 --> 01:31:16,140
Love,

808
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:18,040
tolerance

809
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:20,160
and humility

810
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,130
- -that's it.
