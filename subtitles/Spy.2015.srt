00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,820
炸弹在哪儿
Tell me where the bomb is?

19
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,380
给你十秒  不然你死定了
10 seconds or you're dead.

20
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,440
有意思
Interesting. You see.

21
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,090
我和手下的人藏炸弹时
When my men and I hid it.

22
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,900
吩咐他们除掉所有知情人
I made sure to erase any witnesses.

23
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,890
然后我把他们也都干掉了
And then I erased the erasers.

24
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,390
也就是说
Which means.

25
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,020
现在只有我一个人知道
I'm the only one who knows...

26
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,460
那个危险无比  简单便携的核武器
just where that dangerously compact

27
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,480
究竟被藏在了哪里
and transportable nuke is.

28
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,710
所以
So.

29
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,170
我觉得我不止有十秒钟
I'll say I have more than 10 seconds.

30
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,800
既然如此
Well then. In that case.

31
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,060
我建议你最好...啊啾

33
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,940
我的天哪  搞...
Oh my God. What...

34
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,330
你搞什么啊
Why did you do that?

35
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,510
我又不是故意的  这里到处都是花粉
I didn't do it on purpose. There's like a ton of pollen in here.

36
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,150
真是要了老命了  你没吃过敏药吗
Oh God. Christmas on a cracker. Did you take your medicine.

37
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,350
-我忘在飞机上了  -今天早上我告诉过你
- I forgot it on the plane. - I told you this morning

38
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,630
我在你所有外套里都放了一份
I put extra in all your jackets.

39
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,630
是吗
You did.

40
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,410
真棒  该死
Great. Shit.

41
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,750
-谢了  -我跟你讲
- Thanks. - No. You know what.

42
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,250
这全都怪我  我之前听到你擤鼻涕来着
That's on me because I heard you sniffled a while ago

43
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,390
但是我没放在心上  所以
and I did nothing with that information. So.

44
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,490
这人算是我杀的吧  好了
It's-That's blood on my hands. Really, okay.

45
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,090
话说有三个人进来了
You know what? You got 3 coming in.

46
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,330
从后门赶紧出去  快点
Get out the back door now. Move.

47
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,690
这里有人吗
Anybody in here?

48
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,370
拐角那边过来一个
Yeah, we got 1 coming around the corner now.

49
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,270
有三个人从你身后的那扇门里走进来了
Your 3 guests are coming out of the door behind you right now.

50
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,420
六点钟方向
Watch your 6.

51
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,510
-一拖三  -好棒哦
- Yahtzee. - Oh, zinger. Heh-heh

52
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,350
应该多带点子弹来
Should have brought more bullets.

53
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,290
我还以为这是碎巧克力
I thought they were chocolate sprinkles

54
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,160
平时我可以成把成把的吃
which I would eat normally by the fistful.

55
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,220
但这个尝起来的味道难以形容
But this tasted like, there's no other way to say it really.

56
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,020
像老鼠屎
Like a rat sauce.

57
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,180
各位  你们能小声点吗
Hey guys. Can you please keep it down.

58
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,530
不幸的是天花板里又有耗子了
Look. Unfortunately there's vermin in the ceiling again.

59
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,900
我也不想这么说  但它们
And I hate to say it but they-

60
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,890
它们在蛋糕上拉得到处都是
well they pooped all over your cake.

61
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,060
-往左走  -不
- Am I going left? - No.

62
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,560
你往右拐  沿着通道走
Okay. I need you to go right. And head down the tunnel.

63
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,100
右边来了一个
You got 1 coming around to your right,

64
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,660
后面还跟着一群
and he's got a swarm behind him.

65
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,880
-姑娘你真棒  -也没有啦
- That's my girl. - Oh, I don't know.

66
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,580
小心后面
Watch your back.

67
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,770

-你发现啦  -看起来很有弹性
- You noticed? - You just seemed looser

75
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,300
你的屁股  我是说从动作方面来说
in your hips. I mean athletically...speaking.

76
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,360
我也不晓得
I don't know.

77
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,370
你的动作看起来很流畅
I guess you don't seem so awkward.

78
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,770
-直走吗  -不  走台阶
- Going straight? - No. Go right up the stairs.

79
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,290
在第一个拐角你会发现一个小伙伴
You're going to find a little friend on the first landing.

80
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,710
-多谢你的协助  -上面没人了
- Thanks for your help. - Okay, you are clear to the top.

你们别闹了好吗
Come on, you guys.

84
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,250
好了  范恩  在门口停下
Alright, Fine. Stop at the door.

85
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,350
有个保镖过来了  听我指令行动
Okay, you have a guard approaching. I'll tell you when.

86
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,700

They're culling at my hair. I can't see!

91
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,910
什么意思  你看不见了
What do you mean you can't see?

92
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,950
我没事  有辆SUV开过来了

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,340
范恩  码头上有船
Fine, there are boats at the end.

我根本够不到电线

那就趴下  捂上耳朵
Then stay down and hold your ears.

101
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,520
那我还怎么听到你的甜美声音呢
And how will I hear your beautiful voice.

I don't want to be critical, but this is very chewy.

158
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,620
库珀  你吃的是擦手巾
Coop. You're eating a hand towel.

159
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,270
就是清洁一下我的味蕾
Just, cleansing my palate.

160
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,230
老天  你非得请我来这么破的地方吗

Never as funny as you.

167
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,930

172
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,660
没有你我的工作根本就完不成
I couldn't do what I do without you.

173
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,120
我一直想为你做点特别的事情
And I've been thinking about doing something special for you.

174
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,260

你喜欢蛋糕嘛  
You love cakes.

179
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,330
我说的是大蛋糕
Well, no. I mean big cakes.

180
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,590
我自己做蛋糕
I make cakes.

181
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,130
现在你可以戴在脖子上
Now you can wear a cake.

182
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,350
你怎么知道我不喜欢传统珠宝
How do you know I don't care for traditional jewelry?

183
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,670
我简直看它看不够
Now I can't seem to stop looking at it, and...

184
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,320
它看我也看不够了
it can't stop looking at me.

185
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
想想这要是换了别的得多尴尬
Imagine, how awkward it would've been.

186
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,720
如果里面是钻戒啥的
If it had been a diamond ring or something.

187
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,630
不要钻戒啦  不可以
Not a diamond ring. No.

188
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,440
我才不那样想呢
Oh, I wouldn't had see it like that.

189
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,270
我才不想嫁给你呢
I wouldn't want to marry you.

190
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,720
我才不喜欢你肌肉纠结的胳膊和美手
I don't want your musclely arms and hands,

191
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,500
把妮维雅擦在我背上  就这样过一辈子
rubbing my back with Nivea for the rest of my life.

192
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,190
家里有三个娃跑来跑去什么的
There are 3 kids running. You know.

193
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,390
分别叫凯伦  汤米和比利  然后你说别闹啦
Karen, Tommy and Billy and you said get out of here.

194
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,000
他们下巴都那么美
And they just, they all have that beautiful jaw...

195

I'll just... You know. I'll just...

送我一件实际生活中能戴的小首饰就行
Giving me a little jewellery I can actually wear.

可调节搭扣  真是的
Adjustable toggle. You don't.

204
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,450
这可不常见  很多珠宝都没有呢
You don't see that. It's a lot of jewellery there.

205
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,060
-太配你了  -是吗  哇  完美

我想打你  不是自己
I meant to shoot you, not me!"

217
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,860
我估计就得这么说
That's probably what I'd say.

I mean, you know. Look at you and your tailor and your...

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,150
去把她抓来
Go get her.

280
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,680
帮我拿东西  库珀
Grab my things, Coop.

281
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,280
天哪  库珀  你去找个墨镜戴上好不
Jesus, Cooper. Go put on some sunglasses or something.

282
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,580
感觉你现在像是吉普赛人  正对我下咒呢
Feel like you're a gypsy, cursing me with it.

283
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,990
好  马上去
Yup. I'm on it.

284
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,060
-好  没问题  -范恩
- Yeah, that's all good.  - Oh, Fine.

285
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,090
-好啊  -好啊  超级库珀
- Hi.  - Hey, Super Cooper.

286
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:54,860
我就是感觉有点怪
I just was feeling a little weird, you know, about...

287
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:00,300
就是有些事情  蕾娜的位置来得太容易
Some of the stuff, and I think the intel on on Rayna's location seems a little too easy.

288
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,580
就是  感觉不太对
I just... Something doesn't feel right.

289
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,330
等把蕾娜关进去  核弹夺回来
It'll be right when we get Rayna behind bars

290
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,170
感觉就对劲了
and that nuke back in our hands.

291
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,750
是啊  我就是...
Yeah, sure. I just...

292
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,490
-不知道  我哪个地方都觉得不对  -真的吗
- I don't know. All my alarm bells are going off with this one. - Really?

293
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,720
好吧  没事  我想好了
Well, then, it's okay 'cause I have a plan.

294
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,450
咱们两个不能再这么做任务了
You and I gotta stop going on these awful missions.

295
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,390
一起私奔吧
Run off together.

296
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,950
你是认真的吗
Do you mean that?

297
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,790
-什么  -什么
- What? - What?

298
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,600
我认真的吗  被你糊弄了
Do I mean that? You got me.

299
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,430
-真会开玩笑  -你真差劲
- You kidder. - You sucker!

300
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,260
你真该看看你自己的表情
No. You should have seen your face!

301
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,060
天哪  你那样子  咋回事咋回事
Oh my god! You were like, what, what, what?

302
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,030
好吧  抱歉我...
Fine, I'm sorry if I...

303
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,150
没事
Don't be.

304
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,440
天哪  真是佩服你
God. I admire you.

305
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,700
"佩服你"
"I admire you"?

306
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,530
他有没有用放荡的语气说
Well, did he at least say it in a flirty tone that says...

307
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,440
"因为我欣赏你
"And because of my admiration,

308
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,190
我要脱了衬衣  然后进..."
I shall now take my shirt off, and penetrate ye..."

309
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,310
没有  我要想进他卧室
No. The only way he'd invite me to his bedroom

310
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,320
除非他床坏了
is if he wants me to fix his bed.

311
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,060
我真蠢  能喝一口你的吗
I'm so stupid. Can I just have a sip of your wine?

312
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,370
挺稠的
It's quite buttery.

313
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,170
慢点  你自己点一杯啊
Wow. Okay, we could order you your own glass.

314
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,880
那杯是我的
That was mine!

315
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,380
我的人生各种糟心啊
My life is a disaster.

316
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,500
-才没有呢  -我都四十了  独自生活
- No, it's not. - I'm 40, I live by myself.

317
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,710
自从三年前杰里离开我之后
I've not been in a real relationship since

318
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,650
-我就没谈过正经恋爱了  -杰里是混蛋啦
- Jerry left me 3 years ago. - Jerry was a jackass.

319
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,680
当年我放弃教书加入中情局
I mean, when I gave up teaching to join the CIA

320
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,890
我还以为我的人生会有所不同
I thought everything is going to be different.

321
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,480
我以为我会当上狂拽炫酷的间谍
I thought I was going to be this amazing spy.

322
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,990
结果我还是跟以前那个无聊的自己没啥两样
I'm just the same boring person like I was before.

323
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,940
不管怎么说  我觉得你真的很优秀了
Well, for what it's worth. I think you're brilliant as you are.

324
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,140
你充满活力
You're exciting.

325
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,910
来让你开心点
Come on, let's cheer you up. Okay.

326
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,170
我外甥可喜欢这样了
My nephew loves this. All right.

327
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:43,460
好了  谢谢  你外甥不是才三岁
Okay. Thanks. Isn't your nephew three?

328
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,400
天哪  和之前一样
My God. That's the same face.

329
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,070
-好了  这次不一样了  -还是一样
- Okay, this will be different.  - Exactly the same face.

330
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,710
这回肯定不一样
This will be different.

331
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,970
准备好了吗
Ready? Aah...

332
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,630
一模一样的
That's the exact same thing.

333
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,940
怎么可能一样  我还吐了点舌头
How is that the same thing? There was a little bit of tongue there.

334
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,410
别这样了  我一点也没开心
Please stop. That's not cheering me up.

335
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,540
你知道吗  
You know what?

336
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,400
很高兴你对范恩说了  真的
I'm glad you said that to Fine. I am.

337
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,840
你就是太过谨慎了
Because you played it too safe.

338
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,670
我只是  你懂的
I just. I still- you know.

339
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,360
耳边常想起我妈的话
Hear my mom's voice.

340
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,190
女人要端庄  才能永流芳
Well behave woman, often make history.

341
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,150
你懂的成语真多
Yes, you do know the phrase.

342
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,950
"女人不端庄  才能永流芳"
"Well behaved women seldom... make history."

343
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,860
好吧  我从没听她这么说过
Yeah that's, never heard she said it.

344
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,350
那这一句呢
What about this.

345
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,090
做人要能忍  让别人当赢家
Oh, just blend in. Let somebody else win.

346
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,760
-经典啊  -我在学校里学过好多这种名言
- Classic. Yup. - I got that a lot in my schools.

347
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,400
还有一句"放弃梦想吧  苏珊"
And there was a "Give up on your dreams, Susan."

348
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,540
她以前就把这句话写在我午餐盒上
She used to write that in my lunch box.

349
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,900
快看
Oh. I mean, look.

350
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,990
好吧
Okay.

351
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,360
话说我们跟凯伦·沃克到底差在哪里啊
What's really so different between us and Karen Walker.

352
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,490
我觉得实话说  所有吧
I think-I think literally. Everything.

353
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,450
等一下  不对
No, hang on. No.

354
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,100
因为你在学院里的成绩明明跟她一样好
Because you were just as good as out in the Carvela.

355
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,440
她成功完成的任务比范恩都多
She-She has more successful missions than even Fine.

356
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,440
她最差劲了
Oh. She's the worse.

357
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,050
你看看她  她好完美呢
Look at her. She's so perfect, isn't she?

358
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,000
嗨  我是凯伦·沃克  超级特工
Oh, hi. I'm Karen Walker, Super spy.

359
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,790
一头秀发  花容月貌
Perfect hair. Perfect face.

360
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,550
大概她每晚都得被自己美哭吧
She probably cries herself to sleep every night.

361
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,550
-我觉得可能性不大  -她有可能的
- I don't think she probably does. - She probably does.

362
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,160
而且不是那种轻轻抽泣哦
And not like sort of cute little tears.

363
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,140
就是那种你懂的
Like brilly. Sort of you know.

364
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,190
梨花带雨  无语凝噎
Silent kind of thing.

365
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,340
应该不会吧
I don' think that.

366
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,870
应该像是某种上下颠倒的大芸豆
Like sort of upside down kidney bean.

367
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,690
我睡觉时就是这副模样
This is what I look when I'm asleep.

368
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,280
嘘嘘嘘  别说了  安静
Shh shh, shut up. Be quiet.

369
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,920
她不会知道我们是谁  她又没站在咱们面前
She wouldn't know who we are She's not in front of us now.

370
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,910
南希你好  苏珊你好
Hi. Hey Nancy. Hi Susan.

371
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:21,770
你们俩美妞坐在这儿好美哦
Hey, you 2 cuties sitting here being all cute.

372
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,740
给我一杯古典鸡尾酒  谢谢
Can I have an Old Fashioned, please.

373
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,750
-他家服务很慢的  -超慢
- His service is really slow. - Super slow.

374
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,540
估计你一小时内都拿不到酒
You're not getting that in the next hour.

375
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,750
-您拿好了  沃克小姐  -谢谢
- Here you go, Miss Walker. - Thank you.

376
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,470
我和阿兰是老相识了  我经常来这里
Alan and I go way back. I come here all the time.

377
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,290
我们也是哦  是吧阿兰
So do we. Right Alan?

378
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,250
嘿   阿兰  那个...阿兰
Hey, Alan. How... Alan.

379
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,630
阿伦  大伦子
Big A. Big A.

380
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,380
小亚  没长耳朵吗
Yoo-hoo, Al! You got a hole.

381
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,200
沃克小姐  这两个人是不是吵到你了
Miss Walker. These 2 bothering you?

382
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,290
-没事的  谢谢  -好
- Oh no. Thank you, they're fine. - Okay.

383
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,320
-阿兰  -他最棒了
- Alan. - He's the sweetest.

384
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,470
-他在假装不认识我们  -他好搞笑
- He just pretends not to know. - He's funny.

385
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,350
总之  我正在休假
Yeah, well. Anyway, I'm taking some time off.

386
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,420
等我回来再见咯
So I'll see you guys when I get back.

387
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,730
你去哪儿休假啊
Where're you going?

388
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,410
-卡普里  -卡普里  -卡普里岛
- Capri. - Capri. - Capri.

389
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,980
是卡普利  当地人都这么说
I believe it's "Capri." That's how the locals say it, anyway.

390
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,720
我也希望能留在这里的
I wished I could just stick around here, you know.

391
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,260
蜷缩起来  读本好书
Curl up with a good book.

392
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,040
-但那边有一游艇的朋友在等我  -哇
- But, I have a yacht full of friends waiting for me. - Wow.

393
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,880
游艇最差劲了  总是太美
Yachts are the worst. They seem so glamorous, but...

394
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,210
-真差劲  -游艇最差了
- They're the worst. - Boo, yachts.

395
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,680
总之  等我回来再见吧
Anywho. I'll see you guys when I get back.

396
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,030
带着雀斑  晒得黢黑
All freckle and tanned

397
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,400
-回头见了  -嗯啊
- We're gonna see you. - Yeah.

398
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,320
-拜  -拜
- Bye. - Bye.

399
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,940
抱歉  苏珊不舒服
Oh, sorry. Susan's ill.

400
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,900
她的胃不好
It's her stomach.

401
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,600
天哪  我真要谢谢你啊
My god. Thank you for that.

402
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,270
-你那样干什么  -抱歉  我慌了
- Why would you do that? - I'm sorry, I panicked.

403
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,990
刚才那一刻多美好
What a great moment.

404
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,450
-你看她  -我懂  瞧那裙子
- Just looked a her. - Oh, I know. That dress.

405
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,090
看她多自信啊
Look at her confidence.

406
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,710
他们居然可以在这里抽烟
They are even allowed to smoke in here.

407
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,550
我要回家了
I'm gonna go home.

408
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,530
-不  别走  -走了
- No, come on. - Yes.

409
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,060
苏珊
Susan.

410
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,330
-借过  -感觉好些了吗
- Sorry. - Feel better.

411
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,390
谢谢你  是啊
Oh, thank you. Yeah.

412
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,890
范恩  准备好吗
Fine. You good?

413
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,180
好的  库珀  开始吧
Okay, Coop. Just pulling up.

414
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,370
苏珊  你做的太好吃了
Susan, you're killing it.

415
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,440
谢谢  知道吗  我加了菊苣
Oh good. You know what, they are chicory.

416
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,540
有她在屋子里的迹象吗
Any sign of her in the house?

417
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,320
热传感器没有任何反馈
Heat sensors aren't picking anything up.

418
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,410
有些干扰  我感觉不对劲  范恩
There's some kind of interference. I don't like this, Fine.

419
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,150
我准备好迎接挑战了
I'm up for the challenge.

420
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,260
我进去了
Let's go in.

421
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,880
糟糕  你的摄像头有些问题
Shoot. There is something wrong with your camera.

422
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,350
你能换个新的吗
Can you switch out for a new one.

423
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,490
来不及了
Too late.

424
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,870
没有保镖
No security.

425
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,600
她父亲绝不会这么暴露自己
Her father would never have let himself this exposed.

426
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,690
好了  撤吧  范恩  这也太简单了
Okay. Pull back, Fine. This is too easy.

427
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,640
我就喜欢简单的事
I like things that are easy.

428
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,220
天哪  范恩
Oh my god, Fine.

429
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,250
真不知道你是怎么做到的
I don't know how you do things like that.

430
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,910
谁是最棒的
Hey. Who's the finest of them all?

431
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,230
我不知道
I don't know.

432
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,380
我猜  是你吗
I'm guessing, you?

433
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,650
放下武器
Drop your weapon.

434
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,610
范恩  出什么事了
Fine, what's happening?

435
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,330
让我猜猜  用耳机
Let me guess, whoever is

436
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,510
跟你对话的那个人想知道发生了什么
in your ear wants to know what's happening?

437
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,720
他就要死了
He's about to die.

438
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,190
就这事
That's what.

439
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,510
小姑娘拿了把好大的枪
Awfully big gun for such a little girl.

440
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,850
天哪  别那样说话
God. Don't say stuff like that.

441
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,910
好了  你的右手边有一个刀架
Okay. There's a knife rack directly to your right.

442
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,390
从她握枪的方式能看出她没什么经验
The way she's holding the gun, she's not experienced.

443
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,480
如果你快速跳起
If you jump and launch.

444
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,300
就能拿到刀然后解除她的武器
You get the knife and disarm her.

445
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,610
有人建议你去拿那边的刀了吗
Did someone just suggested you grabbed one of those knives?

446
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,760
不  不  不
No-no-no...!

447
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,980
该死
Damn it!

448
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:35,780
范恩
Fine?

449
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,440
他们能看到我吗
Can they see me right now?

450
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,510
我来调整一下角度
Let me adjust the angle a little bit.

451
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,380
天哪
Oh my god.

452
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,280
他的名字是布拉德利·范恩
His name was Bradley Fine.

453
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,920
为中央情报局工作
He worked for the CIA.

454
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,870
其他顶尖特工还有
Other top agents include,

455
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,420
马修·莱特  蒂莫西·克莱斯
Matthew Wright, Timothy Cress,

456
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,280
里克·福特和凯伦·沃克
Rick Ford and Karen Walker.

457
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,740
快起来啊  范恩  快起来
Come on, Fine. Come on.

458
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,740
我知道你们所有在职特工的名字
I know who all your active agents are.

459
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,170
所以  除非你们还想继续收尸
So. Unless you like the body count to grow.

460
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,950
我建议你们离我远一点
I suggest you stay far away from me.

461
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,360
去拿点纸巾吧
Now grab some tissues,

462
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,990
因为接下来的画面会很伤感
because it's about to get real sad.

463
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,500
不  不要  不
No, don't. No!

464
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,170
上帝啊  范恩
Oh my god. Fine.

465
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,070
作为副局长
As deputy director.

466
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,870
向失去生命的同事告别
I've never had a more difficulty duty,

467
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,730
是我承担过的最艰难的任务
than to bid farewell to colleagues taken from us.

468
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,330
从多佛
From Dover,

469
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,540
到家庭事务部
to the family services.

470
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,600
到这样的纪念仪式
To memorials like these.

471
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,040
说再见都是很难的事
It's tough to say goodbye.

472
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,330
你已经尽力了  苏珊
There's nothing you could have done, Susan.

473
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,620
布拉德利·范恩
Bradley Fine.

474
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,910
不仅是同事和朋友
Was more than just a co-worker and a friend.

475
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,540
还是我们大家庭的一员
He's a part of our family.

476
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,800
作为家人  即使知道
As family, even knowing that the universe has a plan

477
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,470
上帝自有安排
for each human life.

478
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,130
还是很难接受失去这样一位
It's hard to accept the sudden lost of such a

479
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,560
优秀又正直的朋友
good and decent person.

480
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,280
好了  你的右手边有一个刀架
Okay. There's a knife rack directly to your right.

481
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,240
苏珊  我看到你对蕾娜·博亚诺夫的评估报告了
Susan. I got your assessment report on Rayna Boyanov.

482
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,810
我知道你现在可能还无法释怀
I know you're probably feeling a lot of emotion right now,

483
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:15,640
但请避免使用"暴力婊"这样的词语
but please refrain from using the term "thundercunt".

484
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,280
天哪  我居然那么写了吗  抱歉
Oh my god. I-I didn't realise I wrote that, I'm sorry.

485
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,370
南希  我发给你一张照片
Nancy, I'm sending you a photo.

486
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,620
很不清楚  你能处理一下吗
It's in pretty bad shape. Can you enhance it?

487
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,610
巴黎
Paris.

488
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,150
这个婊子怎么他妈知道我们名字的
How the fuck did this twatt, find out our fucking names?

489
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,460
我们不清楚
We don't know.

490
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,570
婊子什么的别乱用
And I've looked way back where the 'T' word for.

491
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,590
我们不是离了你就不行了
You're not immune from the HR department.

492
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,680
得了吧  在英国
Grow up. The twatt means

493
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,160
婊子的意思完全不一样
something completely different in England.

494
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,110
这里它的意思是蜜穴
Well, here it means vagina.

495
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,160
不过  显然我们这里有内鬼
Anyway. Obviously we're talking about a mole.

496
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,020
也可能是间谍黑进了我们的系统
It could be a mole that could've hacked our system.

497
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,140
纯属推测  但重要的是
It's anyone's guess. The bottom line is,

498
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,480
蕾娜·博亚诺夫准备
Rayna Boyanov is about to

499
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,770
出售一枚小型战略核武器
sell a small scale tactical nuclear weapon

500
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,130
给一个恐怖组织
to a terrorist organization.

501
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,680
而她和炸弹在哪我们都不知道
And we don't know where she or the bomb is.

502
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,570
幸运的是
And fortunately,

503
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,280
我们的分析人员苏珊·库珀找到了线索
our analyst, Susan Cooper found the lead.

504
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,970
蕾娜拿到了塞吉奥·德卢卡的电话号码
Rayna had the number of Sergio De Luca.

505
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,720
我们一直怀疑德卢卡在为
We've long suspected that De Luca of working

506
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,400
恐怖组织做中间人
as an intermediater with terrorist groups.

507
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,970
蕾娜可能在利用他来寻找核武器的买家
Rayna maybe using him to find buyers for the nuke.

508
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,420
电话是他在巴黎的一处办公室的
The number was to a office he keeps in Paris.

509
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,900
我告诉过你派我去  而不是范恩
I told you to send me in there instead of Fine.

510
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,740
你不听我的
And you didn't.

511
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,060
现在范恩死了  我他妈的一定要加入
And now Fine is dead. I'm kind of fuck in.

512
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,100
你不行
You can't.

513
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,280
我们需要一个跟踪德卢卡而不会被发现的人
We need someone to follow De Luca without being detected.

514
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,230
并寄希望于通过他找到蕾娜
And I would hopefully takes us to Rayna.

515
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,390
但你们谁都不行
But it can't be any of you.

516
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,990
我们这样子
Here's what we do.

517
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,380
我去那个换脸的机器
I go into the face-off machine.

518
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,030
换一张新的脸
Get a whole new face.

519
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,430
即使出现  他们也不会知道是我
I turned up. They'll never know it's me.

520
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,040
你有零钱吗  那需要50分
Do you have quarters? 'Cause it cost 50 cents.

521
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,150
什么  我还得付钱吗
What, I've got to pay?

522
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,690
不用  因为就没那东西
No, because it doesn't exist.

523
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,670
当然有了
Yes, it does!

524
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,640
我在厕所听到克莱斯和莱特谈论的
I heard Cress and Wright talked about it in the shitter.

525
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,350
他们肯定是在跟你开玩笑
I'm pretty sure that they're pulling your leg.

526
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,700
你们他妈两个婊子
You pair of fucking vaginas.

527
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,830
天啊  你不能再爆粗口了
Seriously. You got to cut that out.

528
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,640
天啊  听着  我们中的一个得去执行任务
Jesus. Look, one of us has to go in.

529
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,390
是否被暴露不重要
Doesn't matter if we've been exposed.

530
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:12,550
我们之前都做过卧底  也总能抓到要抓的人
We've all gone deep before, and we always gotten our guy.

531
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,970
伙计们  这不仅是一个"射杀"任务
Guys. This is more than just a kill mission.

532
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,750
处置妥当的话  我们能抓住蕾娜  德卢卡
Now we can get Rayna, De Luca and some top terrorist leadership

533
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,070
和其他一些恐怖组织高层并拿回武器
and get the weapon back, if we do this right.

534
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,020
我们只是需要一个
We just need someone who

535
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:24,180
能不引起注意并跟踪他们的人
could shadow them without attracting attention.

536
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,000
-我们需要一个不显眼的人  -我去
- We need someone invisible. - I'll do it.

537
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,930
好了  谢谢你  餐厅大妈
Okay, thanks lunch lady.

538
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,610
我是认真的  我
I'm serious. I...

539
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,630
我从未出过外勤
I've never been out in the field.

540
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,970
说的就是啊  这想法蠢爆了
Exactly. Stupid fucking idea.

541
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,320
我的意思是
My point is that

542
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,260
我很可能还没有被暴露
it's highly doubtful I've ever been exposed.

543
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,120
但你跟范恩合作
But you worked with Fine.

544
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,430
他们可能也有你的记录
They may have a record of you too.

545
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,650
有可能  但是
Possibly. But.

546
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,540
他们知道我长什么样的可能性极低
You know. The odds of them knowing my face are very low.

547
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,140
克罗克女士  我很想做这件事
Ms. Crocker, I would really like to do this.

548
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,300
为了范恩
For Fine.

549
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:52,690
你打算怎么做  带只猫当助手吗
What are you gonna do? Bring one of your cats as a sidekick?

550
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,280
我不养猫好吗
I don't have any cats!

551
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,270
你不是真在考虑这个提议吧
You're not seriously considering this, are you?

552
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,520
-好了  贝蒂  -福特  你敢叫我贝蒂·克罗克
- Look here, Betty... - Ford, if you call me Betty Crocker,

553
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,580
我他妈就把你的心掏出来
I will rip your fucking heart out of your chest.

554
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:07,310
我成为美国公民时  不仅发誓保护国家
Not only did I become a citizen and take a vow to protect this country...

555
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:10,650
还发誓保护死去的战友
I also took a vow to avenge my fallen comrades.

556
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,080
我们都发了
We all fucking did.

557
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,990
-没有  -我没有
- No, we didn't.  - Not me.

558
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:17,490
肯定都他妈发誓了  我记得
I'm pretty sure we all took a fucking vow. I remember it.

559
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,530
我他妈还记得举起手说什么
I remember raising my fucking hand and saying some shit.

560
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,890
如果你觉得我会坐视不管
And if you think, I'm going to sit by

561
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,510
让你派个他妈的秘书去做我的工作
and let you send in a fucking secretary to do my work.

562
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,380
那你现在就接受我的辞呈吧
You might as well accept my resignation now.

563
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,720
我能插一句吗  我
If I can jump in. I'm...

564
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,360
我的身份也可以算是特工的
I'm technically, classified as an agent.

565
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,700
听着
Look.

566
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,020
全职的  全职特工  所以
Full. Full agent, so...

567
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,810
特工  特工  特工
Agent, agent, agent.

568
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,050
我也是特工
I'm agent.

569
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,810
你真在考虑吗
Are you considering this?

570
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,830
为了你  还有在座各位的安全
For your safety and the safety of those around this table.

571
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,350
我是在认真考虑
I'm considering it.

572
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,150
那你猜怎么着  我不干了
Then consider this. I quit.

573
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,380
我知道是有他妈的变脸机的
And I know there is a fucking face-off machine.

574
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,400
只是你不告诉我罢了
You're just keeping it a secret from me.

575
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,420
这可是头一遭啊
That hasn't happened before.

576
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:03,820
你的办公室太美了
It is quite a lovely office.

577
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,730
你到底是什么情况  库珀
What's your deal, Cooper?

578
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:08,220
-你什么意思  -你还有不为人知的一面吗
- What do you mean? - You got a faery side?

579
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,570
我写了"暴力婊"  其实我想的是狡猾
I really did in that report mean to write cunning.

580
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,120
我一直在看你的档案
I've been going over your files.

581
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,380
你在学院时计算机和技术支持
You're top of the class at the academy

582
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,070
都在班里名列前茅  这不奇怪
in all computer and support skills. No surprise there.

583
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,820
但同事们对你的评价
But you have a certain tame

584
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,960
并不怎么高
demeanor around the office

585
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,780
说你都没握过枪
that says you've never even held a gun.

586
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,200
所以想象一下
So imagine

587
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,770
我看到你在"农场"演戏时的录像有多震惊
my surprise when I saw footage from this drill back at the farm.

588
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,770
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}"农场"指佩里营

589
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,560
这是  开玩笑吗
Is that... kidding...

590
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,170
那是我吗  不可能吧
Is that me? That can't really...

591
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,550
愚蠢的枪
Stupid gun. Eah!

592
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,460
-这肯定是快放的镜头  -该死
- Somebody definitely sped this up. - Son of a bitch.

593
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,450
视频角度问题  不能让
Camera angle, does not make...

594
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,910
-库珀  库珀  快停下  -好了
- Cooper. Cooper. Stop it, - Okay, uh.

595
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,060
真疼
Ouch.

596
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,470
这些人  你知道的
Those contacts, that's a, you know.

597
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,200
我看了得有十五遍了
I must have watched this 15 times now.

598
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,120
因为  太他妈劲爆了
Because, what the fuck.

599
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,770
-其实  -我差点传到视频网站了
- Well, I... - I almost put it up on YouTube.

600
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:59,140
其实我  至少可以说  对这件事
Well, I was, to say the least, uncomfortable...

601
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,020
感觉非常不舒服
with the event.

602
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,270
但我想说那都是十年前的事了
But I would also like to say it was over 10 years ago.

603
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,630
那个教员没有受伤
The instructor was not harmed.

604
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:07,000
-范恩是你的导师  对吗  -是的
- Fine, was your mentor. Right? - Yes.

605
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,580
为什么你不做外勤特工呢
Why did you not become a field agent?

606
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,700
我们很合拍  是很棒的组合
Well, we're such a great fit and a great team.

607
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,650
范恩跟我说了一些很有道理的观点
I mean Fine, made some great points

608
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,600
也许我还是最好  比如说
you know, maybe I match better with... just staying...

609
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,260
-在局里呆着  -是啊
- In the Bureau. - Well.

610
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,370
他把你收了
Yeah. He sniped you.

611
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,720
我来这儿之前很多顶尖特工都会这么做
All the top agents used to do that before I got here.

612
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,510
我真心觉得他说的很有道理
I really thought he made some great points.

613
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,720
女人啊
Women.

614
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,800
好了  那之后你还参加过外勤培训吗
Alright, have you any field training since then.

615
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,200
-十年可是不短的时间啊  -没有  长官
- 10 years is a long time. - No, ma'am.

616
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,950
一般来说我应该把你送去训练
Normally I would send you back to the farm,

617
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,750
但没时间了  我也不想
but there's no time and I can't take a chance

618
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,570
冒险把你暴露
of anyone leaking your name.

619
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,210
我  我能去吗
Am I - Am I going?

620
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,260
-你去出任务  -好的
- You're going. - Okay.

621
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:46,610
-但只是去跟踪并且汇报情况  -明白
- But it's a track and report mission only. - Got it.

622
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,940
我们会给你一个新的身份
We'll be giving you a new identity.

623
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,860
你不再是苏珊·库珀了
You will not longer be Susan Cooper.

624
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,160
-关于新身份我有些想法  -你的新名字
- Oh, I have a few ideas for that. - Your new name.

625
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,000
我只是突然想到了一些名字
I was just spit-balling

626
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,100
比如说塞拉菲娜  曼尼克斯  吉赛尔
and I thought Serafina, Mannix, Gisele.

627
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,580

卡罗尔·詹金斯

629
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,260
我能说明一下情况吗  长官
You know. If I may, ma'am.

630
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,480
曾经有一个叫卡罗尔的13岁小女孩
There was a 13 year old girl name Carol,

631
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,660
总是带着我在邻里间游荡
that used to come take me around the neighbourhood

632
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,420
把我的辫子当成狗绳
and used my braid as a dog leash.

633
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,780
还让我去求饼干吃  所以
And made me begged for biscuits. So.

634
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:13,600
-卡罗尔·詹金斯  -好吧  卡罗尔·詹金斯
- Carol Jenkins. - Yes, Carol Jenkins.

638
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,390
好吧  这  这
Okay. That is-That is...

639
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:25,440
真是不同的工作...
a different occup.... Huh!

640
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,300
-有问题吗  -没有
- Is there a problem? - No!

641
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,740
只是在想
Just wondering if

642
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,450
这是我的人质还是家人啊
this is my family, if I'm taken hostages.

643
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,810
我不确定
I'm just not sure

644
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,440
如果我是这个样子
how De Luca is going to take me seriously

645
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,400
德卢卡怎么会把我当回事
if I looked like this.

646
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,250
德卢卡不会跟你有接触
De Luca is not going to take you anything.

647
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,320
我再跟你说一遍
In case you did not hear me,

648
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,630
不许与任何目标人物有直接接触
you're not to make direct contact with any of the targets.

649
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,750
跟踪并报告
Track and report.

650
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,520
现在我们在德卢卡办公室的对面
Now we're setting you up in a surveillance office

651
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,790
给你设置一间监视处所
across the street from De Luca's.

652
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,500
你要偷偷连入他的通信网络
You'll be tapped into the same telecom trunk

653
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,110
并获得他办公室内的所有声音和数据
and have access to voice and data coming into his office.

654
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,050
这就是你的全部任务
And that's as sexy as it gets.

655
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,230
一旦犯错
One mistake, and we got

656
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,540
恐怖分子就会得到核弹
a nuclear bomb in the hands of terrorists.

657
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,360
-你明白了吗  -是的
- Do you understand? - Yes.

658
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,050

他会给你一些特殊装备
He's got special equipment for you.

660
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,340
天哪
Oh my god.

661
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,210
我到底是在干什么
What are you doing?

662
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,040
你想好了你的间谍名字吗
Oh, did you come up with your spy name yet?

663
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,500
要是我就叫安珀·瓦伦丁
My would be Amber Valentine.

664
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,490
听着像A片明星的名字
That sounds like you're an adult film star.

665
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,170
不是的  我可是用了起名公式
No, I did this 'find name formula'.

666
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,400
安珀是我第一个宠物的名字
Amber was the name of my first pet

667
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,880
并且我在瓦伦丁街长大
and I grew up on Valentine Street.

668
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,760
你是在想你拍A片用什么名吗
Did you come up with your porn name?

669
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,440
-不  安珀是个间谍名  -才不是
- Oh, no. Amber is a spy name. - Yes

670
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,690
-就是的  -你想用什么名字

00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,520
我太激动了
I'm so excited.

674
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,020
你是间谍啊
You're a spy.

675
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,850
是啊是啊  我想可以这么说
I know, I know. I guess you can say...

676
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:42,810
我得弄辆这个啊
Oh, I got to get one of those.

677
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:43,640
你觉得你有机会开吗
You think you're going to get one of those!

678
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,530
不  不会的  不会的
No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

679
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,570
看那个啊

No, I'll have to turn the printer on again.

709
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,290
我不想那么做

把碎玻璃插进眼睛里
I put shards of glass in my fucking eye.

816
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,150
只穿一件雨衣当降落伞
I jumped, from a high rise building,

817
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:07,020
就从高楼跳下
using only a raincoat, as a parachute.

818
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,780
降落的时候双腿都折了
I broke both legs upon landing.

819
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,390
我还得继续装着
And I still had to pretend

820
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,920
像我在表演马戏样的
I was in a fucking Cirque Du Soleil show.

821
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,170
我吞下去还要拉出来的芯片
I've swallowed enough microchips and shit them back out again

822
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,440
够组一台电脑了
to make a computer.

823
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,140
这整个胳膊都被扯下来了
This arm has been ripped off completely

824
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,590
我就用这只手把它硬生生安回去了
and re-attached with this fucking hand.

825
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:26,240
这在医学上是不可能的
You know it's, that's impossible. I mean medically.

826
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,990
在一次刺杀企图中
During the threat of an assassination attempt

827
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,700
我在国会面前
I appeared convincingly,

828
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,610
令人信服地假扮成了巴拉克·奥巴马
in front of Congress, as Barack Obama.

829
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:37,040
你把脸刷黑了吗  这不太好吧
In black face? That's not appropriate.

830
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,970
我看着把我养大的夫妇在车里被炸死
I watched the couple that raised me explode in a van.

831
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:43,950
我看着我心爱的女人被从飞机上扔下
I watched the woman I loved, get tossed from a plane,

832
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,820
在半空中又撞上了另一架飞机
and hit by another plane, midair!

833
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:50,340
我把车开下高速路  落在火车上
I drove a car off the freeway, on top of a train,

834
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,420
当时我全身是火  不是车着火
while I was on fire. Not the car!

835
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,200
是我着火了
I was on fire.

836
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,160
天  你说得够玄乎的
Jesus. You're intense.

837
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,850
从你小酒柜里面拿了这个
Took this from your mini-bar.

838
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,820
这可不好
Well, that's not right.

839
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,000
你会毁了这项任务
You're going to ruin this mission.

840
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,610
不  是你毁了这项任务
No. You're going to ruin this mission.

841
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,400
不  是你
No. You are.

842
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,040
不  是你
No, you're going to.

843
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,210
是你是你就是你
You times infinity.

844
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,860
这酒店还能不能更要命点
Could this hotel be more murdery.

845
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:37,130
我的办公室在这
Okay. So my office is in here.

846
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:41,190
也就是说德卢卡就在街对面39号...
Which means that De Luca's is right across the street at 39...

847
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:47,570
我的天  别告诉我那是德卢卡那栋楼
Oh God. Tell me that's not De Luca's building?

848
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,900
德卢卡肯定知道我们要来了
De Luca must have known we were coming.

849
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,570
我现在该怎么办
What am I suppose to do now?

850
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:54,270
先别慌  化腐朽为神奇
Okay, don't panic. Lemonade out of lemons.

851
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,090
注意力集中  我们能做到
Stay focus. We can do this.

852
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:00,220
-抱歉打扰一下  -什么事
- Excuse-moi, sil vous plais. - Oui?

853
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:03,420
这栋楼是什么时候被烧的
When this building burned down?

854
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,810
就昨晚  好大的火
Hier soir. It was a big fire.

855
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,750
看  在这
See. There.

856
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,870
-我能看看吗  -给
- Can I? - Here You Go.

857
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,810
这个男人住这条街上吗
Does this man lives on this street?

858
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:24,080
不  我不认识他
No, no. I don't know him.

859
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,370
好了  我看到了
Okay. I got it. I got it.

860
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,690
我在系统里进行比对  要花上几分钟
I'll run it through the system. It will take a few minutes.

861
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,840
什么都没有
Nothing's coming up.

862
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,330
可能就是个游客
Might just be a looky-loo.

863
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:40,070
继续查  我觉得这人有猫腻
Well. Keep looking. I've got a feeling about this guy.

864
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:43,400
我觉得你会把这件事搞砸
Well, I've got a feeling you're about to fuck things up.

865
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,110
一叉子捅死我吧  福特在这
Oh. Bugger me with a fishfork. It's Ford.

866
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,530
莎伦  你知道福特在出外勤吗
Sharon? Ford is in the field. Did you know this?

867
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,480
他要是不回来报道我也没办法
Until he checks in, there's nothing I can do.

868
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,810
你自己玩去别跟着我了
You go make some friends and stop stalking me.

869
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:57,070
你的任务是要惊动目标
Was it your mission to tip off the target,

870
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,580
让他把一切付之一炬吗
so he burns everything in their butts?

871
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,770
干得真好  太棒
It's so well done, phenomenal job.

872
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:02,910
我发誓他们肯定
I'm sure they got suspicious

873
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,930
是看你在这附近晃悠才起疑心了
because they've been seeing you all over the place.

874
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,280
-你会害死你自己的  -我死不掉的
- You're going to get yourself killed. - Nothing kills me.

875
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,430
我对179种毒药免疫
I am immune to 179 different kinds of poison,

876
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:13,190
因为我一次性服用了所有毒药
I know because I ingested them all at once.

877
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:15,790
那是我当年在地下团伙做卧底的时候
When I was deep undercover in an underground,

878
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,240
服毒竞技场
poison ingesting crime ring.

879
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,000
有点像斗狗  但又不是
It was like dog fighting, but instead of dogs fighting

880
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,240
是人服下毒药
it was humans ingesting poison and

881
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,720
有钱人就赌那人活不活的下来
rich people will bet whether we would live or die.

882
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,190
你这个我就不太信了
Yeah. I'm having a hard time with this one.

883
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,840
我死了五分钟  然后又复活了
I died for 5 minutes, and then I came back to life.

884
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,920
往好处想  他看着像演《报童传奇》的
Was it worth... He looks like he's in the cast of Newsies.

885
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,670
克罗克知道你在这吗
Does Crocker even know you're here?

886
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,410
拯救国家  为挚友布拉德利·范恩之死复仇
I don't need anyone's permission to save the country.

887
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,770
不需要他人的准许
and avenge my dear friend, Bradley Fine's death.

888
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:44,510
你都不喜欢他  你老叫他贝弗利·怀恩
You've didn't ever liked him. You used to call him Beverly Whine.

889
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,070
秘密圣诞老人的时候你送了他卫生棉条
You had him as secret Santa and you gave him tampons.

890
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,680
这是男人间的竞争
It's called the rivalry of men.

891
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,040
你不懂  除非你裙子底下
You wouldn't understand it. Unless you got the dong

892
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,610
也有根老二
up underneath that skirt.

893
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,860
这很没礼貌  还有不要说老二
Okay. That's super rude and don't say dong.

894
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,830
也不要做这个手势
Don't do that.

895
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:59,060
我想隐蔽的时候没有人能看到我
Nobody sees me when I don't want them to.

896
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,450
来无影去无踪
I move like a fucking shadow.

897
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:04,010
抱歉  先生
Oh. Excuse me, sir.

898
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,630
他真的是彻底失控了
He's gone all sorts of rogue.

899
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,540
莎伦说他真的不干了  伊莲拦都拦不住
Sharon says he really did quit. Elaine couldn't stop him.

900
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,700
他是要血债血偿
He's out for blood.

901
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:11,830
真是个纯爷们背着他LV的双肩包
Yeah, a real tough guy and his Louis Vuitton backpack.

902
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:16,130
南希  你看到了吗
Nancy, do you see that?

903
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,900
是火灾时的那个男的
It's the man from the fire.

904
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,680
-我去跟着他  -好激动
- I'm follow him. - Oh, exciting.

905
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,060
我在跟着你跟着他
And I'm follow you, follow him.

906
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,100
今天真是不得了啊
So I'm having quite a day here.

907
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:33,240
你觉得福特是不是在引他上钩
Do you think Ford is leading him to a trap?

908
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,680
他个蠢货完全不知道自己被跟踪了
Idiot doesn't even know he is being followed.

909
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,850
他在跟某个女人会面  我不认识她
Okay. He is meeting with some woman. I don't recognize her.

910
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,490
你知道她是谁吗
You have any idea who she is?

911
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:46,310
看不清  你能近点吗
No, it's hard to make out. Can you get any closer?

912
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,890
南希  他们刚把里克·福特的包给调包了
Nancy, our guys just switched Rick Ford's backpack.

913
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:53,210
这是个陷阱
It's a setup.

914
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:57,150
我要去警告他
I got to go warn him.

915
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,670
福特  福特小心  我得过去
Ford! Ford! Look out! I got to get through!

916
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,220
我孩子忘在商店里去了
I left my baby in the shop.

917
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,540
让一让  让我过去  我生病了
Get out of the way! Let me through, I'm sick!

918
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,790
苏珊  说你拉裤子上了
Susan, tell them you shat your pants.

919
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,560
你这么说我肯定立马让路
That would get me out of your way for sure.

920
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,170
我拉裤子上了
I shat my pants!

921
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:12,780
抱歉  福特
Excuse me. Ford!

922
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,370
他还有同伙
He's got a friend.

923
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,940
大家好  双手举起来
Hello everyone! Hands up!

924
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,220
舞动起来吧
Let's dance!

925
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,050
福特
Ford!

926
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:37,680
福特  福特
Ford! Ford!

927
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,810
话筒给我
I need your mic!

928
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:47,120
不  给我  不
No... I need. No!

929
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,850
我  不行
I... No!

930
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:51,700
不不不  别
No no no. Don't.

931
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,820
苏珊  你是要掩人耳目  你在干什么
Susan, you're meant to be blending in. What are you doing?

932
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,490
别  让开
No! Move!

933
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:00,280
里克·福特
Rick Ford!

934
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,530
话筒给我
Give me the mic!

935
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,640
你这么做没有用的
What you're doing doesn't help!

936
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,910
老天
Oh god.

937
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:10,680
里克·福特
Rick Ford!

938
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,790
他们把包对调了
They switched the bag!

939
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,380
我操
Oh, fuck!

940
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:19,930
都他妈给我让开  让开
Get out of the fucking way! Move!

941
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:21,420
都给他让路
Get out of his way!

942
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,410
让开
Move!

943
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:40,840
不好
Oh, no.

944
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:44,490
南希  我在追其中一个恐怖份子
Nancy, I'm in pursuit on one of the terrorists.

945
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,360
他照了我的照片  会曝光我的身份的
He took my picture, he's going to blow my cover.

946
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,630
你去追他 
You're in pursuit.

947
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:50,000
你找到他之后要干什么
What in god's name are you going to do when you catch him.

948
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,230
一锤子敲死他  我怎么知道
Knock him over with a hammer. I don't know.

949
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,440
我还在跟踪上报他的位置
I'm still tracking and reporting his location.

950
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:56,360
你这跟里克·福特干的事差不多
This all seem very Rick Fordy to me.

951
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:00,550
我不能原谅你这种性感但鲁莽的行为
I do not condone this sexy but reckless action of yours, Susan.

952
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,590
天  他跑进楼里了
Oh God. He went into a building.

953
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:14,790
干得好  就这样
Okay, girl. Well done, that's it.

954
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:16,380
今天就这么收工吧
Time to call it a day now.

955
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,540
位置局里面知道了
Location is officially noted.

956
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,800
-我要跟着他  -什么
- I'm following him in. - What?

957
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,430
为了范恩
I'm doing this for Fine.

958
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,420
他在顶楼
He's at the top of the stairs.

959
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,230
天啊  小心点
Oh God. Please be careful.

960
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:37,650
这已经超出你的能力范围了
You are incredibly out of your league.

961
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:39,750
现在感觉跟看自己拍的性爱录像一样
Oh. This is just like when I watched myself in a sex tape.

962
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,510
好多调情和搞笑戏码
There is just a lot of philandering and laughable moments.

963
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:44,600
南希  等我让你说话你再开口
Nancy, I need you to not talk, until I ask you to.

964
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,680
抱歉  我只是很紧张
I'm sorry. It's just that I'm really nervous.

965
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,670
小心点苏珊
Be careful Susan.

966
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:32,660
真巧啊  你也在楼上
Oh, hey. Imagine, running into you up here.

967
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,170
我只是在找鸟
I was just looking for my bird. I..

968
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:37,710
只是找找  沙包先生你在哪
just looking... Hey, Mr. Beanbag!

969
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:40,460
你喜欢鸟吗  好了  好了
You like birds? Alright. Alright.

970
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:43,770
我给你提个醒  我不想再看到
Let me give you a warning. I don't want to see anymore of that

971
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:45,650
那个炸弹什么的
funny bomb stuff. You know?

972
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,680
行了  够了
Alright, that's enough.

973
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,050
放下刀  不然我就开枪了
Drop the knife or I'll shoot.

974
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:51,550
你不会开枪的
I don't think you will.

975
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,970
你看  枪里面
You see. It works better

976
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:55,380
要有子弹才好用
when you have the bullets inside the gun.

977
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:01,720
中情局的训练一年不如一年了
I guess that CIA training isn't what it used to be.

978
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,230
你说得对  混球
Guess you're right, asshole!

979
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,810
不  不  不
No, no, no!

980
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:19,220
上帝啊
Oh God.

981
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:23,700
苏珊你干了什么
Oh Susan, what did you do?

982
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:30,750
老天  别吐他身上  别吐他身上
Oh God. Not on him. Not on him!

983
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:40,280
我为什么要吃炖菜啊
Oh, God, why did I have that stew?

984
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,520
蕾娜的人知道福特在巴黎
Well. Rayna's people obviously knew Ford was in Paris.

985
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,130
中情局特工
And getting footage

986
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,520
在公众场合引爆炸弹的视频
of a CIA operative setting off a bomb in a public

987
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,220
给哪个恐怖组织都是公关的好材料
could be a PR coup for any terrorist group.

988
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,100
查到他见的那个女人的消息了吗
Do we have anything on that woman he met?

989
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,970
面部检测没有任何消息
Facial recognition isn't showing anything.

990
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,570
他们一直盯着福特  你能找到他吗
They were all over Ford. Are you able to track him?

991
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:04,480
天杀的福特还不知道在巴黎哪里
Oh, God damn Ford is still off the grid in Paris.

992
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,360
我知道  因为他一直
I know, because he keeps

993
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,070
想黑进我们系统获取情报
trying to hack into our system for intel.

994
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:09,920
他就像条放跑的蠢狗
He's like a dog that gets loose from his yard,

995
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:13,090
在街坊里到处溜随地拉
and just keeps humping and shitting his way through the neighborhood.

996
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:16,620
是不是这样更...天哪
Would be a lot easier if... Oh, my God!

997
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,320
福特的更大
Ford's is bigger.

998
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,040
真不想看
This is uncomfortable.

999
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:25,390
有什么好指的啊  我们看得见
Why do they always point at it? We can see it.

1000
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:28,070
他死了吧  真可惜
He's dead though, isn't he? Aw. That's a waste.

1001
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:30,080
这里有段视频
Okay, here's a video.

1002
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,510
真不敢想是什么
I can only imagine what this is.

1003
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:33,210
一定要全拍下
Make sure you got everything on camera.

1004
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,570
要围绕着酒店  袭击之后再回来
Base out of the hotel, and go back there after the attack.

1005
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:37,200
我带雷纳多回罗马
I'll take Renaldo to Rome.

1006
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,740
雷纳多  有这个人的记录吗
Renaldo. We have a record of anyone with that name?

1007
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:40,810
据我所知没有
Not that I'm aware of.

1008
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:44,400
尼古拉  你有在听吗
Nicola. Are you listening to me?

1009
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,250
-我在试相机  -别玩了  找到福特
- I was just testing the camera. - Stop it. Find Ford.

1010
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:59,270
够了吧  这人有毛病吗
Come on, what is wrong with this person?

1011
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:02,180
该死  还卡住了  等等
Oh, damn it. Well, now the screen's frozen. Hang on.

1012
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:04,160
别给我看沙漏
Come on, not the hourglass.

1013
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,140
库珀  把相机放下
Cooper, put down the goddamn camera.

1014
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:10,340
南希  你把范恩在博亚诺夫办公室的视频找出来
Hey, Nancy. Can you pull up Fine's POV cam from Boyanov's office.

1015
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,200
然后看看桌子上的照片
And look on the desk there's some photos there

1016
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,210
看能不能找到他站在车旁的照片
and see if you can find one of him standing next to a car.

1017
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,660
雷纳多是辆劳斯莱斯
Renaldo is a Rolls Royce.

1018
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,300
黑进那辆车的追踪系统
Hack into the Rolls tracking system.

1019
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,410
那辆车是魅影所以有卫星辅助传动系统
That car's a Wraith so is has a Satellite Aided Transmission.

1020
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:30,820
接入博亚诺夫的信号
And tap into Boyanov's feed.

1021
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:31,840
他的定位系统会告诉你
His GPS should tell you

1022
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,290
德卢卡此时此刻具体在罗马哪里
exactly where De Luca is in Rome right now.

1023
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:35,710
我现在去机场
I'm gonna head to the airport.

1024
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,290
不用想了  库珀  你马上回来
Forget it, Cooper. You're coming back immediately.

1025
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:39,810
长官  我觉得我能办到
Ma'am, I really think I can do this.

1026
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,450
我不喜欢自吹自擂
And I'm not one to toot my own horn,

1027
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:43,120
但该出手时就出手
but you know what, I'm gonna toot.

1028
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,610
再说我刚救了很多人
And say that, I just saved a lot of people.

1029
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:48,530
我们离蕾娜和核弹很近了
We're so close in getting Rayna and that bomb.

1030
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,370
把角落里的地毯掀起来
Pull back that rug in the corner.

1031
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:58,500
-你有新身份了  -谢天谢地
- You'll be given a new identity. - Oh, thank God!

1032
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,430
不
Oh! No!

1033
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,850
你叫佩妮·摩根  来自爱荷华州的离异主妇
Your name is Penny Morgan. You're a divorced housewife from Iowa.

1034
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:06,910
你是全州玫琳凯销量最高的营业员
You sold more Marry Kay products than anyone else in your state.

1035
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:10,290
你卖掉赢来的车用作欧洲游资金
You traded in a free car you won to fund a trip through Europe.

1036
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:12,690
我喜欢做纸模和刺绣
My hobbies are decopatch and needlepoint.

1037
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:14,680
我收集瓷娃娃

1038
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,620
我还是埃姆斯花园俱乐部的副主席
And I am the Vice President of the Ames Garden Club.

1039
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,120
主席还是个副的
I couldn't even be president?

1040
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,020
为了增添悲剧效果  或许我该直接
Maybe I should just be married to one of the doll,

1041
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,010
嫁给其中一个娃娃算了
just to make it extra sad.

1042
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:24,010
十只猫  我养十只猫干什么
10 cats? What do I have 10 cats?

1043
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:25,790
养那么多合法吗
Is that even legal?

1044
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:28,860
以前范恩都是商人
You know Fine, he got to be a businessman.

1045
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,900
有次他还是赛车手
once he was even a race car driver.

1046
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,760
十只猫在这呢
Well, there's the 10 cats.

1047
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,120
就差没件写着我这辈子没过男人的上衣了
Just missing the shirt that says I've never felt the touch of a man.

1048
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,530
库珀  你说的没错
Oh Cooper, you're right.

1049
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:39,020
你在外面干得不错
You did good work back there.

1050
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,800
不然场面可能一发不可收拾
That would had been a real mess.

1051
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,830
谢谢你  长官
Thank you ma'am.

1052
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,820
但你还是让我当个养猫女人
You still went with the cat lady.

1053
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:46,300
反正都在地板那里了
It was already in the floor.

1054
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:54,320

I'll guide you to him. I've sent a ally to drive you.

Absolutely. No, he's the best.

1081
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:38,410
他  他  不过
He's-He. Oh. Though there had been

1082
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:40,500
也有人投诉他
some complaints filed against him.

1083
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,400
-看路  你倒是看路啊  -玛丽  我爱你
- Hey, watch the road! Watch the road! - Hey, Mary! I love you!

1084
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,830
天哪  看路吧
Oh my god! Watch the road!

1085
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,220
奥多真是争分夺秒啊
Wow. Aldo is making great time.

1086
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:56,130
推车
Watch the cart!

1087
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:57,330
没路了
Dead end!

1088
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,120
怎么能这样
This can't be right.

1089
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,310
老天爷
Oh my god.

1090
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:13,350
-神哪  -迷人的女士  我们到了
- God! - Intriguing lady, we're here.

1091
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:16,640
现在你得走了  因为我担心
Now. You must go because I fear,

1092
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,690
如果我再盯着你美丽的绿色双眸看一会儿
if I stare into your beautiful green eyes a moment longer,

1093
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:22,130
我会爱上你
I will fall in love.

1094
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:23,870
还是太晚了
Oh. Too late.

1095
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:25,360
你这一招真的有用吗
Might as if it ever worked?

1096
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,290
-那我就当成...  -不行
- I will take that as... - That's a no.

1097
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:29,780
-我就知道  -就是不行
- I Know. - Take that as a no.

1098
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,190
天哪
God.

1099
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:37,350
小姐
Hey, signora.

1100
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:38,850
你在打字啊
Ah, typing.

1101
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:41,240
你的手指好美
I admire your thumb.

1102
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:43,070
你刚还在钓我呢
You know. You were just hitting on me.

1103
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:45,340
-我就喜欢碰运气  -好啊  祝你好运
- I like to play the odds. - Yeah, well. Good luck.

1104
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:49,240
这是我的电话号码  记住  然后把它烧了
Here is my phone number. Memorize it, then burn it.

1105
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:53,300
我们面对的这些人就喜欢
These people we are dealing with, they like to, um...

1106
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:56,610
怎么说来着  杀你全家
How do you say it? Murder entire families.

1107
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:58,400
你有什么要给我的吗
Do you have something for me?

1108
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,240
我有没有东西要给你
Do I have something for you?

1109
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:03,820
-想让我给你点东西吗  -不是你想的那个
- Would you like something from me? - I-Not that.

1110
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:05,150
那你想要什么
What do you want from me?

1111
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,120
你应该给我一个装着枪的信封
You're suppose to have an envelope with my gun in it.

1112
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,790
我可没有枪
I don't have a gun.

1113
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:13,780
看着你就让我欲望无限
I am just arouse from looking you.

1114
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:18,300
开玩笑的  没有枪
It was a joke. There is no gun.

1115
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,880
他们说你不需要枪了
They said you would no longer be needing one.

1116
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,990
祝你好运
Good luck.

1117
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:24,710
拜拜
Bye.

1118
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:29,450
老天  为什么不是皮皮乐普[动画人物]
Gravy. Was Pepe Le Pew not available?

1119
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:30,610
别抱怨了  苏珊
Oh. Stop complaining, Susan.

1120
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:33,200
这一路你受到的调戏比我这几天
You're getting more actions than I had in days.

1121
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,840
这几个月  这几年
Months. Years.

1122
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:35,950
这三年零四十天受到的调戏还多
3 years and 40 days.

1123
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:37,800
德卢卡有什么新消息吗
Do you have an update on De Luca?

1124
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:41,960
有  有  他应该要停车了  就是现在
Yes, yup. He should be pulling up right about now.

1125
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:50,810
好帅啊
Oh, wow. He is hot.

1126
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:51,390
说实话吧
I'm not going to lie to you.

1127
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:52,910
我觉得我客观不了了
I don't think I can be objective anymore.

1128
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:55,530
我支持他了  我想让他赢
I'm rooting for that guy. I want him to win.

1129
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:57,700
我是开玩笑的苏珊  你别举报我
I'm joking Susan, don't report me.

1130
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:59,660
他还爱动手动脚
Ewk. And he is handsy.

1131
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:02,960
咱们就把联络点放在你身后的点心店吧
Let's set up camp in the pastry shop behind you.

1132
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,450
据我们的消息  德卢卡整晚都会在赌场
According to our data De Luca spends all night at the casino.

1133
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,850
-我要混进去  南希  -苏珊  伊莲说了
- I'm going in, Nancy. - Susan, you heard Elaine.

1134
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:11,700
跟踪和回报  不许接触
Track and report. No contact.

1135
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,440
那我就跟踪德卢卡进去  然后再汇报呗
I'll track De Luca inside, and then I'll report.

1136
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:18,400
如果是他先找我聊  那我  那我也没办法
And if he initiate contacts with me, I'll just- I'll go with it.

1137
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,090
苏珊  那里不适合你这个爱猫女士
Susan, your cat lady look is not going to fit in, in there.

1138
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,370
是啊  那佩妮·摩根就得扔掉猫短袖
That's right. Penny Morgan is gonna burn her cat T-shirt

1139
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:25,080
花点置装费
and spend some of that Mary Kay money.

1140
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,320
你要一反到底啊
This is full blown rogue.

1141
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:42,300
美女  你太漂亮了  好美
Hey, beautiful looking! You are so pretty! Beautiful!

1142
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,730
你们太坏了
You guys are terrible. Awh.

1143
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:46,730
你这么用心装扮  真希望德卢卡还在里面
I really hope De Luca is still in there, for your sake.

1144
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:48,610
而且他们不会给你报销的
And they're not going to reimburse you for that.

1145
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:50,230
你不应该去那么贵的店  苏珊
You should've gone to cheaper stores, Susan.

1146
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:53,490
-好  我下线了  南希  -等  等等  等下
- Okay. I'm going offline, Nancy. - Wait-wait. Wait-wait. Su...

1147
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:54,470
苏珊
Susan!

1148
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,300
各位帅小伙儿你们好
Well. Bonjour now, boys.

1149
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:03,260
如果我十分钟后还没出来
If I'm not out in 10 minutes

1150
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:05,040
那说明这里都归我了
it's because I won the place.

1151
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,280
让我揉揉你的头发  沾沾好运
Let me just rub that for luck.

1152
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,190
油油的  你的头太油了
Oh, that's an oily- that's an oily scalp.

1153
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,830
太漂亮了
Enchanting.

1154
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:22,470
不好意思  我得问一下您的身份
I'm sorry. But I have to check you in.

1155
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:25,280
-您的名字  -佩妮·摩根
- Your name, please. - Penny Morgan.

1156
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,930
我 我这里没您的名字
I-I don't see you on the list. I'm so sorry.

1157
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:29,100
她是和我一起的
She's with me.

1158
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,670
亲爱的
Darling.

1159
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,310
你迟到了  不过你这一身装扮
You're late. The way you look,

1160
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:35,430
我等的真值得
I say it's more than worth the wait.

1161
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:37,670
走吧  去喝一杯
Come. Let's get a drink.

1162
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:38,440
真绅士
Such a gentleman.

1163
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:41,780
你今晚太迷人了  亲爱的
You look absolutely stunning tonight. And darling...

1164
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,230
你他妈在这干什么
What the fuck are you doing in here?

1165
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:45,940
这语气转换真快  你在这干什么
Well, that's quit a tone changes and what are you doing in here?

1166
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,850
你要害得我被暴露了
You're completely compromising me right now.

1167
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:50,230
我害你  太搞笑了吧
Oh, I'm compromising you? Fucking hilarious.

1168
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:51,150
为了进来
You're about to cause a scene

1169
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,150
你都快成全场焦点了
trying to get into this fucking place.

1170
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:53,650
我好歹努力一把  我还能怎么做
Give me a little credit. What do you think I'm going to do?

1171
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:54,580
一路横冲直撞  边走边说
Run over and be like:

1172
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:56,310
"我是疯女人  自助餐在哪里"
"Hey, I'm a crazy lady! Where's the buffet?

1173
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,590
我是从中西部莱德  蓝人乐队在哪里
I'm from the Midwest. Where's Blue man group?"

1174
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:00,860
拜托  我又不傻  福特  你才是傻瓜
Okay. I'm not an idiot, Ford! You're an idiot!

1175
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,950
你根本不应该来这个赌场  因为德卢卡在这
You should not be in this casino, because De Luca is here.

1176
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:03,930
我得混到他身边
And I need to get close to him.

1177
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:05,470
是吗  怎么混
Yeah. How are you going to do that?

1178
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,330
你要怎么做呢  库珀
How are you going to do that, Cooper?

1179
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:08,910
怎么  你要勾引他吗  这就是你的妙计吗
What. You're going to seduce him? That your big fucking plan?

1180
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:11,200
对  如果我说是呢  有这么难以置信吗
Yeah. What if it is? Why is it so hard to believe?

1181
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,330
因为你更像婚礼乐队的长笛演员
Because you look like a flute player in a wedding band.

1182
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:14,570
这他妈就是原因
That's fucking why!

1183
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:16,230
我来这就是要把德卢卡带出去
I'm here to take De Luca out.

1184
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:18,330
听起来真浪漫  祝你好运
Oh, sounds romantic. I hope you get lucky.

1185
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:20,310
扯淡  我要是想声音浪漫
God damn it. If I was trying to sound romantic,

1186
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,650
你就会躺在地板上  浑身湿透气喘吁吁
you would be on another floor, soaking wet and breathless.

1187
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:24,560
想着自己刚经历了什么  但我没有浪漫
Wondering what came over you. But I'm not!

1188
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,930
所以滚开  别挡我的路
So get the fuck out of my way.

1189
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:28,220
我还是需要你谨慎点  伙计
I need you to rein it in, buddy. Okay.

1190
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,260
如果你干掉了德卢卡  我们就没机会接近蕾娜了
If you take out De Luca, we don't have a shot at getting Rayna.

1191
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:32,430
所以请像5000级选手那样把它拿下
So take it down like 5000 notches.

1192
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:33,290
拿下  就是这样
Take it down. That's how

1193
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:35,210
-才会钋2000中毒  都在你的饮料里  -天哪
- you get polonium 2000. In your drink -Oh God.

1194
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:37,740
我因为辐射中毒连续18个月被特殊护理
I got 18 months in intensive care for radiation poisoning.

1195
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,310
6个月不能用眼
I got 6 months without eyes,

1196
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:41,470
我爱的所有人都被杀了
While everyone I ever loved is gunned down.

1197
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:43,370
真的假的  你爱的人
Really. Everyone that you loved

1198
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:45,140
全都被杀了  就你自己活了下来
has been gunned down, and just you survived.

1199
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:45,750
你有没有想过
Did you ever think that

1200
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,590
也许你爱的人不是被杀的
maybe everybody you loved is not being killed,

1201
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:48,860
而是自杀的
but they're killing themselves

1202
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:50,910
因为他们实在无法忍受你在身边
because they can't stand to be around you.

1203
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:52,800
这里是真的  生死一线
This shit is the real deal. Life and death.

1204
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,220
外勤  跟你原来
This, the field, is hell a lot different

1205
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,640
坐在该死的显示器前谷歌根本不一样
than sitting behind your fucking monitor googling shit.

1206
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,250
离我远点  福特  别让德卢卡看到你
Stay away from me, Ford. And do not let De Luca see you.

1207
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,370
还有  你的枪
And by the way, I can see

1208
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:02,990
从你后口袋露出来了
your gun sticking out of your back pocket.

1209
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,780
除非你真是与常人不一样
Unless you're so extreme,

1210
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:07,370
否则就是你屁股上长了一个鸡鸡
you got a second dick coming out of your hip!

1211
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,660
您好
Oh, Konichiwa.

1212
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,760
-女士  -是的  你好
- Ma'am, - Yes yes.

1213
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,010
-这个座位已经有人了  -当然  没问题
- Seats are reserved. - Of course they are, yes.

1214
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:47,680
得请您出去等了
I'm going to have to ask you to wait outside.

1215
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,110
当然  没问题
Yes, absolutely.

1216
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:50,760
不行吗  从另一个门走
No? Another door?

1217
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,730
我就知道  当然还有一扇门了
I knew that. Of course there's another door.

1218
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:54,960
肯定总有这种事发生
Probably happens all the time.

1219
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,160
-这事头一回  -好吧
- It's never happened before. - Okay.

1220
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:00,120
-女士  -什么事
- Ma'am? -Yes.

1221
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:05,550
女士  您就在这好了  别再到处乱转了
Ma'am, right here is okay. No more exploring, please.

1222
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:07,230
好  很好
Okay. Lovely.

1223
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:21,910
-南希  -苏珊
- Nancy? - Susan?

1224
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:23,450
老天爷
Oh my god. Hi.

1225
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:26,250
我找到蕾娜了  她和德卢卡在一起
I found her. I found Rayna. She's with De Luca.

1226
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:30,260
你成功了  真是出色的追踪和回报  女士
You did it. Excellent trucking and reporting, madam.

1227
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,420
天哪  刚有人在她的杯子里下了药
Oh my god. Somebody just put something in her drink.

1228
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,200
是什么  毒药吗
What is it? Is it poison?

1229
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,130
反正不是纤维补充剂
I don't think it's a fiber supplement.

1230
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:52,890
她杀了范恩  南希
She killed Fine, Nancy.

1231
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,510
我应该很希望她
I could really enjoyed just

1232
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:56,520
现在就死的
watching her die right now.

1233
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,160
她又是唯一一个知道炸弹在哪的人
And she's the only one who knows where the bomb is.

1234
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,850
杜达耶夫就永远找不到炸弹了
So Dudaev will never get his hands on it.

1235
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:02,790
老天  苏珊  你要怎么做
Oh god, Susan. What're you going to do?

1236
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,610
抱歉  女士
Excuse me, ma'am.

1237
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:07,590
女士  你懂英语吗
Ma'am, hi. Do you speak English?

1238
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:11,370
好像有人给你的鸡尾酒里下了药
Because I think somebody just put a roofie in your cocktail.

1239
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:13,820
-不是你下的吗  -你说什么
- Are you sure it wasn't you? - What?

1240
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,840
不  老天  当然不是  我永远不会
No. God, I wouldn't - I would never.

1241
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,170
你能不能指出来是谁呢
Could you point the man out?

1242
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:20,230
他刚从那个门溜出去了
Well, he just kind of zipped out that door.

1243
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,220
戴着紫色领结
He's wearing a purple bow tie.

1244
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:30,290
谢谢你  你叫
Thank you, Miss...?

1245
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:32,530
佩妮·摩根
Oh. Penny Morgan.

1246
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:35,060
这都不算什么  真的
Oh, it's no trouble. Really, I mean.

1247
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:38,060
我觉得姑娘们  就得互相照顾着
I think us ladies, have to watch out for each other.

1248
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:40,180
这种事时有发生
I mean these kind of thing happens all the time.

1249
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:43,280
居然有人想给你下药吗
And people often try to roofie... you?

1250
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,900
有一次  我跟人要泰诺
Once, I asked someone for a Tylenol,

1251
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:47,010
他们给了我泰诺加强版
and they gave me a Tylenol PM.

1252
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:49,520
虽然我不清楚他们想干嘛  但是
I'm not sure what their intentions were. But.

1253
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:54,390
他们好像找到他了
It seems they may have found him.

1254
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:56,590
你要不要跟我去看看啊
Would you come with me to identify him?

1255
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:58,880
当然可以  我...
Yes, of course. I'm...

1256
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,060
很高兴能帮上忙
happy to help.

1257
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,860
我滴个神啊
Holy shit.

1258
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:15,470
我朋友说看到你在我杯子里放东西
My friend here says she saw you put something in my drink.

1259
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:17,220
你的人我一个都不认识
I don't know any of you people.

1260
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,790
我来罗马也只是做生意
Okay, I'm just in Rome on business.

1261
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:21,350
这就要回酒店睡了
I was about to head back to my hotel and go to sleep.

1262
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:22,550
很好
Perfect.

1263
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:24,830
正好可以喝一杯睡前酒
Just in time for a night cap.

1264
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:26,310
这杯酒又没有问题
Apparently there's nothing wrong with it.

1265
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:28,130
我不想喝你的酒
I don't want your drink.

1266
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,200
操你妈  蕾娜
Fuck you, Rayna.

1267
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,990
很不错
Mmm. Scrumptious.

1268
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,860
你丢脸了吧
So. Jokes on you.

1269
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:54,120
你混蛋
Fuck you.

1270
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:58,530
混蛋
Fuck you.

1271
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:22,390
我晕了多久
How long was I out?

1272
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:24,510
不太长  我们刚嘲笑完你
You fainted just long enough for us to laugh at you.

1273
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:27,610
-出什么事了  -只是做梦而已
- What happened? - It was all a dream.

1274
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:30,200
开玩笑  有个人的嗓子融化了
I'm just kidding. A man's throat dissolved.

1275
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,150
不好意思  那不怪我
Sorry, that wasn't my fault.

1276
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,470
谢谢  你们真是...
Oh, thank you. That's...

1277
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:39,220
超级有礼貌
surprisingly polite.

1278
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:40,650
不好意思  我只是
Sorry about that. I just...

1279
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:43,040
我最近见识了很多  只是从来
I mean I've seen a lot of things in my days. I just never

1280
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:45,600
还没见过这个
I have never seen that, exactly.

1281
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:46,520
佩妮
Penny.

1282
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,520
你需不需要跟谁倾诉一下刚看到的事
Do you feel the need to tell anybody about what you just saw?

1283
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,190
我会不会说出去  这个混球
Am I going to tell anybody? You know that

1284
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:57,150
是罪有应得
asshole got what he deserved. I mean.

1285
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:59,880
第一眼就看出来他不是好人
I knew the second I saw him, I thought.

1286
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,590
他就不配有嗓子
That guy doesn't deserve a throat.

1287
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:03,470
所以  做得好
So. Good on you.

1288
01:03:05,170 --> 01:03:08,060
我要带你去吃饭  表示感谢
I would like to take you to dinner, to say thank you.

1289
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:10,150
咱们必须说一下你这丑爆了的裙子
And we must discuss this hideous dress.

1290
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:11,640
看着真是搞笑
It's just hysterical.

1291
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:12,880
好  真好
Oh, ha ha. Good.

1292
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:16,080
我  我也正想去呢
That's- That's what I was hoping... for.

1293
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,450
还有
Oh. And by the way!

1294
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:20,260
克里斯托本来是在酒吧里照顾我安全的
Christo is suppose to be looking after me at the bar

1295
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:23,240
防止任何人在我的饮料中下药
making sure nobody would put anything in my drinks.

1296
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:29,750
他们会跟他聊聊的
They'll give him a talking-to.

1297
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:32,510
可以扣他一天工资
Seems fair maybe dock him a day's wage.

1298
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:34,840
或者直接爆头  百试百灵
Or shoot him in the head. That always works.

1299
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:38,530
-罗马真是太美了  -罗马很烂
- You know, Rome is quite amazing. - Rome is the worst.

1300
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:40,390
-是  -超级无聊  土里土气的
- Yes. - So boring and tacky.

1301
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:43,290
终于有人肯说出来了
I'm so glad one of us finally said it.

1302
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:46,900
-你的唇膏弄到了牙上  -是吗
- You have lipstick on your teeth. - Really?

1303
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,790
看起来像吃了一盒蜡笔
Looks like you had a box of crayons.

1304
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:49,810
他妹的
Damn it.

1305
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:52,220
您的菜
Here we are.

1306
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,980
我们一坐下就应该上来的
These should have been brought out when we first sat down.

1307
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:56,720
我也是这么想的
That's exactly what I was thinking.

1308
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,770
目前我对你们的服务失望透顶
So far I'm riddled with disappointed at the service.

1309
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:03,090
抱歉  我明白了  女士  我道歉
So sorry. I know, signora. I apologize.

1310
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:09,550
我之前见有人吃过一个
You know, I once saw someone eat one of

1311
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:11,320
这个
these before.

1312
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,660
好奇怪
This is strange.

1313
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:17,370
你吃东西都要撕成小块吗
Do you always tear your food up into little pieces?

1314
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,910
好像松鼠
You look like a squirrel.

1315
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:22,440
我就是看看好不好撕
I was just checking for the consistency

1316
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:26,320
跟个小孩子似的
You eat like a baby.

1317
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,640
谢谢
Thank You.

1318
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:31,290
要不要看一下酒单呢
So, would you like to have a look at the wine list?

1319
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:33,260
好  佩妮  你来点吧
Yes. Penny, you can order.

1320
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:37,510
好吧  半干
Okay. Oh. Passum.

1321
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:40,970
我想  想要一瓶红
OK. I'm feeling- I'm feeling a red

1322
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:43,130
红色的  口味各种混杂
Kind of a red. Like a lot of noise.

1323
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:46,240
余味有点像猫狗叫
Like a little bit of a-a barky finish.

1324
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:50,230
还想点一瓶白葡萄酒  里面要有鸡毛网
I tend to like a white, with the grid of a hamus

1325
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,730
当然了  是要稀释的
That's, of course, been thinned out.

1326
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:55,680
瞬间附着上你的味蕾
Just kind of jump up in the front of your palate...

1327
01:04:55,690 --> 01:05:01,270
然后滑下  冒着泡  有种矿物式的泥土味
and then rip back and sizzle. Almost a mineral kind of dirt...

1328
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:03,730
收尾  如果吃肉的话
finish... if we're having meat.

1329
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:07,930
好了  这个挺好  还有...
Okay, here, this is looking promising. Something with...

1330
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:10,570
这个有吐司
This one has nice hints of toast...

1331
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:12,780
还有山茱萸吧
and dogwood, I assume? Hmm?

1332
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:19,150
我要一份风味美食
I will have the Sapori e Delicia.

1333
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:22,880
好的  可是那是我们餐厅的名字
Right. That is the name of this restaurant.

1334
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,080
我当然知道  所以
Yes, I'm aware of that. So.

1335
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:28,200
要不你上点我们不知道的  给我们来份惊喜
Why don't you surprise us with something we don't know?

1336
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,850
比如说  一瓶好酒
Like a delicious bottle of wine.

1337
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:32,890
好的  抱歉  我5分钟就回来
Right, sorry. I'll be back in 5 minutes, okay.

1338
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:35,350
好的服务生可真难找
So hard to get good help these days.

1339
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:37,760
是吧  我就觉得
Don't you find that? I find that.

1340
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,400
我知道你们所有在职特工的名字
I know who all your active agents are.

1341
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:48,880
好吧  我感觉...  重来一次好吗
Okay, I'm sensing, uh... Can I do a little do over?

1342
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:53,260
我真不懂怎么点酒
I really don't know how to order wine.

1343
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,720
我家在爱荷华州的小镇上
I'm from a small town in Iowa.

1344
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,660
这趟来罗马花了所有积蓄
I saved up my money to come on this Rome trip.

1345
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:01,330
我桌子上有个小罐子  大家都说
I had a little jar on my desk at work and everybody said,

1346
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:02,360
"你肯定赚不够钱的"
"You're never gonna make enough money."

1347
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,910
但我赚够了  我来了
But I did, and I'm here.

1348
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:07,050
然后我就遇见你了  可我...
And then I meet you, and I can't afford...

1349
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:08,440
可吃不起这种饭店
to eat at a place like this,

1350
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,930
我只想给你个好印象
and I'm just trying to impress you...

1351
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:13,620
结果还是没成功
and doing a really poor job of it.

1352
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,700
我也觉得
I thought as much.

1353
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:20,370
你那便宜的舞会裙子一看就不怎么高档
Your cheap prom dress doesn't exactly scream sophistication.

1354
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:23,390
我没去过舞会  所以...
Well, I didn't go to prom, so maybe it is...

1355
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:25,330
我小时候是在保加利亚长大的
When I was a little girl growing up in Bulgaria

1356
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:27,190
那真是世界上最差的地方
which is the worst by the way.

1357
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:30,320
到处都是穷人  顿顿吃白菜
Poor people everywhere and cabbage is continuously cooking.

1358
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,190
有一个女人被赶出了家
There was this woman who was kicked out of her house.

1359
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,800
还把钱丢了
And she lost all her money.

1360
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,480
连卖身都不行
She couldn't even sell her body.

1361
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,290
后来她就做了街头小丑
So she became a clown on the streets.

1362
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:41,630
她站在泥里表演自己会的所有的戏法
She would performed all her tricks standing in mud.

1363
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:44,150
一直哭啊哭
And just cry and cry.

1364
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:47,220
你让我想起了她
You remind me of this woman.

1365
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:48,980
谢谢啊
Yo, thank you.

1366
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:52,100
我也不清楚  但你的感觉
I don't know what it is, but there's something about you.

1367
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:55,120
晕倒啊  说话啊
The fainting, the way you talk...

1368
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:57,120
不懂穿衣服啊
your terrible sense of style.

1369
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,760
我这个是在...
I did get this at quite a lovely...

1370
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:03,020
想想你来罗马花了所有积蓄我就伤心
It makes me sad to think of you here spending all your savings on Rome.

1371
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:05,520
走吧  我们要去布达佩斯
Come on! We're going to Budapest.

1372
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,710
-布  布达佩斯  -那里我还有点事要办
- Bu-Budapest? - I have some business to finish there.

1373
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:10,150
结束以后你可以坐我的私人客机
And you can take my private jet when we're done.

1374
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:11,800
想到哪到哪
Anywhere you want to get home.

1375
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,180
回报你的救命之恩
My way of repaying you for saving my life.

1376
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:15,180
好吧
Okay.

1377
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:21,080
怎么了  有问题吗
Is there a problem?

1378
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:28,430
没  完全没问题  走吧
No, not at all. Let's go.

1379
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:32,500
怎么  怎么了  我就是跟姑娘聊天
Hey, what? What? I'm just talking with the girl.

1380
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,110
好了  好了  咱们还是别把事情弄大了
Okay okay. Let's not make a scene.

1381
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,470
我觉得我还需要点时间  拿到我的房卡
You know what I need. Just get my room key out

1382
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,680
拿个包收拾收拾我的东西
and I'll grab a bag and pack my things.

1383
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:40,730
是苏珊  她在给我们发信息
It's Susan. She's sending a code.

1384
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:43,300
-不用  回头再收拾吧  -关
- No, they can collect you back later. - Shut

1385
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,880
-如果你其他的衣服也都像这样的话  -闭
- And if the rest of your clothes are like that dress - down

1386
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:48,100
我可以派人替你烧了
I can send someone to burn them for you.

1387
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:50,370
-电源  -真风趣
- the power. - Quit a zinger.

1388
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:54,830
关闭罗马赌场的电源
Shut down the power to the casino in Rome.

1389
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:55,760
什么
What?

1390
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:59,360
那就把整个电网关闭  快点
Well, shut the entire bloody grid down then. Now!

1391
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:00,890
那可真是太好了
That would be great.

1392
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:07,860
大家请保持冷静  原地别动
Everybody please remain calm. Stay where you are.

1393
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:16,840
天啊  发生什么了
Oh, no! What's happening?

1394
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:27,010
我搞定了
I've got this.

1395
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:30,790
到底发生什么事了
What the fuck just happened?

1396
01:08:32,130 --> 01:08:34,270
-该死的  -我的天啊  蕾娜
- God damn it. - Oh my god. Rayna.

1397
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:36,150
感谢上帝  你的头发保护了你
Thank god your hair broke your fall.

1398
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:37,990
我也不知道为什么突然就断电了
I don't know what happened. The lights were going out.

1399
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,590
我还以为是抢劫  你的两个保镖撞上了我
And I thought it was a robbery. Two of your guys slammed into me.

1400
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:44,360
还把你撞倒了  他们其中一个还摸了我屁股
And took you down. I think one of them touched my bottom.

1401
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:47,500
不知道是谁  但的确有只手
I don't know which one, but I definitely felt a hand.

1402
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:48,900
他们没事吧
Are they going to be okay?

1403
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:50,230
不用担心他们
I wouldn't be worried about them.

1404
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:52,840
他们完蛋了
Their fate has just been sealed.

1405
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:57,570
抱歉  我让你先走  你先走
Sorry, oh. I'll let you go. Let you go.

1406
01:08:57,570 --> 01:08:58,740
你们真没用
Shame on you!

1407
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:11,180
这私人飞机真豪华
This is a really jetsy plane.

1408
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:12,420
你的吗
Is this yours?

1409
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:14,870
-我父亲的  -这样啊
- It is my father's. - Oh.

1410
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:16,820
你从来没坐过私人飞机吗
You've never been on a private jet before?

1411
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,020
没有
Oh no.

1412
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:20,750
我曾经坐过高级经济舱
I did get upgraded to premium economy once,

1413
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:23,470
非常豪华
which was pretty plush.

1414
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:25,030
高级经济舱
Premium economy.

1415
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,490
听起来像是围畜生的围栏
Sounds like a pen for dirty animals.

1416
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:31,530
可能是  不过不像这里
Yeah, probably. But it was not quite like this.

1417
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:33,180
谢谢
Thank you.

1418
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:36,240
你为什么对我这么好
Why are you being so nice to me?

1419
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:39,900
不会只是让你想起了可悲的保加利亚小丑吧
Can't just be because I remind you of some sad Bulgarian clown.

1420
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:41,910
你让我想起了我妈妈
You remind me of my mother.

1421
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,270
真的吗  我和你  你懂的
Really? You know that... I mean, you and I are.

1422
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:48,470
我们年龄差不多
You know, pretty close in age.

1423
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:51,370
你真幽默  真像那个保加利亚小丑
You're funny. It's the Bulgarian clown in you.

1424
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:53,110
-好吧  -她是个很了不起的女人
- Okay. - She was marvelous.

1425
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:56,620
但她很特别  和你一样特别古怪
But she was different. Eccentric, like you are.

1426
01:09:57,390 --> 01:09:59,960
当我看这着你这身破衣服时
The moment I saw you standing there in that abortion of a dress.

1427
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:02,490
-得了吧  -它仿佛在告诉我
- Oh, come on. - It's as if to say

1428
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:05,560
我就只有这件衣服  虽然丑也还是我的
This is what I got, world. It's hideous, but it's mine.

1429
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:09,970
-这就是她  -天啊
- This was her. - Oh, wow!

1430
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:12,890
你怎么有我这张照片  拍得我太美了
Hey, how did you get that picture of me? I look amazing.

1431
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:14,920
你好  另一个我
Hello doppelganger.

1432
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,190
她是我唯一相信的人
She was the only person I could ever trust.

1433
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:21,280
-敬你妈妈  -敬我妈妈
- Well. Here's to your mom. - To my mother.

1434
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,650
-还有你  -还有你
- And to you. - And here's to you.

1435
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:26,570
虽然你不怎么聪明
You may never be as wise as an owl,

1436
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:28,780
但我觉得你还挺灵光
but you'll always be a hoot to me.

1437
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:31,780
这祝酒词真他妈傻
What a stupid fucking retarded toast.

1438
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:33,940
-你太好了  -你也是
- You're delightful. - As are you.

1439
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:40,710
你说我们要去哪里来着
Now. Where did you say we're headed?

1440
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:45,540
哪里
Headed

1441
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:47,920
你说我们要
Where did you say we're...

1442
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:49,950
天啊
Oh. God.

1443
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:51,910
如果你感觉被下药了
If you ever feel like you've been poisoned

1444
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:54,790
嚼一片这个  嚼一片这个
Chew one of these. Chew one of these.

1445
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:10,890
怎么回事
What happened?

1446
01:11:10,890 --> 01:11:14,060
我没见过谁死了还想吃大便软化剂
I've never seen somebody dive for stool softener before.

1447
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:16,040
这是一件事
That's one thing that happened.

1448
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:19,450
你干什么了  你给我下药了吗
What did you do? Did you drug me?

1449
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:22,530
当然  我告诉过你  我不相信任何人
Of course I did. I told you, I can't trust anybody.

1450
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:24,720
反正我都得检查你的东西
I had to look through your things. Anyway.

1451
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,960
告诉我  你的痔疮
Tell me. Are you hemorrhoids

1452
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,380
是特别大  还是只是顽固
particularly large or just tenacious?

1453
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:29,990
别发信息了
Stop texting!

1454
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:31,660
我没有发信息
I'm not texting if you must know.

1455
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:34,410
我只是在玩糖果传奇  刚过了第95关
I'm playing Candy Crash. And I just made level 95.

1456
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:36,540
你太无礼了
God, that is so rude.

1457
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,080
天啊  科林  你在干什么
Jesus, Colin, What the fuck are you doing?

1458
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:43,920
很抱歉  蕾娜  计划有变
I'm sorry, Rayna but there's been a change of plans.

1459
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,090
谁买通了你  科林
Who paid you off, Colin?

1460
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:48,670
科林八个月前就辞职了  我是弗雷德里克
Colin hasn't worked here for like 8 months. I'm Frederick.

1461
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:49,500
这就是原因吗
Is that why you are doing this?

1462
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:51,360
因为我不记得你的名字
Because I didn't remember your fucking name?

1463
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:51,970
这样说吧
Let's just say there are

1464
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:54,570
很多人都想要你卖的东西
people who really want what you're selling.

1465
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:56,060
你不必这样
You don't have to do this.

1466
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:59,360
我可以让你过上舒服的日子  科...
I can give you a very comfortable life. Col...

1467
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:01,000
你又忘了我的名字吧
You forgot my name again, didn't you?

1468
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,470
不  不  我没有  
No. No, I didn't.

1469
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:04,160
你叫
It's... Hmm.

1470
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,960
你敢叫我科林试试
Don't say fucking Colin.

1471
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,310
操  我不在乎你的名字
Fuck. I don't give a shit what your name is.

1472
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:09,620
你就是个打杂的
You're the fucking help.

1473
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:11,110
干得不错  科林

但我和斯坦早就看
But Stan and I already se...

1475

我叫弗雷德里克  弗雷德里克
It's Frederick! Frederick!

1476
01:12:18,350 --> 01:12:20,650
抱歉  小姐  他们只雇佣我
Sorry lady. But they only paid me for one...

1477
01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:29,740
天啊
Wha! Come on!

1478
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:33,620
蕾娜  赶紧去把飞机稳定下来
Rayna, go to the cockpit and level us out!

1479
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:36,230
说得好像我会开飞机一样
Like I know how to fly a fucking airplane!

1480
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:39,480
太神奇了
This was weird.

1481
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,040
你就吹吧  小姐
Blow that thing all you want, lady.

1482
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:49,600
那你怎么不去死[给我吹]  科林
Yeah. Why don't you blow me, Colin.

1483
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,330
我叫弗雷德里克
Aww. It's Frederick.

1484
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,490
该死的
Oh. For fuck sake.

1485
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:37,890
我知道怎么做了
I got it. I know what to do.

1486
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:42,470
你还好吗
Oh, are you okay?

1487
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:45,110
不好  有个死人的头塞在我屁股里
No! I got a dead man's head up in my ass!

1488
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:47,780
这下是为了范恩的  下冲气流
This one's for Fine. Down draft!

1489
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,780
还来  你会不会开啊
Not again! Do you have any idea what you are fucking doing!

1490
01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:56,380
控制板太灵敏了
Oh. The controls are so sensitive.

1491
01:13:56,380 --> 01:14:00,180
天啊  死人居然还拉屎了
God. One of these dead fuckers just shit his pants.

1492
01:14:00,830 --> 01:14:02,390
等等
Okay, wait a minute.

1493
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,900
我能行的  我能行的  好了
I got it. I think I got, okay.

1494
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:07,010
终于好了
Okay.

1495
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,170
幸亏我用过飞行模拟器软件
Good thing I learned to use that Flight Simulator app, huh.

1496
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:15,670
恭喜你  佩妮·摩根
Congratulations Penny Morgan.

1497
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,870
你刚暴露了你的身份
You just blew your cover.

1498
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:22,140
调到自动驾驶  站起来
Now put the plane on autopilot and get up.

1499
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:26,680
再废话  我就把你的脑袋打爆
Any bullshit and I'll blow

1500
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:29,600
把你个中情局特工崩死
your CIA brains all over that control panel.

1501
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,020
我知道你在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

1502
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:32,810
但你错了
And you're wrong.

1503
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:36,460
我的真名是
My real name is

1504
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:38,060

1505
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:41,170
-我会叫  -安珀·瓦伦丁
- My would be. - Amber Valentine.

1506
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:43,330
你还是个A片明星啊
What are you? A porn star?

1507
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:45,920
你真他妈搞笑
You're fucking hilarious, huh?

1508
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,120
我是个私人保镖  你父亲雇我保护你的
I'm a private bodyguard, and your father hired me to protect you.

1509
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,880
你是保镖  得了吧
Bodyguard. You? Please.

1510
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,120
可笑  在我看来  如果没有我
That's funny. 'Causes the way I see it. Without me.

1511
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,480
你早就撞上阿尔卑斯山了
You would currently be crashed in the Alps right now.

1512
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,600
或是躺在太平间
Or you'll be laying in the morgue

1513
01:14:57,610 --> 01:14:58,970
喉咙被烧了个洞
with a hole burned in your throat.

1514
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:01,440
你这娇惯的婊子
You little spoiled piece of shit!

1515
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,990
我爸为什么会雇像你这样的人
Why would my father hired somebody like you?

1516
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:07,030
因为他相信我
Because he trusted me.

1517
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:10,190
而且不知道为啥他爱你
And for whatever fucking reason, he loved you.

1518
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,900
他不希望你知道我在保护你
Didn't even want you to know I'm watching you.

1519
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:14,760
是他让我捏造佩妮·摩根
So, he's the one who made me come up

1520
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,000
这个一塌糊涂的失败者
with this whole loser Penny Morgan bullshit.

1521
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:20,640
你看起来就像我死去的妈妈
Yeah, Oh, you looked like dead, like my dead mama.

1522
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:25,530
还说我像那个操蛋的畜生
And fuck you for saying I look anything like that fucking beast!

1523
01:15:25,530 --> 01:15:27,920
难怪你爸爸一直没能有儿子
No wonder your father never had the son he wanted.

1524
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:29,610
你上那畜生一次
You fuck that monster once and

1525
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:32,040
你就会撒腿就跑
you just dropped the fucking mic and walked out.

1526
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,630
去你的  你说的都是假的
Fuck you! Everything you said is a lie.

1527
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:36,290
怎么了
Oh, what happened?

1528
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:37,890
我戳中你的软肋了吗
Did I hit a little sore spot?

1529
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,000
他一直就想要个儿子  你知道的
Yeah. He always wanted a son, and you knew it.

1530
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:43,430
听着  他想你接手生意
Look. He wanted you to take over the business.

1531
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:45,790
他只是怕你会害死自己
He's just afraid you'll get yourself killed.

1532
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:48,480
如果你想活下来  把炸弹卖掉
So, if you want to live and you want to load that bomb,

1533
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,770
你就跟紧我
you stick with me.

1534
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:51,810
如果你有意见
And if you got a problem with that...

1535
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:53,970
知道你可以干什么吗  蕾娜
Know what you can do, Rayna?

1536
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:57,630
你用你那狗屁英音
You and your bullshit accent

1537
01:15:57,630 --> 01:16:00,410
把这飞机降落吧
can land this fucking plane by yourselves.

1538
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,630
好吧  保镖
Okay, bodyguard.

1539
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:07,230
要是我发现你说谎
But if I find out you're lying to me about of any of this,

1540
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:10,320
我会让你死得很难看
I'll show you ways to die you've never even dreamed of.

1541
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:15,270
出发去布达佩斯吧  我需要喝一杯
Now let's go to Budapest. I need a fucking drink.

1542
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:17,090
我想也是
Yeah, I bet you fucking do.

1543
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,740
我的天啊
Oh my God.

1544
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:32,100
{\an8}{\pos(139,154)}布达佩斯_匈牙利

1545
01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:40,110
{\an8}四季酒店

1546
01:16:44,150 --> 01:16:46,060
欢迎回来布达佩斯四季酒店  博亚诺夫小姐
Welcome back to the Four Seasons Budapest, Miss Boyanov.

1547
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,200
别跟我说话  你不是我朋友  走开
Don't talk to me, you're not my friend. Get away from me.

1548
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,340
走开  走开  我来就好
Okay, move. Move! I got it!

1549
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,930
什么计划  我们要见谁
So. What's the plan? Who are we meeting?

1550
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:56,010
你是我的保镖  不是我的生意合伙人
You're my bodyguard, not my business partner.

1551
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:57,850
你保护好我就可以了
So just focus on guarding my body.

1552
01:16:57,850 --> 01:16:59,940
不知道今晚要见谁能提高我的工作效率
So not knowing who we're meeting tonight is going to make me

1553
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:01,920
好吧  我懂了
extra effective. That's okay, I get it.

1554
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,420
我啥也不用干  你会没事的
I've got shit to do, you'll probably be fine.

1555
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:07,450
不如我给你挑个漂亮的裙子下葬  白痴
Why don't I go get you a nice dress to be buried in. Dumb ass.

1556
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:10,980
如果你真要知道  我要见个潜在买家
I'm meeting a potential bidder if you must know.

1557
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:14,390
如果见面顺利  明天就会交易
If they don't top the current, offered sale will happen tomorrow.

1558
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,920
-在哪里  -还不知道
- Where? - I don't know yet.

1559
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:25,820
-安东  -痛死我了
- Anton. - Ouch!

1560
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:28,380
你个疯子  安东是我安全团队的一员
Anton is part of my security team, psycho.

1561
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:30,860
我不喜欢他的表情  怎么着
Yeah. Well, guess what. I don't like his face.

1562
01:17:30,870 --> 01:17:32,510
我不喜欢你的表情
I don't like the looks on your face!

1563
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:33,950
你他妈的是谁
And who the fuck are you?

1564
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:35,700
我就是那个把你鸡鸡剪下来
I'm the person that's gonna cut your dick off

1565
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,150
粘你额头上
and glue it to your forehead

1566
01:17:37,150 --> 01:17:40,050
把你变成个软鸟独角兽
so you look like a limp dick unicorn. That's who the fuck I am!

1567
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:42,960
你应该叫大屌蛋先生  而不是安东
Your name should be Mr. Bagofdicks, not Anton.

1568
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,090
天啊  别吵了  可以吗
Okay, Jesus! Let's just calm down, okay?

1569
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:47,900
他不像大屌蛋吗
Does he not look like a bag of dicks?

1570
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:50,970
够了  我知道我父亲为什么喜欢你了
Enough! I can see why my father like you now.

1571
01:17:51,630 --> 01:17:54,070
安珀是我的私人保镖
Amber is my hired bodyguard.

1572
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:55,330
向她学习
Be more like her.

1573
01:17:55,650 --> 01:17:58,410
你的头最好别磕坏了我的手机
And your head had better not broke my fucking phone.

1574
01:18:08,410 --> 01:18:09,890
今晚还有大事要做
Got a big night ahead of us.

1575
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:11,880
把自己收拾干净  安珀
Don't be afraid to clean yourself up, Amber.

1576
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:13,410
我的意思是洗个澡
Take a shower, that's what I'm saying.

1577
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:15,240
你也别忘了洗个澡
Yeah? Don't be afraid to hit water yourself.

1578
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:17,310
你闻起来像死在沙滩上的婊子
You smell like a dead hooker that washed up on the beach

1579
01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:18,350
被海水冲洗后晒干了
and then roasted in the sun

1580
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,130
一周后才被发现尸体
for a week before they've even found her body.

1581
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:21,840
你给我注意下言语
Okay, you need to take it, way down.

1582
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,050
-抱歉  太过了  -我告诉过你
- I'm sorry, that's too much. - I've told you.

1583
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:25,090
-是太过分了  -天啊
- Okay. That was too much. Too much. - Oh Jesus.

1584
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:34,760
你看什么看
What are you staring at?

1585
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:37,100
看我毁了你
I will destroy you.

1586
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:41,450
之后给你的残骸拍个写真
And then after I'm done destroying you, I'll take a picture of what's left of your body

1587
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:42,860
彩信发给你妈
and I'm gonna text it to your mother.

1588
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:44,660
带上一句话  说他临死前说
With a little note that says his last words were...

1589
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:47,210
"我妈真坏  你居然这么对我"
"My mother was terrible. You did this to me."

1590
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:48,250
太他妈过分了
That's so fucking mean.

1591
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:51,050
我就他妈这么过分
Yeah, I'm so fucking mean.

1592
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:53,310
-把你的大衣脱给我  -这是男装
- Give me your fucking coat. - This is a man's coat. So.

1593
01:18:53,310 --> 01:18:55,370
但穿的不是男人
Yeah, but I don't see a man, do I?

1594
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:57,330
我只看到一个音乐之声选角失败的可怜虫
I see a reject from "The Sound of Music."

1595
01:18:57,340 --> 01:19:00,330
这是我妈的大衣  她可爷们了  所以...
It was my mother's coat, but she's very masculine, so...

1596
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:02,150
你像阿巴合唱团[瑞典]
You look like ABBA took a shit

1597
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:03,330
拿大衣包着的屎
and put a trench coat on it.

1598
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:05,050
我不会给你的
Well, I won't give it to you.

1599
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:07,930
这破裙子我穿了12小时  把大衣给我
I've been in this dress for 12 fucking hours. Give me your coat.

1600
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:09,490
-不要  -要
- No. - Yeah.

1601
01:19:09,490 --> 01:19:11,970
不行  这是我的大衣
No, I won't give... This is my coat.

1602
01:19:11,970 --> 01:19:13,590
我他妈抓住了你
I'm gonna reach through your fucking body...

1603
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:16,260
把你直接从衣服里拽出来
and rip out your back like a fucking werewolf.

1604
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:17,940
不碰坏大衣
Without tearing the jacket.

1605
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:19,490
因为我还想穿
Just so I can wear your jacket,

1606
01:19:19,490 --> 01:19:21,230
然后给你竖个中指
and give you a final "Fuck you."

1607
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:22,890
你不行呢
Oh, no, you won't.

1608
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:24,870
那我帮你脱
I'm gonna take that fucking coat.

1609
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:28,190
我警告过你的  你个瑞典娘炮
I warned you. You Swedish gummy fish motherfucker.

1610
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:29,760
痛死我了
Ouch!

1611
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:34,410
我的天啊
Oh my god.

1612
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:36,360
我的天啊
Oh my god.

1613
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:39,080
-南希  -天啊  苏珊
- Nancy. - Oh my god. Susan.

1614
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:43,150
在吗  在吗  说话啊
Hello. Hello? Just say something to me, please.

1615
01:19:43,150 --> 01:19:46,200
苏珊  说话啊  我快奔溃了
Susan, anything. I cannot handle this, Susan.

1616
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,660
在现实生活中  没有比这
There is nothing in real life that someone could do to a spy

1617
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:50,680
更无耻更令人心烦的
that is filthier or more upsetting

1618
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:52,310
我的脑袋都要炸开了
than what my brain would cook up right now.

1619
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:54,960
救救我吧  苏珊
So save me from myself, Susan!

1620
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,180
因为你知道接下来会发生什么
Because you know what's gonna happen.

1621
01:19:56,190 --> 01:19:57,670
我会变得越来越话唠
I'm gonna get chattier, aren't I.

1622
01:19:57,670 --> 01:20:00,200
你知道吗  你不可以一下想太多事情
Did you know that you can't have a change having big thoughts

1623
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,240
-否则你的脑袋  -天啊  南希
- or the brain... - Oh my god, Nancy.

1624
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:02,820
要被你逼疯了
You're driving me nuts.

1625
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:05,270
我不讲话是因为我刚跟一群人在电梯里
I couldn't talk because I was in an elevator filled with people.

1626
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:07,220
你没事啊  感谢上帝
Oh, you're alright. Oh thank god.

1627
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:09,900
你失联了12小时  我们不知道发生什么事
You disappeared for 12 hours. We didn't know what had happened.

1628
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:12,420
我得摘下我的耳机和相机
Well, I had to take off my earpiece and my camera.

1629
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:13,610
蕾娜很熟悉特工的手段
Rayna is on to our agents.

1630
01:20:13,610 --> 01:20:15,880
她一英里之外都能识出我的装备
So she was going to spot my equipment from a mile away.

1631
01:20:15,890 --> 01:20:17,330
你跟蕾娜一起吗
You're with Rayna?

1632
01:20:17,330 --> 01:20:20,280
你该跟她保持一英里距离的
You're not suppose to be within a mile away of her.

1633
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:20,740
南希  我知道
Nancy, I know.

1634
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:23,370
不过我深入内部收集了很多情报
But I'm in deep and I'm getting such good intell.

1635
01:20:23,370 --> 01:20:24,380
求你了  我只是
Please, I just need to remain

1636
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:26,610
短时间都不会用无线电
on radio silence just a little bit longer.

1637
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:27,260
好了  别担心
Okay, don't worry.

1638
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:29,380
我将要出外勤  更好的监管你
Because I'll be out to keep a better eye on you now.

1639
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:31,060
什么意思  怎么出外勤
Why are you saying that? How?

1640
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,950
等等  你在这里干什么
Wait. Wh-What are you doing here?

1641
01:20:33,950 --> 01:20:35,740
伊莲想知道你在打什么注意
Elaine wanted to know exactly what you're up to,

1642
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:37,440
所以我定位了你的耳机
so I tracked your earpiece.

1643
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,710
-他们让我来这里找你  -他们派你来
- They sent me here to find you. - They sent you?

1644
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:40,860
我跟你一样不为人知
Well. I was as unknown as you are,

1645
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:42,540
所以他们觉得我的卧底身份很安全
so they thought my cover was safe.

1646
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:44,270
他们有给你新身份吗
Did they give you an identity?

1647
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:47,390
太酷了  我说我想叫安珀·瓦伦丁
It's so cool. I said I wanted to be Amber Valentine. And.

1648
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,670
-什么  -他们让我用这个名字
- What? - And they let me use it.

1649
01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:50,340
为什么你就可以自己选身份
Hey I don't know why you get to pick your identity.

1650
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:51,830
我就要当爱猫狂
I had to go with the freaking cat lady.

1651
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,280
-安珀  -是  -是
- Amber! -Yes. - Yes.

1652
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,760
-这是谁  -对不起
- Who is this? - Oh, I'm sorry.

1653
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,190
我不知道你还要做人口普查
I didn't know the police were here.

1654
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:57,850
这是我同事  长官
This is my colleague. Detective.

1655
01:20:57,850 --> 01:20:59,490
我他妈的之前说过了
The one I fucking told you about.

1656
01:20:59,490 --> 01:21:02,280
-你没有  -我说过了  瞎婆娘
- No, you didn't. - Yes, I did, Helen Keller!

1657
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:03,650
所以你们俩都叫安珀吗
So, you're both named Amber?

1658
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:06,850
我是怎么教你怎么跟我讲话的
Whoa! What did I tell you about talking to me?

1659
01:21:06,850 --> 01:21:08,970
关于交谈  你什么也没说
Nothing. You just said nothing about talking.

1660
01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:09,570
你是想让我
You know what. You want me to

1661
01:21:09,570 --> 01:21:12,130
用卡格尼和蕾西跟你说吗
have Cagney and fucking Lacey explain it to you.?

1662
01:21:09,570 --> 01:21:12,130
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}出自英剧《警花拍档》  主角名

1663
01:21:12,130 --> 01:21:13,860
卡格尼一手卡住你的喉咙
Cagney's coming down your fucking throat.

1664
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:15,300
蕾西给你屁股一拳
Lacey, she's gonna come up your ass.

1665
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,990
两个拳头上下一碰
I'm gonna meet them in the fucking middle

1666
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:18,950
把你的心脏脾肺打烂
and play your heart like a fucking accordion.

1667
01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:21,050
我要把你打成肉酱为止
I'm gonna pump that shit until it pops.

1668
01:21:21,050 --> 01:21:23,280
-你个瑞典婊子  -你才不敢
- You Swedish bitch! - You wouldn't dare!

1669
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,560
你要哭了吗  你个瑞士小娘炮
You gonna cry? You little Swiss fucking pussy.

1670
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,390
-我才不要哭  -你现在就在哭
- I'm not going to cry. - You're crying now!

1671
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:30,950
我没有  我只是热
I'm not. It's so fucking hot.

1672
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:35,090
好了  你就放过安东吧
Okay. You know. Just let's leave Anton alone for now, please.

1673
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,180
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

1674
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:38,490
-苏珊·库珀  -什么
- Susan Cooper. - What?

1675
01:21:38,490 --> 01:21:41,220
-对不起  随口说的  -我刚刚
- Oh, sorry. It came out. - What did I just...

1676
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:42,810
不应该说出她真名的
Not suppose to fucking say her real name.

1677
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:44,880
她是我的精英之一  她很厉害
She's one of my best. She's highly fucking skill.

1678
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,300
-非常厉害  -什么厉害
- Very skill. - At what?

1679
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:48,280
从高层的橱柜里把东西拿出来吗
Getting things out of a higher cupboard?

1680
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:52,700
讲的太好了  因为我高吗
That's-That's very good. Because I'm tall?

1681
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:54,830
说真的  我不怎么擅长拿高处的东西
Really, I'm not very good at reaching high things.

1682
01:21:54,830 --> 01:21:55,770
一位医生曾告诉我
A doctor once said to me

1683
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:57,520
我肌肉的活动性跟初生儿一样
that I had the muscles capacity of an infant.

1684
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,670
-我的手臂就像两根面条  -趴下
- My arms are like two noodles... - Get down!

1685
01:22:09,070 --> 01:22:11,460
苏珊  带蕾娜去安全的地方
Susan, get Rayna to safety. Now!

1686
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,180
-交给我  -快去
- I've got her. - Go!

1687
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:18,550
让开
Go away!

1688
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:28,820
谁给小摩托车加蓬盖啊  你是教皇吗
Who puts a roof on a scooter! What are you, the pope?

1689
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:43,560
闪开
Get out of the way!

1690
01:22:50,710 --> 01:22:52,640
我的天啊
Oh my god!

1691
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:01,920
他们开得太快了  我跟不上
They're driving crazy, I can't keep up with them.

1692
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:05,620
等等
Okay, wait a minute.

1693
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:08,700
我知道了
I got it.

1694
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:11,550
绕点路就好了
Alright. A little detour.

1695
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:21,360
天啊  来吧
Oh, god. Let's do this.

1696
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:30,660
我真是个狠角色
I am so bad ass!

1697
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:37,210
我懂  我知道你们在说什么
Got it. I know what you're saying.

1698
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:40,890
干你的活去  别叽歪
Do your project now! Just get to work!

1699
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:46,490
我们要去哪里  这里一股芝士味
Where are we going? Smells like cheese over here!

1700
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:49,560
不好意思  我出汗...
Apologies. I may be sweating...

1701
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:52,850
一股芝士味  是因为千层面芝士放了好多
cheese because I had quite a hearty lasagna.

1702
01:23:52,850 --> 01:23:55,080
他妈的就一出小丑剧
Fucking ridiculous clown show.

1703
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:56,930
真他妈闹够了
This fuckery stops now.

1704
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,160
打扰一下  请问
Excuse me. Do you know if

1705
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,020
-这里哪里有大力水手快餐店  -什么
- there is a Popeyes Chicken around here? - What?

1706
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:22,360
我在那边看到一家肯德基
I saw a KFC down the way,

1707
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:24,310
不过我更喜欢去大力水手
but I'm more of a Popeyes guy.

1708
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:26,980
那里的食物很特别
The food is really weird I...

1709
01:24:26,990 --> 01:24:28,550
天啊  我还是问别人好了
Oh my God, I'll ask someone else!

1710
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,250
够了
Okay, enough!

1711
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:58,590
放下武器
Drop your weapon!

1712
01:25:00,150 --> 01:25:03,050
天啊  凯伦  你不是在卡普里岛吗
Oh my god. Karen. Why aren't you at Capri?

1713
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:05,620
抱歉  我打伤你了
I'm so sorry I shot you.

1714
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:08,740
你应该没认出我来  我换发型了
You must have not known it was me either. I changed my hair.

1715
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:12,890
新发型不错  那是接发吗
Oh, yeah. Looks really good. Are those extensions?

1716
01:25:12,890 --> 01:25:14,780
不  那是我自己的头发
No. It's just-It's just my hair.

1717
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:17,840
-我还挑染了  -你说是就是吧
- You know, a few clips, colored. - Okay, if you say so.

1718
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:20,760
对不起  这件事我也很抱歉
I'm sorry. And I'm sorry about this too.

1719
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:28,170
我的天啊
Oh, my god.

1720
01:25:31,550 --> 01:25:33,860
不不不
No no no...

1721
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:36,870
苏珊  我的腿快断了
Susan, my thighs are on fire.

1722
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:39,060
这我不管  蕾娜人呢
I don't care. Where is Rayna?

1723
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:41,600
我也不知道  她溜走了  我出了一身汗
I don't know. She slipped off me, I was very sweaty.

1724
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:42,890
不是叫你看好她吗
I thought I asked you to watch her.

1725
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:44,380
我也不知道她为什么跑那么快
I don't know how she ran so fast,

1726
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:46,870
顶着那头发  看着有十几二十斤
particularly with that hair. It must weigh 20 pounds at least.

1727
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,570
没准她是巫婆  她会不会给我下咒了
Maybe she's a witch. Do you think she put a spell on me?

1728
01:25:48,570 --> 01:25:50,580
-凯伦·沃克死了  -什么
- Karen Walker is dead. - What?

1729
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:51,750
她是双重间谍
She's a double agent.

1730
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:53,630
有人当着我的面崩了她  不知道是谁干的
Somebody shot her right in front of me. I don't know who did it.

1731
01:25:53,630 --> 01:25:55,510
真不知道整件事到底藏了多少秘密
I don't know how deep this whole thing goes.

1732
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:56,690
天呐
Oh my God.

1733
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:02,210
你们俩赶快给老娘滚上来
Get your motherfucking asses up here!

1734
01:26:02,210 --> 01:26:03,280
快点
Now!

1735
01:26:04,890 --> 01:26:07,400
-如果她听到了怎么办  -没听到
- But what if she heard? - She didn't hear.

1736
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:09,030
要是真听到了呢
But what if she did hear?

1737
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:11,090
说话声音没那么大
We weren't even talking that loud.

1738
01:26:11,090 --> 01:26:12,780
那种女人有顺风耳的
A woman like that has super ears.

1739
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:14,240
她没有顺风耳
Okay, she does not have super ears...

1740
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,410
我说这个都是你要求的
and I'm only bringing this up because you asked me to...

1741
01:26:16,410 --> 01:26:19,490
而且你让现在的情况进一步恶化了
but you are putting a very negative spin on this situation.

1742
01:26:19,490 --> 01:26:21,440
你要现在说这个吗
Oh, wow. We're going with that now, are we,

1743
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,660
安珀·瓦伦丁
Amber Valentine?

1744
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:25,830
苏珊·库珀  真的假的
Susan Cooper, really? Susan Cooper?

1745
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:43,290
好了  走吧
Okay. Here we go.

1746
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:46,890
没问题的
Okay. We got this.

1747
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:48,930
我的腿不能动了
My legs won't seem to move.

1748
01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:51,320
好了  南希  我知道你害怕
Okay, Nancy, I realize that you are scared,

1749
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:52,790
但你已经参与进来了
but you are in this now...

1750
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:55,620
我非常需要你镇定一点
and I really, really need you to hold it together.

1751
01:26:55,630 --> 01:26:56,870
正在镇定
Holding it together.

1752
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:00,690
我是你见过最镇定的人
I shall now be the most held-together person you have ever met.

1753
01:27:00,690 --> 01:27:03,590
好了  走吧
Okay. Let's go.

1754
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:05,770
做好一切准备  她太奇怪
Be prepared for anything. She's erratic.

1755
01:27:05,770 --> 01:27:08,240
根本不懂她在想什么
It's impossible to tell what she's thinking.

1756
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:10,510
也许是因为她在用保加利亚语思考
Probably because she's thinking in Bulgarian.

1757
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:15,010
你干什么
What are you doing?

1758
01:27:15,010 --> 01:27:17,210
系鞋带
I'm just tying up my shoelaces.

1759
01:27:17,210 --> 01:27:19,310
你那鞋没鞋带  过来
You're wearing a loafer. Get over here.

1760
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:27,890
进来
Get in!

1761
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:28,980
妈的
Shit!

1762
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:29,810
大家都想要杀我
People are trying to kill me,

1763
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:31,520
他妈的我的安保小组就只剩下
and all that's left of my fucking security team

1764
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,690
你们俩保护我了
is you two defending me!

1765
01:27:32,690 --> 01:27:36,140
可你们俩就像是在度假的神经病大妈
You look like somebody's demented aunts on vacation!

1766
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:39,600
你的团队里就没有其他人了吗
Do you have anyone on your team,

1767
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,150
除了这个哮喘傻大个
other than this asthmatic Big Bird?

1768
01:27:42,150 --> 01:27:44,200
通常我们只派她进行
Yeah. We usually just use her for

1769
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,600
无需体力的安保工作
non-physical security resources.

1770
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,910
我真的不擅长干体力活
I'm very non-physical resourceful.

1771
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:52,260
但我会看许多东西  会看手相和地图
I do a lot of reading. I read palms and maps.

1772
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:54,180
还看完了全套《饥饿游戏》
And I read all of "The Hunger Games".

1773
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:55,930
那他妈有个卵用
How is that helpful!

1774
01:27:55,930 --> 01:27:57,240
我也不知道  我现在好怕
I don't know, I'm panicking.

1775
01:27:57,250 --> 01:28:01,330
还有你  别再穿这件傻逼佩妮·摩根外套了
And you! You have to stop with this stupid Penny Morgan outfit.

1776
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:04,220
穿得像个正常人行吗
You have to dress like an actual human!

1777
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:06,060
我一会回来前再给我找几个安保
Get me more security when I come back out here,

1778
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:07,680
不然你们都死定了
or you're both dead!

1779
01:28:15,230 --> 01:28:16,720
去他妈的蕾娜
Suck on this, Rayna.

1780
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:18,750
这项行动可真是让你大出血啊
This mission is going to cost you money, you know.

1781
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:20,920
服装津贴已经减半了  从上个...
The clothing allowance cut off half way through the last...

1782
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:23,970
天呐  你就不能专心点寻找新保镖吗
Oh god. Could you please concentrate on getting the new bodyguard.

1783
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:26,680
-就当我求你了行吗  -好好好
- God damn it! Please. - Alright. Alright.

1784
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:30,710
别念叨了  我已经联系总部了
Crappy. I've already contacted the agency.

1785
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,020
拜托
Oh. Come on!

1786
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:36,870
你  穿着这一身
You, in this outfit.

1787
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:38,950
赞爆了
Magnifico.

1788
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:58,240
-有新发现了吗  -暂时还没  苏珊
- You have anything yet? - No one so far, Susan.

1789
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,650
不过这儿的人都看着有点可怕
Slight intimidating crowd, however.

1790
01:29:00,650 --> 01:29:02,520
你们好  真漂亮呀
Hello. You look nice.

1791
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:06,870
尽情嘲笑吧  你们也会老的
Ah, just keep laughing. Looks fade.

1792
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:08,270
保持警惕
Just keep your eyes open.

1793
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,460
妈的  我不是让你好好打扮下了吗
God damn it. I told you to dress up.

1794
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:16,180
把手套摘了  不然他妈的看着像黑武士
And take off those gloves. You look like Darth fucking Vader.

1795
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:18,550
你那头发里像是死了个毛怪似的
Yeah? Well, you look like an Ewok died on your head.

1796
01:29:18,550 --> 01:29:19,910
那是什么玩意
I don't even know what that means.

1797
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:22,690
等我像汤汤一样把你撕开你就知道了[都出自星战]
You're gonna know what it means when I split you open like a Tauntaun.

1798
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:24,660
随你怎么说  给我盯紧这个女的
Whatever. Keep a eye out for this woman.

1799
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:26,570
她今天也来参与投标
She's the one coming to make the bid.

1800
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:29,700
他还有同伙
He's got a friend.

1801
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:31,860
-真美  -你还知道什么是美
- Very pretty. - I'm glad you know what pretty is.

1802
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:34,370
下次买衣服的时候别忘了
You should remember it next time you're in a clothing store.

1803
01:29:36,110 --> 01:29:37,230
时刻睁大眼睛保持警惕
I need you to keep your eyes open.

1804
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:38,840
一会估计要你帮忙
I may need your help out there.

1805
01:29:38,850 --> 01:29:40,360
眼前有如此妙曼的身躯
To close my eyes in the presence

1806
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:42,450
我哪舍得闭上眼睛呢
of this beautiful body would be a crime.

1807
01:29:42,450 --> 01:29:44,240
又来
Oh God.

1808
01:29:44,690 --> 01:29:47,200
南希  还记得我在巴黎看到的那个女的吗
Nancy. Okay, you know that women I spotted in Paris,

1809
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:48,370
就那个炸弹妞
the bomber?

1810
01:29:48,370 --> 01:29:49,930
她今晚要来参与投标
Well, she's coming tonight to make the bid.

1811
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:50,710
如果她真是德卢卡的手下
If she really works for De Luca

1812
01:29:50,710 --> 01:29:52,970
那他们肯定在盘算什么  你得盯紧...
so we know some things up. I need you to keep an...

1813
01:29:53,870 --> 01:29:56,350
妈的  这个畜生
God. Son of a beast thing.

1814
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,900
抱歉  他是我的人  滚
Excuse me, he's mine. Yeah.

1815
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:05,730
我没想这么用力推她的
I didn't mean to hit her that hard.

1816
01:30:05,730 --> 01:30:07,260
怎么像充气动物那样一碰就倒
God. You look like a balloon animal.

1817
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:09,160
拿住了
Here, take those.

1818
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:11,340
你好啊  你来这干什么  福特
Hi. What are you doing, Ford?

1819
01:30:11,350 --> 01:30:12,600
我是来帮你的  库珀
I'm here to help you, Cooper.

1820
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:15,090
你是找到了蕾娜  但绝不能再让她跑了
You may have found Rayna, but you cannot lose her.

1821
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:16,880
-现在他妈的绝不是儿戏了  -是吗
- This isn't fucking play time, anymore. - Yeah?

1822
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:19,590
可你脸上这白痴胡须还是让我觉得是儿戏
It's play time on your face with your stupid mustache.

1823
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,470
你这衣服哪来的  死乡巴佬
Where'd you get that from, Mr. Potato Head?

1824
01:30:21,470 --> 01:30:23,160
你要暴露我的伪装了
You are gonna blow my fucking cover.

1825
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:26,240
太阳镜算个屁的伪装  就是配饰
Sunglasses are not a cover, they're an accessory.

1826
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:28,120
闪开
Get out of here!

1827
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:29,960
没我在这救你
You're gonna fuck this up without me around

1828
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:31,620
-你肯定要搞砸  -我真是恨你
- to save your girly ass. - God, I hate you so much!

1829
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:34,160
别让你对我的欲望害了你  库珀
You can't let your desire for me put you in danger, Cooper.

1830
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:36,610
做梦吧  马格南
Oh, God, you wish, Magnum.

1831
01:30:36,610 --> 01:30:38,450
你这舞跳的跟个欲求不满的小男生似的
You dance like a horny eighth grader.

1832
01:30:38,450 --> 01:30:40,440
你还硬了吗  滚开
Are you erect? Get off me!

1833
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:41,880
融入不了就滚蛋
Blend in, or get the fuck out!

1834
01:30:41,890 --> 01:30:43,500
你滚蛋
You get out of here!

1835
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:48,240
现在谁说了算
Yeah, who's dominating now?

1836
01:30:49,570 --> 01:30:51,150
操
Fuck!

1837
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:55,200
别这样  你个王八蛋
Don't, you son of a bitch.

1838
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:58,260
开玩笑呢吧  下去
You've gotta be kidding! Get off of me!

1839
01:30:58,260 --> 01:30:58,770
给我下去
You get off of me!

1840
01:30:58,770 --> 01:31:01,530
别压着我
Get your silky shirt off of me!

1841
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,600
融入不了就滚蛋
Blend in, or get the fuck out.

1842
01:31:09,970 --> 01:31:13,800
多谢各位美女  你们喜欢吗
Thank you for the beautiful ladies. You guys okay?

1843
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,250
热烈欢迎
Let's welcome

1844
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:18,230
50美分先生
Mr. 50 Cent!

1845
01:31:18,230 --> 01:31:19,950
晚上好  布达佩斯
What's up Budapest.

1846
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:23,270
刚吃了点炖肉  好吃极了
I just had some goulash. The shit was on point!

1847
01:31:30,590 --> 01:31:33,220
该死  她来了
Oh, shit. She's here.

1848
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,380
绝不能让蕾娜看到她
Okay. We can't let Rayna see her.

1849
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:38,050
你去搞定她的保镖  我来对付她
So, you need to take out her bodyguards, and I'll deal with her.

1850
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:41,450
-别指挥我  -那你还有更好的办法吗
- Hey. Nobody orders me around. - God. Do you have a better idea?

1851
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:43,480
我们在夜店释放毒气
We'll release a gas in the club

1852
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:45,790
让所有人都暂时失忆
causing everybody to get temporary amnesia.

1853
01:31:45,790 --> 01:31:47,500
-再拿一百根炸药  -够了
- Get a 100 sticks of dynamite... - Oh God.

1854
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:49,390
快去  快去
Just go! Just go!

1855
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:53,300
南希  你赶紧进来
Nancy, I need you to get in here now!

1856
01:31:54,170 --> 01:31:55,680
我来了  苏珊  我马上就来
I'm coming, Susan. I'm here, I'm here.

1857
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:56,900
不好意思让一下
Pardon, excuse me.

1858
01:31:57,570 --> 01:31:59,590
好了  我进来了
Okay. I'm here. I'm here.

1859
01:32:01,670 --> 01:32:04,670
50美分本人  多谢告知
50 Cent a piece. Thanks for letting me know.

1860
01:32:04,670 --> 01:32:06,800
别让蕾娜看到那女人
Do not let Rayna see that woman.

1861
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,530
快去吸引她注意力
Create a diversion, now!

1862
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:10,930
-要怎么吸引  -往大里闹
- What kind of diversion? - A big one.

1863
01:32:16,890 --> 01:32:18,680
50美分  我爱你
50, I love you!

1864
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:23,360
50美分  我爱你  快吻我
50, I love you! Kiss me.

1865
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,250
-快把她拽走  -正面上我
- Get her! - Take me now!

1866
01:32:29,190 --> 01:32:30,400
转身
Turn around.

1867
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,250
-走开  -我要亲了
- Get off! - I'm coming in.

1868
01:32:33,890 --> 01:32:35,500
南希  我抓住她了  外面汇合
Nancy, I got her. Meet me outside.

1869
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:39,110
太好了  我没事了  谢谢你
Okay, great. No, I'm fine now. Thank you so much. Okay.

1870
01:32:39,110 --> 01:32:40,710
我夙愿已了  就是这样
Now I got my wish. And that was it.

1871
01:32:40,710 --> 01:32:42,970
我现在要赶去克罗地亚找麦可·布雷了
For a hob, now I got to drop Michael Bublé in Croatia.

1872
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:44,510
他想要我
He wants me.

1873
01:32:44,510 --> 01:32:46,230
好了  库珀  保镖我都搞定了
Okay, Cooper. I got this under control.

1874
01:32:46,230 --> 01:32:47,680
你跟我走
You're coming with me.

1875
01:32:52,930 --> 01:32:54,300
糟了  苏珊
Oh my God. Susan!

1876
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:57,460
再闹个大的  闹个更大的
Okay, bigger diversion! Huge diversion!

1877
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:02,470
贱人
Bitch!

1878
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:08,460
我必须查清她为谁卖命
I got to know who she's working for.

1879
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:10,090
快带蕾娜离开这
Get Rayna out of here.

1880
01:33:18,710 --> 01:33:20,030
这不公平
That's not fair!

1881
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:27,860
妈的
God damn it!

1882
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:32,400
-南希你人呢  -遇到点麻烦
- Nancy, where are you? - A bit indispose.

1883
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:35,820
50美分还真不懂幽默和讽刺
It turns out 50 Cent doesn't have a great sense of humor or irony.

1884
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:39,220
我需要支援  我的枪落在夜店里了
I need backup! I lost my gun in the club!

1885
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:56,110
我们可能超级像的
We're probably more alike than you think!

1886
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:13,310
我干嘛要把手套脱了
Why did I get rid of my gloves?

1887
01:34:36,710 --> 01:34:38,430
我操
Motherbuttler!

1888
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:51,670
你穿这破衣服火气还真大啊
You got a lot of rage in that jumpsuit.

1889
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:12,250
真的假的
You dead serious?

1890
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:14,510
天哪
God!

1891
01:35:15,010 --> 01:35:17,180
等等  等等
Wait! Wait a minute!

1892
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:19,590
这不是你想要的吧
This isn't what you want,

1893
01:35:19,950 --> 01:35:23,530
也不是我想要的  男人最希望这样
or what I want. This is like what the man wants.

1894
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:28,410
我们两个  聪明的黑发美妞互相撕扯
Us, you know? Two smart, pretty brunettes kind of breaking each other down.

1895
01:35:28,410 --> 01:35:29,860
你长得特别像
I mean, you look similar to a gal

1896
01:35:29,870 --> 01:35:32,570
我大学同学  也没啥稀奇
I was in college with. Things happened.

1897
01:35:32,570 --> 01:35:33,870
你也试过吧
I think we all dabble.

1898
01:35:33,870 --> 01:35:36,610
其实就是手在那...
It's mostly just kind of stuff with hands and...

1899
01:35:36,610 --> 01:35:38,730
天哪  快让我宰了你吧
God, I can't wait to kill you.

1900
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:08,040
干净利落地穿过去了
That's clean through.

1901
01:36:08,970 --> 01:36:10,220
谢谢你的武器
Thanks for your weapon.

1902
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:11,390
这进过你身体
It's been inside you,

1903
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:13,520
就不要再进到我身体...
so I don't think it should go inside me...

1904
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:25,620
起来
Get up!

1905
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:33,650
你被苏珊·库珀和美国政府逮捕了
You are under arrest by Susan Cooper and the government of the United States.

1906
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:44,520
蕾娜  你这是怎么做到的
Rayna, how did you do that?

1907
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:45,700
不是我干的
I didn't.

1908
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,320
是他
He did.

1909
01:36:54,170 --> 01:36:55,790
你好  库珀
Hello, Coop.

1910
01:36:59,450 --> 01:37:00,430
范恩
Fine.

1911
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:04,950
库珀
Coop.

1912
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:18,630
醒醒
Wake up!

1913
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,870
睡得好吗
Did you have a nice nap?

1914
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:23,400
你打呼噜还真响啊
You were snoring very loudly.

1915
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:26,680
这还不是最坏的消息吧
Well, this is really not the most upsetting news right now.

1916
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:28,600
我爸以前常带人到这
My father used to bring people here.

1917
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:31,860
他也让你打扮成淫荡的海豚训练师吗
Did he also make you dressed like a slutty dolphin trainer?

1918
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:34,920
他会让他们挨饿  折磨他们
He starved them, tortured them.

1919
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,300
应有尽有
You name it.

1920
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:40,170
但他尤其讨厌别人欺骗他
But he especially didn't like it when people lied to him.

1921
01:37:40,170 --> 01:37:41,970
反正我从没信过你
Not that I bought it.

1922
01:37:41,980 --> 01:37:43,770
-你早就知道了  -那是当然
- You knew? - Of course I knew.

1923
01:37:43,770 --> 01:37:46,560
我早说过你更适合待地下室  库珀
I told you you were better off in the basement, Coop.

1924
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,470
你本来不会像现在这样的
You could have avoided all of this.

1925
01:37:48,470 --> 01:37:49,630
所以呢  范恩
And what, Fine?

1926
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:53,070
你现在是在倒卖核武器  还是恐怖分子
Now you're a nuclear black marketer? A terrorist?

1927
01:37:53,070 --> 01:37:54,020
不是
No.

1928
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:57,090
他只是和我上了床
He's just fucking me.

1929
01:38:05,030 --> 01:38:06,490
你亲嘴的声音可真响
You're a loud kisser.

1930
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:09,040
-你说什么  -你亲嘴的声音可真响
- Excuse me? - You're a loud kisser.

1931
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,350
而且既恶心又让人反胃
And it's gross and unappealing.

1932
01:38:11,350 --> 01:38:12,860
就好像是没牙的老太婆
You look like some old toothless woman

1933
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:14,860
吸着甜甜圈里的果酱
sucking the jelly out of a donut.

1934
01:38:15,620 --> 01:38:18,800
跟你的杀父仇人上床是什么感受
Hey. How's it like sleeping with the man who killed your father?

1935
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,210
没用的  库珀
Nice try, Coop.

1936
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:25,670
-她早知道是克莱斯干的了  -好吧
- She already know it was Cress. - Ah. Okay.

1937
01:38:25,670 --> 01:38:29,150
你应该一直都暗恋着他吧
You probably always been in love with him, haven't you?

1938
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:31,420
在他耳旁喋喋不休
Talking in his ear,

1939
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:34,930
幻想着有一天他也会爱上你
hoping eventually one day he'll fall in love with you.

1940
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,960
可怜可悲的苏珊 科尔曼
Poor little pathetic Susan Coleman.

1941
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:42,090
我的姓还是挺容易记的好吧
Reminisce my last name so truly not much of a burden, is it?

1942
01:38:42,090 --> 01:38:44,340
-科宾  -不对
- Coppin. - No.

1943
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:45,390
科洛朋
Cropon?

1944
01:38:45,390 --> 01:38:48,900
你是想说团购吗  我才不叫团购
Are you... are you thinking Groupon? No, my name is not Groupon.

1945
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,790
-科鲁坡  -不对
- Croop? - Keep going.

1946
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:53,420
-卡帕斯基  -现在完全搭不上边了
- Kapalski. - It's getting further from it.

1947
01:38:53,420 --> 01:38:55,500
管你到底姓什么
Well. Whatever the fuck it is,

1948
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:57,120
反正死定了
let's just call it Dead!

1949
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:59,540
宝贝  不是说好今晚留她一条活命吗
Hey, baby. I thought we were gonna hang on to her till tonight?

1950
01:38:59,540 --> 01:39:01,140
我改主意了
I changed my mind!

1951
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:05,390
永别了
Goodbye.

1952
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,270
才不会在你身上浪费一颗子弹
Like I waste a bullet on you.

1953
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,300
把她关起来
Put her in the room.

1954
01:39:33,730 --> 01:39:34,940
你好  奥多
Hey, Aldo.

1955
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,880
你好  被抓住的妹子
Hello, captured lady.

1956
01:39:38,150 --> 01:39:39,400
我失败了
I failed.

1957
01:39:40,830 --> 01:39:42,300
我任务失败了
I failed the mission.

1958
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:44,510
范恩还活着
Fine's alive and

1959
01:39:44,810 --> 01:39:46,310
还成了叛徒
he's a traitor.

1960
01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:48,750
别丧气
Don't be downhearted.

1961
01:39:49,690 --> 01:39:52,590
我妈曾这么对我说过
My mama, said to me.

1962
01:39:52,590 --> 01:39:53,730
奥多
Aldo,

1963
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:55,220
生活
life is

1964
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:57,080
满是悲伤
full of sorrow

1965
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:59,430
和惊喜
and surprises.

1966
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:02,120
但是
But a

1967
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:04,260
完美的
magnificent

1968
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:06,410
一对大波
pair of bosoms

1969
01:40:07,150 --> 01:40:09,300
会
will...

1970
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:13,400
真是个好故事
Good story.

1971
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:27,790
-苏珊  -离我远点
- Susan. - Get away from me.

1972
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:30,290
听我说  我时间不多
No, listen. I haven't got much time.

1973
01:40:30,290 --> 01:40:31,920
你为什么要这么做  范恩
Why did you do it, Fine?

1974
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,200
这是我潜进来的唯一途径
This was my only way in.

1975
01:40:34,210 --> 01:40:37,280
我必须伪造死亡以赢取蕾娜的信任
I had to fake my death to gain Rayna's trust.

1976
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:41,190
我干扰了信号  取出隐形眼镜  很容易
I jammed the signal. Popped out my lens. It was easy.

1977
01:40:41,470 --> 01:40:44,640
我也不想这样  库珀  可我不得不这么做
I hated to do it to you, Coop. But I had to, I had to.

1978
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:45,940
蕾娜知道我们所有特工的名字
Rayna knew all about our agents,

1979
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:48,660
是因为凯伦·沃克把名单卖给她
'cause Karen Walker sold her the names.

1980
01:40:48,670 --> 01:40:51,000
我不敢信任局里的任何人  怕他们出卖我
I just couldn't trust anyone at the agency not to give me away.

1981
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,320
甚至是你
Not even you.

1982
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,290
我怎么知道你不是在骗我
How would I know you're telling me the true?

1983
01:40:54,290 --> 01:40:56,370
凯伦·沃克想杀了你是吧
Did Karen Walker tried to kill you?

1984
01:40:56,370 --> 01:40:59,290
-是你杀的  -我在卧底
- You shot her? - I'm deep undercover.

1985
01:40:59,550 --> 01:41:02,440
但是也不能不保护你啊
But not so deep that I can't still protect you.

1986
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:04,580
好吧  看着我的眼睛
Alright. Look me in the eye.

1987
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:07,220
-什么  -我说真的  看着我的眼睛
- What? - Really. Look me in the eye.

1988
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:12,040
你居然是大小眼
One of your eyes is bigger than the other.

1989
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:14,660
-真的吗  -假的
- Really? - No.

1990
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:17,150
你太完美了  妈的
You're perfect. God damn it.

1991
01:41:17,390 --> 01:41:18,550
混蛋
Asshole.

1992
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:22,490
好疼
That hurt.

1993
01:41:22,490 --> 01:41:24,360
好  就是要让你疼
Good, it's suppose to.

1994
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,230
大波
Bosom.

1995
01:41:26,230 --> 01:41:29,800
-他威胁到你了吗  -除非你有胸
- Is he dangerous? - Only if you have boobs.

1996
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:32,180
蕾娜真的知道我是间谍吗
So. Does Rayna really know I was a spy?

1997
01:41:32,180 --> 01:41:33,130
不知道
No.

1998
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:35,660
你在厨房自曝身份后她才知道的
Not until you blew your cover back at that kitchen.

1999
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:38,240
我原以为她看人经验更加丰富呢
I really thought she was more experienced than that.

2000
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:42,610
谢天谢地她不是  不然你就死翘翘了
Thank God she's not. Because if she was, you would be dead now.

2001
01:41:42,610 --> 01:41:45,260
-我用了你的完美身份  -我得走了
- I used your pretty good covers... - I got to go.

2002
01:41:45,670 --> 01:41:47,700
我们要去德卢卡家别墅见杜达耶夫
We're heading to De Luca de villa to meet with Dudaev.

2003
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:50,490
然后我们带他去拿炸弹
Then we're taking him to wherever the bomb is.

2004
01:41:50,490 --> 01:41:52,190
这事就快结束了
This thing is almost over.

2005
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:54,580
坚持住
Hang tight.

2006
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,390
你好  被绑住的妹子
Hello, bound lady.

2007
01:42:01,850 --> 01:42:03,190
别毁气氛  奥多
Not now, Aldo.

2008
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:07,200
我觉得范恩先生低估了你
I think Mr. Fine underestimated you.

2009
01:42:07,210 --> 01:42:09,460
你找到了目标  一路紧追不放
You found your target, you tracked them down.

2010
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:11,280
而且也很拼命
You fought very hard.

2011
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:12,280
苏珊
Susan.

2012
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:15,970
你是个好特工
You're a good agent.

2013
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:19,850
下次你肯定会抓住他们的
You'll get them next time, huh?

2014
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,510
除非我们死在了这
Unless we die here.

2015
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:27,860
也许不会
Maybe we'll not.

2016
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:30,530
我才不想就这样死在这
You know what? I'm not going down like this.

2017
01:42:30,530 --> 01:42:32,160
帮我松绑
I need you to untie me.

2018
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:33,430
大波  什么
Bosom. What?

2019
01:42:33,430 --> 01:42:37,570
快他妈闭嘴  给我解开
Stop! God damn it! Just untie me.

2020
01:42:37,570 --> 01:42:38,800
不行  你也听到范恩先生说的了
No. You heard Mr. Fine.

2021
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:39,800
他已经有计划了
He's working a plan.

2022
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:43,270
-我们别去捣乱  -快点帮我松绑
- We have to stay put. - Untie me. Now!

2023
01:42:46,430 --> 01:42:47,670
那是我屁股
That's my ass!

2024
01:42:47,670 --> 01:42:50,850
这样确定准确位置真的很难
It is very difficult to see or gauge my position.

2025
01:42:50,850 --> 01:42:52,680
你根本就是在捏我屁股
You're just simply grabbing my ass.

2026
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:54,990
真是抱歉
Oh. I am, sorry.

2027
01:42:54,990 --> 01:42:56,840
我们侧躺下吧
Let's roll to our side.

2028
01:42:57,190 --> 01:42:58,230
天呐
God!

2029
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:02,780
结打得很紧  我在努力呢
The knot is very tight, but I am making progress.

2030
01:43:02,780 --> 01:43:04,120
你的手离绳结远着呢
You hand is way up in there.

2031
01:43:04,130 --> 01:43:08,560
我的右手被我自己的身体压住了
My right hand is restraint from the weight of my body.

2032
01:43:08,570 --> 01:43:12,210
好了  试试这个
Okay. Let's try this.

2033
01:43:12,570 --> 01:43:17,870
看我一点点挪过去...
Okay. I will inchworm my way...

2034
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:26,230
你声音太大了
You're being very loud.

2035
01:43:34,370 --> 01:43:36,520
我有办法了
Wait. I got an idea.

2036
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:38,610
天哪  又一个吗
Oh my God. Another one?

2037
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:40,490
-天呐  -别乱动
- Oh Jesus. - Don't move.

2038
01:43:40,490 --> 01:43:42,130
-等等  等等  -别动
- Wait, wait. Wait. - Stay still.

2039
01:43:42,130 --> 01:43:44,860
-不不不不不  -要要要要要
- No-no-no... - Yes-yes-yes...

2040
01:43:44,860 --> 01:43:46,260
-天呐  -失礼了
- Good God. - Scusa.

2041
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:47,740
这不是真的
Can't be happening.

2042
01:43:47,740 --> 01:43:52,020
该死  我的侠义豪情全都被你给毁了
God damn it. I was having such an empowering moment before you started.

2043
01:43:52,430 --> 01:43:53,930
我的鸡鸡
My penis

2044
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:55,940
可能会温柔地亲吻
may be gently kissing

2045
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:57,470
你的后脑勺
the back of your head.

2046
01:43:57,470 --> 01:43:59,440
赶快松绑  不然我就顶烂你的蛋蛋
Just untie me before I crush your nuts!

2047
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:03,770
要是我们有时间享受这乐趣就好了
Oh, please! If only we had time for such pleasures.

2048
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:08,820
天哪  你的脸要把绳结顶进我菊花了
God! Your face and the knot are about to enter my colon.

2049
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:12,370
天哪 别舔了
God! Oh, stop licking it!

2050
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:18,430
-搞定  -谢谢你  奥多
- It is done. - Thank you Aldo.

2051
01:44:18,430 --> 01:44:20,350
我一点也不想知道我脖子怎么湿了
I don't want to know why my neck is wet but

2052
01:44:20,350 --> 01:44:22,130
-可你干得不错  -不客气
- you did excellent work. - Prego.

2053
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:24,490
好了  转身  我来帮你松绑
Okay. Turn around. Let me untie you

2054
01:44:24,490 --> 01:44:26,230
我们逃离这个鬼地方
and let's get the fuck out of here.

2055
01:44:30,650 --> 01:44:31,600
够了
Stop!

2056
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:13,050
我要你去通知中情局和国际刑警
I need you to alert CIA and Interpol.

2057
01:45:13,050 --> 01:45:15,070
我去德卢卡那支援范恩
I'm going to De Luca's and backup Fine.

2058
01:45:15,070 --> 01:45:16,850
你知道别墅在哪吗
You know where the villa is?

2059
01:45:18,830 --> 01:45:20,040
我无所不知
I know everything.

2060
01:45:21,030 --> 01:45:25,270
总有一天  超级女间谍  苏珊·库珀
One day, Lady superspy. Susan Cooper.

2061
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,290
我会上了你
I will fuck you.

2062
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:10,660
爱死新车的味道了
Love this new car smell.

2063
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:12,890
太爽了
Really nice.

2064
01:47:05,150 --> 01:47:07,000
欢迎来到巴拉顿湖
Welcome to Lake Balaton.

2065
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:10,800
我发现了这段楼梯  就在这建了栋别墅
I found this staircase and made them built a house around it.

2066
01:47:11,610 --> 01:47:14,500
我们亲爱的杜达耶夫先生马上就到
Our dear Mr. Dudaev will be arriving shortly.

2067
01:47:15,530 --> 01:47:16,760
你
You,

2068
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:19,800
马上就要成为富婆了  蕾娜
are about to become a very rich woman, Rayna.

2069
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:23,790
也就意味着你以后交朋友要更加小心点了
Which means you'll have to be a little more careful about the company you keep.

2070
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:27,730
很多人都心怀不轨
So many people have such terrible agendas.

2071
01:47:27,730 --> 01:47:30,120
比如你身旁的这位朋友
Like perhaps, your friend here.

2072
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:32,970
显然他外表非常英俊
I can see his obvious outer appeal.

2073
01:47:34,010 --> 01:47:35,720
你的双眼很美
You've terrific eyes.

2074
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:37,240
谢谢
Thanks.

2075
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:40,520
可你也是中情局的人吧
But he also works for the CIA, doesn't he?

2076
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:44,130
你还真会选自己的手下
An odd choice of companion for someone in your work, Rayna.

2077
01:47:44,170 --> 01:47:47,260
这样有点打击你周围的人吧
Doesn't exactly inspire confidence in those around you.

2078
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:48,830
去死吧  塞吉奥
Fuck you, Sergio.

2079
01:47:48,830 --> 01:47:50,850
你就不敢跟我爸那么说话
You would never talk to my father like that.

2080
01:47:50,850 --> 01:47:51,870
我也不需要
I never had to.

2081
01:47:51,870 --> 01:47:53,270
德卢卡先生  你说得没错
Mr. De Luca, it's true.

2082
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:55,970
我曾是中情局的人  他们以为我早死了
I worked for the CIA. But they think I'm dead.

2083
01:47:55,970 --> 01:47:57,220
我现在为蕾娜工作
I'm with Rayna now,

2084
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:59,430
我是来帮助你们两个的
and I'm here to help you both.

2085
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:03,230
你和凯伦·沃克都是双重间谍
You and Karen Walker, both double agents.

2086
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:06,050
中情局到底是怎么了
What's going on in the CIA?

2087
01:48:06,050 --> 01:48:08,590
酷炫任务全都派给无人机了吗
Drones taken all the cool assignments?

2088
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:11,760
如果我们现在不干掉他
If we don't get rid of him right now,

2089
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:13,380
我就取消交易
I'm calling off the deal.

2090
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:16,900
你他妈的敢
Don't you fucking dare.

2091
01:48:17,390 --> 01:48:18,730
没错  你最好听她的话  混蛋
Yeah. Why don't you listen to that, asshole.

2092
01:48:18,730 --> 01:48:20,400
你他妈的敢
Don't you fucking dare.

2093
01:48:21,350 --> 01:48:23,890
你不觉得你的人数有点少吗  那个
You're a bit outnumbered here. Miss...

2094
01:48:24,710 --> 01:48:26,180
抱歉  你他妈叫什么啊
I'm sorry, what the fuck is your name?

2095
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:28,460
苏珊·库珀  我是中情局的
Susan Cooper. I'm with the CIA.

2096
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:31,580
上帝啊  蕾娜  你是把整个中情局都请来了
Jesus. Rayna, did you invite the entire agency here

2097
01:48:31,580 --> 01:48:32,250
还是说他们就在隔壁
or are they just

2098
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:35,570
组团旅游来了
having a company retreat at the villa next door.

2099
01:48:35,570 --> 01:48:37,460
天啊  你还挺搞笑
God, you're funny. Huh.

2100
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:39,440
只有我一个人  为了你的利益着想
It's just me. As could be in your best interest

2101
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,540
你最好保证我和范恩的安全
to keep Fine and me alive.

2102
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:44,630
我已经很努力了  但我不太跟得上你的逻辑
I'm trying, but I not quite following your logic.

2103
01:48:44,630 --> 01:48:46,580
你想让我慢慢解释给你听  好吧
You want me to slow it down for you. Okay.

2104
01:48:46,580 --> 01:48:47,960
你马上要见的人是索尔沙·杜达耶夫
You're about to meet with Solsa Dudaev.

2105
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:51,080
我搜集他的情报有好多年了
A man I've been collecting intelligence on for years.

2106
01:48:51,310 --> 01:48:54,540
我猜你的人都忙着在这当摆设
And I'm guessing your boys here are too busy manscaping

2107
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:56,480
而忘了告诉你他的做事风格
to tell you how he does business.

2108
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:58,710
跟他交易的人有一半都死了
It's about half the people he deals with end up dead.

2109
01:48:58,710 --> 01:49:01,790
杜达耶夫要干什么  我现在就能告诉你
I can tell you what Dudaev's gonna do five minutes before he even thinks about it.

2110
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:05,330
而且连我都知道苏联国旗要盖住
And I sure as shit know enough to cover up a Russian flag tattoo...

2111
01:49:05,330 --> 01:49:07,740
因为杜达耶夫的哥哥被苏联军方杀了
since Dudaev's brother was killed by the Russian military.

2112
01:49:07,740 --> 01:49:09,630
天哪  你有电脑吗
Jesus! You own a computer?

2113
01:49:09,630 --> 01:49:11,130
你他妈不会谷歌吗
You heard of fucking Google?

2114
01:49:11,130 --> 01:49:13,790
再告诉你一件事  你那个小女朋友
I'll tell you another thing. Your little girlfriend,

2115
01:49:13,790 --> 01:49:15,590
巴黎爆炸案中那个
one from the Paris bombing.

2116
01:49:15,590 --> 01:49:17,620
她只是在利用你来接近蕾娜
She's just using you to get to Rayna.

2117
01:49:17,620 --> 01:49:19,240
如果昨晚不是我的话
If it hadn't for me last night,

2118
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:20,900
她早就在夜店把她绑架了
she would have kidnapped her at the club.

2119
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:21,610
而你站在这
And you would be standing here

2120
01:49:21,610 --> 01:49:22,870
手里毛线都没有
with your dick in your hand,

2121
01:49:22,870 --> 01:49:24,510
因为你永远也不会找到那个炸弹
because you'd never find that bomb.

2122
01:49:24,510 --> 01:49:26,390
所以你需要我  德卢卡
So. You need me, De Luca.

2123
01:49:26,390 --> 01:49:29,160
而我帮你的条件就是你留范恩一命
And I'm not going to help you unless you keep Fine alive.

2124
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,320
好吧  让我搞搞明白
So. Let me get this straight.

2125
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:37,870
你是中情局的
You work for the CIA.

2126
01:49:37,870 --> 01:49:40,510
但是你却愿意帮我卖原子弹
Yet you're willing to help me sell a nuclear bomb,

2127
01:49:40,510 --> 01:49:42,270
就为了救这个男人一命
in order to save this man's life.

2128
01:49:42,270 --> 01:49:43,690
我为什么要相信这件事
Why would I believe that?

2129
01:49:43,690 --> 01:49:45,490
因为她爱上他了
Because she's in love with him.

2130
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:50,150
是又怎么样  这白痴自己都不知道
Yeah, so what? This idiot doesn't even know it.

2131
01:49:50,150 --> 01:49:52,300
他蠢到不知道我会为他不惜一切
Too dump to know I'll do anything for him.

2132
01:49:54,310 --> 01:49:56,040
让中情局去死吧
Look. Fuck the CIA, right.

2133
01:49:56,230 --> 01:49:57,730
他们为我做过什么
What did they ever done for me?

2134
01:49:57,740 --> 01:49:59,920
浪费了我十年青春  工资少得可怜
Took 10 years of my life, give me shitty pay.

2135
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:02,810
让我在一个屋顶里全是蝙蝠的地下室里工作
Put me in the basement with a ceiling full of bats.

2136
01:50:02,810 --> 01:50:05,000
害我得了红眼病或者至少也是个过敏
Pretty sure give me a pink eye or at least an allergy.

2137
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,600
反正我的眼睛是出问题了
Something got fuck up in my eye.

2138
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:11,170
要不是因为范恩  我早就叛变了
I would have mal a long time ago if it hadn't been for Fine.

2139
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:14,170
所以没错
So, yeah.

2140
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:16,860
我会为了保他一命不惜一切
I'll do anything it takes to keep him alive.

2141
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:19,620
很可悲  对吧
That's pretty pathetic, right?

2142
01:50:21,090 --> 01:50:22,840
相当可悲
Extremely pathetic.

2143
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:24,430
天啊  你真是个混蛋
God, you're an asshole.

2144
01:50:24,430 --> 01:50:27,520
等这事完了  我就剃光你那该死的头
When this is over, I'm gonna shave that fucking head.

2145
01:50:28,020 --> 01:50:29,390
好吧  剃头女士
Alright, Miss Hair Vision.

2146
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,450
我接受你的提议
I'll take you up on your offer.

2147
01:50:31,450 --> 01:50:34,400
但你要是敢耍花招  有任何小动作
But if you try anything, I mean anything.

2148
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,520
我就让你梦想成真
I'll make your dream come true

2149
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,870
送你和你男朋友一块上天堂
and send you and your boyfriend to heaven.

2150
01:50:40,650 --> 01:50:41,570
走吧
Let's go.

2151
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:56,440
杜达耶夫先生
Mr. Dudaev.

2152
01:50:56,550 --> 01:50:58,000
欢迎来到匈牙利
Welcome to Hungary.

2153
01:50:58,070 --> 01:51:01,510
这里就像车臣一样  只是发音更容易
Like Chechnya, only easier to pronounce.

2154
01:51:01,770 --> 01:51:04,120
废话少说
Enough with the bullshit.

2155
01:51:04,630 --> 01:51:06,420
东西在哪
Where is the package?

2156
01:51:06,420 --> 01:51:09,650
我的客户验过款后
Once my client sees the payment.

2157
01:51:09,650 --> 01:51:12,630
自然会带我们去藏东西的地方
She'll take us all to it's very secure hiding spot.

2158
01:51:12,630 --> 01:51:14,170
不管在哪
Wherever that may be.

2159
01:51:23,470 --> 01:51:24,760
我来吧  帅哥
I got it, handsome.

2160
01:51:26,580 --> 01:51:29,280
一亿欧元不如以前值钱了  对吧
100 million euros doesn't buy what it used to, does it?

2161
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:35,170
钻石不错  索尔沙
Nice ice, Solsa.

2162
01:51:36,290 --> 01:51:37,330
好了
Right.

2163
01:51:38,530 --> 01:51:39,910
都是你的了
It's all yours.

2164
01:51:39,910 --> 01:51:42,280
先生们  请随我来
Gentlemen. If you would follow me.

2165
01:51:52,790 --> 01:51:57,980
{\an8}雷纳多

2166
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:12,090
-就在这  -这是什么鬼东西
- Here it is. - What is this bullshit?

2167
01:52:12,090 --> 01:52:13,240
鬼东西
Bullshit?

2168
01:52:13,690 --> 01:52:15,770
索尔沙  我会让你见识的
Solsa, I'll have you know.

2169
01:52:15,770 --> 01:52:17,220
是核弹
It's the nuke.

2170
01:52:18,450 --> 01:52:19,740
真聪明
Clever girl.

2171
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:28,120
铅内衬的暗格
Huh. A lead lined compartment.

2172
01:52:28,350 --> 01:52:29,270
没错  
Correct.

2173
01:52:29,270 --> 01:52:32,460
据说铅内衬可以阻挡任何辐射检测
The lead lining is said to mask any radiation detection.

2174
01:52:32,470 --> 01:52:34,770
我父亲很擅长自己的工作
My father was extremely good at his job.

2175
01:52:34,770 --> 01:52:36,460
太难以置信了
Unbelievable! You know.

2176
01:52:36,460 --> 01:52:37,790
你应该给我点警示嘛  蕾娜
You could have warned me, Rayna.

2177
01:52:37,790 --> 01:52:38,640
我这一周以来
I have been throwing my gym clothes

2178
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:40,370
都一直把我的运动服扔在里面呢
in that uh-uh thing for a week.

2179
01:52:57,160 --> 01:52:59,280
真是漂亮啊
It is beautiful, huh?

2180
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:00,810
是的
Yes, it is.

2181
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,550
你他妈的干吗
What the fuck are you doing?

2182
01:53:07,910 --> 01:53:09,560
做生意
Conducting business.

2183
01:53:17,670 --> 01:53:19,420
把它放到直升机里
Put it in the helicopter.

2184
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:21,670
别忘了我的钻石
Don't forget my diamonds.

2185
01:53:24,630 --> 01:53:26,130
这他妈的是怎么回事
What the fuck is going on?

2186
01:53:26,130 --> 01:53:29,170
德卢卡把你给耍了  蕾娜  而你带他找到了核弹
De Luca played you, Rayna. And you lead him right to it.

2187
01:53:29,170 --> 01:53:31,550
你不会认为我会把核弹交给他吧
You didn't expect me to let him have it, did you?

2188
01:53:31,550 --> 01:53:34,550
这简直就是暴殄天物
I mean. Like giving a strafe of areas to a hillbilly.

2189
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:35,590
我有个买家愿意
I have a buyer who is willing to

2190
01:53:35,590 --> 01:53:38,400
付我五亿欧元买它呢
pay me 500 million euros for it.

2191
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:39,580
而杜达耶夫根本没能力
And Dudaev would've never

2192
01:53:39,580 --> 01:53:42,230
让那炸弹靠近美国半步
be able to get that bomb onto American soil.

2193
01:53:42,610 --> 01:53:43,370
而我的买家能把它
My buyer will have it

2194
01:53:43,370 --> 01:53:46,710
弄到纽约市中心  并且下周就引爆它
in the middle of New York city and use it next week.

2195
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:50,480
要是你们还没在百老汇看过歌剧魅影
So, you know. If you haven't seen "Phantom" yet...

2196
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:51,850
现在怎么着
So what?

2197
01:53:52,470 --> 01:53:54,770
你打算把我也杀了吗  塞吉奥
Does this me you're going to kill me too, Sergio?

2198
01:53:54,940 --> 01:53:56,180
恐怕是的 
I'm afraid so.

2199
01:53:57,270 --> 01:53:59,730
抱歉蕾娜  这样更利索  你明白的
Sorry Rayna. It's just cleaner that way, you understand.

2200
01:53:59,730 --> 01:54:01,820
跟我解释一下  德卢卡
Explain it to me, De Luca!

2201
01:54:08,290 --> 01:54:10,890
天啊  他是好心
Oh God. He-He means well.

2202
01:54:10,890 --> 01:54:13,230
到了这一步  真是越来越精彩了
At this stage, it keeps getting better and better.

2203
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:15,980
谢谢你们的表演  同志们
Thank for the performance folks.

2204
01:54:15,980 --> 01:54:18,130
但是  抱歉蕾娜  演出结束了
But. Sorry, Rayna, the show's over.

2205
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:26,170
上  上
Go! Go!

2206
01:54:44,270 --> 01:54:45,650
我勒个去
Holy shit!

2207
01:54:45,650 --> 01:54:48,040
-德卢卡呢  -苏珊
- Where's De Luca? - Susan!

2208
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:49,700
趴下
Get down!

2209
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:52,420
不
No!

2210
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:01,400
我当时就应该杀了你的
I should have killed you when I had the chance.

2211
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:02,820
-蕾娜  -干吗
- Rayna. - What?

2212
01:55:02,830 --> 01:55:04,170
车底下
Under the car.

2213
01:55:04,990 --> 01:55:06,470
把它推过来
Push it over.

2214
01:55:08,260 --> 01:55:09,170
有没有搞错
Seriously?

2215
01:55:09,170 --> 01:55:12,460
你就不能使点劲推吗
Can't you just fucking burn arms and push it.

2216
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:25,300
发生什么事了  我把他干掉了吗
What happened? Did I get him?

2217
01:55:25,300 --> 01:55:27,810
德卢卡把炸弹弄到直升机上了  起来
De Luca has got the bomb on the helicopter. Get up!

2218
01:55:27,810 --> 01:55:30,540

Ah, fuck me. I got this.

2219
01:55:37,790 --> 01:55:38,830
不
No!

2220
01:55:38,830 --> 01:55:41,640
快点  快点
Hurry up! Hurry up!

2221
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:42,540
快
Come on!

2222
01:55:47,670 --> 01:55:48,920
杀了她
Kill her.

2223
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:52,220
我来  我以前干过
I got this. I've done this before!

2224
01:55:57,100 --> 01:55:58,770
你肯定又得把事搞砸
I bet you're gonna fuck this up!

2225
01:55:58,770 --> 01:56:00,320
闭嘴  过了帮忙
Shut up and help!

2226
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:07,380
你开玩笑呢吧
Are you kidding me?

2227
01:56:11,630 --> 01:56:13,160
福特  你到底在干吗啊
Ford, what the hell are you doing?

2228
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:16,250
我要从你身上爬过去然后干掉德卢卡
I'm gonna crawl up you and take out De Luca.

2229
01:56:16,930 --> 01:56:18,270
别抓我胸
Get your hands off my boobs!

2230
01:56:18,270 --> 01:56:19,540
我是在救你
I'm saving you!

2231
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:21,760
天啊  不是给你摸的
Oh my God. Those do not belong on those!

2232
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:24,930
我抓不住  你的裤子太滑了
I can't get a good grip. Your pants are too slippery.

2233
01:56:24,930 --> 01:56:26,600
你应该穿粗一点的裤子
You should have worn coarser pants.

2234
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:29,250
我他妈不想穿砂纸一样的裤子了
Well, I'm tired of wearing my fucking sandpaper pants.

2235
01:56:29,250 --> 01:56:32,240
屁股夹紧  快他妈夹紧
Clench your ass! Clench your fucking ass!

2236
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:34,270
玩蛋去

2237
01:56:34,270 --> 01:56:37,090
-救我一把  -你个王八蛋
- Help me out! - You motherfucker!

2238
01:56:37,090 --> 01:56:39,240
我要向人力资源告你
I'm gonna report you to HR.

2239
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:43,100
抓紧了  我要像空中飞人一样荡过去
Hang on tight! I'm gonna swing like I'm on a trapeze.

2240
01:56:43,110 --> 01:56:45,900
然后直接跳进驾驶室里
And leap my way up to the cockpit!

2241
01:56:48,290 --> 01:56:52,560
我就说你会把事情搞砸的  库珀
I told you you're gonna fuck this up, Cooper!

2242
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,590
我劈叉了
Oh, I split.

2243
01:56:58,590 --> 01:57:00,180
好高啊
Woo, that's high!

2244
01:57:06,640 --> 01:57:08,370

靠  打烂我的新西装
Fucking new suit.

2246
01:57:11,570 --> 01:57:13,530
这破事该结束了
This shit ends now!

2247
01:57:16,210 --> 01:57:17,360
-不许动  -天啊
- Freeze! - Oh my God!

2248
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:19,550
我他妈的没心情跟你扯
I'm not in the fucking mood for your bullshit!

2249
01:57:19,550 --> 01:57:21,930
是吗  那你肯定喜欢这个
Oh yeah? Then you'll love this!

2250
01:57:23,010 --> 01:57:24,700
我才没心情
I'm not in the mood

2251
01:57:24,710 --> 01:57:27,060
跟你扯呢
for your bullshit!

2252
01:57:27,070 --> 01:57:28,920
退后
Back off.

2253
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:31,040
抱歉  特务  游戏时间结束

Yeah, it is. Say goodbye to your toy.

2255
01:57:33,140 --> 01:57:34,700
你干吗  你干吗  你敢
What are you doing? What are you doing? Do not you dare!

2256
01:57:34,700 --> 01:57:36,410
上帝啊  我的钻石
Oh my God! The stones!

2257
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:41,590
不  天啊
No! Oh my God!

2258
01:57:55,410 --> 01:57:56,580
去死吧
Die.

2259
01:58:02,770 --> 01:58:04,480
我刚打死了个人耶
I just shot a man!

2260
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:07,190
我做错了吗  可是感觉好爽
Is it wrong? It felt so right.

2261
01:58:07,190 --> 01:58:09,020
太符合我性格了
It's so me!

2262
01:58:11,120 --> 01:58:13,530
女英雄
Hey, heroic lady!

2263
01:58:13,540 --> 01:58:17,410
在我的国家  有句话形容你这样的女人
In my country there is a saying about women like you.

2264
01:58:17,410 --> 01:58:19,170
辣翻了
Hot as fuck!

2265
01:58:19,170 --> 01:58:21,780
天啊  别说没用的  奥多
Oh God. Not now, Aldo!

2266
01:58:21,790 --> 01:58:23,000
苏珊加油
Go Susan!

2267
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:26,510
这可不在我的计划中
Oh! That was not a part of my plan!

2268
01:58:28,700 --> 01:58:32,170
始终还是个女人  上战场还戴首饰
Just like a woman. To wear jewelry into battle.

2269
01:58:32,170 --> 01:58:34,950
不过这是我见过最他妈丑的项链了
Although this is the ugliest fucking necklace I've ever seen.

2270
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:37,200
没错  送给你了
Yes, it is. And it's all yours.

2271

搭扣是可调节的呢
With an adjustable toggle!

2272
01:58:52,210 --> 01:58:54,540
好了  没问题的
Okay, here we go. No problem.

2273
01:58:54,540 --> 01:58:55,720
快啊
Come on!

2274
01:58:56,520 --> 01:59:00,070
好了  好了  没事了
Okay, okay. I got it. I got it.

2275
01:59:06,450 --> 01:59:08,480
直升机不错  你从哪弄来的
Nice copter. Where did you get it?

2276
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:10,460
这是50美分的
It's 50 Cent's.

2277
01:59:10,470 --> 01:59:13,190
我还给他授权了  不然开不了
I had to deputize him to let us use it.

2278
01:59:13,190 --> 01:59:15,280
他怕我怕得要死
He is so afraid of me.

2279
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:17,010
我是个屌爆的特务
I'm a motherfucking spy.

2280
01:59:17,010 --> 01:59:18,680
我们再去打别人吧
Let's go shoot somebody else.

2281
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:21,680
闭嘴  50美分  不然我就再吻你了
Oh, zip it up, 50 Cent or I'll mouth you again!

2282
01:59:22,370 --> 01:59:24,440
今天真是越来越精彩啊
This day is just getting better and better.

2283
01:59:24,440 --> 01:59:25,840
他想要我
He wants me!

2284
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:29,270
我想我们该降落了
I think we should land!

2285
01:59:29,270 --> 01:59:31,510
我把核弹扔到水里了
I dropped a nuke in the water.

2286
01:59:45,130 --> 01:59:47,230
干得好  伙计们  抱歉污染了湖
Good job guys. Sorry about the lake.

2287

会让你照相的  50美分不会没有的
You'll get your pictures. There's enough 50 to go around.

2289
01:59:51,370 --> 01:59:52,750
你知道我刚刚协助干掉了一个恐怖分子吗
You know I just help kill a terrorist, right?

2290
01:59:52,750 --> 01:59:54,200
你什么时候见过坎耶干这种事
You ever seen Kanye do some shit like that.

2291
01:59:54,210 --> 01:59:55,860
他可没机会
He never. He never.

2292
01:59:59,810 --> 02:00:01,130
多好呀
Well. Isn't this wonderful?

2293
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:03,890
我就希望在监狱里度过余生呢
I was hoping to spend the rest of my life in jail.

2294
02:00:03,890 --> 02:00:05,690
让我有时间好好消化一下
Give me some quality time to deal with the fact

2295
02:00:05,690 --> 02:00:08,570
我跟我的杀父仇人上了床这件事
that I was sleeping with the man who killed my father.

2296
02:00:08,570 --> 02:00:11,260
总而言之  打电话给我的律师
Anyway, call my lawyer. Get the turf from the hotel.

2297
02:00:11,260 --> 02:00:12,330
把所有东西按时拿给我
I need everything on time...

2298
02:00:12,330 --> 02:00:14,270
你还以为我替你工作呢
Do you think I still work for you?

2299
02:00:14,270 --> 02:00:16,540
随便了  操你
Whatever. Fuck you.

2300
02:00:17,110 --> 02:00:19,000
我知道你是真的喜欢我
I knew you really like me.

2301
02:00:24,180 --> 02:00:25,490
也操你
Fuck you too.

2302
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:32,670
别他妈碰我的头发
Don't touch my fucking hair.

2303
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:35,530
小心点
Watch it.

2304
02:00:40,510 --> 02:00:41,500
天啊  奥多
Oh God, Aldo.

2305
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:45,020
我累死了  没力气再防你的咸猪手了
I'm-I'm too tired to fend you off your groping.

2306
02:00:45,020 --> 02:00:48,330
拜托  我完全理解

2309
02:00:52,490 --> 02:00:55,240
抱歉我入戏有点太深
Look. I'm sorry if my disguise was a bit much.

2310
02:00:55,240 --> 02:00:57,160
我真是喜欢深入角色
I just like to really get into character.

2311
02:00:57,160 --> 02:00:59,410
恐怕我可能在某些时候
Although I fear I may have become

2312
02:00:59,410 --> 02:01:01,600
过于激动了
over excited at certain points.

2313
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:03,900
-有点  -为了表达歉意

我会请你吃饭

你觉得我的英国口音怎么样

我是看《唐顿庄园》学的
I learned it from the Downton Abbey.

2322
02:01:25,410 --> 02:01:26,650
我是开玩笑的
No, I'm only joking.

2323
02:01:27,740 --> 02:01:30,360
-真是玩笑吗  -上帝啊

Oh my God. It was a good one.

2343
02:02:18,140 --> 02:02:20,330
实际上我没开玩笑  我没有幽默感
Yeah, actually I'm not. I don't have a sense of humor.

你刚才是在夸我吗
Wow. Is that a compliment?

2372
02:03:43,590 --> 02:03:44,930
你可从来不夸人啊
That's not easy for you to do.

2373
02:03:44,930 --> 02:03:46,810
去死吧  你干得很不错

It's nice. You're still out of the CIA?

2378
02:03:55,980 --> 02:03:57,660
也许不吧  他们需要我
Probably not. They need me.

2379
02:03:57,830 --> 02:04:00,110
不过我要自己先去度个假
I think I need to spend some time on my own first, though.

2380
02:04:00,110 --> 02:04:01,280
清一清头脑
Clear my head.
