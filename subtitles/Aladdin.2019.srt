Look! Over there!

20
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,990
他们的船真大
Their ship is so big.

21
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,590
我们的船要是也那么棒就好了

这艘船带我们安然度过许多风暴

阿拉丁  公主和神灯的故事了
of Aladdin, the princess, and the lamp.

35
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,630
一盏灯有什么特别的

36
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,620
这可是盏神灯

37
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,120

你把故事唱出来  效果会更好
It's better when you sing.

40
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,770
试想遥远他方
Imagine a land, it's a faraway place

41
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,200
那里驼商游荡

虽说喧扰  到底仍是家乡

日升西方

杯中之沙总有正确之想

47
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:12,030
下来停驻  跳上魔毯起飞
Come on down, stop on by, hop a carpet and fly

当你蜿蜒于街道小巷

51
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,100
穿梭于传说中的市井瓦廊
And the fabled bazaars

52
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,610
货摊上堆满豆蔻多样

53
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,570
可闻香料芬芳  可为锦缎披肩
You can smell e'vry spice, while you haggle the price

54
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,820
好好砍价算账
Of the silks and the satin shawls

55
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,070
当你穿行迷宫  耳畔乐声清亮
The music that plays as you move through a maze

56
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,450
醉于快乐无他想
In the haze of your pure delight

57
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,510
置身舞步蹁跹  恍惚失了方向
You are caught in a dance, you are lost in the trance

58
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,940
在又一个阿拉伯之夜

贪婪或善良
To good or to greed

70

只看你祈愿之力指向何方

让黑暗渐降  找寻未知宝藏

你的命运握于自己之掌

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,490
一晃躲砍刀
One swing ahead of the sword

149
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,150
我偷我所无钱买
I steal only what I can't afford

150
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,610
便是天下大小
And that's ev'rything

151
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,630
一跃警察抓不到
One jump ahead of the lawmen

152
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,670
此言可非说笑
That's all and that's no joke

153
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,400
他们都没领会到  我家徒有四壁高
These guys don't appreciate I'm broke

154
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,420
社会败类  街头鼠辈
Riffraff! Street rat!

155
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,510
-地痞流氓  -尝尝这个
- Scoundrel! - Take that!

156
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,160
换一招试试
Try a dif'rent tack, guys

157
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,830
-把他开膛破肚  -各位从后包抄
- Rip him open! - 'Round the back, guys

158
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,700
面对现实我知道
I can take a hint gotta face the facts

159
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,840
友到用时谁嫌少
Could really use a friend or two!

160
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,970
阿拉丁栽跟头可真糟糕
It's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom

161
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:01,840
姑娘们别这样
Ooh, ladies!

162
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,840
犯罪率因他一人又升高
He's become a one-man rise in crime

163
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,970
好吧
Well...

164
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,500
若非无爹娘  定要怪家教
I'd blame parents 'Cept he hasn't got 'em

165
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,490
要活总要吃饱  要吃只能偷盗
Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat

166
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,350
等我有空再细细说与你知晓
Tell you all about it when I got the time

167
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,040
你可以走楼梯的
There are stairs, you know.

168
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,050
那还有什么意思呢
Where's the fun in that?

169
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,020
一跃超老鳌
One jump ahead of the slowpokes

170
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,060
一跳好运到
One skip ahead of my doom

171
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,100
下次得用假名号
Next time gonna use a nom de plume

172
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,070
一跃小命保
One jump ahead of the hit men

173
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,030
一击人出挑
One hit ahead of the flock

174
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,130
我不如逛逛这街道
I think I'll take a stroll around the block

175
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,670
-站住  小偷  -破坏公物
- Stop, thief! - Vandal!

176
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,690
阿布
Abu!

177
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,770
丢人现眼
Scandal!

178
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,710
各位不必太急躁
Let's not be too hasty

179
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:00,860
他人仍旧很好
Still, I think he's rather tasty

180
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,720
要活总要吃饱  要吃只能偷盗
Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat

181
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,270
-否则你我必能谈笑  -错
- Otherwise we'd get along - Wrong!

182
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,080
别别别
No, no, no!

183
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,280
-数到三一起  -数到三一起
- Together on three! - Together on three?

184
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,880
-跳过去  -跳过去
- We jump. - We jump?

185
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,900
你为什么要重复我说的话
Why are you repeating everything I say?

186
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,320
抓住那根杆子
The pole.

187
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,330
-快点  快点  -这边
- Move, move! - This way!

188
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,500
一  二  三
One, two, three!

189
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,540
小偷  站住  他在屋顶
Thief! Stop! On the roof!

190
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,050
抱歉
I'm sorry!

191
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,730
我做不到
I can't do this.

192
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,780
拦住他
Stop him!

193
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,680
看着我  看着我
Look at me. Look at me.

194
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,470
你能行的
You can do this.

195
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,270
好吧
Okay.

196
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,620
完美着陆
Nicely done.

197
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,910
多谢夸奖
Thank you.

198
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,150
一跃赛马跑
One jump ahead of the hoof beats

199
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,110
一蹦三尺高
One hop ahead of the hump

200
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,150
一计灾挡掉
One trick ahead of disaster

201
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,130
他们虽快  哪如我逃
They're quick but I'm much faster

202
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,010
准备好
Here goes!

203
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,870
最好投降戴镣铐  祝我稳稳把地着
Better throw my hand in, wish me happy landin'

204
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,900
我只需要纵身一跃
All I gotta do is jump!

205
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,900
退后
Move back!

206
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,010
天呐
Oh, dear.

207
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,200
来吧  我知道一个安全的地方
Come on. I know somewhere we'll be safe.

208
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,110
主人来了
Here comes the master.

209
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,460
你带来的全是顽石而非璞玉
You bring me the rough but never a diamond.

210
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,370
把他们带走
Take them away.

211
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,200
-快点  -把他们带走
- Move! - Take them away.

212
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,140
-求你了  -维齐尔大人
- Please! - My vizier...

213
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,590
或许根本不存在未经雕琢的璞玉
perhaps this diamond in the rough does not exist?

214
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,680
他就在某处
He is out there.

215
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,680
但我们已经找了几个月了
But we've searched for months!

216
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,440
我不明白那个洞穴中究竟有什么
I do not understand what could possibly be in that cave...

217
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,990
能助您这样显赫的人更进一步
that could help a man as great as you.

218
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,060
您已经是一人之下  万人之上了
You are already second only to the sultan!

219
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,620
一人之下  糟了
Second! Uh-oh!

220
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,490
现在是谁有麻烦了
Who's in trouble now?

221
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,530
你觉得一人之下就够了吗
And you think second is enough?

222
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,980
当然了
Of course.

223
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,950
您没有当苏丹的命
You were not born to be sultan.

224
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,780
不够机灵
Not smart.

225
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,450
你知道为了得到现在的权势我付出了什么吗
Do you know what I had to do to get the power that I have?

226
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,000
我做出的牺牲  我埋葬的尸体
The sacrifices that I've made, the bodies that I've buried?

227
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,180
我在希拉巴监狱度过的五年
The five years spent in a Shirabad jail?

228
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,780
人们需要明白的是
People need to understand

229
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,750
他们要为低估我而付出代价
that they will pay for underestimating me.

230
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,810
一人之下是不够的  永远都不够
Second is not enough! And it will never be enough!

231
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,280
所以我才需要神灯  而且不再需要你了
That's why I need the lamp, and why I no longer need you!

232
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,200
这边
This way.

233
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,350
这到底是什么地方
Where are we, exactly?

234
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,670
马上揭晓
You'll see.

235
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,590
天呐
Oh, my.

236
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,550
这是你的住处吗
Is this... Is this where you live?

237
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,780
对
Yep.

238
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,160
只有我和阿布  来去自如
Just me and Abu. Come and go as we please.

239
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,940
欢迎来到寒...
Welcome to my humble...

240
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,400
等着瞧吧
You'll see.

241
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,130
你真是个魔术师
You are quite the magician.

242
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,450
谢谢
Thank you.

243
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,700
阿布  别这样  帮帮忙
Abu, no, help!

244
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,770
真不敢相信
I can't believe...

245
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,960
怎么了
What?

246
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,020
真不敢相信我们那样做了  我那样做了
I can't believe we did that. That I did that.

247
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,560
我们居然还活着
That we're alive!

248
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,510
那场追逐
With the chase.

249
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,420
阿布  泡茶
Abu, tea?

250
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,150
在屋舍间跳跃
Jumping buildings.

251
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,640
-太不可思议了  -喝茶吗
- That was incredible. - Tea?

252
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,070
谢谢  也谢谢你带我脱离险境
Thank you. And thank you for getting me out of there.

253
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,700
你叫阿拉丁  对吧
Aladdin, isn't it?

254
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,970
不客气...芳名...
You're welcome...

255
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,220
我叫...我叫达莉亚
I'm... I'm Dalia.

256
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,750
达莉亚
Dalia.

257
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,170
来自王宫
From the palace.

258
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,930
你怎么看出来的
How could you tell?

259
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,330
只有从王宫里来的人
Well, only someone from the palace

260
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,120
才戴得起那样的手镯
could afford a bracelet like that.

261
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,810
那种真丝衬里也是进口的
And that silk lining is imported, too.

262
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,050
是商船运来的
It comes from the merchant boats,

263
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,770
直接送到王宫
straight to the palace.

264
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,940
但不是给侍仆的
But not to servants.

265
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,370
至少不是大多数的侍仆
At least, not most servants,

266
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,880
也就是说  你是公主的侍女
which means you are a handmaid to the princess.

267
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,520
真厉害
Impressive.

268
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,140
这你就觉得厉害
You think that's impressive,

269
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,250
那你应该上那儿看看城市全景
you should see the city from up there.

270
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,950
阿格拉巴  太美了
Agrabah. It's so beautiful.

271
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,760
我应该多出宫转转
I should get out more.

272
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,090
你应该叫公主多出宫转转
You should tell the princess to get out more.

273
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,860
百姓已经很多年不见她了
The people haven't seen her in years.

274
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,650
他们不让她出门
They won't let her.

275
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,540
自从我...
Ever since my...

276
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,330
王后被杀后  苏丹就很害怕公主出事
The queen was killed, the sultan's been afraid.

277
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,080
所以公主一直被锁在深宫
So she's kept locked away.

278
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,210
那之后大家似乎都在担惊受怕
Seems everyone's been afraid since then.

279
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,390
但是阿格拉巴的百姓与此无关
But the people of Agrabah had nothing to do with that.

280
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,900
百姓爱戴她
The people loved her.

281
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,950
确实如此  对吧
They did, didn't they?

282
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,010
这是你的吗
Is this yours?

283
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,710
算是借来的吧
It's kind of borrowed.

284
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,150
这首歌是我母亲教我的
My mother taught me that song.

285
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,790
我母亲也是
Mine too.

286
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,500
这是我对她唯一的记忆了
It's all I remember of her.

287
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,360
那你父亲呢
And what about your father?

288
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,570
我小时候他们就都去世了
I lost them both when I was young.

289
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,630
自那以后我就孑然一身
Been on my own ever since.

290
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,530
没关系的  只是...
It's all right, it's just...

291
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,790
什么
What?

292
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,000
有点悲哀
It's a little sad.

293
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,290
生活中
Having a monkey

294
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,770
仅有的亲权来自一只猴子
as the only parental authority in your life.

295
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,510
还算过得去
We get by.

296
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,660
每天我都觉得会有所改观
Every day I just think things will be different...

297
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,080
但似乎永远没有改变
but it never seems to change.

298
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,190
只是有时候  我觉得自己仿佛...
It's just sometimes, I feel like I'm...

299
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,470
被困住了
Trapped.

300
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,510
仿佛无法逃脱自己生来的命运
Like you can't escape what you were born into?

301
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,870
是的
Yes.

302
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,540
欢迎安德斯王子
Welcome Prince Anders!

303
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,120
我得回王宫去了
I have to get back to the palace.

304
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,760
这就走了
Now?

305
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,590
为安德斯王子让路
Make way for Prince Anders!

306
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,390
为安德斯王子让路
Make way for Prince Anders!

307
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:49,250
又一个来向公主求爱的王子而已
It's just another prince coming to court the princess.

308
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,780
是的  我得去帮她做准备
Yes, and I have to get her ready.

309
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,510
我的手镯在你那里吗
Do you have my bracelet?

310
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,760
没问题
Sure.

311
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,910
为安德斯王子让路
Make way for Prince Anders.

312
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,150
我明明放在这里的
I'm sure I put it in here.

313
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,090
某个地方
Somewhere.

314
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,010
阿布  是不是你拿的
Abu, did you take it?

315
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,540
那是我母亲生前戴的手镯
That was my mother's bracelet.

316
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,960
是的  很美
Yes. It's beautiful.

317
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,230
你的确是个小偷
You are a thief.

318
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,950
-不是  我偷东西  但是...  -我太天真了
- No, no. Yes, but... - I'm so naive.

319
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,410
-阿布  -借过
- Abu. - Excuse me.

320
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,850
等等  等等  不是那样的
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, it's not like that!

321
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,450
让路
Clear the way!

322
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,260
不  小心
No! Watch it!

323
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,210
街头鼠辈  给我让开
Street rat, get out of the way!

324
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,470
你叫谁街头鼠辈呢
Who do you think you're calling a street rat?

325
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,360
你胆敢跟我顶嘴
Are you talking back to me?

326
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,650
你生来就一文不值  死了也毫无价值
You were born worthless and you will die worthless.

327
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,790
只有身上的跳蚤会哀悼你
And only your fleas will mourn you.

328
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,210
走吧  阿布
Come on, Abu.

329
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,370
我们回家
Let's go home.

330
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,520
社会败类  街头鼠辈
Riffraff, street rat

331
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,960
我才不吃那一套
I don't buy that

332
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:13,080
要是他们仔细瞧
If only they'd look closer

333
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,280
是否仍见我潦倒
Would they see a poor boy

334
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,340
不会  先生
No, siree

335
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,530
他们会知道
They'd find out

336
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:33,220
我可与天公试比高
There's so much more to me

337
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,090
阿布
Abu.

338
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,900
偷东西这事  有时候能做
There's a time that we do steal,

339
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,570
有时候不能做
and a time we don't.

340
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:47,430
这次就是绝对不能做的
This was definitely a don't.

341
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,370
安德斯王子  欢迎你
Welcome, Prince Anders!

342
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,010
旅途中你一定很愉快
We trust you had an enjoyable journey.

343
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:28,720
安德斯王子  这是小女  茉莉公主
Prince Anders, my daughter, Princess Jasmine.

344
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,660
怎么没人告诉我你如此美丽
So, why did no one tell me of your beauty?

345
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,060
也没人跟我说过你如此英俊
No one mentioned yours, either.

346
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,240
多谢夸奖  斯坎兰的人都这么说
Thank you. They say that in Skanland.

347
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,720
是吧
Yeah. Right?

348
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,110
非常有趣
It's very, very amusing.

349
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,680
-是吗  -是的
- Is it? - Yeah.

350
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,970
我们的头衔相当
We have the same title,

351
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,360
但对我们的描述却不尽相同
yet are never described the same way.

352
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,100
茉莉
Jasmine.

353
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,900
是的
Yeah.

354
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,090
那是什么
What is that?

355
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,390
先别说
Don't tell me.

356
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,650
是带条纹的猫
It's a cat with stripes!

357
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,770
他喜欢你
He likes you.

358
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,840
我知道
I know.

359
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,970
因为在斯坎兰  猫都特别喜欢我
'Cause in Skanland, cats love me.

360
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,460
过来小猫咪  小猫咪过来
Here, puss, puss. Hey, puss, puss.

361
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,190
小猫咪  小猫咪  小猫咪
Hey, puss, puss, puss...

362
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,440
苏丹陛下  我们的敌人日益强大
My sultan, our enemies grow stronger every day...

363
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,350
然而您却允许女儿拒绝安德斯王子
yet you allow your daughter to dismiss Prince Anders...

364
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,000
这个潜在的军事盟友
and a possible military alliance.

365
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,420
什么敌人
Which enemies?

366
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,910
希拉巴一直在积累力量
Shirabad continues to amass.

367
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,720
-希拉巴是我们的盟友  -曾经是
- Shirabad is our ally. - Was our ally!

368
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,650
你要让我们跟最古老的盟友开战...
You would drag us into a war with our oldest...

369
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,500
而您却允许自己的王国
And you would allow your kingdom

370
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,070
因为感情用事而陷入毁灭深渊
to sink into ruin for mere sentiment!

371
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,470
贾法尔
Jafar!

372
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,730
牢记你的身份
Remember your place.

373
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,620
我向您道歉
I apologize.

374
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,270
请原谅我  苏丹陛下
Forgive me, my sultan.

375
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,700
我逾越了
I went too far.

376
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,560
但是
But...

377
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,650
如果您能再考虑一下
if you would only reconsider...

378
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,940
我想您会明白
I think you will see...

379
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:20,790
入侵希拉巴才是正确的决策
that invading Shirabad is the right thing to do.

380
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:27,720
入侵希拉巴才是...
Invading Shirabad is...

381
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,340
入侵希拉巴
Invade Shirabad?

382
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,030
-什么  -为什么要入侵母亲的王国
- What? - Why would we invade Mother's kingdom?

383
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,700
我们永远不会入侵希拉巴
We would never invade Shirabad.

384
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,470
但是与斯坎兰结盟能稳固我们的地位
But an ally in Skanland would improve our situation.

385
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:48,720
是的  如果你能考虑给安德斯王子一个机会
Yes, if you consider giving Prince Anders a chance.

386
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,890
让他统治吗  阿爸  拉贾都比他强
To rule? Baba, Rajah would make a better ruler.

387
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,570
亲爱的  我已经不复年轻了
My dear, I'm not getting any younger.

388
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,130
必须给你找个丈夫
We must find you a husband,

389
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,950
候选王子真的已经所剩无几了
and we are running out of kingdoms.

390
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,750
哪个异国王子会比我更关心我国百姓
What foreign prince could care for our people as I do?

391
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,210
我可以领导他们  只要...
I could lead if only...

392
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,730
亲爱的  你不能成为苏丹
My dear, you cannot be a sultan...

393
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,460
因为我们王国一千年以来
because it has never been done

394
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,330
都没有开过这个先例
in the 1,000-year history of our kingdom.

395
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:16,300
我这一生都在为此做准备  我读了...
I have been preparing for this my whole life. I have read...

396
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,290
很多书  但是经验不是读出来的
Books? But you cannot read experience.

397
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,630
缺乏经验等于危险
Inexperience is dangerous.

398
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,500
不受约束的民众会发动叛乱
People left unchecked will revolt.

399
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,650
不设防卫的边境和城市会被袭击
Walls and borders unguarded will be attacked.

400
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,640
贾法尔说得对
Jafar is right.

401
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,560
总有一日
One day...

402
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,360
你会明白的
you will understand.

403
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,670
你可以走了
You may leave now.

404
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,080
公主  如果您能接受这些传统
Life will be kinder to you, Princess,

405
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,680
并且明白您只需要供人欣赏
once you accept these traditions...

406
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:12,230
而不是自己发声  您就会活得轻松许多
and understand it's better for you to be seen and not heard.

407
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,860
巨浪涌来  挟我而去
Here comes a wave meant to wash me away

408
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:38,720
潮汐将我  卷没深海
A tide that is taking me under

409
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:43,040
心碎复来  言语难再
Broken again left with nothing to say

410
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,090
我声徒被  奔雷掩埋
My voice drowned out in the thunder

411
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:51,330
但我不能流泪
But I can't cry

412
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:56,310
我也不能崩溃
And I can't start to crumble

413
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,330
纵使汝等想方设法
Whenever they try

414
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:04,060
堵我口舌  灭我志气
to shut me or cut me down

415
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,580
我不能沉默不语
I can't stay silent

416
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,530
纵然汝等想让我闭口不提
Though they wanna keep me quiet

417
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:16,600
威胁若来  我将战栗
And I tremble when they try it

418
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:27,010
我只自知不会就此沉默不语
All I know is I won't go speechless

419
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,940
打开大门
Open the gate!

420
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,740
太厉害了
Splendid!

421
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,790
你知道该怎么做  阿布
You know what to do, Abu.

422
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,620
放开我  放开  肮脏的猴子
Get off me! Get off me, you dirty monkey!

423
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,230
滚开  快滚开
Go away! Go away! Go away!

424
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,680
关上大门
Close the gate!

425
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,600
肮脏的猴子
Dirty monkey!

426
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,300
街头小偷  街头小偷
Street thief. Street thief.

427
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,650
"牢记你的身份  贾法尔"
"Remember your place, Jafar."

428
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,160
牢记你的身份
Remember your place!

429
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,610
如果再让我听到一次
If I hear that one more time...

430
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,240
对不起  主人
Sorry, master!

431
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,460
又一次被鼠目寸光的笨蛋侮辱了
Another petty insult from that small-minded fool.

432
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,230
他眼中只有这座城市
He sees a city

433
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,590
而我却着眼建立帝国
where I see an empire.

434
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,350
真有远见
Such vision.

435
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,700
一旦神灯落入我手中
Once that lamp sits in my hand...

436
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,520
他的王位就是我的了
then I shall sit on his throne.

437
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,290
小偷  宫殿里有小偷
Thief. Thief in the palace.

438
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,860
"宫殿里有小偷"
"Thief in the palace"?

439
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,290
正是如此  小偷
That's what I said. Thief!

440
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,190
你看到什么了  伊阿古
What have you seen, Iago?

441
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,160
未经雕琢的璞玉
Diamond in the rough.

442
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,950
我告诉过你们  快点
I told you, now, come on!

443
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,820
擦的范围再大一点
Bigger circles. Bigger circles.

444
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,250
真是个机灵的小子
Who's a clever boy?

445
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,810
可是一定有我能做到的事情  达莉亚
But, Dalia, there has to be something I can do.

446
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,540
一位英俊的王子想要娶您
A handsome prince wants to marry you.

447
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,540
还有比这更完美的人生吗
When will life get easier?

448
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,780
我不是不想结婚  只是...
It's not that I don't want to marry, it's just...

449
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,630
您想成为苏丹  但是为什么
You want to be sultan. But why?

450
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,500
你还记得我母亲以前常说的话吗
You remember my mother used to say...

451
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,730
我们永远不会比最不幸的百姓更幸福
we would only ever be as happy as our least happy subject?

452
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,670
如果她见到我今天所见的景象
If she saw what I saw today,

453
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,320
她一定会心碎的
she would be heartbroken.

454
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,000
她也一定会希望您平平安安
She would also want you to be safe.

455
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,330
并且干干净净  我去准备沐浴
And clean. I'll draw the bath.

456
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,390
贾法尔的守卫无处不在
Jafar's guards on every corner.

457
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,930
很快  他就会让他们冒着生命危险
Soon, he'd have them invading our neighbors,

458
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:53,200
入侵邻国  为了什么呢
risking lives, for what?

459
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,340
我能帮上忙
I can help.

460
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,220
我知道我能
I know I can.

461
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,900
我注定能成就比嫁给一位草包王子更伟大的事
I was born to do more than marry some useless prince.

462
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,980
如果您必须嫁给一位草包王子
If you had to marry a useless prince,

463
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,380
这一位绝对不是您最糟糕的选择
you could certainly do worse than this one.

464
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,770
他高大英俊
He's tall and handsome.

465
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,460
诚然  他有点迟钝
And yes, he's a little dim,

466
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,480
但你们只是要结婚而已
but you're just getting married.

467
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,680
您又不非得跟他说话
It's not like you have to talk to him.

468
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,300
但是您更喜欢今天集市上的那个男孩
But you'd prefer that boy from the market.

469
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,610
有什么事吗
Can I help you?

470
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:34,830
喝茶吗
Tea?

471
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,260
你  是你
You? You!

472
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,390
你怎么在这里
What are you doing here?

473
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,360
快进来
Get in here, now!

474
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,000
我来把手镯还给你
I came back to return your bracelet.

475
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,620
我的手镯  在哪呢
My bracelet? Where is it?

476
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,090
在你手腕上
On your wrist.

477
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,330
什么
What?

478
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,150
不赖嘛
Not bad.

479
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,450
我喜欢她这个地方的布置
I like what she's done with the place.

480
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,300
你是怎么通过守卫的
How did you get past the guards?

481
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,820
挺有难度  不过山人自有妙计
That was challenging, but I have my ways.

482
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,280
趁公主不在
While the princess is out,

483
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,380
你愿意跟我一起去散步吗
would you like to go for a stroll?

484
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,230
顺便聊一聊
Have a little chat?

485
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,570
你真让人难以置信
You are unbelievable.

486
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,530
你不能闯进王宫
You cannot just break into a palace

487
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,370
然后像主人一样闲庭信步
and walk around like you own the place.

488
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,670
如果你一无所有
If you don't have anything,

489
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,720
你就得表现得像是坐拥天下
you have to act like you own everything.

490
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:16,520
你的回答是什么  我可是帮你找回了手镯
So, what do you say? I did find your bracelet.

491
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,510
不是你找到的  是你偷走的
You did not find it, you stole it!

492
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,990
纠正一下  是猴子偷走的
Correction, the monkey stole it.

493
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,640
他是你的猴子
He's your monkey.

494
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,600
猴子就是猴子
He's still just a monkey.

495
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,450
谁下令送茶了
Who ordered the tea?

496
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,860
是我
I did.

497
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,930
为您准备的  茉莉公主
For you, Princess Jasmine.

498
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,700
公主殿下
Your Majesty!

499
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,110
您为什么表现得这么奇怪
Why are you being weird?

500
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,300
我是公主
I'm the princess.

501
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,980
是的
Yes.

502
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,820
我的人生真美好
And it is good to be me...

503
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,290
拥有宏伟的宫殿
with all my palaces...

504
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:07,780
数不清的金银珠宝
and wagons of gold things...

505
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:13,310
每小时都能换一套服饰
and dresses for every hour of the day.

506
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,050
现在该给我的猫洗澡了
Now it is time for my cat to be cleaned.

507
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,540
她很少出宫
She doesn't get out much.

508
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,990
显而易见
Clearly.

509
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,170
你不是应该在洗澡吗
Aren't you supposed to be in the bath?

510
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,810
侍女丫头
Servant girl,

511
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:37,370
这只猫可不会清洁自己
this cat isn't going to clean itself!

512
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,760
但猫不是都会清洁自己吗
But don't cats clean themselves?

513
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,820
你该走了
You have to go now.

514
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,940
好吧  但是明晚我还会再来
Okay. But I'm coming back tomorrow night.

515
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,840
什么  不行  你不能...
What? No, you can't...

516
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,080
当月亮升起  越过尖塔的时候
Meet me in the courtyard beside the fountain

517
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,280
来庭院中的喷泉旁见我
when the moon is above the minaret.

518
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,190
我来归还这个
To return this.

519
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,060
我保证
I promise.

520
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,030
你敢相信吗  阿布
Can you believe it, Abu?

521
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,100
整个阿格拉巴守卫最森严的地方...
The most heavily guarded place in all of Agrabah...

522
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,640
晚上好
Evening.

523
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,000
晚上好
Evening.

524
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,150
晚上好
Evening.

525
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,130
我身后有守卫
Guards are behind me.

526
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,870
你们好  伙计们
Hello, boys.

527
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,690
我在哪里
Where am I?

528
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,360
深陷麻烦之中  小子
In a world of trouble, boy.

529
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,220
是因为那个手镯吗
That bracelet, is that what this is about?

530
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,480
不是我偷的  那个侍女...
Because I didn't steal it. The handmaid...

531
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,690
哪来的侍女  能戴王后的手镯
What was a handmaid doing wearing the queen's bracelet?

532
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,690
王后  不是的
The queen? No, no.

533
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,500
她说那是她...
She said that it belonged to her...

534
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,810
母亲的
Mother.

535
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:13,150
至少这一点上  她说的是实话
Well, at least she told the truth about one thing.

536
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:16,600
你是说她是公主吗
Are you saying that was the princess?

537
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,410
我是在和公主...
I was talking to the...

538
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,180
她是在玩弄你
She was toying with you.

539
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,560
结识平民是她的乐趣
It amuses her to meet commoners.

540
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,450
你真以为她喜欢你吗
Did you actually think she liked you?

541
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,140
你有名字吗
What do they call you?

542
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,890
阿拉丁
Aladdin.

543
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:38,520
阿拉丁  我们这类人必须得现实一点...
Aladdin. People like us must be realistic if...

544
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,300
我们这类人
Us?

545
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,350
你看  我曾经和你一样
You see, I was once like you.

546
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,810
是个惯偷
A common thief.

547
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,610
只不过我深谋远虑
Only I thought bigger.

548
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,160
窃钩者诛
Steal an apple and you're a thief,

549
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,940
窃国者侯
steal a kingdom and you're a statesman.

550
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,980
只有弱者才裹足不前
Only weak men stop there.

551
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,460
除非成为最有权势的人
You're either the most powerful man in the room,

552
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,630
否则一切都没有意义
or you're nothing.

553
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,550
而你  撞上了一个机会
You, you stumbled upon an opportunity.

554
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,850
我可以给你财宝
I can make you rich.

555
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,260
足以打动公主的财宝
Rich enough to impress a princess.

556
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,350
但是天下没有免费的午餐
But nothing comes for free.

557
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,700
你要我做什么
What would I have to do?

558
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,030
这附近有个洞穴
There's a cave nearby,

559
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,910
里面有一盏普通的油灯
and in it, a simple oil lamp.

560
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,090
为我取回来
Retrieve it for me

561
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:36,920
我就给你足以打动公主的财宝
and I will make you wealthy enough to impress a princess.

562
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,960
你对她无关紧要
You're nothing to her,

563
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:42,920
但是这可以改变
but you could be.

564
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:48,300
你的人生现在才开始  阿拉丁
Your life begins now, Aladdin.

565
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,980
还在等吗
Still waiting?

566
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,310
不是  我是出来...
No. No, I came out to...

567
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,150
他保证过的
He promised.

568
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,410
需要我的话  我就在楼上
I'll be upstairs if you need me.

569
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,370
晚安  达莉亚
Good night, Dalia.

570
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,210
奇迹山洞
The Cave of Wonders.

571
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,320
进去后  你会看到数量超乎想象的财宝
When you enter, you will see more riches than you ever dreamed of...

572
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,220
金子  钻石  还有那盏灯
gold, diamonds, and the lamp.

573
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,600
把它拿给我  我就给你财宝和自由
Bring it to me and I will make you rich and free.

574
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:36,950
但是不要动其它宝物
But take no other treasure,

575
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,150
不论你有多么心动
no matter how sorely you are tempted.

576
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,570
你一定会心动的
And you will be tempted.

577
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,590
只有一人能进入此地
Only one may enter here.

578
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:55,330
一个价值深藏内心的人
One whose worth lies far within.

579
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:59,080
未经雕琢的璞玉
The diamond in the rough.

580
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:00,830
记住
Remember...

581
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,040
除了神灯其余不能动
take nothing but the lamp.

582
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,770
阿布  不能碰
Abu, don't touch.

583
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:47,800
记得吗
Remember?

584
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,650
阿布
Abu.

585
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,190
这是一张魔毯
This is a magic carpet.

586
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,320
这种东西竟然真的存在
These really do exist.

587
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,030
你好  魔毯
Hello, Carpet.

588
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:00,790
让我看看能不能帮你脱困
Let's see what we can do about your situation here.

589
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,080
好了
Okay.

590
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,430
别客气
Don't mention it.

591
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,440
阿布  管好你的小猴爪
Abu, keep your little monkey hands to yourself.

592
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,190
阿布  不要
Abu, no!

593
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:41,760
你动了禁拿宝物
You have touched the forbidden treasure.

594
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,410
你将再也不能
Now you will never again...

595
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:49,020
重见天日
see the light of day!

596
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,310
魔毯
Carpet!

597
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,310
阿布  快跳
Abu, jump!

598
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,020
你能伸手拉我一把吗
Could you give me a hand?

599
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,350
先把神灯给我
First, the lamp.

600
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,770
不  你先伸手
No, first your hand.

601
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,060
我们时间不多
We don't have much time.

602
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,380
把神灯给我
Give me the lamp.

603
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,260
手给我
Your hand!

604
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,600
不再是一人之下了  主人
Second no more, master.

605
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,890
把你的手给我
Now your hand.

606
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,440
把我的脚给你怎么样
How about my foot?

607
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,610
不  不
No! No!

608
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:25,740
滚下去  猴子
Get off me, monkey!

609
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,380
停下
Stop.

610
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:39,550
贱猴子  一人之下
Dirty monkey! Second, second!

611
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,990
我们好像还活着
We're alive. I think.

612
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,200
谢谢你  魔毯
Thank you, Carpet.

613
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,740
阿布
Abu.

614
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,250
你是怎么...
How did you...?

615
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,420
你个狡猾的小猴
You cunning little monkey.

616
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,130
现在我们只需找条路出去
Now, all we need's a way out.

617
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,100
魔毯  你知道怎么出去吗
Carpet, do you know a way out of here?

618
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,180
神灯
The lamp?

619
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,520
这是什么
What is that?

620
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,620
召唤我的伟人啊
Great one who summons me,

621
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,040
命令我的恶人啊
terrible one who commands me...

622
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:02,340
我恪守誓言  效忠于三个愿望
I stand by my oath, loyalty to wishes three.

623
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:10,720
我说了  "召唤我的..."
I said, "Great..."

624
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,850
小子  请问你的老板在哪
Excuse me, boy, where's your boss?

625
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,980
帮我一下  你老板在哪里
Help me out here. Where's your boss?

626
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,330
要是我想自言自语
If I was gonna talk to myself,

627
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:18,770
干脆就待在灯里了
I could've just stayed in the lamp.

628
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,400
你好
Hello?

629
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:22,650
我...
I'm...

630
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,190
拿出你的男子气概说话
Use your big boy voice.

631
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:28,800
我在和一个冒烟的蓝巨人说话吗
I'm talking to a smoking blue giant?

632
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,820
不对
No!

633
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,630
我不是巨人
I am not a giant,

634
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,580
我是精灵  两者大不相同
I am a genie. There is a difference.

635
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:37,970
巨人是谣传
Giants are not real.

636
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,100
-你老板在哪  -我老板
- Where's your boss? - My boss?

637
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,810
听着  小子  这事我做很久了
Look, kid, I've been doing this a long time, all right?

638
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:45,020
总是有一个人...
There's always a guy, you know...

639
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,590
骗了他人或葬了他人
he's cheated somebody or buried somebody...

640
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,730
你懂我的意思  那个人在哪
I mean, you get my point. Where's that guy?

641
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,070
我知道那个人  他在外面
I know that guy. He's outside.

642
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:57,050
所以这里只有你和我吗
So, it's just you and me down here?

643
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,020
还有一只猴子
And a monkey?

644
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,660
那是你的私事
That's your personal business...

645
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,990
不过晚点我们需要谈谈这猴子的事
but we gonna need to talk about that monkey later.

646
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,210
真是一只帅气的小猴
It's a pretty little monkey.

647
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:05,650
所以是你擦拭了神灯
So, you rubbed the lamp?

648
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,710
好吧  你介意...
Okay. Do you mind...

649
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:12,030
你介意我在这边稍微拉伸一下吗
if I could just stretch it out over here, do you mind?

650
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,590
你在问我吗
Are you asking me?

651
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,410
是的  你是我的主人
Yes. You're my master.

652
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,100
我是你的主人吗
I'm your master?

653
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:18,810
下犬式
Downward dog.

654
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:21,730
不不不  你看着更应该当我的主人
No, no, no. You look like you should be my master.

655
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:24,690
是啊  但规矩不是这样的
Right, but that's not quite how it works, though.

656
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,510
你被困在这里面多久了
How long have you been trapped in here?

657
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,270
大约一千年
'Bout thousand years.

658
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,400
一千年
A thousand years?

659
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,820
"一千年"
"A thousand years."

660
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:34,320
小子  只有我觉得你一直大惊小怪吗
Kid, is it me or does, like, everything surprise you?

661
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,770
你真的不知道我是谁吗
So, you really don't know who I am?

662
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:40,810
精灵  愿望  神灯  你都不耳熟吗
Genie, wishes, lamp, none of that ringing a bell?

663
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,770
这倒是头一回
Well, that's a first.

664
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,070
猴子
Monkey!

665
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:55,030
毋需担心他  他没事的
You don't need to worry about him. He's fine.

不过主人你最走运
But, master, you're in luck because up your sleeve

670
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,130
因为你手中的精灵百试百灵
You got a genie that never fails

671
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:14,970
我是最牛的
I'm the best.

672
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:16,810
错不了
Yeah.

673
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:20,560
不够是吧
Not enough, huh?

674
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,190
我开玩笑呢  瞧这个
I'm kidding. Watch this.

675

00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,280
当心
Watch out!

678

你已经把我惹毛了

让你瞧瞧我的真本事

I can sing, rap, dance if you give me a chance

712
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:11,730
别瞪着大眼  傻傻坐着像个笨蛋
Don't sit there buggy-eyed

713
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:14,130
你所有白日祈祷我来一次兑完
I'm here to answer all your midday prayers

714
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:16,650
字据为证  如假包换
You got me bona fide certified

715
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:19,110
你的任何事  精灵来代办
Got a genie for your charge d'affaires

716
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:21,450
我帮你的热情快要爆表
I got a powerful urge to help you out

717
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:23,680
你有什么愿望  我真的想知道
So what you wish? I really wanna know

718
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:26,370
你无疑有个超长的清单列表
You got a list that's three miles long, no doubt

719
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:29,310
你只需像这样擦擦灯就好
All you gotta do is rub like so

720
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,330
这位先生
Mister...

721
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,370
-阿拉丁  -棒
- Aladdin. - Yes!

722
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:33,670
许一个两个三个愿
One wish or two or three

723
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,040
我尽力帮你全实现
Well, I'm on the job

724
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,210
你个大人物
You big nabob

725
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:38,420
你从没有过  从没有过我这样的
You ain't never had a friend never had a friend

726
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,840
你从没有过  从没有过我这样的
You ain't never had a friend never had a friend

727
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,790
你从没有过我这样的
You ain't never had a friend

728
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:51,290
朋友
Like me

729
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,760
你从没有过我这样的朋友
You ain't never had A friend like me

730
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:00,890
你可以鼓掌了
You can clap now.

731
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,570
不不不  别客气  过奖了
No, no, no, no. Please, please. Please, please.

732
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:09,690
你可以等重见天日后再谢我
You can thank me outside. In the sun.

733
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:11,610
等你许愿让我们出去后
When you wish us out.

734
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,900
到底要怎么做来着
So, how does it work?

735
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,690
你在逗我吧
You're kidding, right?

736
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:22,280
整首歌就是操作指南
The whole song was the instructions!

737
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,640
显然你无法听与跳同时进行
Obviously, you can't dance and listen at the same time.

738
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,300
概括如下  第一步  擦拭神灯
So, here's the basics. Step one, rub the lamp.

739
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:30,810
第二步  说出你的愿望  第三步
Step two, say what you want. Step three...

740
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:33,600
没有第三步  瞧  就这么简单
there is no step three. See, it's that easy.

741
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,560
你有三个愿望
You get three wishes...

742
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,060
说之前必须擦拭神灯并说"我许愿"  懂了吗
they must begin with rubbing the lamp and saying, "I wish." Got it?

743
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,610
-应该吧  -还有几条规矩
- I think so. - Couple other rules.

744
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:42,070
你不能许愿要更多愿望  三个足够了
You can't wish for more wishes. Three is enough.

745
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:44,450
还有  我不能让人坠入爱河
Now, I can't make anybody love anybody

746
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:47,200
或者让人死而复生
or bring anybody back from the dead.

747
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,530
有不明白的地方尽管打断我
Feel free to interrupt me anytime you don't understand.

748
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,740
我说笑呢  任何情况下都不要打断我
I'm kidding, don't ever interrupt me, no matter what.

749
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,410
通常我不需要解释这么多
Now, I usually don't have to go through all of this...

750
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,460
因为得到我的人
because by the time the guy gets to me,

751
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,960
基本都想好要什么了
he pretty much knows what he wants...

752
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,440
通常都不外乎是
and it generally has to do with

753
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:02,030
无尽金钱  无上权力
tons of money and power!

754
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,800
帮我个忙  别搞那一套
Do me a favor, do not drink from that cup.

755
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,550
我保证  再多的金钱  再大的权力
I promise you there is not enough money and power on earth

756
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,760
也无法让人满足
for you to be satisfied.

757
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,920
明白了吗  好了  你的第一个愿望是什么
Good? So, what's your first wish?

758
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:15,890
我必须考虑一下
Well, I have to think about it.

759
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,980
毕竟只有三个愿望
I mean, if there are only three...

760
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,520
再说为什么只有三个
Why are there only three anyway?

761
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,720
我不知道  谁在乎啊
I don't know, who cares?

762
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:23,800
你不知道
You don't know?

763
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,110
我以为你无所不知
I thought you were all-knowing.

764
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,720
那是因为你没认真听
That's 'cause you don't listen.

765
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,990
我从未说过我是全知的
I never said I was all-knowing.

766
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,660
我说的是  我是全能的
I said I was all-powerful.

767
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,940
{\an3}{\pos(40,120)}我
苏丹
你

768
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:33,050
我是宇宙中最强大的生灵
The most powerful being in the universe.

769
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,750
就算有我不知道的东西
Look, whatever I don't know,

770
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,040
我也可以去学
I know I can learn it.

771
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,370
重见天日后学
Outside in the sun.

772
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:39,170
许个愿还要故纵欲擒吗
Why are you playing hard to wish?

773
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:41,790
我知道你看不出来  但我现在很苍白
I know you can't tell, but I am very pale.

774
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,550
这是天蓝色  我原本的肤色是海蓝色
This is sky blue. My natural pigmentation is navy.

775
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:47,300
让我们重见天日吧
Give us some sun.

776
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:51,300
好吧  精灵  我许愿你带我们离开洞穴
Okay, Genie. I wish for you to get us out of this cave.

777
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:52,890
太好了
Boom! Booyah!

778
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:55,310
他许下了第一个愿望
He has made his first wish!

779
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:57,270
感谢您选择魔毯  骆驼和篷车服务
Thank you for choosing Carpets, Camels and Caravans.

780
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:59,300
请不要忘记在出去的路上给精灵小费
Please don't forget to tip your genie on the way out.

781
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:01,170
坚持住  小子
Hold yourself, kid!

782
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,100
天呐  看看这个世界
Man, look at this world.

783
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:13,370
太广袤了
It's so big!

784
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:14,740
在神灯里  四面都是
Inside the lamp, everything is, like,

785
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,580
铜壁  铜壁  铜壁
brass, brass, brass!

786
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,920
你心想  "这是铜吗"
You're like, "Oh! Is that some copper?"

787
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,480
不  是黄铜
Nope, brass!

788
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,040
感觉这就是精灵的宿命
Sorta the problem with the genie life...

789
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:27,050
拥有举世无双的非凡魔力  但只有小之又小的生存空间
phenomenal cosmic powers, but itty-bitty living space.

790
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:31,290
是神灯有魔力  还是你本身有魔力
So, is this magic, or are you magic?

791
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,540
两者是捆绑销售的
Kind of a package deal.

792
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:38,140
你能在这样做之前给我个提醒吗
Can you warn me before you do that?

793
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,590
你会习惯的
You'll get used to it.

794
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:41,340
好吧
Right.

795
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:43,970
我必须在这把愿许完吗
So, do I have to make all my wishes here?

796
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:46,480
如果我带你回阿格拉巴  人们会不会...
I mean, if I take you back to Agrabah, won't people...?

797
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:49,530
不会不会  我可以变得非常普通
No, no, no! I can look totally normal.

798
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:50,720
变
Boo!

799
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:52,980
好的  非常普通
Right, totally normal.

800
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:56,020
你还是蓝色的
Still blue.

801
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,120
顶髻真的有必要吗
Do we need the top knot?

802
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,130
这是我的闪光点
That's my little cherry on top!

803
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:03,570
行吧
Okay, okay.

804
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:07,410
那你打算许什么愿呢
So, what are you gonna wish?

805
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,910
我还没想过呢
I haven't thought about that.

806
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,660
看来你真的不是那种人
You really are not that guy.

807
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:14,390
好吧
Okay.

808
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:15,870
那你会许什么愿
So, what would you wish for?

809
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:21,420
从没有人问过我这个问题
No one's ever asked me that before.

810
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,880
不过答案很简单
It's an easy one, though.

811
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:26,340
我会许愿获得自由
I'd wish to be free.

812
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,070
不用再说
To not have to say,

813
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:29,760
"嗖  有什么需要吗"
"Poof! Can I help you?"

814
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,320
"嗖  您想要什么"
"Poof! What would you like?"

815
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,700
"嗖  欢迎来到神灯"
"Poof! Welcome to the lamp.

816
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,020
"请问您要点什么"
"May I take your order, please?"

817
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:35,530
自由
Freedom.

818
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:36,730
我许愿
I wish to be...

819
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:39,310
变成人类
to be human.

820
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:41,270
你为什么不放自己自由
Why don't you just set yourself free?

821
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:46,880
魔毯  你听到这小子说什么了吗
Carpet! Did you hear what this boy said?

822
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,320
我为什么不放自己自由
Why don't I set myself free?

823
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,970
精灵获得自由的办法只有一个
Only way a genie gets to be free...

824
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:54,010
那就是神灯的主人
is if the owner of the lamp

825
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:56,800
用他的一个愿望来放他自由
uses one of his wishes to set him free...

826
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:58,850
上次这种事发生还是在...
and the last time that happened was, like,

827
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:01,380
其实压根就没发生过
the fourth of Never-ary.

828
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,230
我来许愿  我有三个愿望  对吗
I'll do it. I've got three, right?

829
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:08,730
其实你只剩两个了
Actually, you have two left.

830
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:11,490
你用了一个愿望来离开洞穴  记得吗
You used one to get out of the cave. Remember?

831
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:13,640
是我吗  还是你
Did I? Or did you?

832
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,910
我记得你说要擦拭神灯才能许愿
I thought I had to be rubbing the lamp.

833
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:17,370
好啊  小滑头
Okay, little street boy.

834
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:18,560
咱们倒个带
Let's rewind the tape.

835
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,920
好吧  精灵  我许愿...
Okay, Genie. I wish...

836
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,280
猴子拿灯的把戏
Little monkey with the lamp trick!

837
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:28,490
从没见过呢
Never seen that one before.

838
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,240
我会盯住你的
I'll keep my eye on you.

839
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,990
不过现在  我可以用第三个愿望放你自由了
At least now, I can use my third wish to set you free.

840
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:37,120
愿望是这么回事
Here's the thing about wishes...

841
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,250
你拥有的越多  想要的就更多
the more you have, the more you want.

842
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,630
我不是这样的
That's not me.

843
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:45,850
我们走着瞧吧
We'll see about that.

844
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:47,210
不过确实有件事
But there is something.

845
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,380
这表情我见过
Seen that face before.

846
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:51,930
她是谁  哪个姑娘
Who is she? Who's the girl?

847
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:53,850
她是公主
She's a princess.

848
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:55,530
哪个姑娘不是公主呢
Aren't they all?

849
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:58,140
我常说  "奉你的女人为女王"
"Treat your woman like a queen," I always say.

850
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:01,120
不  不  她是真正的公主
No. No, she's an actual princess.

851
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,160
我已经说明过了
Well, I already told you,

852
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,310
我不能让人坠入爱河...
I can't make anyone love anyone, so...

853
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,530
不用  我们擦出火花了
No, no. We had a connection.

854
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:07,730
真的吗
Did they?

855
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:13,460
她聪明善良  还很漂亮
Okay. She is smart, and kind, and so beautiful.

856
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,530
但是她必须嫁给...
But she has to marry a...

857
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:18,660
你能让我变成王子吗
Can you make me a prince?

858
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:23,500
"变成王子"这个说法太含糊了
There's a lot of gray area in "make me a prince."

859
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,000
我可以给你变一个王子
I could just make you a prince.

860
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:27,100
不是的
Oh, no.

861
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,600
没错  从今以后你就要跟那个伙计
Right. You'd be snuggled up with that dude

862
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:29,810
相依为命了
for the rest of your life.

863
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,470
你们看到我的王宫了吗
Y'all seen my palace?

864
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:34,030
要说得详细具体
Be specific with your words.

865
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:36,900
-重点在于细节  -明白了
- The deal is in the detail. - Got it.

866
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:37,910
我不太明白的是
Which I don't really understand

867
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:39,490
如果她已经喜欢上你了
because if she already likes you...

868
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:40,240
为什么还要变呢
why change?

869
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,790
我说了  她必须嫁给一名王子
I told you, she has to marry a prince.

870
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,370
我只想回家  伙计
I just wanna go home, man!

871
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:46,400
好吧  我可以办到
Okay, I can do that.

872
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,290
这次是正式许愿
An official wish this time,

873
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:50,670
如果有人在计数的话
for those of us who are counting...

874
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:52,450
比如说我
which now, I am one.

875
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,370
精灵  我许愿...
Genie, I wish...

876
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:56,480
神灯
Lamp.

877
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:57,830
抱歉
Sorry.

878
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,250
好了  精灵
All right. Genie...

879
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:03,620
别伤着他  精灵
Don't hurt him, Genie!

880
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:09,020
我许愿变成王子
I wish to become a prince.

881
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,840
退后点  小子  我需要空间施展魔力
Back up, boy. I need some room to work.

882
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,130
我要给你变身了
I'm about to fabulize you.

883
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:15,340
精灵
Genie?

884
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,230
有点头晕  不过快适应了吧
Little head-spinney. Better though, right?

885
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,350
感觉好像逐渐习惯了
I think I'm getting used to it.

886
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:28,330
好吧  王子  王子
Okay, a prince, a prince.

887
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:32,250
很明显  贫民风格的造型行不通
Obviously, the ghetto-chic is not gonna work.

888
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,920
我想到了长春花紫
I'm feeling a periwinkle.

889
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,660
什么是长春花紫
What's periwinkle?

890
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:38,740
不  荨麻酒绿
No! Chartreuse.

891
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,200
樱桃红
Cerise!

892
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,850
-线条一塌糊涂  -这是什么
- The lines are all wrong. - What is this?

893
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:45,890
颜色和你的肤色冲突了
The color clashes with your skin tone,

894
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:47,310
轮廓不清晰
the silhouette is confused.

895
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:48,180
这帽子好大
This is a big hat!

896
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:50,520
不  这帽子不大
No, that is not a big hat.

897
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,900
拜托  精灵  好好想想
Come on, Genie! Gotta kick the door down!

898
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,680
大胆一点  用纯金色
We gotta go bold and gold!

899
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,360
不行
No!

900
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,280
-太离谱了  -精灵  你生疏了
- We've gone too far. - Genie, you're slippin'!

901
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,950
不能和沙漠的颜色冲突
It's gotta be neutral for the desert.

902
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:04,490
象牙色  米色  骨色  阿尔比恩风格
Ivory, beige, bone, Albion.

903
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:05,640
这身服装好沉
It's a little heavy.

904
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,230
纯白色
White.

905
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:13,320
人群开始狂欢
And the crowd goes wild!

906
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:17,960
精灵  精灵火力全开
The genie! The genie's on fire!

907
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:19,670
精灵火力全开  大伙们
The genie's on fire, folks!

908
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,970
别伤着他  精灵  别烫伤他
Don't hurt him, Genie! Don't scald him!

909
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:23,700
快来给我降温
Somebody cool me down!

910
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:26,500
快来扑灭我  我太惹火了
Somebody put me out! I'm too much!

911
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,850
我回来了
I'm back!

912
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:30,000
你觉得怎么样
So, what do you think?

913
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,230
我喜欢
I like it.

914
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:32,900
你当然喜欢  小子  这是我变的
Of course you like it, boy! I made it!

915
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,110
我觉得功劳在我
I think that's me.

916
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,360
严格来说  功劳在我
Strictly speaking, it is me.

917
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,650
毕竟大部分活都是我干的
I mean, I did most of the work.

918
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:38,940
你只是在这站着
You was just standing there.

919
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,900
但我理解你
But I hear you.

920
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,200
可我不会被人们认出来吗
But won't people recognize me?

921
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,450
没人会认出你的
Nobody'll recognize you.

922
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:45,160
这就是精灵的魔力
That's how genie magic works.

923
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,140
你说什么  人们就看到什么
People see what they're told to see.

924
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,500
好吧  那我是谁
Right. Who am I?

925
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,480
谁...
Who...?

926
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:54,190
阿里王子
Prince Ali?

927
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,090
来自
From?

928
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:58,300
来自阿巴布瓦
From Ababwa.

929
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,120
阿巴哇
A-bub-wha?

930
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,700
你没有认真听  阿巴布瓦
You're not listenin'. Ababwa.

931
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:04,590
-这地方真的存在吗  -当然
- Is that a real place? - Yeah!

932
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,470
大家都知道
Like, everybody knows about it.

933
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:07,870
有宣传册
It has a brochure.

934
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:09,930
夏天有点热  秋天气候温和
Little hot in the summer, temperate in the fall.

935
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:11,630
但现在不行  上路后再给你看
But no, I'll let you read it en route.

936
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,000
我们该怎么去呢
How are we gonna get there?

937
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:17,220
骑猩猩应该是没戏了
I guess you can't ride a chimp.

938
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,430
会太空舞步的猴子是不是太讨人喜欢了
Don't you just love a moonwalking monkey?

939
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:20,890
阿布  别动
Hold it there, Abu.

940
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:23,430
驴  太小了
Donkey. Too small.

941
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:26,890
不行
No.

942
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,280
太没新意了
Too obvious.

943
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:30,520
我们需要更张扬的
We need somethin' robust!

944
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,820
放轻松  阿布  一会儿就好
Relax, Abu. It's just for a minute.

945
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:40,630
阿巴布瓦的阿里王子
Prince Ali of Ababwa.

946
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:42,720
现在  为你创造随从
And now, for your entourage!

947
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,450
什么
What?

948
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:47,620
怎么回事
What's happening?

949
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:48,830
精灵
Genie?

950
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:07,140
让路
Clear the way!

951
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:08,850
让路
Clear the way!

952
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:11,350
让路
Clear the way!

953
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,810
让路
Clear the way!

954
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:16,860
让路
Clear the way!

955
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:47,150
让让道  阿里王子驾到
Make way for Prince Ali

956
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:51,810
说您好  阿里王子驾到
Say hey, it's Prince Ali

957
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:55,080
古老的集市快清出道
Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar

958
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,340
说你呢  快让开
Hey, you, let us through

959
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:57,710
新星如此闪耀
It's a brand new star

960
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:59,000
先来一睹为妙
Come be the first

961
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,530
走上街头  看他眸明目皓
On your block to meet his eye

962
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,340
让让道  王子驾到
Make way, here he comes

963
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,760
鼓儿一敲  铃铛一摇
Ring bells, bang the drums

964
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,800
你便爱他到无可救药
You're gonna love this guy

965
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,050
阿里王子  绝妙如他
Prince Ali, fabulous he

966
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:12,640
阿里·阿巴布瓦
Ali Ababwa

967
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,930
好孩子要有礼
Show some respect

968
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:15,220
给我们行个屈膝
Boy, genuflect

969
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:17,920
单膝着地
Down on one knee

970
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:20,650
现在尽量克制住自己
Now, try your best to stay calm

971
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:23,150
练练周五的额手礼
Brush up your Friday salaam

972
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:27,820
然后来见见他这帮厉害手下
Then come and meet his spectacular coterie

973
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:30,320
阿里王子  威猛如他
Prince Ali, mighty is he

974
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,660
阿里·阿巴布瓦
Ali Ababwa

975
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:36,650
以一当十不在话下
Strong as ten regular men definitely

976
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:40,170
他独挡疾驰骏马
He's faced the galloping hordes

977
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:42,670
一百坏蛋  纵使持剑哪如他
A hundred bad guys with swords

978
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:44,420
是谁把他们打包扔回给老大
Who sent those goons to their lords

979
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:46,800
没错  就是阿里王子殿下
Why, Prince Ali

980
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,670
小伙子们  他有
Fellas, he's got

981
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:51,050
七十五头金骆驼
75 golden camels

982
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:52,300
姑娘们  他有
Now the ladies, what he got

983
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:56,290
五十三只紫孔雀
Purple peacocks he's got 53

984
00:56:56,430 --> 00:57:00,340
说到奇珍异兽
When it comes to exotic-type mammals

985
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,480
大家帮我说一说
Everybody, help me out!

986
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,230
我说一园动物为他所有
He's got a zoo I'm telling you

987
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:05,730
绝对世界一流
It's a world-class Menagerie!

988
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:07,790
阿里王子  英俊如他

此事与您的侍仆无关
This doesn't concern your servant.

1105

我就在那边  干我自己的事

1110
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:14,100
你好像还没有自我介绍过
I, uh, don't believe we've been properly introduced.

1111
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:17,380
我是贾法尔  苏丹的维齐尔

别让公主久等了
I don't wanna keep the princess waiting.

1115
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:28,680
也许是我没说清楚
Perhaps I'm not making myself clear.

1116
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,940
过了这个村可就没这个店了  明白吗

This one's gonna be easy.

1126
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,640
瞧瞧她的侍女
And look at her handmaid.

1127
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,170
她要去拿酒了
And she's going to get some punch.

1128
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:13,630
我也有点渴呢
Feelin' a little thirsty myself.

1129
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:15,460
不不不  你不能走
No! No, no! You can't leave me.

1130
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:16,510
他们会看穿我的
They'll see right through me.

1131
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:19,340
不  他们不会的  你只需要走过去就好
No, they won't. All you have to do is walk over there.

1132
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:21,930
然后说话  我还得开口说话
And speak. I also have to speak.

1133
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:23,240
好吧  听着
Okay, listen to me.

1134
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,330
我住在一盏油灯里
I live in a lamp.

1135
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,100
而这是一场派对
This is a party.

1136
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,600
别给我搞砸了  好吗
Do not mess this up for me. Okay?

1137
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,500
我喜欢派对
I like to party.

1138
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:32,670
去拿下她
Go get her!

1139
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,380
好吧
Okay.

1140
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:45,470
茉莉公主
Princess Jasmine!

1141
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:47,870
是你  你还没走啊
You? You're still here?

1142
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:48,930
是的
Yes.

1143
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,190
你在做什么
What are you doing?

1144
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:56,840
你在做什么
What are you doing?

1145
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:00,510
我只是检查一下水温是否合适
I'm just making sure the water is a good temperature.

1146
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:01,590
你怎么没在那边
Why are you not over there?

1147
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:03,840
我要怎么跟他比
How am I supposed to compete with that?

1148
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:06,310
看看他  那么有王子风范
Look at him. He's so princely.

1149
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:09,770
你得对你的资本表现得更自信些
You have got to be more confident about what you have to offer.

1150
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:11,600
我有什么资本
What do I have to offer?

1151
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,060
偷食物的本领吗
Knowledge of how to steal food?

1152
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:15,290
在屋舍间跳跃的技巧吗
How to jump between buildings?

1153
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,150
但是阿里王子  他有珠宝
Now, Prince Ali, he has jewels.

1154
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:18,840
不  打住  打住
No, stop, stop, stop!

1155
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,970
我把你的外表变成了王子
I made you look like a prince on the outside.

1156
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:27,390
但是我没有改变你的内在
But I didn't change anything on the inside.

1157
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:29,810
阿里王子领到门
Prince Ali got you to the door...

1158
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:31,940
开门还需阿拉丁
but Aladdin has to open it.

1159
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,170
看见没  苏丹喜欢我
See, the sultan does like me!

1160
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:38,860
好吧  或许他会娶你当老婆
Okay, well, maybe he'll let you be his wife.

1161
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:43,780
看啊  又一位对阿爸更感兴趣的王子
Look at that, another prince more interested in Baba.

1162
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:46,990
说不好  我觉得这个可能与众不同
I don't know, I think this one might be different.

1163
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:50,100
而且他还带了一位魅力非凡的朋友
And he comes with an incredibly attractive friend.

1164
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:51,580
但愿能成
Please make it work.

1165
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,750
那阿里王子呢
And what about Prince Ali?

1166
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:57,340
您看他  他已经很努力了
Look at him. He's trying so hard.

1167
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,030
问题就在这
And that's the problem.

1168
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:01,510
-是时候大放异彩了  -不
- Showtime. - No.

1169
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:02,440
我在等待合适的时机
I'm waiting for the right moment.

1170
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:04,780
不  别等了  不能再等了
No. No waiting. We're done waiting.

1171
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:06,780
不  我说了算  好吗
No, I'm in charge. Okay?

1172
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,850
时机到了我会告诉你的
I say when it's the right moment.

1173
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,690
你不是吧
Really? Really?

1174
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,780
他来了  说点什么  表现得自然点
He's here. Say something, act natural.

1175
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:22,440
您好
Hi!

1176
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:27,930
果酱的事很抱歉  还有那些珠宝...
I'm sorry for the jams, and the jewels...

1177
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:30,410
还有说要买你的事
and the buying you.

1178
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:33,540
那不是我的本意  是我说的  我没...
That wasn't me. It was me, I don't...

1179
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:37,210
是我  我没有双胞胎兄弟  但我...
It was me, I don't have a twin or anything, but I...

1180
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:40,130
跳舞吗  我很乐意
Dance? I'd love to.

1181
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,300
好的
Yes.

1182
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:45,760
跳舞
Dance?

1183
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:47,760
舞力全开
Just dance.

1184
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:49,760
快去
Go. Go.

1185
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:04,420
我怎么办
What am I suppose to do?

1186
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,650
放轻松
Relax.

1187
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:03,560
漂亮  跳得好
Bravo! Well done!

1188
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:13,620
他有古怪
Something very strange about him.

1189
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:17,950
密切盯住阿里王子
Keep a close eye on Prince Ali.

1190
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:22,600
她就那么走了
She just walked out.

1191
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,190
或许后空翻我做得有点过火
Maybe I went a tad far with the back flip...

1192
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:29,920
但是那支舞可能是你人生中最辉煌的时刻了
but that dance may be the best thing you ever do in your life!

1193
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:31,240
我确实很出彩
I was pretty good.

1194
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,240
但似乎没有打动她
But nothing seems to impress her.

1195
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,080
对  太不可思议了
Yeah, it's crazy.

1196
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,560
宝石  果酱或珠宝都打动不了她
Not gems or jams or jewels.

1197
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:40,850
如果连我都不能让她心动  恐怕没人能行了
If I can't impress her, I wonder who can.

1198
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:43,210
你这话什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

1199
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:46,920
我只是说你要做自己
I'm just sayin' try being yourself.

1200
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,940
但是她必须嫁给一位王子
But she has to marry a prince.

1201
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:52,320
如果我能再和她多相处一会  我知道我可以...
If I just had a few more minutes with her, I know I could...

1202
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:54,970
你得把我送过去
You need to get me over there.

1203
01:09:54,970 --> 01:09:56,220
这是正式许愿吗
Is that an official wish?

1204
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:58,720
不是  这是友情帮忙
No. It's a favor. For a friend.

1205
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:01,680
精灵是没有朋友的
Yeah, see, genies don't really have friends.

1206
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,100
你不是说你从没有过我这样的朋友吗
I thought you said you never had a friend like me.

1207
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:07,960
不  我说的是你从没有过我这样的朋友
No, I said you never had a friend like me!

1208
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:09,520
身为精灵
When you're a genie,

1209
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:11,610
总是有人对我予取予求
somebody always wants something from ya.

1210
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:12,530
很尴尬
It's awkward.

1211
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:14,280
你说得对
You're right, you're right.

1212
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:18,350
再说了  还得引开某个侍女...
Besides, it would've involved distracting a certain handmaiden...

1213
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,620
我明白你的把戏了
I see what you're doing!

1214
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:22,350
我成功上钩了  那边见
You hooked me. See you there?

1215
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:31,650
晚上好
Good evening.

1216
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,900
你是怎么通过守卫的
How did you get past the guards?

1217
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:36,590
我溜进来的
I snuck past.

1218
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:37,840
48个守卫都没看见你
All 48 of them?

1219
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:40,470
连那个吞火的守卫也没看见你  真有一手
Even the ones that eat fire? Impressive.

1220
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:43,660
是的  大家都这么说我
Yes, well, that's what people say about me!

1221
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:47,980
这话听着不对劲
Well, that didn't come out the right way.

1222
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:50,250
没人这么说  我不知道为什么要这么说
No one says that. I don't know why I said that.

1223
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:55,200
太美了  她不会喜欢的
They're beautiful! She will hate them.

1224
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,870
告诉阿里王子要赢得公主的芳心得先读懂她的心思
Tell Prince Ali the way to her heart is through her mind.

1225
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:02,390
实际上  这些花是我送给你的
Actually, these are from me to you.

1226
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:06,770
稍等片刻好吗
Could you excuse me one moment?

1227
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,400
等等  不...
Wait, no, just...

1228
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:16,910
"大家都这么说我"  不是吧  精灵
"That's what people say about me." Come on, Genie!

1229
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:20,760
这是我最喜欢的花  我收下了  请讲
My favorites. I accept. Please continue.

1230
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:25,600
我发现今晚是如此喜人
I was noticing how pleasant the evening is.

1231
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:29,040
在派对上  我发现你发现了...
At the party, I noticed you noticing...

1232
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:32,920
我有多么喜人
how pleasant I am.

1233
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,190
好吧  我的表现如何
Right. How's this going?

1234
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:38,430
有点笨拙  不过是可爱地笨拙
It's clumsy, but in a charming sort of a way.

1235
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:39,760
散步
A stroll.

1236
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:44,890
你愿意与我一同在夜色中散步吗
Would you like to take an evening stroll?

1237
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:48,500
就我们两个  专门散步
Just the two of us? On purpose?

1238
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,270
是的  两个凡人
Yes, as people.

1239
01:11:51,670 --> 01:11:53,210
再等一下
Just one more second.

1240
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:54,070
好吧
Okay.

1241
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,650
我为什么要说"两个凡人"
Why would I say "as people"?

1242
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:58,950
那小子有毒
That kid is contagious!

1243
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:02,490
去吧
Go.

1244
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:07,710
我以前从没试过  该怎么做
I've never done this before. How does it work?

1245
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:10,290
你喜欢绵羊奶酪吗
Do you like sheep cheese?

1246
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:16,050
进来
Come in.

1247
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:18,380
其实我已经进来了
Actually, I'm already in.

1248
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:20,890
别动
Don't move.

1249
01:12:23,830 --> 01:12:26,330
我回来是因为你离开时很...
I just came back because you left so...

1250
01:12:26,330 --> 01:12:28,690
你是怎么到那去的
How did you get there?

1251
01:12:30,290 --> 01:12:31,770
坐魔毯飞来的
Magic carpet?

1252
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,900
其实我很高兴你来了
Actually, I'm glad you are here.

1253
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:37,030
真的吗
You are?

1254
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:39,090
我一直在地图上找阿巴布瓦
I've been trying to find Ababwa,

1255
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:41,990
但是好像哪张地图上都找不着
but it doesn't seem to be on any of my maps.

1256
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:44,160
你愿意指给我看吗
Care to show me?

1257
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:45,990
乐意之至
I'd love to.

1258
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,390
拉贾  暂时先别吃这位王子
Rajah, let's not eat the prince today.

1259
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:51,670
他还要留着腿跳舞呢
He needs his legs for dancing.

1260
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:55,110
我的后空翻是不是太过火了
Did I go too far with the back flip?

1261
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:56,000
有点
A little.

1262
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,550
-阿巴布瓦  -好的
- Ababwa? - Yes.

1263
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:01,910
精灵  我需要找到阿巴布瓦
Genie, I need to find Ababwa.

1264
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:03,410
我另一个哥哥  矮个子那个
My other brother...the short one,

1265
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:06,530
不是送了我一头山羊的那个  他娶了...
not the one who gifted me a goat, he's married...

1266
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:08,480
她有地图  好多地图
She has maps, lots of maps.

1267
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,770
阿巴布瓦  没问题
Ababwa, of course.

1268
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:18,130
阿巴布瓦
Ababwa.

1269
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:20,950
牦牛餐巾可不常见
Yak napkins are not easy to find...

1270
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:30,130
{\an8}冒险王国  神奇王国  明日王国

1271
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:33,630
{\an8}做自己

1272
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:36,670
你找不到自己的国家吗
Have you lost your country?

1273
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:39,630
我的国家  不  不
My country? No, no.

1274
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:45,220
在这呢
There it is.

1275
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:48,470
别忽悠了  我已经...
I don't think so. I've been...

1276
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:51,990
{\an8}阿巴布瓦

1277
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:52,770
在这呢
There it is.

1278
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:56,040
我之前怎么没看见
How did I not see that?

1279
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,630
这年头谁还需要地图
Who needs maps anyway?

1280
01:13:57,630 --> 01:14:01,710
又旧又没用  也没有实际价值
They're old and useless, and add no practical value.

1281
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,410
我就是通过地图看世界的
Maps are how I see the world.

1282
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:06,950
我以为公主能去任何地方
I thought a princess could go anywhere.

1283
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:09,490
我这个公主不行
Not this princess.

1284
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:13,960
那...
Well,

1285
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:16,920
你想...
would you wanna...?

1286
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:21,090
抱歉  抱歉
Sorry, sorry.

1287
01:14:22,610 --> 01:14:23,510
拉贾
Rajah!

1288
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:34,310
谢谢你舔我
Thanks for that.

1289
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:41,130
我是说你应该亲眼去看那些地方
I was saying you should see these places.

1290
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:45,820
书本和地图外的世界生动无比
I mean, there's a whole world outside of books and maps.

1291
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:49,200
你想去吗
Do you want to?

1292
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:52,160
怎么去  所有的门都有人把守
How? Every door is guarded.

1293
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,330
谁说要走大门了
Who said anything about a door?

1294
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:55,750
你要做什么
What are you doing?

1295
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,040
有时候  公主
Sometimes, Princess...

1296
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:02,380
有时候  你必须冒险
sometimes, you just have to take a risk.

1297
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:08,390
刚才发生什么了
What just happened?

1298
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:16,020
什么
What?

1299
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:19,310
这是...
Is this...?

1300
01:15:19,630 --> 01:15:20,980
魔毯
A magic carpet?

1301
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:23,530
你相信我吗
Do you trust me?

1302
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:25,740
你说什么
What did you say?

1303
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:27,610
你相信我吗
Do you trust me?

1304
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:34,200
相信
Yes.

1305
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:52,140
{\an9}我带你遍览  这世间万象
I can show you the world

1306
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:57,310
{\an9}如此明亮  皎洁光芒
Shining, shimmering splendid

1307
01:15:57,330 --> 01:15:59,250
{\an9}告诉我  公主
Tell me, Princess

1308
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:04,690
{\an9}你何时曾随心之所向
Now when did you last let your heart decide?

1309
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:09,070
{\an9}我陪你尽看  那天高地广
I can open your eyes

1310
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:13,540
{\an9}寻访奇妙风光
Take you wonder by wonder

1311
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:16,720
{\an9}天地皆在眼中藏
Over, sideways and under

1312
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:20,520
{\an9}遨游神奇魔毯上
On a magic carpet ride

1313
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:24,480
{\an9}崭新的世界
A whole new world

1314
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:28,470
{\an9}全新的视角
A new fantastic point of view

1315
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:31,320
{\an9}无人能阻挡
No one to tell us no

1316
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,140
{\an9}你我随心而往
Or where to go

1317
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:36,630
{\an9}相信这一切绝非虚妄
Or say we're only dreaming

1318
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:40,250
{\an1}崭新的世界
A whole new world

1319
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:44,290
{\an1}从未了解  此地胜景
A dazzling place I never knew

1320
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,050
{\an1}但当我在云端穿行
But when I'm way up here

1321
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:48,970
{\an1}我心如明镜
It's crystal clear

1322
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:55,390
{\an1}你我同在崭新的世界
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

1323
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:58,970
{\an9}你我同在崭新的世界
Now I'm in a whole new world with you

1324
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:01,060
{\an1}未曾见过如此美景
Unbelievable sights

1325
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:04,810
{\an1}未曾有过如此心动
Indescribable feeling

1326
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:04,810
{\an9}如此心动
Feeling

1327
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:08,280
{\an1}我心随之起伏不定
Soaring, tumbling freewheeling

1328
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:11,650
{\an1}越无尽夜空  赏璀璨繁星
Through an endless diamond sky

1329
01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:15,580
{\an1}崭新的世界
A whole new world

1330
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,580
{\an9}千万不要闭上眼睛
Don't you dare close your eyes

1331
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:19,640
{\an1}万千世界等你探寻
A hundred thousand things to see

1332
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,710
{\an9}凝神屏息静待
Hold your breath it gets better

1333
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:22,330
{\an1}我如划过天际的流星
I'm like a shooting star

1334
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:24,380
{\an1}我已千里远行
I've come so far

1335
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:28,920
{\an1}再难回曾经
I can't go back to where I used to be

1336
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:30,520
{\an9}崭新的世界
A whole new world

1337
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,880
{\an1}每个转弯都有惊喜
Every turn a surprise

1338
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:35,430
{\an9}有新的地平线去寻觅
With new horizons to pursue

1339
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:35,430
{\an1}每一刻都值得铭记
Every moment red-letter

1340
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:38,180
我将遍寻它们的踪迹
I'll chase them anywhere

1341
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:40,060
岁月仍居  时仍我与
There's time to spare

1342
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:46,420
这崭新的世界  让我与你携手共享
Let me share this whole new world with you

1343
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:50,580
{\an9}崭新的世界
A whole new world

1344
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:51,800
{\an1}崭新的世界
A whole new world

1345
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:54,210
{\an9}那才是我们的终点
That's where we'll be

1346
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:56,030
{\an1}那才是我们的终点
That's where we'll be

1347
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:57,330
{\an9}惊奇旅程
A thrilling chase

1348
01:17:57,330 --> 01:17:59,890
{\an1}奇妙之地
A wondrous place

1349
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:07,150
你我二人
For you and me

1350
01:18:20,850 --> 01:18:22,640
你带我看了那么多地方
Of all the places you've shown me,

1351
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,920
目前这里是最美的
this is by far the most beautiful.

1352
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:28,920
有时候你只是需要换个角度看
Sometimes, you just have to see it from a different perspective.

1353
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:32,760
是他们  百姓  是他们增添了光彩
It's them, the people. They make it beautiful.

1354
01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:35,220
他们理应被明白这点的君主领导
And they deserve a leader who knows that.

1355
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:37,660
不知道为什么  我觉得这个君主可以由我来当
I don't know why I think it could be me.

1356
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:39,180
因为本就该由你来当
Because it should be you.

1357
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:41,220
你这么想吗
You think so?

1358
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:43,980
我怎么想重要吗
Does it matter what I think?

1359
01:18:52,170 --> 01:18:54,510
你看下面那只可爱的小猴
Look at that adorable monkey down there.

1360
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:55,090
那是阿布吗
Is that Abu?

1361
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:57,200
不不  不可能是阿布  他...
No, no, it couldn't be Abu, he's...

1362
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:05,750
你到底有几个名字  阿拉丁王子
So, how many names do you have, Prince Aladdin?

1363
01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:07,060
不不  我
No, no, I...

1364
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:08,710
阿里王子是谁
So who is Prince Ali?

1365
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:11,570
我就是阿里王子
I am Prince Ali.

1366
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:13,030
那你怎么这么了解这座城市
But how would you know the city so well?

1367
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:14,880
我提前来到阿格拉巴
I came to Agrabah early...

1368
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,860
因为  要了解一国百姓
because to know a people,

1369
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:18,030
你一定要亲自去接触
you have to see them for yourself.

1370
01:19:18,030 --> 01:19:19,510
但是这个道理你已经懂了
But you already know that.

1371
01:19:19,870 --> 01:19:22,970
我们初次相遇  你就乔装打扮混在城里
When we first met, you were disguised in your own city.

1372
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:25,040
你看到我们入城时的
You saw us arrive

1373
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,330
舞者和大象了  还有魔毯
with dancers, an elephant, and a magic carpet.

1374
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:30,590
街头小偷怎么可能拥有这些
How could a street thief have all that?

1375
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:32,900
但是我怎么没认出你呢
But how could I not recognize you?

1376
01:19:34,130 --> 01:19:36,450
人们看不到王室外表之下真正的你
People don't see the real you when you're royalty.

1377
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:42,560
对不起  我无地自容
I'm sorry. I'm embarrassed.

1378
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,810
你这几天所见的阿格拉巴
I mean, you've seen more of Agrabah in days

1379
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:47,000
比我这辈子看的都多
than I have in an entire lifetime.

1380
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:51,800
我们应该...
We should...

1381
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:56,220
差不多该回去了
probably head back.

1382
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:58,680
这就走了
Already?

1383
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:10,150
明天见  公主
Until tomorrow, Princess.

1384
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,410
晚安
Good night.

1385
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:30,790
晚安
Good night.

1386
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:36,720
太棒了
Yes!

1387
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:45,770
有意思
Fascinating.

1388
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:52,790
我喜欢你这表情  约会顺利吗
I like that face. Good date?

1389
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:54,130
顺利极了
The best.

1390
01:20:54,130 --> 01:20:56,230
比最好的还要好
But it was better than the best.

1391
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:58,360
她认出我是阿拉丁了
She figured out I was Aladdin.

1392
01:20:58,470 --> 01:20:59,820
你说过这是不可能发生的
You said that wouldn't happen.

1393
01:21:00,430 --> 01:21:03,720
精灵的魔法只能改变外表
I mean, genie magic is really just a facade.

1394
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:04,950
或早或晚
At some point,

1395
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:07,580
真正的品格总是能透射出来
real character's always gonna shine through.

1396
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:10,420
但这是好事  对吧  现在她知道真相了
But that's a good thing, right? Now, she knows.

1397
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:11,270
这个...
Well...

1398
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:12,600
这个是哪个
Well, what?

1399
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,980
他说他只是乔装成小偷
He told me he was only pretending

1400
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:15,270
去了解这座城市
to be a thief to see the city...

1401
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:17,190
但他其实是王子
but he's actually a prince.

1402
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:19,780
我让她相信我真的是王子
I convinced her that I really was a prince.

1403
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:21,030
你相信他吗
And you believed him?

1404
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:22,150
她相信你吗
And she believed you?

1405
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:23,110
是啊
I think so.

1406
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:27,490
总有一天  你要告诉她真相
Eventually, you are going to have to tell her the truth.

1407
01:21:27,490 --> 01:21:30,440
总有一天  我会告诉她的
Eventually, I will tell her.

1408
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:34,810
反正  我现在也算是个王子了
Anyway, I sort of am a prince now.

1409
01:21:36,210 --> 01:21:39,400
看来你要搞那一套了
So, you're gonna drink from that cup.

1410
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:42,300
你有没有想过  你选择相信他
You don't think maybe you want to believe him...

1411
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,630
是因为你只能嫁给王子
because you have to marry a prince,

1412
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:45,300
而不能嫁给小偷
but you can't marry a thief?

1413
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:49,870
不  我是真心相信他
No, I believe him. I do.

1414
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,380
等到时机成熟  我会告诉她的
When the time is right, I will tell her.

1415
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:06,430
早上好
Morning.

1416
01:22:06,910 --> 01:22:07,890
早上好
Morning.

1417
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:12,850
又来了
Not again.

1418
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,230
求求你们
Please, please.

1419
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:22,840
先生们  我觉得你们是误会了
Gentlemen, I think there's been some sort of confusion.

1420
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,490
你们好像不知道我是谁
I don't think you know who I am.

1421
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:25,620
不不
Oh, no, no.

1422
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,120
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

1423
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:29,290
阿拉丁
Aladdin.

1424
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:30,620
阿拉丁
Aladdin?

1425
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:32,270
阿拉丁
Aladdin.

1426
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:34,190
我不知道那是谁  我是阿里王子
I don't know who that is. I'm Prince Ali...

1427
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:35,770
-街头鼠辈  -来自阿巴布瓦
- Street rat! - of Ababwa.

1428
01:22:35,770 --> 01:22:38,560
来自一个并不存在的王国的王子
Prince from a kingdom that doesn't exist...

1429
01:22:38,570 --> 01:22:41,340
还拥有一张魔毯
who now possesses a magic carpet

1430
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,070
出自奇迹山洞
from the Cave of Wonders.

1431
01:22:43,070 --> 01:22:44,610
在我看来  唯一的解释就是
Seems to me, the only way that's possible...

1432
01:22:44,610 --> 01:22:45,780
你的猴子在哪
Where's your monkey?

1433
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:47,720
你找到了那件宝物
is if you found a certain treasure.

1434
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,770
我的宝物
My treasure.

1435
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:53,140
神灯在哪
Where's the lamp?

1436
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:03,960
我们之间显然有些误会
There's clearly been some sort of misunderstanding.

1437
01:23:03,970 --> 01:23:04,920
我是阿里王子
I'm Prince Ali.

1438
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:07,410
如果我把你从阳台上扔下去
If I throw you off of that balcony,

1439
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,080
你的身份也确实如你所说
and you are who you say you are...

1440
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:13,710
你就会被水淹死
you will die a watery death.

1441
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:18,840
如果你活下来了  只可能是借助神灯
If you survive, it can only be because of the lamp.

1442
01:23:20,150 --> 01:23:22,300
这样的话  我也得到了答案
In which case, I will have my answer.

1443
01:23:23,150 --> 01:23:24,510
最后问你一次
For the last time...

1444
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,890
神灯在哪
where is the lamp?

1445
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:36,160
听我说  我不知道你把我错认成谁了
Listen to me. I don't know who you think I am.

1446
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,120
再见了  阿拉丁
Goodbye, Aladdin.

1447
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:44,110
不  不
No! No!

1448
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:44,840
小子  你搞什么...
Boy, what in the...?

1449
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:48,380
小子
Kid, okay.

1450
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:50,700
你得许愿我才能救你
I can't get you out of this unless you make a wish!

1451
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:53,740
你得许愿  快点  醒醒
You have to make a wish! Come on, wake up!

1452
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:57,230
说出这几个字  "我许愿"
Okay, try and form the words "I wish."

1453
01:24:57,370 --> 01:25:00,770
小子  快点  醒醒  醒醒
Kid, come on, wake up! Wake up.

1454
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:02,810
赶紧动动脑子  好好想  努力想
You need to think. Think, think.

1455
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:04,860
使劲想
Think.

1456
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:07,760
好吧好吧  我们来暗箱操作一下
Okay, okay! A little gray area here,

1457
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:09,110
但是值得一试
but it's worth a try.

1458
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:13,140
我  阿拉丁  头脑清醒身体强健
"I, Aladdin, being of sound body and mind...

1459
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:14,760
在此声明  我的第二个愿望
"Declare that my second wish

1460
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,760
就是预嘱逃出生天
"Is to be saved from certain doom."

1461
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:18,970
我私自做主签了昨天的日期
I took the liberty to backdate that a day.

1462
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:20,160
希望你不会介意
I hope you don't mind.

1463
01:25:20,190 --> 01:25:21,750
好了  我们走吧
Yes! Here we go! Come on!

1464
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:35,490
挺住  小子  挺住  小子  醒醒啊
Come on, kid! Come on! Kid? Kid? Kid, please.

1465
01:25:35,490 --> 01:25:37,990
快醒醒  醒醒  醒醒  醒醒啊
Come on! Wake up! Wake up, wake up!

1466
01:25:37,990 --> 01:25:40,640
小子  醒醒
Kid, wake up.

1467
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:41,640
拜托
Please.

1468
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:49,440
要是换个方向喷就好了  不过
Probably could've done that the other direction, but...

1469
01:25:53,390 --> 01:25:54,240
你怎么样
How you doing?

1470
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:56,490
谢了  精灵
Thanks, Genie.

1471
01:25:57,180 --> 01:25:59,910
小事一桩  我恰好就在附近
No problem, you know. I was in the neighborhood.

1472
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:02,170
我还以为你说不会帮忙
I thought you said no favors.

1473
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:04,830
你不是说不交朋友吗
I thought you said no friends.

1474
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:05,960
嗯
Right.

1475
01:26:06,650 --> 01:26:09,710
其实用掉了你的一个愿望
It actually cost you a wish.

1476
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:15,430
那不重要  你救了我一命
Whatever it cost, you saved my life.

1477
01:26:15,450 --> 01:26:16,550
对  这倒不假
Yeah, that's true.

1478
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:19,970
严格来说  这是团队协作的功劳
I mean, strictly speaking though, it was a team effort.

1479
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:24,690
谢谢你
Thank you.

1480
01:26:27,210 --> 01:26:28,820
我们必须阻止贾法尔
We have to stop Jafar.

1481
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:30,900
那谈何容易
That's not gonna be easy.

1482
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:33,070
苏丹无条件地信任他
The sultan trusts him completely.

1483
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:35,660
他骗过了所有人
He has everybody fooled.

1484
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,040
也许并不是所有人
Maybe not everyone.

1485
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:44,140
我无意中听到阿里王子和他的谋士说
I overheard Prince Ali talking to his advisor...

1486
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:46,650
要带领一支军队回来占领阿格拉巴
about returning with an army to conquer Agrabah.

1487
01:26:46,650 --> 01:26:47,540
什么
What?

1488
01:26:47,650 --> 01:26:50,460
显然他已经连夜出逃了
Now it appears he's fled in the night.

1489
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:52,840
茉莉
Jasmine.

1490
01:26:55,450 --> 01:26:57,030
你亲耳听见他说的吗  贾法尔
You heard him say this, Jafar,

1491
01:26:57,030 --> 01:26:58,850
你亲眼看见他离开的吗
and you saw him leave?

1492
01:26:59,490 --> 01:27:03,290
是的  亲耳所闻亲眼所见
Yes, with my own ears and my own eyes.

1493
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:06,940
有什么问题吗  公主殿下
So, what's the problem now, Princess?

1494
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:10,110
这就是问题所在  贾法尔
This is the problem, Jafar.

1495
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:12,210
如果你说的是实话
If what you say is true,

1496
01:27:12,210 --> 01:27:14,470
为什么阿里王子还在这呢
then why is Prince Ali still here?

1497
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:15,660
陛下
Your Majesty.

1498
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:18,240
阿里王子
Prince Ali.

1499
01:27:19,850 --> 01:27:21,010
真是惊喜
This is a surprise.

1500
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:24,250
陛下  您的谋士表里不一
Your Highness, your advisor's not who he says he is.

1501
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:26,940
我表里不一
I'm not who I say I am?

1502
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:30,670
阿爸  他试图杀害阿里王子
Baba, he tried to kill Prince Ali.

1503
01:27:31,610 --> 01:27:34,470
贾法尔  你能解释一下吗
Jafar, can you explain this to me?

1504
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:36,180
好的
Yes.

1505
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:40,050
苏丹陛下
My sultan...

1506
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:45,350
您知道我对您忠心耿耿
you know my loyalty belongs to you.

1507
01:27:47,830 --> 01:27:49,360
忠心耿耿
Your loyalty...

1508
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,780
忠心耿耿
Your loyalty...

1509
01:27:53,130 --> 01:27:54,190
是的
Yes.

1510
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,510
阿里王子  你不请自来
Prince Ali, you invited yourself into our city...

1511
01:28:00,510 --> 01:28:02,810
我们将你迎为座上宾
and we welcomed you as our guest.

1512
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:05,790
但是我认为你的意图
But I believe your intentions are...

1513
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:10,960
并不单纯
deceitful.

1514
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:13,150
你对阿格拉巴来说是巨大的威胁
You're a grave danger to Agrabah

1515
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:14,860
你将被严肃处理
and you shall be dealt with as such.

1516
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:18,090
-阿爸  你在说什么  -够了  茉莉
- Baba, what are you saying? - Enough, Jasmine!

1517
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:22,810
贾法尔把阿里王子的野心都告诉我了
Jafar told me of Prince Ali's ambition.

1518
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:23,490
他的权杖
His staff.

1519
01:28:23,490 --> 01:28:25,100
他是来篡夺王位的
He's here for my throne.

1520
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,180
哈基姆
Hakim!

1521
01:28:36,510 --> 01:28:37,360
阿爸
Baba?

1522
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:39,630
发生什么了
What happened?

1523
01:28:39,630 --> 01:28:40,680
他给你下咒了
He had you under a spell.

1524
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:43,720
不可信任他  陛下
He's not to be trusted, Your Majesty.

1525
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:44,810
他想篡夺您的王位
He wants your throne.

1526
01:28:44,810 --> 01:28:48,960
贾法尔  你曾是我最信任的谋士
Jafar! You were my most trusted advisor.

1527
01:28:49,810 --> 01:28:52,710
哈基姆  将他关入地牢
Hakim! Put him in the dungeon!

1528
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:02,780
你该好好想想
You should think about how quickly

1529
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:06,810
权力倒戈风云莫测  哈基姆
the sands of power shift in a storm, Hakim.

1530
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:09,270
我忠于苏丹陛下
I am loyal to my sultan,

1531
01:29:10,170 --> 01:29:12,150
你也该如此
as you should have been.

1532
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:16,820
法律就是法律
The law is the law.

1533
01:29:32,650 --> 01:29:36,190
阿里王子  请容我致歉
Prince Ali, I must apologize.

1534
01:29:36,190 --> 01:29:40,740
陛下  我有一事想澄清
Well, Your Highness, there's something I'd like to explain.

1535
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:42,320
你的名誉与正直
Your honor and integrity

1536
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:45,890
将永不在阿格拉巴受到质疑
will never again be questioned here in Agrabah.

1537
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:48,870
-我...  -从没有比你更高尚和真诚之人
- I... - A more noble and sincere young man

1538
01:29:48,870 --> 01:29:52,500
踏足过这座宫殿
has never graced the chambers of this palace.

1539
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:53,670
这个...
Well, uh...

1540
01:29:54,670 --> 01:29:58,630
-我...  -能有你这样的女婿是我的荣幸
- I... - I would be honored to call you my son...

1541
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:04,070
如果这是你们心之所向
if that were something anyone wanted.

1542
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:06,430
姑娘到手了
So, you got the girl.

1543
01:30:06,430 --> 01:30:07,220
相信我
I mean, trust me,

1544
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:10,810
果酱灾难后我对你确实有些怀疑
I had my doubts after your whole jam debacle.

1545
01:30:10,810 --> 01:30:14,130
但你重振了旗鼓
But you pulled yourself back together a little bit.

1546
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:15,880
确实是  不是吗
I did, didn't I?

1547
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:18,070
我觉得自己终于找到当王子的诀窍了
I think I finally got the hang of being a prince.

1548
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:20,070
其实我不是这意思
Well, that's not exactly what I meant.

1549
01:30:20,070 --> 01:30:22,820
你说得对  人们只看见想看见的东西
You were right! People see what they wanna see.

1550
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:25,970
阿拉丁已逝  如今我是阿里王子
Aladdin is gone. I'm Prince Ali now.

1551
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:28,620
你都搞明白了是吧  小子
Got it all figured out now, huh, kid?

1552
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:30,830
我在想  关于我的最后一个愿望
And, you know, I was thinking about my last wish...

1553
01:30:30,830 --> 01:30:34,370
我真的不能没有你
and I just can't do this without you.

1554
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:36,000
我知道自己说过要放你自由
I know I told you I'd use it to set you free,

1555
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,130
但你听到苏丹的话了
but you heard the sultan.

1556
01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:39,170
我不能让我们努力的一切分崩离析
I can't let everything we worked for fall apart.

1557
01:30:39,170 --> 01:30:43,010
那你要永远瞒着她
So, you just never tell her the truth?

1558
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:44,010
你要永远活在谎言中
You're gonna keep living the lie?

1559
01:30:44,010 --> 01:30:46,950
这不是谎言  人可以改变
It's not a lie. People can change.

1560
01:30:47,470 --> 01:30:48,990
确实改变了
They can change all right.

1561
01:30:50,180 --> 01:30:52,520
这是坏事吗
And that's a bad thing?

1562
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,810
现在一切都好了  没人受伤
Everything is better now. No one got hurt.

1563
01:30:54,810 --> 01:30:57,270
你难道宁愿我回街上靠偷窃为生吗
You'd rather me be back on the streets stealing to survive?

1564
01:30:57,270 --> 01:31:00,460
我以为你会为我高兴
I thought you'd be happy for me.

1565
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:02,360
但你只在乎
But all you cared about was that

1566
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,970
我用最后的愿望放你自由
I use my last wish to set you free.

1567
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:09,490
小子  我根本不在乎那个愿望
Well, kid, I don't care nothin' about that wish.

1568
01:31:09,490 --> 01:31:13,080
重点在于你  你身上的变化
This is about you, what's happening to you.

1569
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:15,870
你宁愿欺骗心爱之人
You'd rather lie to somebody you love

1570
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:17,620
也不愿放弃这一切
than give all of this up.

1571
01:31:17,630 --> 01:31:19,190
你不明白  精灵
You don't get it, Genie.

1572
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:23,650
我这样的人  如果不伪装什么也得不到
People like me don't get anything except by pretending.

1573
01:31:24,130 --> 01:31:27,280
我觉得也许是你不懂
I think maybe you don't get it.

1574
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:30,830
你靠伪装得到的越多
The more you gain by pretending,

1575
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:33,410
实际拥有的就越少
the less you're actually gonna have.

1576
01:31:33,890 --> 01:31:38,040
一万年来  我从未  从来没有
In 10,000 years, I have never once, ever...

1577
01:31:38,650 --> 01:31:41,380
称主人为朋友
called a master a friend.

1578
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:45,300
我为你打破规矩  救你性命
I broke the rules for you, I saved your life.

1579
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:46,550
为了什么
And for what?

1580
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,800
你真让我心碎  小子
You are breaking my heart here, kid.

1581
01:31:50,370 --> 01:31:51,830
真让我心碎
You're breaking my heart.

1582
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:53,890
精灵  不  别这样
Genie, no! Come on!

1583
01:32:10,470 --> 01:32:12,260
神灯  神灯
Lamp. Lamp.

1584
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:14,370
主人  神灯
Master. Lamp.

1585
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,830
他以为自己是谁  他本该为我效命
Who does he think he is? He's supposed to serve me.

1586
01:32:19,230 --> 01:32:21,920
我的内在依然没变  对吧  阿布
I'm the same as I always was on the inside. Right, Abu?

1587
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:50,760
你在逗我吗
Are you kidding?

1588
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:52,990
你为什么要在拱道下...
Now, why would you rub the thing under the...

1589
01:32:53,850 --> 01:32:55,200
擦拭神灯
archway?

1590
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:04,840
蟊贼草包
Riffraff

1591
01:33:05,570 --> 01:33:07,170
街头鼠辈
Street rat

1592
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:11,470
若细查看
Would they think that

1593
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:19,480
是否彼念仍然
If they look much closer?

1594
01:33:19,830 --> 01:33:23,480
我仍无法  佯装王子欺瞒
Still, I can't play a prince here

1595
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:25,480
不  先生
No, siree

1596
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:31,760
必吐真言  我无法扮演
Gotta tell the truth I can't pretend

1597
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:37,040
纵使美梦凋谢
Even if it means this dream will end

1598
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:44,920
纵使佳人决别
Even if she walks away

1599
01:33:46,610 --> 01:33:48,090
渐行渐远
From me

1600
01:33:58,160 --> 01:33:59,270
贾法尔
Jafar.

1601
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,190
你应该在还有机会时离开阿格拉巴
You should have left Agrabah while you had the chance.

1602
01:34:03,790 --> 01:34:06,420
为何我要离开属于自己的城市
Why leave when the city belongs to me now?

1603
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:09,000
-结束了  贾法尔  -真有你的
- It's over, Jafar. - Good for you.

1604
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:12,880
我已经受够了你没有骨气的无能为政
I've endured your spineless incompetence for long enough now.

1605
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,160
-哈基姆  -老家伙
- Hakim. - Old fool.

1606
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:26,960
精灵
Genie!

1607
01:34:27,690 --> 01:34:29,360
我的第一个愿望
For my first wish,

1608
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:32,150
我许愿变成阿格拉巴的苏丹
I wish to be sultan of Agrabah!

1609
01:34:32,150 --> 01:34:32,970
什么
What?

1610
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:35,590
如你所愿  主人
As you wish, Master.

1611
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:36,550
不
No!

1612
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:12,840
哈基姆
Hakim.

1613
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:14,430
哈基姆
Hakim!

1614
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:19,600
你听命于苏丹  所以你现在听命于我
You obey the sultan, so you obey me now.

1615
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:27,060
你清楚法律  哈基姆
You know the law, Hakim!

1616
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:33,150
不
No.

1617
01:35:37,090 --> 01:35:38,240
苏丹陛下
My sultan!

1618
01:35:38,890 --> 01:35:40,080
苏丹陛下
My sultan!

1619
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:43,700
哈基姆
Hakim.

1620
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:46,100
率领军队入侵希拉巴
Marshal an army to invade Shirabad.

1621
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:47,230
-希拉巴  -你不能...
- Shirabad! - You cannot...

1622
01:35:47,230 --> 01:35:49,440
我觉得我们听够你的话了  公主
I think we've heard enough from you, Princess.

1623
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:52,130
你该履行一直以来应尽的义务了
It's time you start doing what you should have done all along.

1624
01:35:52,190 --> 01:35:54,170
保持沉默
Stay silent.

1625
01:35:54,780 --> 01:35:57,130
守卫  把她带下去
Guards, remove her!

1626
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:04,220
请你好自为之  管好那只猫
Control that cat if you know what's good for you.

1627
01:36:05,170 --> 01:36:06,000
拉贾
Rajah.

1628
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:08,260
拉贾
Rajah!

1629
01:36:09,870 --> 01:36:12,950
拉贾  没事的
Rajah! It's all right.

1630
01:36:19,350 --> 01:36:20,880
-别碰她  -阿爸
- Don't touch her! - Baba.

1631
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:28,600
茉莉
Jasmine.

1632
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:35,730
只需要供人欣赏
And understand it's better for you

1633
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:36,790
而不是自己发声
to be seen and not heard.

1634
01:36:36,790 --> 01:36:39,340
我觉得我们听够你的话了  公主
I think we've heard enough from you, Princess.

1635
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:40,370
保持沉默
Stay silent.

1636
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:45,380
戒律清规  镌于石碑
Written in stone ev'ry rule, ev'ry word

1637
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:49,110
千朝万代  墨守成规
Centuries old and unbending

1638
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:52,870
"安分守己  不亢不卑"
"Stay in your place better seen and not heard"

1639
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:57,970
而今陈规终结尾
Well, now that story is ending

1640
01:36:58,690 --> 01:37:00,660
因我
'Cause I

1641
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:05,320
不能屈服崩溃
I cannot start to crumble

1642
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:07,800
尔等无妨但来
So come on and try

1643
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:13,600
-堵我口舌  灭我志气  -茉莉
- Try to shut me and cut me down - Jasmine!

1644
01:37:14,610 --> 01:37:17,900
我不会沉默不语
I won't be silenced

1645
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:21,550
你无法让我闭口不提
You can't keep me quiet

1646
01:37:21,550 --> 01:37:24,980
虽有威胁  绝不战栗
Won't tremble when you try it

1647
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:29,180
我只自知不会沉默不语
All I know is I won't go speechless

1648
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:30,770
沉默不语
Speechless

1649
01:37:30,770 --> 01:37:33,230
任凭风暴来袭
Let the storm in

1650
01:37:33,230 --> 01:37:36,850
我仍傲然挺立
I cannot be broken

1651
01:37:36,850 --> 01:37:40,220
我非寒蝉僵鸟
No, I won't live unspoken

1652
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:45,590
因我自知不会沉默不语
'Cause I know that I won't go speechless

1653
01:37:45,590 --> 01:37:49,220
纵使围墙高砌
Try to lock me in this cage

1654
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:53,720
绝不坐以待毙
I won't just lay me down and die

1655
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:56,660
我将驾驭残羽
I will take these broken wings

1656
01:37:56,660 --> 01:38:01,420
燃烧划过天际
And watch me burn across the sky

1657
01:38:01,420 --> 01:38:03,550
天地回荡我语
Hear the echo saying

1658
01:38:03,550 --> 01:38:09,310
我不会沉默不语
I won't be silenced

1659
01:38:09,310 --> 01:38:14,530
纵然你威逼  想见我战栗
Though you wanna see me tremble when you try it

1660
01:38:14,530 --> 01:38:18,720
我只自知不会沉默不语
All I know is I won't go speechless

1661
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:20,480
沉默不语
Speechless

1662
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:22,580
人虽扼我喉颈
'Cause I'll breathe

1663
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:26,170
我将奋力喘息
When they try to suffocate me

1664
01:38:26,170 --> 01:38:29,720
勿把我看低
Don't you underestimate me

1665
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:33,550
因我自知不会沉默不语
'Cause I know that I won't go speechless

1666
01:38:33,550 --> 01:38:37,830
我只自知不会沉默不语
All I know is I won't go speechless

1667
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:40,580
沉默不语
Speechless

1668
01:38:46,390 --> 01:38:47,580
哈基姆
Hakim!

1669
01:38:48,150 --> 01:38:49,170
哈基姆
Hakim!

1670
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:53,000
把她带走
Take her away!

1671
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,410
跟他们说  哈基姆
Tell them, Hakim.

1672
01:39:05,490 --> 01:39:06,970
当你还小时
You were just a boy

1673
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:10,350
你父亲耕地为生
when your father came to work the grounds.

1674
01:39:11,540 --> 01:39:12,720
但你奋斗崛起
But you have risen up

1675
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:15,990
成为了我们最信赖的士兵
to become our most trusted soldier.

1676
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:20,220
我知道作为一个男人  你想做到忠诚与公正
As a man, I know you to be both loyal and just.

1677
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:23,610
但现在你必须做出选择
But now you have to choose.

1678
01:39:24,650 --> 01:39:26,640
责任与荣誉不总是相辅相成
Duty isn't always honor.

1679
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:28,560
我们面对的最大挑战
Our greatest challenge

1680
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:31,310
不是对抗敌人
isn't speaking up against our enemies...

1681
01:39:31,830 --> 01:39:36,030
而是违抗我们最希望得到其认可的人
but defying those whose approval we seek the most.

1682
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:40,930
贾法尔不值得你的尊敬及牺牲
Jafar is not worthy of your admiration nor your sacrifice.

1683
01:39:40,930 --> 01:39:45,190
我只希望阿格拉巴繁荣昌盛
I wish nothing but glory for the kingdom of Agrabah.

1684
01:39:45,190 --> 01:39:49,080
不  你只为自己争名夺利
No. You seek glory for yourself.

1685
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:52,520
而你决不能赢得我的人民的支持
And you would win it off the backs of my people!

1686
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:56,170
哈基姆  这些人
Hakim, these men,

1687
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:57,770
会追随你的脚步
they will follow where you lead...

1688
01:39:57,770 --> 01:39:59,340
但这都取决于你
but it's up to you.

1689
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:01,020
你要保持沉默
Will you stand silent

1690
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:03,550
眼看着贾法尔摧毁我们所爱的王国
while Jafar destroys our beloved kingdom...

1691
01:40:03,550 --> 01:40:05,650
还是选择正道
or will you do what is right...

1692
01:40:10,660 --> 01:40:13,150
与阿格拉巴的人民携手而战
and stand with the people of Agrabah?

1693
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:26,840
公主殿下
My princess.

1694
01:40:28,930 --> 01:40:33,510
原谅我  苏丹陛下
Forgive me, my sultan.

1695
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:39,450
哈基姆
Hakim.

1696
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:44,160
守卫  拿下维齐尔
Guards, arrest the vizier!

1697
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:48,170
神灯  快擦拭神灯
Lamp! Rub the lamp.

1698
01:40:48,330 --> 01:40:50,280
事已至此
So, this is how it will be.

1699
01:40:51,070 --> 01:40:52,660
连苏丹的头衔
Not even the title of sultan

1700
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:54,710
都无法唤醒这群昏庸之人
will wake the herd from their sleep.

1701
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:56,220
我早该料到
I should've known.

1702
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,220
如果你们不愿臣服于苏丹
If you won't bow before a sultan,

1703
01:40:59,570 --> 01:41:01,850
那么你们将畏首于巫师
you will cower before a sorcerer.

1704
01:41:01,860 --> 01:41:04,020
精灵  我许愿变成
Genie! I wish to become

1705
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:06,710
史上最强大的巫师
the most powerful sorcerer there is!

1706
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:08,830
如你所愿  主人
As you wish, Master.

1707
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:35,670
这下有趣了
This could be fun.

1708
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,800
哈基姆  我曾对你寄予厚望
Hakim, I had such big plans for you.

1709
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:42,820
而如今
But now...

1710
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:47,120
你对我来说已经毫无价值了
you are no longer of any use to me.

1711
01:41:47,470 --> 01:41:50,240
也许你的手下愿意跟随你一起下地牢
Perhaps your men would like to follow you to the dungeon.

1712
01:41:52,650 --> 01:41:53,810
还有你
You too.

1713
01:41:56,630 --> 01:41:58,180
阿里王子
Prince Ali!

1714
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:02,350
这不是阿里王子吗
If it isn't our Prince Ali.

1715
01:42:02,350 --> 01:42:04,800
-阿里  -或者应该说是...
- Ali! - Or should I say...

1716
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:11,020
阿拉丁
Aladdin.

1717
01:42:13,970 --> 01:42:15,090
阿拉丁
Aladdin.

1718
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:17,360
他从头到尾一直在伪装
He's been pretending the entire time.

1719
01:42:17,710 --> 01:42:21,490
他是个冒牌货  根本没有阿里王子
An impostor. There is no Prince Ali.

1720
01:42:21,490 --> 01:42:22,870
从来就没有过
There never was.

1721
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:25,020
他只不过是个骗人的小偷
He's nothing but a lying thief.

1722
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:26,200
对不起
I'm sorry.

1723
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:27,780
你根本无关紧要
You're insignificant.

1724
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:30,110
等我把你驱逐到世界的尽头
An irritation I no longer need to tolerate...

1725
01:42:30,110 --> 01:42:33,200
确保你要在痛苦中死去之后
once I ensure your agonizing death

1726
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:37,000
我就再也不用忍受你这个麻烦了
by banishing you to the ends of the earth.

1727
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:37,990
不
No!

1728
01:42:56,940 --> 01:42:57,890
不
No.

1729
01:42:58,300 --> 01:42:59,290
不
No!

1730
01:43:02,740 --> 01:43:03,670
阿布
Abu.

1731
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:07,000
阿布
Abu!

1732
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:11,600
我可以直接把你们都杀了
I could simply kill you all.

1733
01:43:12,330 --> 01:43:14,070
但是那不足以偿还
But that would be inadequate repayment

1734
01:43:14,070 --> 01:43:17,390
这么多年来我遭受的侮辱和轻视
for years of humiliation and neglect.

1735
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:20,270
"牢记你的身份  贾法尔"
"Remember your place, Jafar."

1736
01:43:20,270 --> 01:43:22,650
"你太逾越了  贾法尔"
"You forget yourself, Jafar."

1737
01:43:22,650 --> 01:43:23,480
贾法尔
Jafar.

1738
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:28,420
不  你需要的是折磨  "阿爸"
No, what you need, Baba, is to suffer.

1739
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:30,740
-就跟我遭受过的一样  -阿爸
- Like I have suffered. - Baba?

1740
01:43:30,740 --> 01:43:33,530
看着我统治你的王国够折磨吗
Would watching me rule your kingdom be enough?

1741
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:34,250
住手
Stop!

1742
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:37,280
或是看着我的军队吞并你那无用的盟友
Or watching my armies devour your toothless ally?

1743
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:38,870
求求你  住手
Please, make it stop.

1744
01:43:38,870 --> 01:43:40,550
不  最合适的惩罚
No, the most suitable punishment

1745
01:43:40,550 --> 01:43:41,760
是让你眼睁睁看着
would be to make you watch

1746
01:43:41,770 --> 01:43:44,000
我夺走你的至爱
while I take what you love most.

1747
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,760
不  不  求你了  阿爸
No. No, please. Baba.

1748
01:43:45,770 --> 01:43:47,150
娶你的女儿
And marry your daughter.

1749
01:43:47,450 --> 01:43:48,410
不
No!

1750
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:50,660
不
No.

1751
01:43:51,490 --> 01:43:55,290
她绝不会嫁给你
She will never marry you.

1752
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:00,820
阿爸
Baba.

1753
01:44:00,820 --> 01:44:02,610
我会如你所愿
I will do as you wish!

1754
01:44:03,370 --> 01:44:04,730
快住手
Make it stop.

1755
01:44:07,730 --> 01:44:09,690
快住手
Make it stop.

1756
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:14,280
阿爸
Baba!

1757
01:44:15,210 --> 01:44:16,770
阿爸  你没事吧
Baba, are you all right?

1758
01:44:16,770 --> 01:44:17,870
茉莉
Jasmine.

1759
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:21,660
阿布
Abu!

1760
01:44:23,950 --> 01:44:25,170
阿布
Abu!

1761
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:28,540
阿布
Abu!

1762
01:44:40,310 --> 01:44:41,210
阿布
Abu.

1763
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:43,840
你没事吧
Are you okay?

1764
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:46,510
我们快离开这里
Let's get out of here.

1765
01:44:48,390 --> 01:44:49,290
不
No.

1766
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:23,140
苏丹陛下  怀着真心诚意
Your Highness, Sultan, in honesty and sincerity...

1767
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:24,600
您愿意娶茉莉公主...
do you accept Princess Jasmine...?

1768
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:25,670
我愿意
Yes.

1769
01:45:26,730 --> 01:45:28,740
我愿意
Yes, I accept.

1770
01:45:28,990 --> 01:45:30,830
公主
Princess.

1771
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:32,240
茉莉公主
Princess Jasmine,

1772
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:35,590
您愿意嫁苏丹为妻吗
do you accept the sultan to be your husband?

1773
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:42,370
快点  女人
Come on, woman.

1774
01:45:43,190 --> 01:45:44,660
快说
Accept.

1775
01:45:44,660 --> 01:45:45,630
我...
I...

1776
01:45:50,730 --> 01:45:52,100
愿意
Yes?

1777
01:45:52,630 --> 01:45:53,540
我...
I...

1778
01:45:55,610 --> 01:45:56,740
拒绝
do not!

1779
01:45:56,740 --> 01:45:58,720
神灯  神灯
The lamp! The lamp!

1780
01:45:58,750 --> 01:46:00,060
拦住她
Stop her!

1781
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:02,890
不  茉莉  不
No, Jasmine! No!

1782
01:46:02,890 --> 01:46:05,090
不  不
No! No!

1783
01:46:10,780 --> 01:46:12,720
神灯  伊阿古
The lamp! Iago!

1784
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:14,720
-你没事吧  -没事
- Are you okay? - Yes.

1785
01:46:26,060 --> 01:46:27,080
抓稳了
Hold on!

1786
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:34,330
神灯
The lamp!

1787
01:46:34,570 --> 01:46:35,720
阿布
Abu!

1788
01:46:57,710 --> 01:46:58,670
神灯
The lamp!

1789
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:06,700
魔毯  送我上去
Carpet, get me up there!

1790
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:10,770
阿布
Abu!

1791
01:47:15,030 --> 01:47:16,110
跳
Jump!

1792
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:31,420
不
No!

1793
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:47,080
没了权杖你什么都不是
You're nothing without your staff!

1794
01:47:47,410 --> 01:47:48,690
什么都不是
Nothing!

1795
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:17,570
神灯
The lamp!

1796
01:48:24,820 --> 01:48:26,130
魔毯
Carpet!

1797
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:39,650
茉莉
Jasmine.

1798
01:48:43,780 --> 01:48:46,080
惩罚他们  惩罚他们
Punish them. Punish them.

1799
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:50,500
精灵应该在旁见证
Genie should witness.

1800
01:48:56,250 --> 01:48:57,880
正如老头所说
As the old man said...

1801
01:48:57,890 --> 01:49:00,690
你应该在还有机会时离开阿格拉巴
you should have left Agrabah when you had the chance.

1802
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:13,380
我曾经告诉过你要深谋远虑
I told you before to think bigger.

1803
01:49:13,660 --> 01:49:16,310
你本可以成为最有权势的人
You could have been the most powerful man in the room.

1804
01:49:16,310 --> 01:49:18,260
但现在神灯在我手中
But now I hold the lamp.

1805
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:20,790
权力被我掌握
I hold the power.

1806
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:27,600
神灯里没有你想要的东西  贾法尔
You can't find what you're looking for in that lamp, Jafar.

1807
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:30,120
我找过  但是失败了  你也会的
I tried and failed, and so will you.

1808
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:33,110
那是你的想法  但我是苏丹
You think so, but I am sultan!

1809
01:49:33,570 --> 01:49:36,930
我是这世上从古至今最伟大的巫师
I am the greatest sorcerer the world has ever seen.

1810
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:40,940
我要创造一个历史无法忽视的帝国
I will create an empire that history cannot ignore.

1811
01:49:41,470 --> 01:49:45,260
我能摧毁城市
I can destroy cities.

1812
01:49:45,730 --> 01:49:49,350
我能摧毁王国
I can destroy kingdoms.

1813
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,880
我也能摧毁你
And I can destroy you.

1814
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:57,890
没错
True.

1815
01:49:58,250 --> 01:49:59,950
但是让你变成苏丹的是谁
But who made you a sultan?

1816
01:50:01,020 --> 01:50:02,700
让你变成巫师的是谁
Who made you a sorcerer?

1817
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:04,910
总会有某个东西
There will always be something,

1818
01:50:04,950 --> 01:50:07,080
某个人  某个生灵
some man, some being...

1819
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:08,820
-比你更强大  -你在干什么
- more powerful than you. - What are you doing?

1820
01:50:08,820 --> 01:50:10,640
你的权力是精灵给的
Genie gave you your power,

1821
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:12,120
他也可以收回去
and he can take it away.

1822
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:14,110
-他为我效命  -只是暂时的
- He serves me! - For now.

1823
01:50:14,110 --> 01:50:16,480
但你永远不可能比精灵更强大
But you'll never have more power than the genie.

1824
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:23,350
这是你自己说的
You said it yourself.

1825
01:50:23,590 --> 01:50:26,570
除非成为最有权势的人
You're either most powerful in the room...

1826
01:50:26,570 --> 01:50:28,460
否则一切都没有意义
or you're nothing.

1827
01:50:29,420 --> 01:50:32,860
你永远都是一人之下
You'll always be second.

1828
01:50:32,860 --> 01:50:35,560
一人之下  一人之下
Second! Second!

1829
01:50:38,410 --> 01:50:39,520
一人之下
Second?

1830
01:50:39,970 --> 01:50:41,770
区区一人之下
Only second?

1831
01:50:42,140 --> 01:50:44,040
他为我效命
He serves me!

1832
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:50,600
我要确保没人会再说出这种话
I will make sure no one will ever say these words again.

1833
01:50:50,670 --> 01:50:51,820
精灵
Genie!

1834
01:50:52,410 --> 01:50:54,260
我的最后一个愿望  我许愿变成
For my final wish, I wish to become

1835
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:57,150
宇宙中最强大的生灵
the most powerful being in the universe.

1836
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:59,230
比你更加强大
More powerful than you!

1837
01:50:59,930 --> 01:51:03,760
这个愿望太含糊了  不过...
A lot of gray area in that wish, but, uh...

1838
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:07,620
宇宙中最强大的生灵
most powerful being in the universe

1839
01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:09,180
马上就来
coming right up!

1840
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:38,230
宇宙中最强大的  终于
The most powerful in the universe, at last...

1841
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:40,200
不亚于任何人
second to no one.

1842
01:51:40,310 --> 01:51:43,770
我还以为之前就够强大了
And I thought I had power before!

1843
01:51:43,910 --> 01:51:48,580
首先  我要摧毁希拉巴的那些蠢货
First, I'll lay waste to those fools in Shirabad.

1844
01:52:03,950 --> 01:52:05,260
你对我做了什么
What have you done to me?

1845
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:07,190
我什么也没做  贾法尔
I haven't done anything to you, Jafar.

1846
01:52:07,190 --> 01:52:09,270
你对我做了什么
What have you done to me?

1847
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:11,420
这是你的愿望  不是我的
This was your wish, not mine.

1848
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:14,360
精灵也许拥有举世无双的非凡魔力
A genie might have phenomenal cosmic powers...

1849
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:17,180
但只有小之又小的生存空间
But an itty-bitty living space.

1850
01:52:17,180 --> 01:52:20,280
是这样  没有主人的精灵
You see, a genie without a master

1851
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:22,060
必须回到自己的神灯里
goes back in their lamp.

1852
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:24,700
不  不回神灯
No! Not the lamp!

1853
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,820
我不会忘记你的  小子
I will not forget you, boy!

1854
01:52:28,820 --> 01:52:30,150
记住我的话
Mark my words,

1855
01:52:30,150 --> 01:52:32,460
我不会忘记你对我做的事
I will not forget what you have done to me!

1856
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:33,720
再见了  贾法尔
Goodbye, Jafar!

1857
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:36,590
鹦鹉  你要跟我一起
Parrot! You're coming with me!

1858
01:52:38,030 --> 01:52:38,930
不
No!

1859
01:52:54,740 --> 01:52:55,670
阿爸
Baba.

1860
01:52:55,870 --> 01:52:57,400
-阿爸  -起来吧
- Baba. - Come on.

1861
01:52:57,450 --> 01:52:59,330
在奇迹山洞里待上几千年
Couple thousand years in the Cave of Wonders

1862
01:52:59,330 --> 01:53:00,880
应该能让你冷静下来
ought to cool you off.

1863
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:14,090
等等  等等
Wait. Wait.

1864
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:16,780
我该如何感谢你
How can I ever thank you?

1865
01:53:16,780 --> 01:53:20,600
不  不  您不用感谢我
Oh, no. No, you don't need to thank me.

1866
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:23,340
不过我希望你们能接受我的道歉
But I hope you accept my apology.

1867
01:53:23,350 --> 01:53:26,730
我对你们二位都很抱歉
I'm sorry to the both of you.

1868
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:28,440
尤其是你
Especially you.

1869
01:53:28,750 --> 01:53:32,080
你值得更好的
You deserve so much.

1870
01:53:33,310 --> 01:53:35,270
人非圣贤  孰能无过
We all make mistakes.

1871
01:53:38,750 --> 01:53:39,750
阿拉丁
Aladdin?

1872
01:53:43,170 --> 01:53:45,160
我希望你能找到一直寻觅的东西
I hope you find what you're looking for.

1873
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:53,430
真是一团糟啊  阿布
That's a bit of a mess there, Abu.

1874
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:55,220
我来帮你搞定
Let me take care of that for you.

1875
01:54:02,940 --> 01:54:03,980
完美
Beautiful.

1876
01:54:05,310 --> 01:54:08,150
不  不要拉着张脸  好吗
No, no long faces, all right?

1877
01:54:08,150 --> 01:54:09,670
我有个主意
I got an idea. All right?

1878
01:54:09,670 --> 01:54:11,630
这是你最后一个愿望
This is your last wish.

1879
01:54:11,630 --> 01:54:14,180
跻身王室这个主意没错
Royalty was the right idea, okay?

1880
01:54:14,190 --> 01:54:16,080
只是需要加上点个人特色
We should just riff on that a little bit.

1881
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:17,840
我是这么想的
All right, here's what I'm thinking.

1882
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:21,850
阿拉丁  勇士王子
Aladdin, warrior prince,

1883
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:25,890
高尚正直  所在之处窃贼慌忙逃窜
a noble heart in a land where thieves run feral!

1884
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:29,840
茉莉
Jasmine!

1885
01:54:30,140 --> 01:54:31,060
你喜欢吗
You like it?

1886
01:54:31,900 --> 01:54:34,280
不喜欢  好吧  你的心声我听得明明白白
No? Okay, all right. I hear you loud and clear.

1887
01:54:34,280 --> 01:54:36,360
但是这才是你需要的
All right. But this is what you need.

1888
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:39,420
王室敕令的阿格拉巴统治法律
The governing laws of Agrabah by royal decree.

1889
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:41,750
它是这么写的
Okay? And here it is.

1890
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:43,580
"必须嫁给一位王子"
"Must marry a prince."

1891
01:54:43,580 --> 01:54:45,880
没错  但是只要你一句话
Right. But you say the words...

1892
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:49,240
这条法律就能消失得无影无踪
and this law just, kinda like, goes away.

1893
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:52,730
你和公主就能相伴终生了
And you and the princess are in it together forever.

1894
01:54:52,730 --> 01:54:55,200
你可以直接让法律消失
You can just make the law disappear?

1895
01:54:55,580 --> 01:54:57,840
当然了  就跟从来没存在过一样
Please. Like it never existed.

1896
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:01,060
最后一个愿望  来吧
All right. Last wish, let's get it.

1897
01:55:01,070 --> 01:55:01,930
好吧
Okay.

1898
01:55:02,930 --> 01:55:04,400
最后一个愿望
Last wish.

1899
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:06,280
精灵
Genie?

1900
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:08,010
我准备好了  等等  来吧
I'm ready, hold on. Here we go.

1901
01:55:10,670 --> 01:55:11,700
我许愿
I wish...

1902
01:55:11,700 --> 01:55:14,030
第三个也是最后一个愿望
Third and final wish.

1903
01:55:14,030 --> 01:55:15,430
我许愿
I wish

1904
01:55:16,250 --> 01:55:17,690
放你自由
to set you free.

1905
01:55:18,910 --> 01:55:19,770
什么
What?

1906
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:26,150
什么
What?

1907
01:55:31,610 --> 01:55:32,550
等等
Wait.

1908
01:55:40,850 --> 01:55:42,280
等等  我是不是...
Wait, am I...?

1909
01:55:49,460 --> 01:55:50,930
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait.

1910
01:55:51,980 --> 01:55:53,720
给我提个要求
Tell me to do something.

1911
01:55:54,270 --> 01:55:55,990
给我弄点果酱
Get me some jams.

1912
01:55:57,490 --> 01:55:58,960
自己弄去
Get it yourself?

1913
01:56:01,660 --> 01:56:03,420
自己弄果酱去
Get your own jams!

1914
01:56:09,610 --> 01:56:12,600
谢谢  谢谢你
Thank you. Thank you.

1915
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:15,040
不  谢谢你  精灵
No. Thank you, Genie.

1916
01:56:15,740 --> 01:56:17,300
我欠你太多了
I owe you everything.

1917
01:56:20,790 --> 01:56:22,260
现在你有什么打算
What are you gonna do now?

1918
01:56:27,710 --> 01:56:31,430
实际上  有一个侍女
Actually, there is this handmaiden...

1919
01:56:32,740 --> 01:56:36,200
我很想与她一同周游世界
that I would love to travel the world with.

1920
01:56:38,220 --> 01:56:39,470
如果她愿意的话
If she'll have me.

1921
01:56:42,710 --> 01:56:45,020
我们什么时候启程  还有  我想要孩子
When do we leave? Also, I want children.

1922
01:56:45,020 --> 01:56:46,870
好  两个孩子
Yes. Two of them.

1923
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:49,390
起名为利安和奥玛  相隔三岁
Lian and Omar, three years apart.

1924
01:56:49,390 --> 01:56:51,990
他们会很崇拜我们  有问不完的问题
They will worship us both and ask lots of questions...

1925
01:56:51,990 --> 01:56:54,610
你会用故事和歌曲为他们解答
and you will entertain them with stories and songs.

1926
01:56:54,610 --> 01:56:55,800
他就像我一样英俊
...and he's handsome like me.

1927
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:56,680
我们要有一艘船
We'll have a boat.

1928
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:58,690
好几层的大船
A large one with multiple levels

1929
01:56:58,690 --> 01:57:00,280
还有壮观的帆
and magnificent sails.

1930
01:57:00,290 --> 01:57:02,180
我觉得小一点的更好
I was thinking more of a smaller one.

1931
01:57:02,190 --> 01:57:03,220
好极了
Perfect.

1932
01:57:03,230 --> 01:57:04,440
好极了
Perfect.

1933
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:07,900
陪我坐坐  女儿
Sit with me, my child.

1934
01:57:08,930 --> 01:57:09,880
对不起
I'm sorry.

1935
01:57:09,880 --> 01:57:12,600
-爸爸  为什么你要...  -听我说完
- Baba, why are you...? - Please, let me finish.

1936
01:57:13,380 --> 01:57:18,230
我害怕失去你  就像失去你母亲那样
I feared losing you. Like I lost your mother.

1937
01:57:18,510 --> 01:57:23,400
我只看到了我的小女儿  而不是如今的你
All I saw was my little girl, not the woman you have become.

1938
01:57:23,910 --> 01:57:28,630
你向我展示了勇气和力量
You have shown me courage and strength.

1939
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:33,450
你是阿格拉巴的未来
You are the future of Agrabah.

1940
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:44,140
你将成为下一任苏丹
You shall be the next sultan.

1941
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:55,160
谢谢你  爸爸
Thank you, Baba.

1942
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:58,680
作为苏丹  你可以修改法律
And as sultan, you may change the law.

1943
01:58:00,260 --> 01:58:01,920
他是个好男人
He is a good man.

1944
01:58:08,950 --> 01:58:09,980
他去哪了
Where'd he go?

1945
01:58:38,380 --> 01:58:41,610
站住  小偷  你的苏丹命令你站住
Stop, thief. Your sultan commands it.

1946
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:47,090
苏丹
Sultan?

1947
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:50,610
我是不是惹上麻烦了
Does that mean I'm in trouble?

1948
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:56,110
那是因为你被抓住了
Only because you got caught.

1949
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:45,740
{\an8}剧终

1950
02:00:07,710 --> 02:00:10,000
你的朋友能否做到
Can your friends do this?

1951
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:14,720
你从没有过我这样的朋友
You ain't never had A friend like me

1952
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:27,000
{\an1}Friend Like Me [feat. DJ Khaled] 我这样的朋友

1953
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:22,750

You know it's Will Smith And DJ Khaled!

1959
02:01:34,530 --> 02:01:36,050
