00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,950
会最先实现自动化
going to be the first one to get automated,

278
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,190
所以我想在
so I'm trying to just squirrel away a few nuts

279
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,130
被机器抢走饭碗之前多攒点钱
before the robots come to get me.

280
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,660
这话题太扫兴了  老兄  -这就是我的生活
- That was a real buzzkill, man. - It's just my life.

281
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,530
这个密室难度一定很高
This one's got to be really insane

282
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,370
不然不会有现金大奖  据网上说
for there to be a cash prize. The website said

283
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,870
至今还没有人成功逃脱
no one's been able to escape it yet.

284
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,000
如果我们成功了  
If we're able to do that,

285
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,200
会有多少粉丝  你们绝对想象不到
we're going to have so much street cred. You have no idea.

286
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,210
那这游戏有没有什么规则？
Are there rules and regulations? What?

287
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,480
只要在规定时间内逃出来就行
You just have to escape before the clock runs out.

288
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,040
要是逃不出来呢
Well, what happens if you don't?

289
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,510
会有人从那扇门进来
Some guy comes in through the door

290
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,110
告诉你错过了什么线索
and explains all the clues you missed.

291
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,350
让你感觉自己是个蠢蛋
He makes you feel like a total idiot.

292
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,680
游戏什么时候开始？
When does the game start?

293
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,420
我们要先等游戏大师过来
We are waiting for the Games Master

294
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,020
给我们讲解故事背景
to come in to give us the story

295
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,820
然后他再带我们去密室
and take us to the escape room.

296
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,620
比如  要是玩《僵尸启示录》
Like, it's a zombie apocalypse and we have to find

297
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,160
就得在被吃掉之前找到解药
the cure before we get eaten alive.

298
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,690
这个我喜欢  很有意思
I like that one. That one sounds good.

299
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,600
我估计这个游戏大师还在找停车位吧
While the Games Master is looking for a parking spot,

300
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,670
我先出去抽根烟
I'm going to go smoke a cigarette.

301
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:45,960
<i>出口</i>

302
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,000
<i>烧烤  关</i>

303
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,350
该死
Shit. Um...

304
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,750
门把手掉下来了
Hey, the doorknob came off.

305
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,590
你把门弄坏了吗？ 要不然呢
- What, you broke it? - Of course he did.

306
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,660
不是我弄坏的  是它自己掉的
I didn't break it, it broke.

307
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,730
你在自己家也这么开门吗？
Is that how you open a door in your house?

308
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,660
不是  -好了  你先别起急
- No. - Well, don't be so rough with it.

309
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,060
好吧  打扰一下  小姐
Well, excuse me, miss. Ma'am.

310
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,770
老天  这下精彩了
Oh, my God, this is awesome.

311
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:20,540
各位  我想这里就是我们要逃脱的密室
You guys, you guys, I think this is the escape room.

312
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,200
什么？
What?

313
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,840
等等  什么？
Wait, what?

314
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,410
好吧  这像是烤箱刻度盘  也就是说
Okay, it looks like an oven dial, which means

315
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,890
它可能是个密码锁
it's probably a combination lock.

316
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,380
好了  大家都来搜房间吧
All right, everyone search the room.

317
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,750
等一下  这就开始了吗？
Wait, wait. It's starting right now?

318
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,080
是的
- Yes. - Oh!

319
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,820
那找什么呢  兄弟？
What are we looking for here, bud?

320
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,250
找任何像是谜语或者密码的东西
Anything that looks like a puzzle or a code.

321
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,990
或者密码的东西  线索可能是任何东西  藏在任何地方
Numbers are very important. It could be anything, anywhere.

322
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,520
没准就在这底下
Maybe under here.

323
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,190
我得一直拿着这玩意吗  还是？
Do you want me to hold on to this or is it...?

324
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,630
拿着吧  这可是命根子
Yeah, just hold your knob there, guy.

325
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,930
行吧  你很幽默  对
Great. Very funny. Yeah.

326
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,800
<i>我们知道你有路可走</i>

327
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,300
<i>烤肉月刊《焦痕》余无坦博士
米诺斯密室逃生  3楼</i>

328
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,000
各位
Hey, guys.

329
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,070
各位  这些杂志都是
Hey, guys, these are all addressed

330
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,840
寄给同一个人的  他叫作余无坦博士
to the same guy, this Dr. Wootan Yu.

331
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,900
这应该是线索吧？
I mean, that's got to be a clue, right?

332
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,670
也许故事是这样的
Maybe that's the story.

333
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,610
可能他是个邪恶的科学家
Maybe he's like an evil scientist

334
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,910
我们必须逃出他的实验室
and we have to escape his lab

335
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,440
否则他就会把我们缝在一起
before he sews us all together

336
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,310
变成某种可怕的医学怪物
into some sort of medical abomination.

337
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,000
他的邪恶实验室还配了个等候室吗？
So, his evil lab has a waiting room?
<i>《华氏451度》</i>

338
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,610
他的邪恶实验室还配了个等候室吗？
So, his evil lab has a waiting room?

339
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,550
是啊  -别逗了
- Yeah. - No.

340
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,200
见鬼  真是见鬼
Shit. Shit, shit.

341
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,420
大家快看  我找到一把星型螺丝刀
Guys, look, look. I found a star-head screwdriver.

342
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,460
这肯定有用  对吧？
That's got to be something, right?

343
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,830
太好了  那要再找点螺丝钉吗？
Great. So, we're looking for screws?

344
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,200
不  这不是锤子
Well, this isn't a hammer.

345
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,000
这是螺丝刀  对吧？ -应该没错
- That's a star-head, right? - I think so. Yeah.

346
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,970
这是《华氏451度》
That's <i>Fahrenheit 451.</i>

347
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,170
好吧  她想到什么了
All right, she's got something.

348
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,880
怎么回事？ -不知道
- What was that? - I don't know.

349
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,880
怎么了吗？
Did that do anything?

350
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,720
好吧
Okay.

351
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,190
这下可厉害了  -是啊
- All right, now that's pretty cool. - Yeah.

352
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,230
有人带防晒霜了吗？
Anybody got suntan lotion?

353
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,900
你刚才做了什么？
What did you just do?

354
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,100
我以为书名是烤箱刻度盘的密码
I just thought the book was the code for the oven dial.

355
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,700
把它关掉  麻烦你
Turn it off, please.

356
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,970
这东西真的在升温
Wow, it's really throwing off some heat.

357
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,240
是  挺热的
Yeah, it's warm.

358
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,770
它在发热
It's kicking some heat.

359
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,270
这是什么  巨型加热线圈吗？
What are those, giant oven coils?

360
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,970
快关掉  -对不起  它卡住了
Turn it off. - I'm sorry. It's stuck.

361
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,310
我转不动
I can't move it.

362
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,840
该死  -这热度真要命
- Shit. - This is crazy hot.

363
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:45,550
你们能关掉吗？ -该死  好吧
Can you shut it off? - Shit. Okay.

364
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,320
别再碰什么了  好吗？
Don't touch anything else, okay?

365
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,350
你  游戏小子  就你
Hey, you, gamer boy, there.

366
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,020
我们该怎么办？ 怎么逃出去？
What do we do? How do we get out of here?

367
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,990
要是没头绪  可以要个提示
When you're stuck, you can ask for a hint.

368
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:57,390
要个提示？ 还能这么干吗？ 太好了  那走吧
A hint? That's an option? Okay, great. Here we go.

369
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,290
是  可我们自己想办法更有意思啊
Yeah, but it's way more fun if we do it ourselves.

370
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,500
说得好  游戏小子
Good one, gamer boy.

371
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,660
我也想靠自己
I kind of want to do it ourselves.

372
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,400
不好意思
Hi, excuse me.

373
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,570
我们现在想要提示  麻烦你  -对  你好
- We'd like our hint now, please. - Yeah, hello.

374
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:09,500
请您就座稍后会有人接待
 Please have a seat. Someone will be with you shortly.

375
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,340
不是  不好意思  我们真的需要提示  拜托
No, yeah, excuse me, we'd really like our hint, please.

376
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,740
请您就座稍后会有人接待
 Please have a seat. Someone will be with you shortly.

377
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,820
这话她之前就说过  -所以呢？
- She said that last time. - So?

378
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:23,090
她说得跟之前一模一样  节奏一样  语调也一样
She said it the exact same way. Same cadence, same tone.

379
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,120
他们总不会是雇了朱迪·丹奇爵士这样的演员吧
Well, the actors they hire aren't exactly Dame Judi Dench.

380
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,060
有人吗？ 我喜欢朱迪·丹奇
- Hello? Hello? - I love Judi Dench.

381
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,130
那颗雪花水晶球应该没什么用  老兄
Yeah, I don't think the snow globe's going to help, man.

382
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,210
各位  这里有个锁
Hey, guys, there's a lock over here.

383
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,040
棒  锁在密室逃生游戏里超级无敌关键
Yes. Locks are a super important part of escape rooms.

384
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,440
好吧
All right.

385
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,380
好吧  看来我们需要一把小钥匙
Okay, it looks like we need a small key

386
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,180
才能进到里面去
to get to the other side of the partition.

387
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,180
下一个线索可能就在里面
That's probably where the next clue is.

388
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,580
好吧  这我可帮不上忙了
Well, I'm not going to be any help there

389
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,890
因为我总是找不到钥匙
because I can never find my keys.

390
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,920
好笑  我们直接砸门算了
Hilarious. Or we could just break it off.

391
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,260
正好这里有个灭火器
There's an extinguisher right here.

392
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,460
好  好主意
Yeah, good idea.

393
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,090
不  我们不能使用暴力
No, no. We shouldn't have to use force.

394
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,070
这条游戏规则我之前忘记告诉你们了  我的错
That's actually the one rule I forgot to tell you. My bad.

395
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,600
干得好  -真棒
- Good one. - Great.

396
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,000
你还真是个破坏王啊
You're really good at breaking stuff, huh?

397
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,940
这个是塑料的
It's plastic.

398
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,640
又怎么了？
What was that?

399
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,010
是刚才那个声音  对吗？
That's that same sound, right?

400
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,010
兄弟  你刚才都干了什么
 Man, what the hell did you just do?

401
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,650
该死
Oh, shit.

402
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,120
该死  这像是真的
Oh, shit, that looks real.

403
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,990
这只是为了吓唬我们
They're just trying to give us a scare

404
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,990
就是那个所谓的沉浸式体验
as part of the immersive experience.

405
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,760
搞什么  你是他们的托儿吗?
What the hell, are they paying you?

406
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,360
不是  我只是知道怎么才好玩
No, I just know how to have fun, I guess.

407
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,960
你觉得中暑好玩是吗?
Heat stroke is your idea of fun?

408
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,430
越来越热了
It's getting warm.

409
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,660
好了  也没那么糟  只要脱了外套就好
Hey, it's not that bad. Just take off your jacket.

410
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,640
谁还不知道要脱外套?
Hey, does anyone else have a problem with this?

411
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,270
各位  我想我找到钥匙了
Hey, guys, I think I've got the key.

412
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,240
等等  听着  小东西
Listen, short stuff...

413
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,180
在你冒冒失失
let's talk about this before you bring tiki torches

414
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,300
搞出大事之前我们先谈谈  好吗?
- out of the walls, okay?

415
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,610
别急  她找到钥匙了
- Hold on now. She's got a key.

416
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:59,180
就插进去试试呗
Why don't we stick it in the keyhole?

417
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,020
好  行  行  是我不好  试试吧
Okay, yeah. My bad. Let's try it.

418
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,150
来试试  快
Give it a shot, come on.

419
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,230
请您就座稍后会有人接待
Please have a seat. Someone will be with you shortly.

420
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,500
这个也太诡异了
Well, that's creepy as hell.

421
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,710
好  我去接  让开

432
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,570

Oh, shit.

433
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,740
不  -是我干的吗？

434
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,210
不  到底是怎么回事？
No, no. What the literal hell?

Please stop. Okay, I'm done.

436

No, no. You're stressing everyone out here, okay?

437
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,750
先去找点水喝  然后把外套脱了
Just go get some water and take off your damn jacket.

438
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,590
我们得想办法离开这个大烤箱
We've got to find a way out of this Easy-Bake Oven.

439
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,660
看着我  阿曼达
Okay, look at me, look at me. Amanda.

440
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,390
该死
Oh, shit.

441
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,230
那是风扇吗？ 它在吹热风吗？
Are those fans? Are they blowing hot air?

442
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,800
去找点水喝  知道吗？
We'll just get some water, okay?

443
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,100
你跟我去接水吧
Come and get some water with me.

444
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,270
我还好
I'm fine. Okay.

00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,540
好吧  越来越热了
Yeah, it's getting hot,

446
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,370
不过也没发生什么
but nothing is going to happen to us.

447
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,970
烤箱都有风扇  -是啊  那又怎么样
Ovens have fans. - True, but so what?

448
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,310
去找已发布的规则吧

449
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,780
我才不管什么已发布的规则
I don't care about the posted rules.

450
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,540
窗边可能凉快一点
It might be colder by the windows.

451
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,950
我快烧着了
I'm burning up.

452
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,020
快点  想想怎么出去？
Come on, how do we get out of here?

453
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,560
你这么傻坐着能想出什么来
 You're not going to solve anything by sitting on your ass.

454
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,330
我没傻坐着  我手扶着膝盖沉思呢
I'm not sitting on my ass. I'm on my hands and knees.

455
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,930
你们三个在干吗？ 快找线索  快

It's too hot. What do you want me to do?

姑娘们  快  水喝够了吧

快来帮忙找线索
Get over here and help us look.

459
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,440
我们得先弄清楚线索是什么
We just have to figure out what the clue meant.

460
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,270
等等  这是什么？
Hold on. What's this?

461
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,240
哪有游戏会这么玩啊
There's no way this is part of the game.

462
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,080
线索都在哪里？
Where are all the clues at, huh?

463
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,140
大家快点  这里越来越热了
Guys, come on. It's getting hot in here.

464
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,910
我们总得想办法把这门打开
We've got to find something to break this door open.

465
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,150
老兄  我们不能使用暴力
Dude, we're not supposed to use force.

466
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,220
开门啊
Come on!

467
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,020
有完没完了？ 怎么才能出去？
When is this over? How do we get out?

468
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,960
越来越热了  我们会被活活烤死的
It's getting hotter. We're being baked alive.

469
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,490
各位  放松点
Guys, relax.

470
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,090

你们还想我怎么样？ 我什么也看不见啊
What do you want me to do? I can't see anything.

473
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,170
各位  我们得集中精神寻找线索
 Guys, we need to focus and find the clues.

474
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,940
我感觉这里有六十多度
It's like 150 degrees in here.
<i>（译者注：150华氏度≈65.56摄氏度）</i>

475
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,340
佐伊  那幅画
Hey. Hey, Zoey, the painting.

476
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,040
我的天  那里有个出口
Oh, my God. There's an exit.

477
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,810
老天爷  快看那边
Oh, hot dog, look at that.

Zoey, do that again. Whatever you did, just do it again.

各位  这是通风口  也许能出去
Hey, guys, it's a duct. It could be a way out.

480
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,760
大家看  这里还有很多杯垫
Guys, there are more coasters here.

481
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,260
快启动杯垫
Get on the coasters.

482

大家试着同时按下杯垫
Everyone try pressing down at the same time.

483
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,860
天啊  连桌子都是烫的
God, even the table's hot.

484
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,500
开了？ 我们是不是赢了？ -是的

Wait, you're not going to just leave us

487
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,940
你不会自己跑路吧
with our dicks in our hands.

488
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,050
那有谁希望让这位替我探路？
Does anybody prefer this guy go instead of me?

489
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,450
我就知道没有  -是吗？
- That's what I thought. - Really?

490
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,430
这是通往哪里的？
Where does it go?

491
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:34,400
里面有多长？ -特别特别长
- How deep does it go?- It goes pretty far.

492
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,030
我的老天啊
Jesus Christ.

493

还有下一个密室吗？ -杰森？
- The next room? - Jason?

497
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,680
我好像找到出口了  不过有铁丝网挡着
Hey, I think I found a way out! It's blocked by a grate.

498
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,550
迈克  把那把螺丝刀给我  -好  在我口袋里

Hey, hey. Just think of it like interactive dinner theater.

507

我的老天  你说什么废话呢
Jesus Christ, you're not helping me here, man.

00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,970
加油  -好的
- Come on. - Okay.

541
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,050
她出去了  走走走  快
She's clear. Go, go, go. Come on.

542
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,550
快点  你个混蛋  求你了
Come on, you son of a bitch, please.

543
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,880
快快快
Come on, come on, come on.

544
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,920
阿曼达？ 阿曼达  我来了
Amanda? Amanda, I'm here.

545
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,660
好了  满了
Okay. Good.

546
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,920
怎么了？ 你能呼吸  你没被困住
What's wrong? You can breathe. You're not stuck.

547
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,690
跟我呼吸  一  二
Breathe in with me. One, two...

548
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,500
再来两杯
Two more.

549
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,530
这不是真的  这不是真的
This is not real. You're not stuck.

550
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,900
好  没事的  我在这里  好吗？ 我拉着你的手呢
You're okay. I'm here, okay? I'm holding your hand.

551
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,710
我保证哪里也不去  你没事的
I promise I'm right here. You're okay.

552
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,940
好了  再来一杯  再来一杯就行
Okay, we need one more. We just need one more.

553
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,840
该死  我们没水了
Shit, we're out of water.

554
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,210
那现在怎么办啊？
What are we supposed to do now?

555
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,210
我怎么知道？ 你才是逃脱专家
How would I know? You're the expert here.

556
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,380
马上就到了  马上就到了  我保证
We're really close. We're really close, I promise.

557
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,550
这都要怪你  知道吗
This is all your fault, you know.

558
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,020
什么？ -都怪你触发烤箱
- What? - You're the reason

559
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,450
阿曼达才会把线索都喝光
that Amanda drank all of our clues.

560
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,420
杰森就在那边  好吗？
Jason's right there, okay?

561
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,130
那时候我怎么知道这个饮水机
How was I supposed to know that the water cooler was...

562
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,630
不
Oh, no.

563
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,800
这下完蛋了  -怎么会这样？
- Well, that's not good. - What the fuck?

564
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,140
我的酒瓶
My flask. My flask.

565
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,110
你一直揣着这玩意吗？
You've had that the whole time?

566
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,320
我的天
Oh, my God.

567
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,150
快点  好了
Come on! Yes. Yes.

568
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,160
你想被烧死吗？ 快走
Do you want to burn to death? Let's go!

569
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,510
真见鬼
What the hell?

570
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:20,150
老天  这就是真实感啊
Oh, Jesus. Talk about immersive.

571
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:23,480
什么真实感？ 你是不是脑子坏掉了？ 这就是真的
Immersive? What the hell is wrong with you? That was real!

572
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:26,320
这只是一种干扰而已  -你在开玩笑吗  老弟？
- They're just messing with us. - Are you kidding me, dude?

573
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,290
听着  我出来之后才爆炸的
Look, it went off right as I cleared it.

574
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,390
懂吗  应该是我触发了什么机关
Okay, I must have triggered it.

575
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,360
游戏大师就是想让我们觉得像死里逃生
The Games Master wants us to think we barely made it.

576
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,960
不可能只有我觉得不对
I can't be the only one.

577
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,500
奖金有一万呢  我可不认输
Hey. It's ten grand and I don't lose.

578
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,170
我退出  行吗？
Well, I'm out, okay?

579
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,670
你们好  够了
Hi. Okay, I'm done.

580
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,570
我不玩了  你们立刻让我走
I want out. You let me out of here now!

581
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,810
我们现在是不是正在被监视？
You think they're watching us right now?

582
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:49,680
得了吧  塞尚锁具公司
- Come on. - "Sai-San lock and co."

583
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,140
好吧  还得再找一把钥匙
All right, so we need another key.

584
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,710
你手机给我  我要报警
Give me your phone. I'm calling the cops.

585
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,980
你先回想一下  好吗？
Think about it for a second, okay?

586
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,580
到现在为止我们出事了吗？
What has actually happened to us so far?

587
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,420
没有  你跟警察怎么说？
Nothing. What will you tell the cops?

588
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,890
怎么说  我就说我们被关进巨型烤箱
I don't know, maybe that they locked us

589
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,650
差点被人烤了吃
in a giant oven and tried to cook us.

590
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,120
这种游戏是经常有喷火环节吗？
Is open flame a common occurrence in these things?

591
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,290
不经常有  -原来不经常有
- Not really. - Not really.

592
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,890
把你手机给我
Give me your goddamn phone.

593
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,960
你真的有手机  你是怎么带进来的？
You do have a phone. How did you get a phone in here?

594
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,070
我偷带进来的
I snuck it in.

595
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,170
没有信号  -猜到了
- There's no signal. - Typical.

596
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:18,410
很正常  毕竟我们是在混凝土大楼里
Well, yeah. We're in a giant concrete building.

597
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:21,070
各位  我们能逃出去的  你们看看这里
Guys, we can figure this out. I mean, look at this place.

598
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,040
我想说  这里再来杯热巧克力就是度假小屋啊
I mean, the only thing missing is the hot chocolate.

599
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:26,250
好吧  那你说这游戏得玩多久？
All right, how long do you think this game is going to last?

600
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:29,050
我也不知道  我有一次玩过有五个密室的
I mean, I don't know. I did one that had, like, five rooms once.

601
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,990
五个吗？
Five?

602
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:33,620
五个密室这么多？ 好吧
Five rooms? Okay.

603
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:37,130
好吧  所以刚才那种事还得再来四次
Okay. So, that means we just need to do that four more times.

604
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,460
开个玩笑  好了各位  我们能行
I'm kidding. Come on, guys, we can do this.

605
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,100
刚才那是目前最难的
That was the hardest roomby far, right?

606
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,800
最难的都放第一关  对吗  丹尼？
They front-loaded it, right, Danny?

607
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,770
对  毕竟对他们来说每个密室
Yeah. I mean, I'm sure they can't afford

608
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,130
都烧一次也太费钱了
to light every room on fire.

609
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,770
就是嘛  看看这里
Exactly. Look at it.

610
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,870
都是木头  一点就着啊
This place is a goddamn tinder box.

611
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:55,070
这里有第二把锁  各位
Hey. Hey, second lock, guys.

612
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,110
密码是一个七个字母的单词
It looks like we need a seven-letter word.

613
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,880
要不我们分头行动  去找线索吧
Let's spread out and see what we can find.

614
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,120
好的
Okay.

615
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:16,200
你一定会被载入史册
"You'll go down in history."

616
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,300
这有什么含义吗？ 
What about this? Could that mean something?

617
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,970
你一定会被载入史册
"You'll go down in history."

618
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:22,600
你一定会被载入史册
You'll go down in history. You'll go down in history.

619
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:24,710
会是某个总统的名字吗？ 也许是总统姓氏
Maybe a president's name? Maybe a president's last name.

620
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,770
哪个总统的姓氏有七个字母？
What presidents have a seven-letter last name?

621
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:30,040
麦迪逊  杰克逊  林肯  约翰逊  哈丁
Madison, Jackson. Lincoln, Johnson, Harding.

622
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,710
慢点说  小雨人  -你太没礼貌了
- Whoa. Slow down there, Rain Man. - That's offensive.

623
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,580
第一个是什么？ 麦迪逊
What was the first one? Madison.

624
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:40,350

00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,990
不对  没有反应  还有什么来着？
No, that didn't work. What was another one?

627
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,830
约翰逊  -约翰逊吗  好  约翰逊
- Johnson. - Johnson. Okay, Johnson.

628
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:53,030
J-O-H-N-S-O-N.

629
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,200
不对  还有呢？
No, what else?

630
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,500
对了  杰克逊
Yeah, Jackson.

631
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,500
 J-A-C-K-S-O-N.

632
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,650
下一个是什么来着？
What's the next name?

633
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,840
试试林肯  林肯  -林肯吗？
Try Lincoln. Lincoln. - Lincoln?

L-I-N-C-O-L-N.

635
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:05,250
这边有字母  但是有九个
There are letters here, but there are nine.

636
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,880
不行  还是打不开
No, that doesn't work either.

不会再那么吓人了
No more scary shit.

651
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,560
你还好吗？
are you okay?

652
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,690
我还好  没事
Yeah, fine.

653
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,260
看看  一会儿热一会儿冷的
 Look at this, going from hot to cold.

654
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,070
这样最容易生病
You know, that's how you get sick.

655
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,320
我有个傻问题  这真是户外吗？
Dumb question.Are we outside...

656
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:54,260
还是我出现幻觉了？
or am I stone-cold tripping?

657
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,460
我也搞不清楚  老兄  这里太冷了
I don't know, man. This place is really cold.

658
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:04,800

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,230
这游戏真好玩  是吧？
Real fun game, huh?

660
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,840
有人吗  
Echo!

661
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,540
这地方简直太荒唐了
This whole place is bullshit.

662
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,940
我们得快点找到出口
The sooner we figure this out,

663
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,140
才能早点离开这里
the sooner we get the hell of out here.

664

这里太美了  天啊

我倒想在这儿多待一会儿
I could hang out in here for a while.

666
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,020
这里像个滑冰场
It's like ice skating.

667
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,750
滑向广阔的天地吧  丹尼  -小心点
- Into the great wide open, Danny! - Be careful.

668
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,090
去吧  老弟  探探路
Keep going, man. Check it out.

669
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,330
你要去哪里？ -让他去看看
Yeah, where are you going? - Let him figure it out.

670

各位？ -大家都别动
Guys? - Hey, nobody move.

671
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:44,600
行了  各位  放松点  好吗？ 没事的  看
Come on, guys. Relax, okay? It's fine. Look.

672
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,640
别这么干
Hey, don't do that.

673
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,040
刚才只是音效
It's just a sound effect.

674
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,310
冰面没有裂开
The ice isn't cracking.

675
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,840
他们正看着呢
They are watching to make sure

676
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,180
不会让我们出什么意外的
nothing bad happens to us.

677
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,950
要是真有人受伤
I mean, can you imagine the lawsuits

678
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,980
知道他们会吃多少官司吗？
if one of us actually got hurt?

679
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:58,360
得学会笑对人生啊各位  真是
Learn to have some fun in your life. Jeez.

680
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,590
这设计者简直是艺术家
Whoever did this is an artist.

681
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,330
怎么回事？
What is that?

682
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,060
丹尼  快回来  -回这边来  快  丹尼
- Danny, come on back. - Get over here. Hurry up, Danny.

683
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,300
该死
Shit.

684
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,300
通风口正在喷冷风
There's freezing air coming through those vents.

685
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,430
快点  丹尼
Come on, Danny!

686
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,870
丹尼  快点回来
Danny, get back here.

687
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,870
我回来了
Okay. I'm coming. I'm coming.

688
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:20,470
见鬼  真的太冷了  -我们靠在一起能暖和点
- Shit, that is cold. - Get together for body heat.

689
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,140
这风冷死我了  -挨紧点
- Oh, the air is freezing. - Stay close.

690
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,850
这真是厉害了  -他们干吗要这么玩？
- This is awesome. - Why are they doing this?

691
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:28,680
快  再挨紧点  -老天  太冷了
Come on, get closer. - Oh, my God, that's cold.

692
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,990
我们该去找找线索
We should look for clues.

693
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,230
有人吗？
Hello?

694
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,610
开门
Open, open, open.

695
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,750
要不你也看看？ -好
- Yeah, do you want to look? - Yeah.

696
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,460
没有真正的北方
"True north is a lie."

697
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,540
你在看什么呢？
What are you looking at?

698
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,480
乖狗狗
Good boy.

699
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,580
我发现一扇门  得找把小钥匙
Hey, I found a door. We need a small key.

700
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,720
这外套哪里来的？
Where did that come from?

701
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,590
六个人  就找到这一件？
One coat for six people?

702
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,760
看出他们打什么主意了吧？
You know what they're trying to do, right?

703
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,600
他们要我们互相争抢有限的资源  我的天啊
They want us to fight over limited resources. Jesus Christ.

704
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,730
臭混蛋们
Hey. Hey, assholes.

705
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,070
这次你们别想得逞  懂吗？
It's not going to work this time, okay?

706
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,470
我们会轮着穿
We're going to share it.

707
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:59,280
佐伊  你先穿
Zoey, you go first.

708
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,640
谢谢
Thank you.

709
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,830
该死  水怎么这么冷  -本
Shit, that's cold. - Ben.

710
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,330
该死  冻死我了
Shit! Oh, that's cold.

711
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:28,340
虚惊一场  大家别怕
Hey, false alarm, everybody.

712
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,500
这垂钓用的洞这么大  你没看见吗？
A giant fishing hole. How did you miss that?

713
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,410
这个洞有什么用呢？
What are we supposed to do with this?

714
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,910
水底下可能有线索
There could be a clue at the bottom.

715
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:36,740
是吗？ 那你怎么不潜下去找找？
Oh, really? Why don't you go dive in and check?

716
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,950
好吧  虽然我觉得这游戏世界第一好玩
Okay, it just feels like I'm playing

717
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:41,780
但队友也是世界第一嘴贱
the world's funnest game with the world's meanest people.

718
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,280
该死  我的腿都冻麻了
I can't feel my goddamn leg.

719
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:46,990
各位  -迈克？
- Hey, guys. - Mike?

720
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:51,220
看  我找到了
Look, I've got it.

721
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:53,560
我找到线索了
I mean, I've got something.

722
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,200
刚刚大概是
I just climbed a tree for, like,

723
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,060
我这辈子第一次爬树
the first time in my goddamn life.

724
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,570
丹尼  这东西应该有用吧
Danny, tell me this is something we can use.

725
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,970
有用  绝对是线索
Yeah, totally. It's a clue.

726
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:04,200
总算啊  该我表现表现了
Finally, something I'm good at.

727
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:07,640
你是要表现怎么拿着棍子站在洞口吗？
You mean you can stand over a hole and hold a stick?

728
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,810
有你在真给力
Wow, thank God you're here.

729
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:11,710
我知道你现在很冷
I understand you're cold right now,

730
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,510
可你要是再敢
but if you say something disrespectful to me

731
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,480
对我说这种不尊敬的话  我就替你父母履行
like that again... I'm going to give you

732
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,420
未尽的管教义务了
the slap your parents should have years ago.

733
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,020
是吗？ -回得真漂亮
Oh, really? - That's amazing.

734
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,620
我乐意效劳
With pleasure.

735
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,390
那我们现在怎么办
So, what are we supposed to do now,

736
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,790
难道就站在这里等线索上钩吗？
just stand here and wait to catch a clue?

737
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,660
这水可能非常深
Well, it's probably really deep.

738
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,300
<i>（译者注：20英尺=6.096米）
是  钓鱼线已经放下六米了
Yeah, I'm about 20 feet down already.</i>

739
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,830
什么都看不见
I can't even see.

740
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,670
这就是浪费时间
This is a waste of time.

741
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,970
你觉得是浪费时间吗？
 You think this is a waste of time?

742
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,500
对  -真是要冻死人了
Yeah. - It's so goddamn cold.

743
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,170
我觉得这就是干扰设置
I do. I think it's a distraction.

744
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:41,040
这整套游戏都是浪费时间
I think this whole thing is a waste of time.

745
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,880
这根钓鱼竿可是我费了老大劲儿
I climbed up to the top of that tree.

746
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,410
爬到树顶上才发现的
I found a fishing rod up there.

747
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,080
真正的北方
True north.

748
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,420
什么？
What?

749
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,290
你到底想告诉我什么呢？
What are you trying to tell me?

750
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,330
没有真正的北方
True north is a lie.

751
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,470
他们可能正一边看着我们  像傻子一样围在洞口
They're probably watching us, laughing their asses off,

752
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:09,940
以便使劲儿嘲笑我们呢
as we stand around a hole like a bunch of morons.

753
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,200
可能再等等就有了  -去你的吧
- We probably just have to wait. - Oh, screw that, man.

754
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,540
这个给我  迈克  给我  迈克  快给我
Give me this, Mike. Mike, give me the pole!

755
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,880
你能不能冷静点？
Why don't you chill out, man?

756
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,140
你根本就不会钓鱼
You don't know what you're doing, man.

757
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:18,640
缠线架都没打开
You don't even have the release open.

758
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:19,810
不要放线
Don't let it out.

759
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,650
你得让钓线垂到水底
You've got to drop it to the bottom.

760
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,760
见鬼  这么深
Shit, that's deep.

761
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,300
不管了  给  你拿吧
Screw this. Here, take this.

762
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,400
把它还给我
Give me that back.

763
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,530
对不起  我只是
I'm sorry, all right? I just

764
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:42,400
太冷了  我快被冻疯了
I hate the cold and it makes me go crazy.

765
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:44,270
以前冬天我都在夏威夷过
I have to spend every winter in Kauai.

766
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:46,780
真巧啊  我还去法国南部过冬呢
Me, too. When I'm not in the South of France.

767
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,410
佐伊穿着外套去哪里了？
Hey, where's Zoey with that jacket?

768
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:53,780
我得穿会儿外套
I need that jacket.

769
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,730
就是它
Yes.

770
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:14,200
你能别在我旁边抽烟吗？
Hey, you mind not smoking that around me?

771
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,010
收线  我找到线索了
Pull up the line. I found something.

772
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,750
快把线拉上来  -什么？
- Pull up the line. - What?

773
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,950
各位  我找到线索了
Everyone, I found something.

774
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,480
你找到什么了
What do you got there?

775
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:32,690
又一条线索？ 厉害啊  佐伊
Another clue? Impressive, Zoey.

776
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:35,090
是什么？ -来吧
- What is it? - Okay.

777
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:37,660
是磁铁  原来如此  -别急
- A magnet, of course. - I'm with you. Okay, okay.

778
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,990
好了  快试试
Okay, try it. Try it now.

779
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,530
往后退
All right, all right. Stand back.

780
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:46,700
下去了
There she goes.

781
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,070
佐伊  外套该换人穿了
Zoey, your turn is up.

782
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:52,710
对  抱歉
Right. Sorry.

783
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,740
该死  好吧  它已经到底了
Oh, shit. Okay. I'm on the bottom.

784
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,980
不  有了
No, I'm hooked.

785
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,480
好的  有东西
All right, I've got something.

786
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,680
它吸上了
I've got something here.

787
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,050
没错  绝对吸上了
Yeah, I'm definitely hooked.

788
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:03,420
天啊
Oh, God.

789
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:07,650
真棒  -天啊  真重
- Nice. - God, that's heavy.

790
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,190
可以  我抓到了
 Okay. Okay, I've got it. I've got it.

791
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:10,930
你抓到了吗？
You've got it?

792
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:12,890
好像是一把钥匙
We've got a key or something.

793
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:14,830
上来了  好吧
You've got it. Okay.

794
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:16,930
这一定是那扇门的钥匙
 That's got to be the key to the door.

795
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:22,670
谁想的破游戏？ 一  二  三
- Who thinks of this shit? - One, two, three.

796
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:26,310
再来  一  二  三
Okay. One, two, three.

797
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,910
好吧  -该死  太结实了
- Okay. - Shit, that is solid.

798
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:36,020
本  打火机借一下  -对  这主意好
- Hey, Ben. We need your lighter. - Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.

799
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:39,690
借给你  我有什么好处？
What do I get in return?

800
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:42,690
你爱听单向乐队的唱片  以后我不跟你抢了
I won't take any of your One Direction CDs.

801
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:46,930
快拿来吧  老弟
Come on, just give it, man.

802
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,360
要打火机是吧？
All right, you want the lighter?

803
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,000
给
Here.

804
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,430
拿去吧
There you go.

805
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,810
算了  我去捡  -谢了  丹尼
- Okay, I'll get it. - Thanks, Danny.

806
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,810
钥匙冻在冰块正中间是吧？
Man, that is buried right in the center, isn't it?

807
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:06,580
顺便一提  不用谢
Oh, and you're welcome, by the way.

808
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:10,450
还真是多谢
Thanks a lot.

809
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:19,930
丹尼？
Danny?

810
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:25,670
怎么回事？ 怎么了？ 丹尼人呢？
What was that? What happened? Where's Danny?

811
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,030
你说话啊  他人呢？
Say something. Where is he?

812
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,540
他掉下去了
He just fell through.

813
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,140
他怎么会掉下去？
What do you mean, he fell through?

814
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,300
他在冰层下面
He's under the ice!

815
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:35,040
丹尼
Danny! Danny! Danny!

816
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,910
别慌  我下去救他
All right, I'm going in after him.

817
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:38,880
不行  冰层下面有暗流
No, no. There is a current under there.

818
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,150
你就算找到他
Even if you find him,

819
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:41,950
也不可能带他游回洞口
you will not make it back to the hole.

820
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:46,120
丹尼  你在哪里？
Danny, where are you?

821
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:49,930
他被水流卷到别处去了
He's being dragged around under there.

822
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,760
丹尼
Danny!

823
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,400
丹尼  你在哪里？
Danny, where are you?

824
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,500
丹尼  他去哪里了？ -谁看见他了？
- MIKE: Danny! Where did he go? - Do you see him?

825
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,640
我找不到他  -丹尼
- I can't see him. - Danny!

826
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:05,740
别吵
Shush, shush, shush! Shush!

827
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,920
天啊  丹尼  -他在哪里？
Oh, my God. Danny. - Where is he?

828
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,520
丹尼
Danny. Danny, Danny.

829
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,230
发生了什么？
What happened?

830
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:40,080
你说得对
You were right.

831
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,650
这游戏是真的
This is real.

832
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:52,260
怎么会这样？
How did it happen?

833
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,530
怎么会这样？ -什么？
- How did it happen? - What?

834
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:01,530
丹尼是怎么掉进去的？ 只有你看见了
How did Danny fall in? You're the only one who saw.

835
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:05,900
他就站在那里  然后冰面破了  他就掉下去了
He was there and then it exploded and then he fell.

836
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:09,400
是你把打火机扔给他的  你怎么就一点事都没有？
You threw him the lighter and somehow you're perfectly fine?

837
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:11,700
我扔到冰面那头去了  这样确实很过分
I threw it across the ice. I was just being an asshole.

838
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:14,370
你是正好扔到那里然后冰面正好就破了吗？
Yeah, you threw it to the exact spot that just happened to collapse?

839
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,840
你以为是我故意害他吗？
Are you saying that I did it?

840
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,550
这是你说的  我可没说
Yeah, hey, your words, not mine.

841
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,380
丹尼之前一直说什么游戏大师
Danny kept talking about a Games Master.

842
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,250
是啊  没准他就在我们中间
Yeah. Well, maybe he's already here.

843
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,890
什么游戏大师？ 我就是在杂货店里打杂的  好吗？
Games Master? I work at a grocery store, all right?

844
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:29,390
杰森才是我们当中
I mean, Jason's the one here

845
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:31,120
最像变态杀人狂的人
with the whole American Psycho vibe.

846
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:33,890
迈克  你就像躲在卡车休息站的怪胎
Mike, you're like the creep at the truck stop.

847
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,560
佐伊  真的对不起
And Zoey, I'm really sorry,

848
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,870
但我觉得你是那种会被父母锁在地下室
but it seems like your parents locked you in a basement

849
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:39,570
不写完作业不准出来的孩子
until you finished all your homework.

850
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:41,000
还有她  再看看她
And her. What about her?

851
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,670
她那些伤疤都是哪里来的？
I mean, where did she get all the scars?

852
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,200
来自伊拉克战争  混蛋
I served in Iraq, asshole.

853
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:46,110
所以你在军队待过？
Oh, so you've had military experience?

854
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:47,440
所以你才会这么像
So, that makes you like a...

855
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:52,080
疯子女战士
psycho Xena.

856
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,580
我只是想说  跟你们比  我才是最正常的
I'm just saying here, I'm, like, the least suspicious one.

857
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,280
这事就不是我的  够了  闭嘴
Okay, you know what? Shut up!

858
00:48:57,290 --> 00:49:00,050
这些都是废话  懂吗？
None of it matters, all right?

859
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:01,920
不管幕后黑手是谁  要是不想冻死在这里
Whoever did this to us will let us freeze to death,

860
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,790
我们就得把钥匙从冰块里取出来
if we don't get the key out of that ice.

861
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,230
好吧  既然本的打火机不见了
Okay. Since Ben's lighter is gone,

862
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:11,100
那我们就围住冰块尽量用体温融化它
we have to surround it with as much body heat as possible.

863
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,430
你只关心本的打火机不见了吗？
Ben's lighter is gone?

864
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:16,640
丹尼刚刚死了
Danny is dead.

865
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,910
你知道如果体温过低会怎么样吗？
Do you know what happens when you get hypothermia?

866
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,180
你会失去方向感  还有判断力
You get disoriented and confused.

867
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,850
我不在乎你有多聪明
And I don't care how smart you are

868
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:28,120
又或者读过多少书
or how many books you read,

869
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,850
反正你会忘掉你是怎么来的
you won't remember how you got here,

870
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:31,180
也不会知道该怎么逃出去
much less how to get out.

871
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:32,690
都给我到这边来
You guys get over here

872
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:34,690
把双手放到冰块上
and put your hands on this ice.

873
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:47,300
我知道很冷  但冰块在融化了
I know it's cold, but it's melting, guys.

874
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,070
加油  继续捂着就好
Come on, just keep your hands on it.

875
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:50,840
外套给你
Hey, jacket.

876
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:01,950
我来托一会儿吧  真够冷的
Let me take it for a minute. Oh, that's cold.

877
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:06,050
好  给你
Okay. Here.

878
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:22,070
你怎么样  迈克？
How are you doing there, Mike?

879
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:23,870
你懂的  -要休息会儿吗？
- Oh, you know. - Need a break?

880
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:26,140
不用  没事  我能行
Mm-mm. No, I got it.

881
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,910
我能行  谢谢
I'm okay. I'm okay. Thank you.

882
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:31,080
我就是想不通
I just can't figure it out.

883
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,180
这游戏是谁设计的？
Who would do this?

884
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,590
一个心思缜密  无所不知的人
Someone who thought of every detail.

885
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,510
迈克？ -迈克
- Mike? - Hey, Mike.

886
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:04,340
背靠着树
Hey, put your back against the tree.

887
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:06,480
没事的  我们在呢  知道吗？
No, I'm okay. - We're here, okay?

888
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:11,850
我们都在呢
Hey, we're here, we're here.

889
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:13,250
杰森？ -他要去哪里？
- Jason? - Where's he going?

890
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,050
他把钥匙拿走了  大家快起来  
He's got the key. You guys, come on.

891
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,990
快起来  好
- Get up, come on. - Okay.

892
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,930
门在哪里？ -杰森
- Where is it at? - Hey, Jason.

893
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:23,800
门在哪里？
Where's it at? Where's the door?

894
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,400
杰森  -放开我
- Jason! - Get off me!

895
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,870
门在哪里？
Where's the door?

896
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:31,740
那里有门吗？
There's a door?

897
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,970
快打开
Open it.

898
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:36,080
快把门打开
Open the goddamn door! Open up!

899
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,210
把门打开  把这该死的门打开
Open this door! Open the goddamn door!

900
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:44,120
你把门打开了
Hey, you did it, you opened a door.

901
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,720
快走  -杰森  我们走
- Move. - Jason! Let's go!

902
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,020
等等
Wait.

903
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:53,160
该死
Oh, shit!

904
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,030
等一下  佐伊  快点
Wait, wait. - Zoey, come on!

905
00:51:58,030 --> 00:51:58,970
你们等等我
Wait for me!

906
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:02,140
本
Ben!

907
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:10,880
大家都还好吗？
Hey, is everyone okay?

908
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,900
我的手脚都冻僵了
I can't feel my extremities.

909
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,350
<i>8号球
生啤
我的手脚都冻僵了
I can't feel my extremities.</i>

910
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:15,750
那是什么？
What is that?
<i>8号球
生啤</i>

911
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:16,650
那是什么？
What is that?

912
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:22,900
<i>8号球
台球室</i>

913
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:29,300
当然了
Sure, why not?

914
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,500
好吧
Well...

915
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:41,270
往好的方面看  至少这地方很暖和
glass half full, at least it's warm in here.

916
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,180
天啊
Oh, my God.

917
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,680
这是怎么了？
What's happening? What is that?

918
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,680
我们在移动吗？ -对  抓稳
- Are we moving? - Yeah. Hold on.

919
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:51,950
我们在上升吗？ -对
- What, are we going up? - Yeah.

920
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:53,850
米诺斯大厦有几层？
 How many floors is this building?

921
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,520
十五到二十层吧
15 to 20 floors.

922
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,460
我想应该不是送我们上来看风景的
Well, I'm guessing they didn't shoot us up here for the view.

923
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:22,980
好吧
Okay.

924
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:24,590
我们怎么上去接电话？
How are we supposed to answer that?

925
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:33,660
你好？
Hello?

926
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:39,170
真是一群混蛋
- Son of a bitch!

927
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:41,870
天啊  太刺耳了  疼死我了
God, that's loud. And it sucks.

928
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,910
真棒  我们会在电梯音乐声中死去
Oh, great, we're going to die to elevator music.

929
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:49,240
各位  上面这扇门没有把手
Guys, hey, this door up here doesn't have a handle.

930
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,680
看来得找个门把手
I think we're looking for a doorknob.

931
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,580
我们四处找找吧
Let's see what we can find.

932
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:56,880
<i>♪ Listen to the music
Of the traffic in the city ♪</i>

933
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,080
<i>♪ Linger on the sidewalk
The neon signs are pretty ♪</i>

934
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,500
<i>余无坦博士
♪ Linger on the sidewalk
The neon signs are pretty ♪</i>

935
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,890
<i>♪ Linger on the sidewalk
The neon signs are pretty ♪</i>

936
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:04,860
<i>♪ How can you lose
The lights are much... ♪</i>

937
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:08,560
八号球  台球桌上没有八号球
Hey, the eight ball, it's missing from the pool table.

938
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,000
你们看  我去看看球杆架
Look at that. I'm going to check these cue racks.

939
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,900
没准能找到什么有用的
Maybe there's something over here we can use.

940
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,970
迈克  停下  -迈克
- Hey. Mike, stop! - Mike! Mike!

941
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,470
快离开那里  找个东西抓住
Get away from the edge. Grab onto something.

942
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,440
我的老天  -迈克  退后
- Oh, Jesus Christ. - Mike, step back! Mike!

943
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:25,710
你们快回来  -别站在地板上
Guys, come on. - Hey, get off the floor!

944
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:29,480
迈克  快点  迈克  别站在地板上
Mike, hurry up! Mike, get off the floor.

945
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,050
该死  -你们看见了吗？
- Shit. - Did you see that?

946
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:34,450
这又是搞什么鬼？
What the hell's going on?

947
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:41,800
这到底是什么机关  抢椅子游戏吗？
What is this, like, musical chairs?

948
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:45,760
我们怎么办？
What do we do now?

949
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:48,070
还能怎么办  想办法活下去
I don't know, try not to die.

950
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:50,240
阿曼达  你要想清楚
Hey, Amanda, just think about this.

951
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,440
让我试一下
Just let me try this.

952
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,910
快快快
Go, go, go.

953
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:58,540
该死  -你还好吗？
- Oh, shit. - Are you okay?

954
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:01,950
还好  只是出汗了  该死
Yeah, it's just wet. Oh, shit.

955
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,020
好了  我继续
Okay, here I go.

956
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:10,790
试试关一下收音机？ 可能音乐就停了
Hey, what about the radio? Maybe it'll shut the music off.

957
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:12,330
不行  音乐不是这里传出来的
No, I don't think it's connected.

958
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,500
再看看上面那几台制冷机？
What about those coolers at the top?

959
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,800
好
Okay.

960
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,630
没准能找到门把手
Maybe the handle's in there.

961
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:21,700
别忘了顺便找找八号球
And keep your eyes peeled for that eight ball.

962
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,640
好的
Okay.

963
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:27,940
这个密室里面的摆设简直是太诡异了
Yeah, the craftsmanship in here is just terrifying.

964
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,980
我很不喜欢这个密室
I hate this room so much.

965
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,210
各位  这里有个保险箱
Guys, I've got a lock box.

966
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:34,980
好了
All right.

967
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:38,520
需要一个四位密码
It looks like I need four numbers.

968
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,320
好吧  试试一二三四  瞎猜一个
All right, try one-two-three-four. Just to see.

969
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,660
看来这是迈克的惯用密码
I guess we know Mike's PIN code.

970
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,800
不对
Nope.

971
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,930
好吧  再试试四个一
 All right. Try one-one-one-one.

972
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,500
我们从最简单的来吧
You know, go back to the basics.

973
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,470
什么？ 四个一吗？
What? One-one-one-one?

974
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,670
不对  还是打不开
Uh, nope. That's not it.

975
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:59,810
那是个巨型的滑块拼图
It's a giant sliding puzzle.

976
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,040
佐伊  -佐伊
- Zo? - Zoey?

977
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:05,810
佐伊  你要干什么？-佐伊
  - Zoey, what are you doing? - Zo?

978
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,820
小心点
Careful. Careful, careful, careful.

979
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,100
干得好  佐伊
Good job, Zo.

980
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,070
可以了  佐伊  站在那里就行
That's good, Zoey. Just stay there.

981
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:28,530
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

982
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:30,810
不能一直扒在这个书架上
I can't hang around on this bookshelf all day.

983
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,150
我不该动的  天啊
This was a bad idea. Oh, God.

984
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:42,580
好吧  一  二  三
Come on. One, two, three.

985
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:46,620
上去吧
Up you get.

986
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:47,790
谢谢
Thanks.

987
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:49,090
好了
Okay.

988
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,840
该死
Oh, shit!

989
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,770
我的天  真是见鬼
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, shit.

990
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,540
杰森  抓紧
Jason, hold on!

991
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:16,010
我没事  老天  我没事
I'm okay. I'm okay. Oh, God. I'm okay. Oh, God.

992
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,380
你还好吗？
Are you all right?

993
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:20,790
继续吧  我没事
Keep going. Keep going. I'm okay.

994
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:22,790
没关系  好的
He's okay. It's okay, he's okay.

995
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:24,660
你一定能行
You've got this. You've got this.

996
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:32,500
能不能想个办法把这破音乐给关了？
Is there anything we can do about this shitty music?

997
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:40,310
天啊
Oh, God!

998
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:41,570
我的老天爷啊
Oh, my God.

999
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:43,280
天啊
Jesus Christ.

1000
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:52,450
我拼好了
Hey, I've got it.

1001
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:53,690
什么？
What?

1002
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,960
我拼好了
Got it.

1003
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,660
那里有好多颜色  我看见黄色
There are colors. I see yellow...

黑色和蓝色
black, and blue.

1005
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,500
对对对  还有上下两道杠  中间夹个圆  杠和圆
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and we've got two lines and a circle.

1006
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:09,740
像摩斯密码  也许是摩斯密码
It's like Morse code. Maybe it's Morse code.

1007
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:12,640
两道杠夹个圆是台球的样子
Stripes and circles. They're billiard balls.

1008
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,840
带杠的黄色球是九号球
The yellow stripe, that's a nine.

1009
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,410
九  下一个数字
Nine. Next.

1010
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:19,110
那个黑圆圈明显是八号球  八号球
The black ball, like, that's the eight ball, obviously.

1011

八  还有两位  -带杠的蓝色球 是十号球
- Eight. Two more. - Blue stripe, that's ten.

1013
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:26,520
一  零  真见鬼了
- One-zero. Goddamn it.

1014
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,620
该死

1015
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,760

坚持住  好吗？
Hold on, okay?

1019
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:49,410
那架子支撑不了你们三个人
That thing's not going to hold all three of you.

1020
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:51,410
迈克  你先下去  -下哪里去？

各位   都坚持住  好吗？
Guys, just hang on, okay?

1023
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,380

1024
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,720
迈克  看着我  你必须从那个书架上下去
Mike, look at me. Get off the goddamn shelf

1025
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,320

Yeah, my cousin is deaf. They must have known about that, too.

1210
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:30,710
这间密室里有没有心电图测量仪？
Is there an EKG machine here somewhere?

1211
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,710
你在干什么？
Hey, what are you doing?

1212
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:36,650
根据量子芝诺效应
Quantum Zeno effect. Atoms won't change

1213
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:38,520
原子在被持续观测时不会发生衰变
if you take continuous measurements...

1214
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,190
所以只要他们一直监视我们
so as long as they're watching us,

1215
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:41,590
我们就改变不了命运
we can't change our state.

1216
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:43,560
这游戏永远设定成他们赢
The game is designed so they always win.

1217
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:49,560
好好好  可现在我们真的需要你帮助
Okay, okay. We could really use your help right now.

1218
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,360
不   我们可以找到别的出路
No. We can find another way out.

1219
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:52,770
现在有什么出路都不知道
We don't even know the first way out.

1220
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:55,100
别乱砸东西了  深呼吸冷静一下
Just stop smashing shit and take a deep breath.

1221
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:57,270
您是否有足够强壮的心脏愿意让余无坦博士
Do you have the heart to let Dr. Wootan Yu...

1222
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:59,370
帮你进行改造
help you become a better you?

1223
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:01,940
佐伊  你得冷静下来
Hey, Zoey, you need to calm down.

1224
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:03,940
<i>有毒</i>

1225
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:06,410
三分钟之后  他们会毒死我们
In three minutes, they're going to poison us.

1226
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:08,410
我们已经没时间了  你快冷静下来
We are running out of time here. You've got to calm down.

1227
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:10,150
你们都别跟我说什么冷静  好吗？
Stop telling me to calm down, okay?

1228
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:12,120
你们根本就不听我说话
You're not listening to me!

1229
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:16,950
你们看  心电图测量仪  它可能就是出去的关键
You guys, it's an EKG machine. Maybe this is our way out.

1230
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,890
本  把T恤脱掉  -为什么是我？
 - Ben, take your shirt off. - What? Why me?

1231
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:21,790
因为这是下一条线索  就这样
Because it's the next clue, that's why.

1232
01:11:21,790 --> 01:11:23,460
快点  就用它测个心率
Come on, it's just an EKG machine.

1233
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:26,560
不  这个鬼地方什么东西都没那么简单
No, no. Nothing is just anything in this hellhole.

1234
01:11:26,570 --> 01:11:28,400
心率够高应该就能出去  本
The right heart rate could open a door, Ben.

1235
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:31,240
我们快没时间了  -快点
- We're running out of time. - Hurry up.

1236
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,170
测就测  来吧
Just do it. Come on.

1237
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:39,150
快点  按住  深呼吸
Come on. Hold those, hold those. Take a breath, take a breath.

1238
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:44,500
你的心率太低
Your heart rate's too low. Your heart rate's too low.

1239
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:46,800
<i>失败</i>

1240
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,820
这根本就没用
It's not working.

1241
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:50,290
你换别人来测吧
Somebody else has to do it.

1242
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:52,760
迈克  心率得高点才行  换你来测
Mike, we need a higher rate. You've got to go.

1243
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:53,350
佐伊
Zoey

1244
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:56,100
什么？ 我又不是小白鼠  要测你自己测
What? I'm not your guinea pig, man. You do it. You try it.

1245
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:57,660
本测了没事  老兄  快
Look. Ben is fine, man. Come on,

1246
01:11:57,660 --> 01:11:59,860
不行再换我  我们要高心率  快点
I'll go next. We need a higher rate. Come on.

1247
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:01,000
你简直是疯了
You're going crazy.

1248
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:01,870
行  我来
All right, let's do it.

1249
01:12:01,870 --> 01:12:04,240
佐伊求你了  你就听我说两句
Zoey, please, just listen to me for two seconds.

1250
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,040
该死
Shit.

1251
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:12,580
这屋子是铜墙铁壁  够了  你这么乱砸没用的
We're in a metal box. Come on, that's not going to help.

1252
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,950
别砸东西了  来帮帮我
Just stop smashing shit and help me.

1253
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:20,280
再高点  快
Higher, higher, higher. Come on!

1254
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:21,150
佐伊  求你了
Zoey, please.

1255
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:22,220
不
- No.

1256
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:24,320
挑战极限  打开新世界的大门
Open new doors by testing your limits.

1257
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:26,490
他说挑战极限
Testing your limits. Testing your limits.

1258
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:27,860
你得挑战心率的极限  -你开玩笑
- We need a higher rate. - You're kidding me.

1259
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:28,960
我现在慌得不行
Man, I'm already freaking out here.

1260
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,490
心率早到极限了
My heart rate's sky high.

1261
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,030
难道再来个立卧撑跳还是开合跳？
Want me to do some burpees, jumping jacks?

1262
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:33,360
你还想让我怎么样？
What do you want me to do?

1263
01:12:33,370 --> 01:12:35,400
你用这个吧  -你疯了吧？
- We've got these. - What are you, insane?

1264
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,600
海岸警卫队找到我的时候  我都快死了
When the Coast Guard found me dying from hypothermia...

1265
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:41,010
因为我体温太低  心脏都快停跳了
my heart was half dead, man.

1266
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:42,640
是这个  把我给救回来的
These are what they used to bring me back.

1267
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,840
医生就是用这个  
Come on, this is what they used.

1268
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,340
不  这不行
No, no. That is not an option.

1269
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:47,110
好了听着  心率是线索  他们把它放在我的病房
Listen, it is a clue. They put it in my room

1270
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:48,710
因为他们知道我能想到这一点  迈克
because they knew I would know, Mike.

1271
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,880
你的心率已经很高了  男人点儿  来吧
Your heart's already high. Man up, come on.

1272
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,450
你开什么玩笑? 拿开
Are you kidding me? Get these away from me.

1273
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:55,220
迈克  看着我
Mike, Look at me, goddamn it! Look at me!

1274
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:57,590
再过一分钟  他们就要放毒气了
In one minute, they're about to poison us.

1275
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:59,590
我们都会窒息而死
And we are going to suffocate, all right?

1276
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:01,330
氧气会一点一点耗光
We're going to run out of breathable air,

1277
01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:02,460
就像你当初被困在矿井里那样
just like you did in that mine.

1278
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:03,560
该死
Shit.

1279
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:05,230
你想想你弟弟卡尔
You think about your brother, Cal.

1280
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:09,500
他叫卡尔对吧？ 现在你可以赎你的罪了
Cal was his name, right? This is your time.

1281
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,210
迈克  只有你能救我们
Mike, you can save us.

1282
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:15,910
只有你能救我们  迈克
This is it. You could save us, Mike.

1283
01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:17,840
现在  救我们  -好吧
- Now, save us. - Okay.

1284
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,850
动手吧  动手啊  快点  动手
Do it. Do it, do it quick! Come on, do it!

1285
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:26,920
杰森  你在干什么？ 
Jason, what are you doing?

1286
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:29,190
不
No. No.

1287
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:32,260
不  住手  你走开
- Hey, don't. Stop! - Get off me!

1288
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:37,100
你会杀了他的
You're going to kill him!

1289
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,500
<i>失败</i>

1290
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:39,330
不能失败
- Come on!

1291
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:41,830
迈克？ 你干了什么？
Mike? What did you do?

1292
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,400
他没呼吸了  迈克
He stopped breathing! Mike!

1293
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:48,000
醒醒  迈克  住手
Wake up! Mike. Hey, stop! Stop!

1294
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:48,800
您是否有足够强壮的心脏
Do you have the heart to

1295
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,500
再来
Come on!

1296
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,180
愿意让余无坦博士
let Dr. Wootan Yu...

1297
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:50,900
醒醒  迈克
Come on, Mike!

1298
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,200
帮您进行改造
help you become a better you?

1299
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:54,750
挑战极限  打开新世界的大门
Open new doors by testing your limits.

1300
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:55,910
挑战极限
Testing your limits.

1301

High and low. High and low.

1302

见鬼  该死
Goddamn it. Fuck!

1303
01:14:09,930 --> 01:14:10,830
该死
Oh, shit.

1304
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:13,970
我不懂该怎么急救
I don't actually know how to do this.

1305
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,640
你现在还想干什么？
What the hell are you doing?

1306
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:20,040
挑战极限  也许他们要的是最低心率
Extremes. Maybe they mean the low end.

1307
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,700
<i>危险  请勿移动</i>

1308
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:29,350

Hey, come on.

1309
01:14:45,330 --> 01:14:46,700

Come on, man.

1310
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:50,340

The door. The door is opening. It opened.

1315
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:12,330
佐伊
Zoey. Hey!

1316
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:14,160
佐伊
Zoey!

1317
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:18,860
佐伊  快来  出路在那边
Zoey! Hey, come on. There's a way out.

1318
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:21,130
这个才是出路
This is the way out.

1319
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:23,200
你会窒息的  快点走
You'll suffocate, come on!

1320
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,170
你走
Just go!

1321
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:27,780
求你了  -你快走  
Please! - Just go!

1322
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,680
该死
Shit.

1323
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,490
我们该带她一起走的
We should have made her come with us.

1324
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:21,690
我们这是留她在那里等死
We just left her there to die.

1325
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:22,930
这是她自己选的
She made her decision.

1326
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:25,100
你怎么就这么冷血？
What the hell is wrong with you?

1327
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:26,700
刚才到底是怎么回事？
What happened back there?

1328
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:29,400
我保住了我们俩的命  不客气
I saved our asses. You're welcome.

1329
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:32,110
你杀了迈克
You killed Mike.

1330
01:16:35,410 --> 01:16:39,340
是整天不运动的生活习惯杀了他
Sitting on his ass 12 hours a day killed him.

1331
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:42,250
就算挺得过这间密室  他也挺不过下一间
If it wasn't that room, it would've been the next.

1332
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:47,550
你对人一向如此对不对？
So that's just something you do, isn't it?

1333
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:48,850
你朋友在船上是怎么死的？
Your friend on the boat?

1334
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:51,090
你想说什么  本？
What are you saying, Ben? Huh?

1335
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,690
有话直说吧
Use your words.

1336
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:59,460
你们两个人  只有一件外套
One jacket between the two of you.

1337
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:01,100
把你的外套给我
Give me your jacket!

1338
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:04,300
怎么就这么巧  他直接游走淹死了
It's pretty convenient that he just swam off and died.

1339
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:08,610
刨根问底对你没好处
You don't want to do this, man.

1340
01:17:08,610 --> 01:17:11,850
你之所以能幸存  根本不是因为幸运
You being the sole survivor had nothing to do with luck.

1341
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:15,080
承认吧
Admit it.

1342
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,050
是你杀了他  承认吧  就是你杀了自己的朋友
You killed him! Admit that you killed your friend.

1343
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:21,960
生还是死  是自己选的
Surviving is a choice!

1344
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:25,660
现在该你选了
- Make yours.

1345
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:32,800
睁大你的狗眼  好好找线索
Keep your eyes open and look for clues.

1346
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:37,800
有船舱门
Hey, it's a hatch.

1347
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:44,010
我们也只能打开了
I guess we just open it.

1348
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:45,810
我们就这么进去吗？
What are we letting in?

1349
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:49,380
行  进就进
Fine, I'll do it.

1350
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:53,050
好重  -少废话  再用点劲儿
It's heavy. - Come on, try harder.

1351
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:55,050
混蛋  我又不是天天泡健身房
Asshole, I don't go to the gym every day.

1352
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:56,490
真是见鬼
Goddamn it.

1353
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:06,570
用力
Come on, come on.

1354
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,610
我手上这是什么？
What's this shit on my hands?

1355
01:18:21,650 --> 01:18:23,550
我觉得不太对劲
I don't feel so good.

1356
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:31,520
他们在把手上涂了东西
They put something on the handle.

1357
01:18:31,530 --> 01:18:35,530
你在融化
Hey, you're melting. You're melting.

1358
01:18:35,530 --> 01:18:37,960
什么？ 你在融化
What? - You're melting.

1359
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:41,400
什么？ 等等  你看  上面有字
What? Wait. Look, look. It says something.

1360
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:45,470
想离开  请自便  但友情提示
"Feel free to leave, but may we note...

1361
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:48,910
最好还是先找到解药
it's best to find the antidote."

1362
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:51,510
这什么解药该怎么找？
How the hell are we supposed to do that?

1363
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:02,150
起来找解药  臭小子
Get up and look, goddamn it!

1364
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:05,420
还找什么解药  老兄？ 我们无论如何都得死
Who cares, man? We're going to die here anyway.

1365
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:07,860
我不会死的  我一定不会死
I'm not going to die. I'm not going to die.

1366
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:17,900
好吧
Okay.

1367
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:25,110
在哪里？ 快点  在哪里？
Where is it? Come on. Come on. Where is it?

1368
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:28,180
解药在哪里？ -在哪里？
- Where is this bastard? - Where is it?

1369
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,490
本
Ben. Ben.

1370
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:42,790
我找到了  -快给我
- I have the anti... - Give me that!

1371
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:01,120
这是我的
It's mine!

1372
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:41,950
该死
Shit.

1373
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:49,360
该死
Oh, shit.

1374
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:10,420
天啊
Oh, my God.

1375
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:15,890
好了  这里有十个数字  四个空位
Okay, I've got ten numbers, four spots.

1376
01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:17,490
要找到四位密码
I need a four-digit code.

1377
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:23,360
进入五号密室  各就各位
Entering room five. Stand by.

1378
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,660
已就位
Standing by.

1379
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:27,900
这里有两具尸体  完毕
We have two bodies. Over.

1380
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:30,700
收到
Copy.

1381
01:21:32,610 --> 01:21:36,410
二十分钟之内完成清理  完毕
20 minutes for disposal and cleanup. Over.

1382
01:21:36,410 --> 01:21:38,210
收到  通话结束
Copy. Out.

1383
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:44,780
看这个  这里有个氧气面罩
Look at that, the oxygen mask.

1384
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:46,950
她用这玩意能干什么？
What the hell was she going to do with that?

1385
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:48,550
呼吸  混蛋
Breathe, bitch!

1386
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:13,950
该死
Shit.

1387
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,000
<i>赢家</i>

1388
01:23:17,310 --> 01:23:19,940
你确实是匹黑马
Now, you were a dark horse.

1389
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:21,780
我原本赌杰森会赢
My money was on Jason.

1390
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:24,650
可你看这就是密室逃生的迷人之处
But, see, that's why these games are so fascinating.

1391
01:23:24,650 --> 01:23:26,480
也不知怎么  你就战胜了火焰
Somehow, after being burnt,

1392
01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:28,850
冰雪  毒药  残疾
frozen, poisoned, and crippled...

1393
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:32,460
只要再逃出这最后一个密室就算大功告成
you still managed to escape the final room.

1394
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:35,130
你想过自己还有这种潜力吗?
Did you ever think you had that in you?

1395
01:23:35,130 --> 01:23:38,500
这种勃发的冲劲儿以及才智？
That adrenaline, that drive?

1396
01:23:39,530 --> 01:23:42,300
坐吧  庆祝一下
Sit down. Celebrate.

1397
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:45,040
你总算做成了一件事
You won something for once.

1398
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:49,710
你就是设计这个杀人迷宫的神经病吗？
So, you're the psycho that designed this murder maze, huh?

1399
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:49,870
不  我是游戏大师
No, I'm the Games Master.

1400
01:23:49,870 --> 01:23:52,000
<i>当前叫价
不  我是游戏大师
No, I'm the Games Master.</i>

1401
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:52,040
不  我是游戏大师
No, I'm the Games Master.

1402
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:54,310
负责设计的是密室制造者
The Puzzle Maker designs the rooms.

1403
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:58,120
可你拿杀人当消遣  难道看电视还不够你消遣的吗？
But you kill people for fun. There's nothing good left on TV?

1404
01:23:59,350 --> 01:24:01,350
你的朋友都被你害死了
You killed all your friends...

1405
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,760
就因为你不愿意给他们出一趟打车钱
because you didn't want to pay for a goddamn cab.

1406
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,990
我想你还没这个资格指责我  本
I wouldn't get too comfortable on that high horse, Ben.

1407
01:24:06,990 --> 01:24:08,830
自人类文明诞生以来
From the beginning of civilization...

1408
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:11,060
我们就知道人类自相残杀谋求生机的过程  
we've known there was something captivating...

1409
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:13,560
一直就非常具有观赏性
about watching human beings fight for their lives.

1410
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:17,200
所以我们会看角斗士竞技  会看公开行刑
That's why we watch gladiator games, public executions...

1411
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:19,100
会在高速上探出头去看追尾
rubber-necking on the freeway.

1412
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:20,570
可现在的人太脆弱
But now the world's gone soft.

1413
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:23,570
在哪里都图个安全  干什么都要小心
Everything is safe. Everything is careful.

1414
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:25,510
所以我们才为那些
So, we created a sport for people

1415
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:27,750
骨子里依旧嗜血的人发明了这个游戏
who still have a thirst for savagery...

1416
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:30,380
还为他们提供专属的包厢
and we provided them with a box seat

1417
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:32,220
来观赏这极致的生死大战
for life's ultimate drama.

1418
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:39,320
我们的客户都是
Our customers are some of the most powerful

1419
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:41,430
这世界上最有权势的人
people in the world.

1420
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:44,530
但是他们每年都有新要求
But every year, they demand more.

1421
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:48,030
要更复杂的密室
More complicated rooms.

1422
01:24:48,030 --> 01:24:49,900
更有意思的主题
More interesting subjects.

1423
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:53,200
更多生死赌注的玩法
More ways to gamble on life and death.

1424
01:24:53,210 --> 01:24:57,210
去年他们要大学生运动员来玩
Last year, they had college athletes...

1425
01:24:57,210 --> 01:24:59,210
而前年呢  是学者
the year before, savants...

1426
01:24:59,210 --> 01:25:02,110
今年我们找来了终极幸存者
and this year we had lone survivors.

1427
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:05,920
他们想知道运气这东西到底能不能保命
They wanted to know if luck had anything to do with it.

1428
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:10,890
运气好的人才不会被变态绑架和折磨
Lucky people don't get kidnapped and tortured by psychopaths.

1429
01:25:10,890 --> 01:25:12,620
你知道叫别人变态
You know, it's kind of hurtful

1430
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:14,490
会伤对方的心吧？
when you call someone a psychopath, huh?

1431
01:25:18,730 --> 01:25:20,970
我也觉得这游戏挺蠢
I thought it was stupid, too.

1432
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:22,700
但是再看看你
But here you are...

1433
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:25,270
我们有史以来赢面最小的玩家
our lowest-odds ever to win...

1434
01:25:26,770 --> 01:25:29,070
竟然还活着
still alive.

1435
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:32,340
我是真没想到会这样
I really didn't think it was possible...

1436
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:33,780
但我也说了
but as I said...

1437
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:35,150
你的赢面是最小的
you were the long shot.

1438
01:25:40,950 --> 01:25:43,320
那我也赢了
So I won.

1439
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:46,990
赢了就能回家  对吗？
That means I get to go home, right?

1440
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:54,030
本
Ben...

1441
01:25:54,030 --> 01:25:56,100
你看赛马比赛结束后
at the end of the Kentucky Derby...

1442
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:58,210
得到奖励的是马吗？
do you think the horse gets a prize?

1443
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:20,800
<i>系统过载</i>

1444
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:24,500
<i>赢家</i>

1445
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:25,550
<i>游戏进行中</i>

1446
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:33,300
本
Hey. Hey, Ben.

1447
01:26:33,310 --> 01:26:36,480
起来  本  起来
Come on. Hey, Ben, come on. Come on.

1448
01:26:51,490 --> 01:26:56,130

Ben.

1449
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:59,060
本  快起来  本  快点  起来
Ben, come on, get up. Ben, come on, get up.

1450
01:27:00,870 --> 01:27:02,170
不
No!

1451
01:27:08,070 --> 01:27:12,010
你走不了  除非游戏结束  佐伊
You can't leave until we finish our game, Zoey.

1452
01:27:20,050 --> 01:27:22,790
好了  我们得确保
Okay, we have to make sure that...

1453
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,290
他死了
He's dead.

1454
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:40,070
走吧
Okay. Come on. Come on.

1455
01:27:41,470 --> 01:27:43,400
快  这里有一部货梯
Come on, there's a service elevator.

1456
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:43,800
<i>赢家</i>

1457
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:50,480
你是回来救我的
You came back for me.

1458
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:53,520
对  我不想再当唯一的幸存者了
Yeah, well, I'm tired of being the only survivor.

1459
01:27:57,420 --> 01:28:00,090
佐伊  快走  好的
Zoey, go, go. - Okay.

1460
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,500
已经过了二十四小时  他的情况稳定了
It's been 24 hours. He's stable now.

1461
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:14,270
你最好休息一下
You should get some rest.

1462
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:18,280
他准备好了
He's ready.

1463
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:20,480
贝尔医生  请立刻到手术室来
Dr. Bell, please come to the OR.

1464
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,880
贝尔医生  请到手术室
Dr. Bell, OR, please.

1465
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:25,150
戴维斯小姐？
Miss Davis?

1466
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:27,490
你现在能跟我走一趟吗？
Are you feeling well enough to come with me?

1467
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:34,390
是  说得对  我们会去做二次检查的
Yeah, you're right, we'll have to check that for roof access.

1468
01:28:46,910 --> 01:28:49,510
好了  我们走
All right, everyone, 360.

1469
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:52,680
戴维斯小姐
Miss Davis.

1470
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:05,960
等一下  这里之前是等候室  好吗？
Wait, this was the waiting room. Okay?

1471
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:08,930
它突然变成了一个一个巨大的烤箱  懂吗？
And then it turned into a giant oven, okay?

1472
01:29:08,930 --> 01:29:12,360
还有火  火是从天花板上喷出来的
And there was fire. The fire came down from the ceiling.

1473
01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:15,870
我们没有找到任何证据能证实你的描述
We haven't found any evidence of the things you've described.

1474
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:20,000
这里  看  这里是通风口
That. Look. This was the duct.

1475
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:21,940
当时上面盖着一幅画
There was a painting that came down.

1476
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:24,510
你以前是不是出现过幻觉？
Have you ever seen things that weren't there before?

1477
01:29:24,510 --> 01:29:28,380
这些不是我的幻觉  好吗？
I am not imagining this, okay?

1478
