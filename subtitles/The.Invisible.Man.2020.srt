对不起
I'm sorry.

00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,570
该死  我不能让你戴着这玩意
Shit. I'm not gonna leave you with that thing on.

00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,450

过来
Come here.

00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,090
没关系  好孩子
It's okay. Good boy.

27

该死
Shit.

塞茜莉亚  怎么回事
Cecilia, what is going on?

33
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,500
你还好吗
Are you okay?

34
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,060
我晚点再解释
I'll explain later.

35
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,770
快走吧  艾米丽
Just go, Emily.

36
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,550
走
Go.

37
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,570
-把门给我打开  塞茜莉亚  -怎么回事
- Open the fucking door, Cecilia! - What is happening?

38
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,620
快开门
Open the door!

39
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,570
-不  -开门
- No. - Open this door!

40
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,040
开门
Open the door!

41
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,530
快他妈给我开门
Open the fucking door!

42
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,340
我走了  我走了
I'm going, I'm going.

43
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,230
塞茜莉亚  回来
Cecilia, get back here!

44
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,200
天啊
Jesus!

45
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,340
立刻给我回来
Get back here now!

46
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,620
你不能这样做  快回来
You can't do this! Get back here!

47
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,350
茜
Cee.

48
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,310
你起床多久了
How long have you been up?

49
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,280
几小时
A few hours.

50
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,640
睡不着
Can't sleep.

51
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,880
如果你闭上眼
Now, you know, if you close your eyes

52
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,160
躺下来  一般会有用
and you lie down, that usually helps.

53
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,480
别以为缺觉
Um, don't think being tired

54
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,380
就能让你摆脱任务
gets you out of our little deal, now.

55
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,050
我跟你妹妹发过誓要让走出屋子
I swore to your sister I'd get you to step outside my house.

56
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,090
茜
Hey, Cee.

57
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,550
他不在外面
He's not out there.

58
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,210
我保证
I promise.

59
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,790
对不起  我只是...
I'm sorry. I'm just...

60
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,080
-我还没准备好  -没关系  茜
- I'm not ready yet. - Hey, it's okay, Cee.

61
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,480
这是你来之后去过最远的距离了  好吗
That's the furthest you've gone since you've been here, okay?

62
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,440
所以就我来看  你刚踏出了登上月球的那一步
So, as far as I'm concerned, you just walked on the moon.

63
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
我摆不平这破玩意
I can't work with this goddamn thing.

64
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:41,920
没关系的
It's all right.

65
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,200
我去开
I got it.

66
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,720
我去开
I got it.

67
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,640
我认识你吗
Do I know you?

68
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,970
-我欠你钱吗  -可多了
- Do I owe you money? - A lot.

69
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,740
可多了  我说过别来我家搞突袭
A lot? I told y'all about running up on me in my house.

70
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,720
茜
Hey. Cee.

71
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,410
告诉她不能把你带回去
Tell her she can't take you back.

72
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,390
我们要留着你
We're keeping you.

73
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,360
你来这里干什么  艾米丽
What are you doing here, Emily?

74
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,000
好吧  也很高兴见到你  姐姐
Well, it's nice to see you, too, sis.

75
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,580
我去看看西德尼在干什么
I'm gonna go see what Sydney's up to.

76
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,850
就...
Just...

77
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,110
这不公平
This is not fair.

78
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,380
我跟你说过别来了
I asked you not to come over.

79
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,810
他知道你住在哪里  他会跟踪你
He knows where you live. He will follow you.

80
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,810
好吧  我有消息告诉你
Yes, well, I have some news.

81
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,940
没有什么消息可以抵消你的愚蠢行为
There is no news that justifies this.

82
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,950
好吗  我有个计划  我只是...
Okay, I have a plan, and I just...

83
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,150
我需要你遵从计划
I-I need you to-to go along with it

84
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,170
别老想着控制我好吗
and just not be in control for one second.

85
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,400
我没有想控制你  亲爱的
I'm not trying to control you, boo.

86
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,010
我急切地想告诉你
I'm desperately trying to tell you that

87
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,350
你不用再想方设法甩掉我了
you don't need to cut me off anymore.

88
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,470
因为他死了
Because he's dead.

89
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,220
什么
What?

90
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:06,770
什么
What?

91
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,790
他对你做了什么
What did he do to you?

92
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,060
你能跟我说说吗
Can you talk to me?

93
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,370
完全说不通
It just doesn't make any sense.

94
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,110
他...他...
He was... he was in... he was...

95
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,950
他完全掌控了一切  你们懂吗
in complete control of everything, you know? Just...

96
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,320
包括我
Including me.

97
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,490
他管我的打扮  还有...
He controlled how I looked and...

98
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,910
我穿什么  吃什么
what I wore and what I ate.

99
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,340
然后...
And...

100
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,370
后来还管我什么时候出门
then it was controlling when I left the house and...

101
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,300
我说什么话
what I said.

102
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,590
最终...
And eventually...

103
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,530
管到了我的思想
what I thought.

104
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,210
如果...
And if...

105
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,830
如果他不喜欢他认为我在想的事
if he didn't like what he assumed I was thinking...

106
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,160
他...他会...
h-he... he would...

107
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,660
他会做什么
He'd what? He'd...

108
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,890
他会...他会打你吗
He would... he would hit you?

109
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,880
打我只是一部分
Amongst other things.

110
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,200
他想要个孩子
He wanted to have a baby.

111
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,680
我知道如果我们有了孩子  我...
And I knew that if we did that, that I...

112
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:23,150
我就再也无法摆脱他了  所以...
I would never be able to get away from him, so...

113
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,980
我瞒着他吃了避孕药
I took birth control without him knowing it.

114
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,280
但也只能撑得了一时  所以...
But, um, that can only go on for so long, so...

115
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,580
我打给了你
I called you.

116
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,330
你现在跟我们在一块了
You're here with us now.

117
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,590
你很安全
And you're safe.

118
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,990
他不在了
He's gone.

119
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,010
我不是让你放低目标
I'm not telling you to aim low.

120
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,440
我只是说  别局限于一种选择  好吗
I'm just saying, e-explore more than one option, okay?

121
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,530
全国这么大  别把你的选项
Don't limit your choices to just

122
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,300
局限于一所学校
one school in the whole country.

123
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,680
可唯独那所学校是我的目标
But that one school is my goal.

124
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,310
帕森斯设计学院是我的目标
Parsons is my goal.

125
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,690
我是让你要有目标  但不止一个
Yeah, I told you to have goals... plural.

126
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,150
我觉得有目标是很重要的  詹姆斯
I think it's important to have goals, James.

127
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,840
瞧瞧你  开始出门走入世界了
Look at you, getting out into the world.

128
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,650
知道吗  明年你就能跨过街道了
You know, by next year, you'll make it across the street.

129
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,420
茜
Hey, Cee.

130
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,450
有你的信
Something came for you.

131
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,080
没人知道我在这里
No one knows I'm here.

132
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,870
是谁
So, who's it from?

133
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,670
谢谢两位过来
Thank you both for coming in.

134
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,090
作为我已故哥哥的
As the appointed attorney

135
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,160
信托基金的指定律师
representing my late brother's discretionary trust,

136
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,440
我被要求执行他的遗愿
I'm required to enact his final wishes.

137
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,050
他明确要求我亲自来做
And he stipulated that I do this in person.

138
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,340
他想让我读...一段准备好的声明
He wanted me to read a... A prepared statement.

139
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,260
塞茜莉亚
"Cecilia,

140
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,320
虽然我们的关系远远称不上完美
"Although our relationship was far from perfect,

141
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,450
我觉得我们至少建立起了足够的信任
"I at least thought we had built up enough trust

142
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,610
你可以跟我敞开心扉
"That you would talk to me

143
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,820
而不是逃离你自以为
"Rather than running away from what you

144
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,460
-身处的境况  -不  抱歉
- perceived us to have." - No, no. Sorry.

145
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,860
你不能这么做
You're not allowed to do that.

146
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,510
我被要求宣读这个
I'm required to read this.

147
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,970
她没被要求听这些
She's not required to listen.

148
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,520
发个邮件给我  我们会看的
E-mail me a copy, and we will read it.

149
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:13,730
一定
You bet.

150
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,880
我只是想做好我的工作
I'm just trying to do my job.

151
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,270
你的工作是解释清楚
Your job is to explain the money

152
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,160
你在电话里说的钱
you mentioned on the phone.

153
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,990
我说的是阿德里安的信托中
I mentioned Cecilia specifically

154
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,510
明确提到了塞茜莉亚的名字
is named in Adrian's trust.

155
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,340
-所以我们现在才会坐在这里  -对
- That is why we're sitting here. - Yes.

156
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,520
跟阿德里安生命中那么多接近他的
For the same reason so many women in Adrian's life

157
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,600
女人一样  为了钱
got close to him: his money.

158
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,660
要是有可能跟他本人发生近距离接触
If there was a chance of physically being close to him,

159
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,840
我们根本不会来这里  再多钱都没用
we would not be here for any amount of money.

160
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,880
你们现在就跟他本人距离很近
You are physically close to him.

161
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,450
他在那边那个骨灰罐里
He's in that urn over there.

162
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:44,680
根据他的遗愿  你将得到五百万美元
And as per his final wishes, you're getting $5 million,

163
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,890
不用交遗产税和所得税
estate and income tax free.

164
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,380
这笔钱将在接下来的四年左右
Now, the money will be staggered

165
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,600
按照每月十万的数额
in installments of $100,000

166
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,960
分期支付给你
each month for the next four years or so,

167
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,330
当然还有一些细则条件
contingent, of course, on the fine print.

168
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,830
比如你不能犯罪  等等
You can't commit a crime, et cetera.

169
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,970
通常来说  我有120天的争议期
Normally, I would have a 120-day contestability period,

170
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,160
但我会放弃这一权利
but I'm gonna waive my rights in that regard.

171
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,160
所以
So...

172
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,960
只要你在此签名
as soon as I have your signature

173
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,830
并留下银行信息
and your banking information,

174
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,700
我就可以开始发放资金了
I can start releasing the funds.

175
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,250
好了  你们可以进来了
Okay, you can come in now.

176
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,590
等等  你在哪呢
Wait, wait. Where you at?

177
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,130
-我们现在能看了吗  -小心
- Can we look now? - Careful.

178
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,500
是的  你们可以看了
Yes, you can look.

179
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,950
谢了  茜
Wow. Thanks, Cee.

180
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,810
真是太棒了  瞧瞧
Wow, that's nice. L-Look at that.

181
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,070
一个梯子
A ladder?

182
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,940
你说什么
Excuse you?

183
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,220
我肯定是听错了吧
I know I didn't hear you just say that.

184
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,240
-我是想说谢谢  -你该说什么
- I meant to say thank you. - What do you say?

185
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,330
不客气
You're welcome.

186
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,980
我知道你需要一个新的
Well, I-I knew you needed a new one,

187
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,330
那个...得扔了
and that one just... that has to go.

188
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,470
你真是太好了  茜  太谢谢了
That's so nice of you, Cee. Thank you so much.

189
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,210
你真贴心  谢谢
That's very sweet of you. Thank you.

190
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,260
我只是...我想谢谢你  因为
I just... I wanted to thank you for,

191
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,610
你懂的  你收留我住在这里
you know, letting me stay here

192
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,650
也谢谢你把我照顾得这么好
and for taking such good care of me, so...

193
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,560
而且西德尼也可以用梯子
And Sydney can also use ladders.

194
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,310
千万别觉得我会帮你刷墙
Don't think I'm helping you paint.

195
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,490
我跟本不会费事问你
I wouldn't even bother to ask you.

196
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,230
不  显然不是用来刷墙
No, not for, like, painting, obviously,

197
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,670
但可以用来做许多事
but just for a lot of things.

198
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,660
你得爬上去才能拿到那里的东西
You climb them to get things like-like stuff like that.

199
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,710
这也太奇怪了  要是有个
That's so strange. God, I wish you had, like...

200
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,510
等等  你可以
Oh, wait, you could totally

201
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,090
-用梯子  -用梯子爬上去
- use the ladder. - A ladder to climb up...

202
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,530
可以用梯子
Yeah, the ladder's cool.

203
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,490
-好吧  -它该不会是自己上去的吧
- Okay. - This happened to just pop up there by itself?

204
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,450
就是刚好在那里
It happened to just be here, so...

205
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,040
就是这么巧
it's convenient.

206
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,330
是什么
What is it?

207
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,810
-写着我的名字  -好奇怪
- It has my name on it. - That's weird.

208
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,740
-看着像你的笔迹  -不知道了
- And it looks like your handwriting. - I don't know...

209
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,100
-你真觉得奇怪吗  -我只是买了个梯子
- You sure it's weird? - I just got a ladder, so...

210
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,680
-要是你觉得奇怪  -我不知道
- If you think it's weird. - I don't know what...

211
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,600
我们看看吧
Let's see.

212
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,030
只是买了个不错的梯子
A cool ladder is all.

213
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,350
是用你名字开的新账户
It's a new bank account, um, with your name on it,

214
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:54,700
我准备每个月都往这个账户存一万美元
and I'm gonna put $10,000 in it every month

215
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,190
一直到年底
for the rest of the year.

216
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,340
我管它叫帕森斯基金
I called the account "Parsons."

217
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,540
你要去上设计学院了
You're going to fashion school, kid.

218
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,190
茜  这可不是小数目
Hey, whoa, Cee, Cee, that's... that's too much, Cee.

219
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,810
你确定你能负担吗
Come on, are you sure you can do that?

220
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,480
我这么说吧
Let me put it this way.

221
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,180
她想读到研究生都没问题
She can probably go to grad school, too.

222
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,060
我要去帕森斯上学了
I'm going to Parsons.

223
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,360
她可以去帕森斯了
She can go to Parsons.

224
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,930
你要去帕森斯了
You're going to Parsons.

225
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,460
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

226
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,960
等一下
Oh, wait, no.

227
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,970
我们得庆祝  好好庆祝一下
We got to cel... we got to celebrate.

228
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,590
我可不要加热冷冻快餐
And I don't want TV dinners, microwave nothing, we...

229
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,030
那可真是太可惜了
Oh, it's, like, I guess too bad

230
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,910
我们什么庆祝的东西都没有
we don't have anything at all to celebrate with.

231
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,590
我不知道你在高兴什么
I don't know why you dancing.

232
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,650
-你还不到21  一口也喝不上  -我当然要喝
-You can't have none, 'cause you're not 21. - Yes, I can.

233
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:40,550
别扫兴嘛
Oh, come on.

234
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,920
就喝一点点
Just, like, a little bit.

235
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,620
他那天说我已经很成熟了
He said the other day that I was mature for my age.

236
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,610
-是没错  -他真的说过
- That's right. - He did.

237
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,240
-成熟的小孩  -我听到你说了
- A mature child. - I heard you say that.

238
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,370
-我记得的  -等一下  等一下
- I remember. - Hey, hold up, hold up, hold up.

239
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,880
不公平啊  你们两个对我一个
This ain't fair, okay? Two against one.

240
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,570
我只是个想做正确的事的无辜男人
I'm just an innocent man trying to do right.

241
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,130
你害怕了吗  害怕了吗
Are you scared? Are you scared?

242
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,380
这  这简直荒谬  我是个警察
This a... this is abuse. I'm a cop.

243
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,540
-你害怕了吗  -我可是警察
- Are you-you scared? - You realize I'm a cop.

244
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,800
我来抓住他  我抓住他
I got him, I got him.

245
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,110
-我抓住他了  西德尼  -不  他冲我来了
- I got him, Sydney! I got him! - No, he's got me!

246
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,200
我来保护你
Oh! I'll protect you!

247
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,930
早上好
Morning.

248
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,010
吃早餐吗
You want some breakfast?

249
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,950
不了  我得走了
Nah, nah, I got to go.

250
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,380
你信不信  我竟然有点宿醉了
You know, I'm a little hungover, believe it or not.

251
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,290
我也是
Ugh. Me, too.

252
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,250
每次喝香槟都这样
Champagne does that to me every time.

253
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,450
我们老了  茜
We're getting old, Cee.

254
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,450
老了
We old.

255
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,510
冬天的早晨太痛苦了
These winter mornings are killing me.

256
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,930
我该走了
All right, look, I'm out of here.

257
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,130
七点左右回来
Um, I'll be back around 7:00.

258
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,680
-知道了  -好吗
- Okay. - All right?

259
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,780
-茜  -怎么了
- Oh, uh, Cee. - Hmm?

260
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,570
你去叫西德尼起床好吗
You mind getting Sydney up?

261
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,240
因为你  她兴奋坏了
She's actually pretty excited, thanks to you.

262
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,600
她可能需要你帮忙把注意力转回来
She, uh... she might need a little help staying focused.

263
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,050
知道了
You got it.

264
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,230
小西  起床了
Syd, come on, girl.

265
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,710
你要迟到了
You're gonna be late.

266
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,220
糟了
Shit!

267
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,020
糟了  妈的
Shit, shit.

268
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,510
-妈的  -别别别
- Shit. - No, no, no, no, no.

269
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,360
别用水
No, don't use water. No.

270
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,950
让一下  抱歉
Excuse me. Sorry.

271
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,560
你做的早餐
You did that.

272
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,820
还能抢救一下吗
You think we can salvage it?

273
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,680
-不能  -不能吗
- No. - No?

274
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,440
不能  抱歉
No. Sorry.

275
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,200
詹姆斯
James?

276
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:43,860
詹姆斯
James!

277
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,200
詹姆斯  詹姆斯  詹姆斯
James! James, James!

278
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:46,850
怎么了
Yeah, yeah, what?

279
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,210
出什么事了  怎么了
What-what happened? What happened? What?

280
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,870
我看见那有东西  就在那
I saw something right there. They were right there.

281
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,600
有脚印  我看见了
There were footprints. I saw it.

282
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,420
你说你看到了脚印
You-you saw... you saw footprints?

283
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,350
我看见了  没错  在被单上
I saw... I... Yes, I saw... On the sheets.

284
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,170
就在那
I saw it right there.

285
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,900
-我看见了  -在被单上
- I saw them. - On the sheet?

286
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,590
我看见了
I saw it.

287
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,050
刚刚有人进来了  有人进来了
There was someone in here. There was someone in here.

288
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,320
小西  把那个破玩意收起来
Syd, put that stupid thing away.

289
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,960
是你给我买的
Y-You're the one who bought it for me.

290
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,060
你准备喷谁  喷谁
Who you gonna spray? Who?

291
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,910
詹姆斯  我看见了
James, I saw it.

292
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,100
我发誓
I swear.

293
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,300
茜
Cee.

294
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,470
如果你不放下  阿德里安会一直阴魂不散
Adrian will haunt you if you let him.

295
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,940
别再想他了
Don't let him.

296
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,840
你应该试着睡一会儿
Now, you should try and get some sleep.

297
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,380
你明天还有一场重要的面试
You have an important job interview tomorrow,

298
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,840
别让那个王八...
and I don't want the memory of this motherfu...

299
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,880
那个
that...

300
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:41,880
那个人不好的回忆毁了你的面试
this person to ruin it.

301
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,470
-好吗  -好
- Okay? - Okay, yeah.

302
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,640
抱歉
Sorry.

303
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,340
从加州科技大学毕业以后  我去巴黎
After Cal Poly, I worked in Paris

304
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,760
工作了六个月
for six months.

305
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,300
那是我一生中最美好的一段时光
That was the best time of my life, for sure.

306
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,930
当然还有接下来这个阶段
Except for this next phase, of course.

307
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,300
请坐
Take a seat.

308
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,720
你去巴黎工作有特定的原因吗
So, any reason you worked in Paris in particular?

309
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,620
是不是有这么条规定
Is that where all the beautiful women in the world

310
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,080
漂亮女人都要去趟巴黎
have to go as a rule?

311
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,810
我会说一点点法语
Well, I speak a little... A little French,

312
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:20,320
我也一直想去那里生活
and I've always wanted to live there.

313
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,130
所以毕业以后
So, after I graduated,

314
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:25,850
我就完全靠学生的预算去了那里
I went out there on a totally student budget.

315
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,480
我真的是睡在杂物间里
I slept in a broom closet, literally.

316
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,020
我真的是在杂物间里创建了这家公司
I started this firm in a supply closet, literally.

317
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,450
是吧
There you go.

318
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:35,200
-所以我们都知道杂物间的价值  -没错
- So we both know the value of closet space. - Yeah.

319
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,500
给我看看你的作品
Let me see some of your work.

320
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,450
好的
Yes, of course.

321
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,940
我不  我肯定
I don't... Uh, I know that I...

322
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:06,540
我肯定是放进来了  实在抱歉
I know I put them in here, so I... so I apologize.

323
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,780
我不知道出了什么情况
I don't know what happened.

324
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,170
没关系
It's okay.

325
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,080
你可以等有时间了发给我们
Uh, you can send it to us whenever you get a chance.

326
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,680
好的
Okay.

327
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,280
我跟你介绍一下我们公司
Uh, so, uh, l-let me tell you about us.

328
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:19,800
儒勒的建筑设计更加注重人性化
Uh, at Ruler, we approach architecture on a human level.

329
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,160
首先
First and...

330
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,950
你还好吗
Are you okay?

331
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,110
抱歉
Um, I'm sorry.

332
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,390
我就是不太...
Uh, I'm just not feeling, um...

333
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,170
你要喝水吗
Uh, would you like some water or...

334
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,040
塞茜莉亚
Cecilia?

335
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,820
你还好吗
Are you feeling okay?

336
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,210
塞茜莉亚
Cecilia.

337
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,980
接下来的几天你最好
Okay, so, uh, you probably shouldn't drive

338
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,990
别开车或者操作什重型机械
or operate any heavy machinery for the next few days,

339
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,470
但除此以外你没有问题
but other than that, you seem fine.

340
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,510
我或者我拜托的医生会来跟进
Either myself or my admitting will, uh, follow up with you

341
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,340
告诉你血检的结果
with the results of the blood test.

342
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:19,220
好吧  你能给护士留一个号码吗
Okay? Uh, can you just leave a number with the nurse?

343
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,560
你们可以回家了
You guys can go home.

344
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,830
好
Okay.

345
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,770
你准备好了吗
You ready?

346
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,190
好了
Yeah.

347
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,810
喂
Hello?

348
00:38:58,810 --> 00:38:59,860
塞茜莉亚・卡斯在吗
Is Cecilia Kass there?

349
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,100
是我
That's me.

350
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,580
你好  我是圣文森特医院的李医生
Hi. Uh, this is Dr. Lee at St. Vincent's.

351
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:08,880
我们拿到了你的血检结果
So, we got the results of your blood test back,

352
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:11,210
看起来你很有可能
and it looks like the diazepam

353
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,280
是因为地西泮才晕到
was the most likely cause of you fainting.

354
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:16,060
抱歉  什么地西泮
Um, sorry, what diazepam?

355
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:19,780
你的血检显示地西泮含量很高
Well, your blood work showed a very high amount of it.

356
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:22,790
这就能解释你为什么晕倒了
That would definitely explain what happened to you.

357
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,690
还有一件事我想跟你谈谈
There's something else I wanted to talk to you about,

358
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:31,790
但我不确定电话上是否方便
but I'm not sure if we should do it over the phone, so, um...

359
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,010
叫他停下
Tell him to stop.

360
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,400
叫谁停下什么
Tell who to stop what?

361
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,170
叫他停下正在做的事
Tell him to stop what he's doing.

362
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,660
你知道她在瞎说什么吗
Do you know what she's babbling about?

363
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,030
不知道  她还没跟我解释为什么要来
Nah, she hasn't explained to me why we're here yet,

364
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:09,420
但是作为她的好朋友  我知道肯定有原因
but being her very good friend, I know it's a good reason,

365
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,680
所以我需要你坐着听好了
so I'm gonna need you to sit up and listen.

366
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,510
放尊重点
Show a little respect.

367
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,810
有一晚  我坐在那里
One night, I was sitting,

368
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:25,740
我在思考怎么离开阿德里安
and I was thinking about how to leave Adrian.

369
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,100
我在脑海里计划了一切
I was planning the whole thing in my mind.

370
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,980
他盯着我
And he was staring at me,

371
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,580
研究我的心理
studying me.

372
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,290
然后我还没有说一个字
And without me saying a single word,

373
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,360
他就说我永远离不开他
he said that I could never leave him.

374
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,790
不管我去哪里
That wherever I went,

375
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,270
他都会找到我
he would find me.

376
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,900
他会直直走向我
That he would walk right up to me

377
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,850
而我根本看不见他
and I wouldn't be able to see him,

378
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,730
但他会给我一个信号
but that he would leave me a sign

379
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,310
让我知道他来了
so that I'd know he was there.

380
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:15,430
我离开他的那晚  我用这个给他下了药
The night I left him, I drugged him with that.

381
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,040
那晚我弄丢了药瓶
I lost the bottle that night.

382
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:22,160
但不知怎么的  它回到了我手中
And somehow, it found its way back to me.

383
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,850
所以你是在说什么
So, what exactly are you saying?

384
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:29,290
你弄丢了药瓶  又找到了药瓶
You lost the bottle, you found the bottle.

385
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,420
他没死  汤姆
He's not dead, Tom.

386
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,710
我有整整一盒骨灰
I have a pile of ashes in the box

387
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,510
证明你说的不对  塞茜莉亚
that would disagree with you, Cecilia.

388
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,670
我不知道他是怎么做到的
I don't know how he's done it.

389
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,720
但是他肯定想到办法了
He's figured it out, though.

390
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:55,640
他想出了隐形的办法
He has figured out a way to be invisible.

391
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:03,770
他是世界光学界的领头人
He is a world leader in the field of optics.

392
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:06,540
我知道他能办得到
I-I... I know that he could do this.

393
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,120
直觉告诉我  你很清楚我在说什么
Something tells me you know exactly what I'm talking about.

394
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,610
他没有死
He's not dead.

395
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,400
我只是看不见他
I just can't see him.

396
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,360
求你叫他停下
Please tell him to stop.

397
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,620
好吧
Okay.

398
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,290
不  我同意你说的话
No, I agree with you.

399
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:33,920
阿德里安是很聪明
Adrian was brilliant.

400
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,200
但他的聪明之处不在于他的发明
But it wasn't because of anything he invented.

401
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,420
而在于他善于影响人们的思维
It was how he got in people's heads.

402
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,330
那才是他真正的本事  知道别人的弱点
That was his true genius... knowing people's weaknesses.

403
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,590
你好好想想
You think about it.

404
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,780
他的完美计划在死后还能折磨你
He came up with the perfect way to torture you even in death.

405
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,760
比起造出什么
Only thing more brilliant

406
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,600
可以隐形的东西
than inventing something that makes you invisible

407
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:56,180
什么都没造却让你以为他造了  才更加高明
is not inventing it but making you think he did.

408
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:01,460
我哥哥早在遇到你之前就控制了我  塞茜莉亚
My brother controlled me long before he met you, Cecilia.

409
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:03,520
我恨他
I hated him.

410
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,100
这点上你我是相同的
You and I, we got that in common.

411
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,000
我听到他的死讯时
I was relieved...

412
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,290
着实松了口气
when I heard that he was dead.

413
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,060
他已经死了  塞茜莉亚
He's gone, Cecilia.

414
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,770
我亲眼看到了他的尸体
I saw his body.

415
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,220
听我说
Listen to me.

416
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,320
别让他因为你的臆想而得逞
Don't let him win by bringing him back to life.

417
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,440
艾米丽  我得和你谈谈
Emily, I need to talk to you.

418
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,870
至少现在我们之间没有隐瞒了
Well, at least now we have clarity.

419
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:20,530
现在我知道你对我真正的看法了
Now I know what you really think of me.

420
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:21,190
什么
What?

421
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:25,000
真是多谢你挤出时间让我知道
Thanks so much for carving out the time to let me know how...

422
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,550
引用你的原话  我是多么"令你窒息"
quote, unquote... "suffocating" I am to you.

423
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:30,410
什么  你在说什么
What? What are you...

424
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:32,330
这话我本来不用说出来的
Not that I should have to say this,

425
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:35,450
但我从没想要你给我钱
but I never expected any of that money.

426
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:40,880
艾米丽  我不知道你在说什么
Emily, I-I don't... I don't know what you're talking about.

427
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,310
那封邮件  你今早给我发的那封邮件
The e-mail... the e-mail you sent me this morning.

428
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,460
-什么邮件  -如果你就是这么看待我的话
- What e-mail? - If that's how you feel about me,

429
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,430
别再把我这里当成你的私人避风港了
don't ask me to bail you out of your personal life anymore.

430
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,630
如果你蠢到不知道哪些是好人
If you're too stupid to know who the good guys are

431
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,930
而又软弱到无法摆脱那些坏人
and too weak to get away from the bad ones,

432
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:57,220
别摇着尾巴向我乞讨
don't sob to me for charity.

433
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:57,920
我不干了
I'm out.

434
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,670
我他妈的没给你发邮件
I didn't send you the fucking e-mail.

435
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,780
我没发
I didn't.

436
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:06,180
有人在  在针对我
Someone is-is-is doing this to me.

437
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,420
他  他在针对我
He's-he's doing this to me.

438
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,930
谁
Who's...

439
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,660
阿德里安吗
Adrian?

440
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,950
阿德里安给我发的邮件  好吧
Adrian sent me the e-mail. Okay.

441
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:27,650
你得吃药了  阿德里安已经死了
You need some medication. Adrian is dead.

442
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:29,670
艾米  求你别这样
Em, please, no.

443
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,190
茜
Cee?

444
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,560
我没事  西德尼
It's okay, Syd.

445
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:09,870
你知道我们需要什么吗
You-you know what I think we need?

446
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,650
我想我们可以把爸爸赶出去
I think we could kick Dad out and...

447
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,830
过一个闺蜜之夜
have a little girls' night.

448
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,310
吃点蛋糕
Eat some cake.

449
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:28,270
好啊
Yeah.

450
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,390
我确实喜欢吃蛋糕
I do like cake.

451
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,850
天啊  西德尼  你还好吗
Oh, my God. Sydney, are you okay?

452
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:41,230
你为什么要  住手  住手  爸爸
Why would you just... Stop! Stop! Dad!

453
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,850

- What? No. No, Sydney, I didn't... - Dad! Dad!

454
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:44,530
-我没有...  -爸爸  她
- No, I... - Dad, she...

455
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:46,390
-怎么了  发生什么了  -她打我
- What happened? What happened? - She-she hit me.

456
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,550
-什么  -不  不  不
- What? - No. No, no, no.

457
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:49,860
詹姆斯  不是我干的
James, I did not do that.

458
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,400
西德尼  我不会打你的  我爱你
Sydney, I would never hit you. I love you.

459
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:53,810
我绝不会那样做的  詹姆斯
I would never do that, James.

460
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:55,500
是他  他就在这里  我发誓
It was him. He's here, I swear to you.

461
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,930
够了  够了
Enough. Enough.

462
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,660
茜  够了
Cee, enough.

463
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,370
别装了
Just stop it.

464
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:00,900
你没事吧  宝贝
Are you okay, baby?

465
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:01,780
-我不想再待在这里了  -你没事吧
- I don't want to stay here. - You-you all right?

466
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,250
西德尼  对不起  我绝不会...
Sydney, I'm sorry. I would never...

467
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,470
别过来  茜
Hey, hey. Cee.

468
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:08,500
现在我的首要任务是把我的宝贝送到安全的地方
Right now my priority is getting my baby somewhere safe.

469
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,600
你明白吗
Do you understand?

470
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,880
来吧  宝贝  没事的
Come on, baby. It's okay.

471
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,620
不  詹姆斯  求你了
No. James, please.

472
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,080
这就是他的企图
This is what he wants.

473
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,070
这是我们在一起时他经常干的
This is what he used to do when we were together.

474
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,050
他想让你认为是我干的
He wants you to think that I did it.

475
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:21,380
这就是他的手段  他想方设法孤立我
This is what he does. He tries to isolate me,

476
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:23,560
-他想让我独自一人  -喂
- and he tries to get me alone. - Hey!

477
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,680
你得冷静一点
You need to calm down.

478
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:26,380
你吓到我女儿了
You are scaring my daughter.

479
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,680
如果我是你  我会去你妹妹家
Now, if I were you, I would go to your sister's place.

480
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,470
你现在不应该待在这里
You don't need to be here right now.

481
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,460
走吧  西德尼
Come on, Sydney.

482
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,530
西德尼  对不起  西德尼
Sydney, I'm sorry. Sydney.

483
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,260
你在哪
Where are you?

484
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,420
来啊
Come on!

485
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:03,040
你在哪  出来啊
Where are you? Come on out.

486
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,250
别打小女孩
Don't hit a little girl.

487
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,010
打我啊
Hit me!

488
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:04,470
为什么要选我  阿德里安
So, why me, Adrian?

489
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:12,360
随便哪个女人都会倒贴你
You could have any woman you wanted.

490
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,300
这也正是你可悲的现实
That's the sad reality.

491
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:20,590
对吧
Right?

492
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:24,580
这就是金钱和权力为你提供的
And that's what money and power buy you.

493
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:26,940
人心
People.

494
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,320
那
So...

495
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:36,690
为什么选我
why me?

496
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,580
我只是个郊区女孩
I'm just a suburban girl who...

497
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,960
在一个派对晚上误打误撞进入了你的生活
stumbled into your life one night at a party.

498
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:56,300
你就不能忘记我曾经来过吗
Can't you just forget I ever existed?

499
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:03,910
我已经不剩什么
There's nothing left

500
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,760
可以让你夺走了
for you to take.

501
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,730
你已经全部夺走了
You've already taken it all.

502
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:38,960
我是阿德里安・格里芬
This is Adrian Griffin.

503

01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,910
斯汀森海滩  离这很远啊
Stinson Beach... that's a long way from here.

513
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,020
我要进去拿点东西
I-I just need to get something.

514
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:02,760
可以麻烦你等我吗
Do you mind waiting for me?

515
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,570
可能需要两分钟
I might be two minutes,

516
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:06,260
可能需要二十分钟  我不确定  但是...
I might be 20, I don't know, but...

517
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,290
之后可以再把我送回市里
You could run me back to the city after.

518
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:10,680
-好的  -好
- Sure. - Okay.

519
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:11,270
没问题
No problem.

520
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:10,350
宙斯
Zeus.

521
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:17,540
12-14... 17.

522
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:20,700
我们认识那天
The day we met.

523
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,440
真浪漫啊
So romantic.

524
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:37,450
拜托  今晚有空的话和我见一面
Please, meet me tonight, if you can,

525
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:38,920
在...在公共场所
in a pu... in a public place.

526
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:40,980
八点在玉兰见
8:00 at Yulan.

527
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,440
你要是不来的话我也理解  但一定要告诉我
And if you can't, I understand, but you have to tell me,

528
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,760
因为我得叫别人来
because I have to call someone else,

529
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:47,850
因为我的时间不多了
because I don't think I have much time left.

530
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:52,630
谢谢你  谢谢

531
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:42,090
你们好  欢迎光临玉兰
Guys. Welcome to Yulan.

532
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,430
我叫泰勒  今晚
My name is Taylor, and I will be

533
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:44,930
由我来招待你们
taking care of you this evening.

534
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,090
你们知道这里的规矩吗
Do you know how this place works?

535
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,490
我猜就是点菜  然后吃掉吧
I'm assuming you order food, then you eat it.

536
01:09:48,490 --> 01:09:49,520
差不多吧
Pretty much.

537
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,160
我们只是有一点不同
We just do things a little bit differently.

538
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,050
都是家庭式的
It's all family style.

539
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:53,840
我们以前来过  没问题的
We've been here before. It's all good.

540
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,630
好的  我先为你们上点水吧
Okay. Can I get you started with some water?

541
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:58,010
-有矿泉水和气泡水  -免费的就行
- We have still or sparkling. - Just the free kind.

542
01:09:58,010 --> 01:10:00,010
-好的  自来水  -行
- Okay, tap it is. - Cool.

543
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:05,240
谢谢你肯来见我
Thank you for being here.

544
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:09,800
我爱你
I love you.

545
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,700
你就像警察一样  艾米丽
You're like a cop, Emily,

546
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:17,890
你身上有种强大的力量
and y-you have this brute-force strength

547
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:23,320
在我遇到麻烦时让我非常安心
that is so, so comforting when I'm in trouble,

548
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:27,540
在我没遇到麻烦时又让我畏惧
and it is really intimidating when I'm not.

549
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:30,660
詹姆斯是个一米八的真警察
I mean, James actually is a six-foot cop,

550
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:33,990
我觉得他也畏惧你
and he's, I think, really intimidated by you.

551
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:34,750
他应该畏惧
As he should be.

552
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:36,240
我能揍扁他
I'd kick his ass.

553
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:39,180
我能
I would.

554
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:41,040
你能
You would.

555
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:47,670
我现在需要这种力量
I need that strength in my life right now.

556
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:52,080
我还需要你相信我接下来要告诉你的事
And I need you to believe what I'm about to tell you.

557
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,220
好的  我...
Okay. I...

558
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,790
谢谢你了  泰勒
Thank you, Taylor.

559
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:08,750
好了  你们需要再看看
All right. Uh, do you guys need more time

560
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:10,250
-饮品单吗  -是的
- with the drink menu? - Yes.

561
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,880
需要很多时间
Lots more time.

562
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,800
好的  没问题
Okay, no problem at all.

563
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:18,350
艾米丽
Emily.

564
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,540
我今天去了他家
I went to his house today.

565
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:27,340
-你去了阿德里安家  -是的
- You went to Adrian's house? - Yes.

566
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,350
直接进去了
I just walked right in.

567
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:34,850
我找到了可以证明我的经历的证据
I found something that can prove what I'm experiencing.

568
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:39,990
可以证明阿德里安在跟踪我
That can prove that Adrian is stalking me.

569
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:41,940
是什么
What is it?

570
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:46,450
是阿德里安发明的一种衣服
It's some kind of suit that Adrian has built.

571
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:49,750
上面有摄像头  可以...
And it has cameras, and it somehow...

572
01:11:49,790 --> 01:11:50,680
怎么了
What?

573
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:05,750
不  拜托  不
No, please. No!

574
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:08,020
你们不能这么做  你们不能这么做
You can't do this. You can't do this.

575
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:09,380
是他杀了她  是他杀了她
He killed her. He killed her.

576
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:11,010
拜托  不是我做的
Please, I didn't do it!

577
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:12,600
不是我做的
I didn't do it.

578
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,390
不  不
No! No!

579
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,060
是他杀了她
He killed her!

580
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:19,280
是他杀的  你们听我说
He did it! You have to listen to me.

581
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,100
-拜托  不要  -尽量放松
- Please, please, no. - Try to relax.

582
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,910
不要
Please, no!

583
01:13:22,910 --> 01:13:24,900
不
No!

584
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,500
听我说  不
Listen to me! No!

585
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:32,020
你这个天杀的
You motherfucker!

586
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,040
你杀了她
You killed her!

587
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:38,870
我看见你了  我看见你了
I see you! I see you!

588
01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:39,730
他在这里
He's here!

589
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:41,030
他在这里  他就在这里
He's here. He's right here.

590
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:42,990
他就在这里  拜托
He's right here. Please!

591
01:13:42,990 --> 01:13:45,410
你们看不见他  他就在屋子里
You can't see him. He's in the room.

592
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:47,740
你们听我说
You have to listen to me.

593
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:50,560
他就在这里  他会伤害我的
He's right there. He's gonna hurt me.

594
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,360
-拜托  不要  -好了
- Please. No... - Okay.

595
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:54,850
他就在那里
He's right there.

596
01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:57,470
-他在这里  -好了
- He's here. - Okay.

597
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:58,490
他就在...
He's right...

598
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:00,330
那里
There.

599
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:07,680
-现在都好了  -他就在那里
- Everything's better now. - He's right there.

600
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,600
好吧  你会没事的
Okay? You'll be all right.

601
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,100
惊讶吧
Surprise.

602
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:56,340
塞茜莉亚
Cecilia.

603
01:14:57,620 --> 01:15:00,300
你能确认视频中的人是你吗
Can you confirm the person in this video is you?

604
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,590
你能确认
And can you confirm

605
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:07,600
你最近在工作面试中
you recently fainted during a job interview

606
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,440
因为体内地西泮含量过高而晕倒了吗
due to a high amount of diazepam in your system?

607
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:19,930
我被下药了
I was drugged.

608
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:24,730
你几天前还发邮件给你妹妹
You also sent your sister an e-mail a few days ago

609
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:27,300
告诉她你想要她死  是吗
saying you wished she was dead, didn't you?

610
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,080
我有证据
I have something.

611
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:43,750
我有证据可以证明他还活着
I have something that will prove he's alive.

612
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:45,710
我找到了
I found it.

613
01:15:47,030 --> 01:15:48,380
你有什么证据
What do you have?

614
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:02,990
我现在不能告诉你
I can't tell you right now.

615
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:05,270
他在听
He's listening.

616
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:10,630
他也在房间里  詹姆斯
He's in the room, James.

617
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:13,010
你是说杀害你妹妹的人
You're saying that the person who killed your sister

618
01:16:13,010 --> 01:16:16,590
现在也在房间里  而我们看不见他
is in the room right now but we can't see him?

619
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:19,700
好了
Okay.

620
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:22,860
-好  -谢谢
- Yeah. - Thank you.

621
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:27,050
詹姆斯
James.

622
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:31,820
告诉我你不认为我是凶手
Tell me you don't think I did this.

623
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,120
告诉我你相信这一点
Tell me you know that.

624
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,340
虽然可能确实是我害死了她
I may as well have done it, though.

625
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:56,590
是我带阿德里安进入了她的生活
I brought Adrian into her life.

626
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,700
是我做的
I did that.

627
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:06,150
我不该离开你  丢下你一个人
I shouldn't have walked out on you and left you alone.

628
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:10,660
我辜负了你
I failed you.

629
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,940
你对这张床有什么意见吗  塞茜莉亚
Is this bed giving you any problems, Cecilia?

630
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:29,490
没有
No.

631
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,790
这房间里有什么让你不适的地方吗
Is there anything in the room that is distressing to you?

632
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:40,000
没有
No.

633
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:43,770
行  好
Okay. Good.

634
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:47,170
我想跟你谈一件事
I wanted to talk to you about something.

635
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,640
我们看了你上周
We checked the blood test

636
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,750
在医院做的血检
that you had done at the hospital last week.

637
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:55,120
你还记得去验血的事吗
Do you remember taking those blood tests?

638
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:56,700
记得
Yes.

639
01:17:59,910 --> 01:18:00,850
好
Okay.

640
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:05,630
你知道你怀孕了吗
Well, did you know that you were pregnant?

641
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,200
不
No.

642
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,010
验血的医生没告诉你吗
Didn't the doctor who took the test tell you?

643
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:37,330
不  那不可能
No, that can't be right.

644
01:18:37,330 --> 01:18:40,170
那不是真的
That's... that's not true.

645
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:43,730
化验结果显示你是最近怀孕的
The test shows us that it was pretty recent.

646
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:45,860
我们不太确定具体时间
We can't be sure of exactly when,

647
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:48,850
但肯定是发生在上个月
but it must have been sometime in the last month.

648
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:57,850
亲爱的  有没有我们能联系的人
Sweetie, is there anyone we can call?

649
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:00,660
家人
Family?

650
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,650
朋友
Any friends?

651
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:07,820
好吧
Okay.

652
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,520
看你这样真让人难过
It's upsetting to see you in this condition.

653
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,530
尽管你和阿德里安结局不佳
Even though things ended badly for you and Adrian,

654
01:19:52,530 --> 01:19:54,610
我仍然视你为家人
I still look at you as family.

655
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:59,050
你现在是我的代理律师吗
Are you my lawyer now?

656
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:02,540
我是负责你收入来源的律师
I'm the lawyer for your source of income.

657
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:05,670
我代理我哥哥的信托基金
I represent my brother's trust.

658
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,950
他的信托基金只在你
The money from his trust was payable to you

659
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:12,180
没有面临刑事指控
conditional upon you being subject

660
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:14,390
以及精神健全时
to criminal charges of any kind

661
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,710
给你支付资金
or being ruled to be mentally incompetent.

662
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:21,250
鉴于你目前的处境
Now, in light of your current situation,

663
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:23,190
我有义务通知你
it's my duty to inform you

664
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:26,130
信托基金以后不会再给你付款了
that any further payments are to be halted.

665
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:29,240
我知道你开了一个账户
I know that you set up a bank account

666
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:31,840
供你的一个朋友上大学
for a friend of yours to go to college,

667
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:35,960
所以传达这消息并不让我开心
so I take no pleasure in relaying that.

668
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:42,030
我过去曾经同情过你
I used to feel sorry for you.

669
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:47,630
身为一个反社会自恋狂的血亲
The blood relative of a narcissist sociopath.

670
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:51,000
永远都是他的出气包
Permanent punching bag.

671
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:54,620
受制于他的金钱
Handcuffed to his wallet.

672
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,080
但现在
But now...

673
01:20:58,390 --> 01:21:01,600
我认清你了
I can see you for what you really are.

674
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:09,210
你只不过是懦弱版的他
You're just the jellyfish version of him.

675
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,910
除了没骨气  其他都一样
Everything but the spine.

676
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:21,470
你可以对此发起诉讼
I mean, you can try to litigate it,

677
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:24,700
但那会花很多钱
but that's going to be an expensive option.

678
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:26,360
我觉得那行不通
I can't see it working.

679
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:31,840
不过
However...

680
01:21:36,650 --> 01:21:38,600
如果你签署这份文件
if you sign this document and forfeit

681
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,520
放弃你那部分信托基金
your share of the trust,

682
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,730
那情况就好多了
it'll be a lot cleaner.

683
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:57,150
或者还有一个
Or there's one option

684
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,260
摆平一切的办法
where this all goes away.

685
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,990
同意生下孩子
Agree to have the baby...

686
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:09,410
回到他身边
and go back to him.

687
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,020
你真以为他不知道
You really think he didn't know

688
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:16,570
你在偷偷吃避孕药吗
you were secretly using birth control?

689
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:18,540
他当然知道
Of course he did.

690
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:21,270
你应该知道他会发现的
You should have known he'd find out.

691
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,130
你和我一样了解他
You knew him as well as I did.

692
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:29,310
他把避孕药换掉了
He replaced them with something else.

693
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:33,170
你以为自己在吃避孕药  可惜不是
You only thought you were taking birth control pills.

694
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:38,970
无论要付出什么代价  他都会找到你的
He was always going to find you no matter what he had to do.

695
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:43,270
他需要你  因为你不需要他
He needs you because you don't need him.

696
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:45,420
没人离开过他
No one's ever left him before.

697
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:48,610
但他现在惩罚你惩罚够了
But he's punished you enough now.

698
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:51,910
现在他知道你怀上他的孩子了
Now that he knows you're the mother of his child.

699
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:54,940
是时候结束游戏了
It's time to stop playing games.

700
01:22:57,950 --> 01:23:01,270
只要打一通电话
A new life with him can be given to you

701
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:03,600
你就能和他一起获得新生
with one phone call.

702
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:07,840
与你和阿德里安以前的生活一样
A life just like your old one with Adrian.

703
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:11,740
塞西莉亚  你现在别无选择
Cecilia, you don't really have the choice right now.

704
01:23:12,030 --> 01:23:14,440
现在你是杀人犯
Right now you're a murderer.

705
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:18,160
但我可以改变现状
But I can change that.

706
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,730
阿德里安杀了我妹妹
Adrian killed my sister,

707
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:39,840
你帮了他
and you helped him.

708
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:48,700
我不指望你现在做出决定
I don't expect you to make a decision right now.

709
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:54,930
三天后我再来
I can come back in three days.

710
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:01,850
在那之前老实点
Be good to yourself until then.

711
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:03,520
我们会看着的
We'll be watching.

712
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:10,630
拿上你的雨伞
Grab your umbrella.

713
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:12,630
拿上你的雨衣  拿上你的雨鞋
Grab your rain jacket. Grab your rain boots.

714
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:13,650
你会用得上的
You're gonna need it.

715
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:15,480
之后几天都会用得上
You'll need them for a couple days.

716
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,570
最近的天气将持续
This pattern we're in stays put.

717
01:24:17,570 --> 01:24:19,210
这片雨云直指
We've got this atmospheric river

718
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:21,910
加州中部
pointed right here at central California.

719
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:24,800
这就意味着本周接下来的几天
And that means we're gonna keep it cloudy and rainy

720
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,520
将继续多云多雨
as we get through the rest of the week.

721
01:24:26,530 --> 01:24:28,500
冷湿气流持续袭来
This is a lot of moisture coming in.

722
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,130
本周后半将会
It's going to mean heavy rainfall

723
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:31,800
出现强降雨
and flash flooding concerns

724
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,470
并可能山洪爆发
right as we get to the end of the week.

725
01:24:33,470 --> 01:24:35,910
我们要等到周末
It's not until the weekend that we get our next chance

726
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,800
降水才可能停止
of seeing some dry conditions.

727
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:39,770
实际上  下一个晴天
In fact, the next glimpse of sunshine even

728
01:24:39,770 --> 01:24:42,000
要等到周日下午
doesn't come until Sunday afternoon

729
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,760
那时气温将达到十六度左右
when temperatures hit the mid-60s.

730
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,410
但在那之前  气温会很凉爽
But until then, it's going to be cool,

731
01:24:45,410 --> 01:24:47,340
空气湿度大...
it's going to be damp, it's going to be...

732
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:09,420
张开嘴
Open your mouth.

733
01:25:10,650 --> 01:25:11,560
抬起舌头
Tongue up.

734
01:25:12,730 --> 01:25:13,740
放下舌头
Tongue down.

735
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:17,220
好的  晚安
Okay. Good night.

736
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:33,550
你得不到孩子
You won't get the baby.

737
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:37,230
也得不到我
And you won't get me.

738
01:26:47,290 --> 01:26:48,440
找到你了
There you are.

739
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:57,620
你去死
Fuck you!

740
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:06,720
回床上去  快点
Get back in bed. Now.

741
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:41,290
不  不
No! No!

742
01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:43,090
拜托不要
Please, no!

743
01:27:43,090 --> 01:27:44,080
不
No!

744
01:27:44,590 --> 01:27:46,500
住手  住手
Stop. Stop.

745
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:49,530
拜托不要
No, please. No.

746
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:52,580
不要  停下  停下
No, stop! No, stop.

747
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:54,080
他就在那里
He's right there.

748
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:18,750
趴下
Lay down.

749
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:20,070
他就在那里
He's right there.

750
01:28:20,610 --> 01:28:22,190
趴下
Lay down.

751
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:23,950
他就在你身后
He's right behind you.

752
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:25,580
-听我说  -谁
- Listen to me. - Who is?

753
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:27,370
他就在你身后
He's right behind you.

754
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:29,500
-转身  -我明白  塞茜莉亚
- Turn around. - I understand, Cecilia.

755
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:31,310
-他就在那里  -趴下
- He's right there. - Lay down.

756
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:33,680
听我说
Listen to me!

757
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,860
-他就在你身后  -趴着别动
- He's right behind you. - Stay down.

758
01:30:18,010 --> 01:30:19,350
-退后  -好
- Get back! - Okay.

759
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:20,310
退后
Get back!

760
01:31:20,370 --> 01:31:21,550
她在这边
She's over here!

761
01:31:22,570 --> 01:31:24,760
她在那里  去右边
She's over there! Go right!

762
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:42,330
你以为你在学怎么打败我
You think you're learning how to beat me,

763
01:32:42,330 --> 01:32:44,770
那我就教你点有用的
so I'm gonna truly teach you something.

764
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:47,520
如果你反抗我  我不会伤害你
If you fight me, I won't ever hurt you.

765
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:50,320
我会找上你爱的人  伤害他们
I'll find someone you love and hurt them instead.

766
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:55,590
现在你只能怪自己害死那个无辜的女孩了
Now you've only got yourself to blame for that innocent young girl's death.

767
01:32:55,590 --> 01:32:56,870
求你不要
No, please.

768
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:59,040
不要伤害西德尼  阿德里安  不要
Not Sydney. Adrian, no.

769
01:33:00,010 --> 01:33:01,830
别动  举起手来
Hold it! Show me your hands!

770
01:33:42,970 --> 01:33:45,500
塞茜莉亚  别做傻事
Cecilia, don't do anything stupid.

771
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:49,250
我在这边
I'm over here!

772
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:51,130
拦下她
Stop her!

773
01:33:52,110 --> 01:33:53,880
她往大门去了
Heading towards the main exit!

774
01:34:26,430 --> 01:34:29,000
搞...搞什么
What the... What the fuck?

775
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:33,250
喂  喂
Hello? Hello?

776
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:37,380
哈利  怎么回事
Harry, what's going on?

777
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:39,800
哈利
Harry.

778
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:40,800
喂
Hello?

779
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:42,450
哈利  你没事吧
Harry, are you okay?

780
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:43,450
-他没事  他没事  -什么
- He's fine. He's fine. - What?

781
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:45,140
-我保证  -你...你是谁
- I promise. - Who... who is this?

782
01:34:58,340 --> 01:34:59,380
我是詹姆斯・拉尼尔
This is James Lanier.

783
01:34:59,380 --> 01:35:00,610
詹姆斯  是我
James, it's me.

784
01:35:01,090 --> 01:35:02,630
茜  你怎么
Cee? What... How...

785
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:04,760
-你怎么能打电话  -那不重要
- How are you calling? - It doesn't matter about that.

786
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:06,970
-你必须听我说  -不  这很重要
- You have to listen to me. - No, no, it-it does matter.

787
01:35:06,970 --> 01:35:08,330
-听我说  -快点
- Listen... - Come on!

788
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:11,480
你不能打电话给我
You can't be calling me.

789
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:12,680
-詹姆斯  听我说  -听着
- James, listen to me! - Look, I...

790
01:35:12,690 --> 01:35:13,810
西德尼有生命危险
Sydney's life is in danger.

791
01:35:13,810 --> 01:35:15,050
你现在在哪里
Where are you right now?

792
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:16,670
我在工作  她在家里
I'm at work. She's at the house.

793
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:20,110
你得马上去找她  詹姆斯
Okay, you need to go to her right now, James.

794
01:35:20,110 --> 01:35:21,090
听到了吗
Do you hear me?

795
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:23,800
我担心阿德里安要伤害她
'Cause I'm afraid Adrian is gonna do something to her.

796
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:22,340
西德尼
Sydney.

797
01:37:24,690 --> 01:37:25,760
西德尼
Sydney.

798
01:37:27,610 --> 01:37:28,930
小西  你没事吧
Syd, you okay?

799
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:30,140
西德尼  西德...
Sydney, Syd...

800
01:37:54,970 --> 01:37:57,210
住手
Stop!

801
01:37:58,310 --> 01:37:59,380
不要
No!

802
01:37:59,730 --> 01:38:01,670
住手
Stop!

803
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:04,300
住手
Stop.

804
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,760
住手
Stop.

805
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:12,510
爸爸  爸爸
Dad! Dad!

806
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:14,390
不
No!

807
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:24,740
西德尼  趴下
Sydney, get down!

808
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:06,570
别哭
Don't cry.

809
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:19,540
汤姆
Tom?

810
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:11,260
有人吗
Is someone there?

811
01:40:12,030 --> 01:40:14,470
救命  救我
Help. Help.

812
01:40:15,150 --> 01:40:16,060
拜托
Please.

813
01:40:16,610 --> 01:40:18,020
-救命  -躲开
- Help! - Stand clear!

814
01:40:22,790 --> 01:40:24,560
警察  举起双手
Police! Show me your hands.

815
01:40:24,790 --> 01:40:27,650
我们的战术小队今早找到了阿德里安
Our tactical team found Adrian this morning

816
01:40:28,290 --> 01:40:30,110
被绑在他家地下室
tied up in his basement.

817
01:40:31,210 --> 01:40:34,070
看来他和你一样都是他弟弟的受害者
Looks like he was a victim of his brother just like you were.

818
01:40:36,590 --> 01:40:37,530
不
No.

819
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:40,930
不  詹姆斯
No, James.

820
01:40:40,930 --> 01:40:42,250
不是这样
That's not right.

821
01:40:42,350 --> 01:40:44,000
是阿德里安干的
Adrian did this to me.

822
01:40:49,230 --> 01:40:51,090
他才不是受害者
He is not the victim here.

823
01:40:52,940 --> 01:40:55,640
他被绑在自己家地下室
He was tied up in his basement.

824
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:57,320
他能假死
If he faked his own death,

825
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:58,780
也就能假装被绑架
he could fake his own kidnapping.

826
01:40:58,780 --> 01:41:01,410
汤姆的尸体就在我家客厅
We have Tom's body laying in my living room,

827
01:41:01,410 --> 01:41:03,950
穿着被你射成碎片的某种隐形衣
wearing some sort of suit that you shot to pieces.

828
01:41:03,950 --> 01:41:06,790
即使之前能隐形  现在也不能了
If it did work, it doesn't now.

829
01:41:06,790 --> 01:41:09,330
但精神病院有一群目击证人
But-but we have a whole bunch of corroborative witnesses

830
01:41:09,330 --> 01:41:12,920
能确认看到了奇怪的东西
from the psychiatric hospital when it comes to seeing something strange.

831
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:17,200
这是你重获自由的最佳办法  明白吗
Look, this is your best-case scenario for getting your freedom back, okay?

832
01:41:18,180 --> 01:41:19,030
不
No.

833
01:41:20,930 --> 01:41:24,100
我知道汤姆的尸体在你家客厅
I know Tom's body is in your living room.

834
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:24,920
嗯
Yeah.

835
01:41:26,930 --> 01:41:29,460
但这之前的事都是阿德里安干的
Adrian did everything before that, though.

836
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,010
他陷害了自己的亲弟弟
He set his own brother up.

837
01:41:35,030 --> 01:41:36,970
我知道这是怎么一回事  茜
I know how this works, Cee.

838
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:38,740
我知道  你不懂
I know. You don't understand.

839
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:40,680
不  是你不懂
No, you don't understand.

840
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:42,470
这就是他的手段
This is what he does.

841
01:41:43,780 --> 01:41:46,310
他让我感觉是我疯了
He makes me feel like I'm the crazy one.

842
01:41:48,830 --> 01:41:49,940
这
This is...

843
01:41:50,710 --> 01:41:52,230
这就是他的手段
This is what he does.

844
01:41:54,090 --> 01:41:55,460
现在他在故技重施
And he's doing it again.

845
01:41:55,460 --> 01:41:56,840
好吧好吧  但是听着
Okay, okay, but listen.

846
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:59,030
你不要和别人这么说
I need you to keep that to yourself

847
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:01,200
让我做我该做的
and let me do my job.

848
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:02,740
好吗
Okay?

849
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:05,100
让我帮你就好
Just let me help you.

850
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:08,130
但只要阿德里安还在  你就帮不了我
Yeah, but as long as Adrian's around, you can't help me.

851
01:42:56,820 --> 01:42:57,970
塞茜莉亚
Cecilia?

852
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:02,430
真高兴接到你的电话
I'm so glad you called.

853
01:43:44,530 --> 01:43:45,600
你看上去真迷人
You look amazing.

854
01:43:46,820 --> 01:43:49,690
我是说  你总是很迷人
I mean, you-you've always... you always look amazing.

855
01:43:50,790 --> 01:43:52,270
可我感觉很糟
I don't feel amazing.

856
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:54,730
这一切都是谎言
It's all a lie.

857
01:43:56,750 --> 01:43:57,990
快请进
Please, come on in.

858
01:43:58,630 --> 01:43:59,860
外面冷  快进来
It's cold. Come on.

859
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:27,160
我本来想简单点个外卖  但我还是
So, I-I wanted to get us some simple takeout, but, of course,

860
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:29,700
忍不住想象你会想吃什么
I-I started obsessing over what you'd be in the mood for.

861
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:32,940
所以就有了寿司  牛排和意面的强迫症自助餐
Hence, we have the OCD buffet of sushi, steak and pasta.

862
01:44:35,290 --> 01:44:37,520
或许你一点也不饿
Or you might not be hungry at all.

863
01:44:38,670 --> 01:44:42,320
这也很合理  只是这餐盛宴突然显得很愚蠢了
which is so logical that it suddenly makes this feast look moronic.

864
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:44,070
我选牛排
I'll have steak.

865
01:44:44,590 --> 01:44:45,780
好极了
That's a good choice.

866
01:44:56,890 --> 01:44:57,960
我的手在抖
My hand's shaking.

867
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:08,780
你是世界上唯一一个
You know, you're the only person in the world

868
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:10,270
能看我手抖的人
who gets to see my hand shake.

869
01:45:12,870 --> 01:45:14,900
这是因为我需要你  塞茜莉亚
It's 'cause I need you, Cecilia.

870
01:45:17,250 --> 01:45:19,250
我知道以前
I know I didn't treat you the way

871
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:20,650
我不应该
you should have been treated

872
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:22,690
那么对待你
when we were together.

873
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:26,160
但我吸取教训了
But I've learned my lesson.

874
01:45:29,260 --> 01:45:33,790
我愿意把一切都付之一炬来向你证明这一点
I would burn everything I own just to prove that to you.

875
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,500
好
Okay.

876
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:43,290
好
Okay.

877
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:49,890
如果你想陪伴这个孩子成长
If you want to be a part of this child's life...

878
01:45:52,950 --> 01:45:55,100
首先你必须要对我坦诚
it has to start with honesty.

879
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:57,100
当然
Of course.

880
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:07,360
这意味着我需要你承认你做过的一切
Which means I need you to admit everything that you did.

881
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:13,040
是你做的
That it was you,

882
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:16,160
不是你弟弟
not your brother.

883
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:20,290
是你
You.

884
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:24,130
塞茜莉亚
Cecilia.

885
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:29,680
我爱我弟弟
I loved my brother.

886
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:32,390
我以为他也爱我
And I thought he loved me, too.

887
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:38,520
我知道在外人看来可能不是这样  但是
I know it didn't seem like it to the outside world, but...

888
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,530
汤姆控制了我
Tom controlled me.

889
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,490
告诉我真相
Just tell me the truth.

890
01:46:48,050 --> 01:46:52,370
我得知道我没有疯  好吗
I need to know that I'm not crazy, okay?

891
01:46:57,350 --> 01:46:59,930
而且我们不能用谎言开始新生活
And we can't start this with a lie.

892
01:46:59,930 --> 01:47:02,500
但我没说谎
But I'm not starting with a lie.

893
01:47:05,650 --> 01:47:07,340
不是我
It wasn't me.

894
01:47:08,070 --> 01:47:09,780
我发誓
I swear it.

895
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:11,970
你为什么就不能告诉我真相呢
Why can't you just tell me the truth?

896
01:47:13,030 --> 01:47:14,610
我说了
I am.

897
01:47:14,620 --> 01:47:16,350
阿德里安  别
Adrian, stop.

898
01:47:20,450 --> 01:47:23,650
我需要你为我这么做
I need you to do this for me.

899
01:47:26,130 --> 01:47:27,360
不仅如此
More than that,

900
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:28,990
也是为了你自己  阿德里安
do it for you, Adrian.

901
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:34,950
我就是在照你说的做  塞茜莉亚
I'm giving you exactly what you're asking for, Cecilia.

902
01:47:36,850 --> 01:47:40,830
我在告诉你真相
I am telling you the truth.

903
01:47:50,690 --> 01:47:52,760
不  不  不
Oh, no, no, no.

904

I know that you feel like you're going insane sometimes.

905
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:04,690
但我是唯一能帮你的人
But I'm the only one who can help you.

906
01:48:04,870 --> 01:48:06,110
还记得吗
Remember?

907
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:10,280
因为我比这世上任何一个人都了解你
Because I know you better than anyone else in the world.

908
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:13,320
我说
I mean...

909
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:16,580
这应该不算
that shouldn't come as a...

当然
Of course.

01:50:03,910 --> 01:50:06,350
不  不  不
No! No, no.

914

不  你做了什么
No, no. What did you do?

919

他自杀了
He killed himself.

928

他割开了自己的喉咙
He cut his own throat.

929
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:42,120
有监控录像可以证明
There's security camera video of it.

930
01:51:54,690 --> 01:51:55,940
你压根就没想过

01:51:55,940 --> 01:51:58,420
要让他在录音里认罪  对吗
admitting anything on tape, did you?

932
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:00,590
我当然想过
Of course I did.

933
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:04,850
我只是不知道他情绪这么不稳定
I just didn't know he was that unstable.

934
01:52:12,290 --> 01:52:13,610
