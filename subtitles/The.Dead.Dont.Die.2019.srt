or are acting unusually skittish and aggressive.

283
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,190
下面是来自哈里斯维尔的报道
Here's a report from Harrisville.

284
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,070
你看看
Look at this.

285
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:40,120
我就是找不到我的猫  她叫彩虹
I mean, I just couldn't find my cat, Rainbow.

286
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,490
等我终于找到她了
And when I finally did find her,

287
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,500
她居然在房子底下
she was under the house.

288
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,580
她以前从来没有这样过
She's never done that before.

289
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,720
平时她不是这样的
She's not usually like that.

290
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,000
她很温柔...
She's very gentle and...

291
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,630
真奇怪  你们去哪了
That's so strange. Where are you guys?

292
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,880
她的眼中充满狂野
too, and she had this wild look in her eye,

293
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,430
等我好不容易把她弄出来了
and when I finally tried to pull her out,

294
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,520
她就像野兽一样  把我抓得遍体鳞伤
she scratched me all to shreds, like a wild animal.

295
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,770
太可怕了  我知道...
That's so creepy. I knew...

296
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,100
切回来了
We're back?

297
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,150
大家好
Hello.

298
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,480
太奇怪了  似乎各地都在发生这种情况
That is strange, and it seems to be happening all over.

299
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,360
十一点会有更多报道
We'll have more reports at 11:00.

300
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,880
这里是森特维尔新闻七台
But for now, this is Posie Juarez

301
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,320
普瓦泽·华雷斯为您报道
for Centerville 7 News.

302
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,370
请注意安全
Stay safe...

303
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,990
并保持警惕
and keep your eyes open.

304
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,040
拉姆斯菲尔德
Rumsfeld.

305
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,750
拉姆斯菲尔德  过来
Rumsfeld. Here, boy.

306
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:32,960
你到底去哪了
Where the hell are you?

307
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,720
该死的狗
Goddamn dog.

308
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,720
拉姆斯菲尔德  你在外面吗
Rumsfeld? You out here?

309
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,610
拉姆斯菲尔德  你在那干什么
Rumsfeld, what you doing over there?

310
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,940
快给我进来
Get your ass inside.

311
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,190
快点  蠢狗
Come on, stupid.

312
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,200
你要干什么
What are you doing?

313
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,040
该死的
Goddamn it.

314
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,960
我操
Holy shit.

315
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,540
谁他妈偷走了我的牛
Who stole my fucking cows?

316
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,590
我的鸡都去哪了
Where the hell are my chickens?

317
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,770
弗兰克的牛
Frank's cows.

318
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,520
去森林里吧  女士们
Into the woods, ladies.

319
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,190
欢迎来到我的世界
Welcome to my world.

320
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,990
该死的  马洛里
Damn it, Mallory.

321
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,290
就算死了你身上都有霞多丽白葡萄酒的气味
Even dead, you reek of chardonnay.

322
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,420
廉价的霞多丽
Cheap chardonnay.

323
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,550
她看上去如何
How's she looking?

324
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,930
反正她不会再衰老了
Well, she's not getting any older.

325
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,940
这个餐馆的咖啡
The diner sure makes

326
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,520
绝对是世界第一  对吧
the world's best coffee, doesn't it?

327
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,770
但是你怎么这么晚了还在喝
Yeah, but how can you drink it so late?

328
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,610
-不会睡不着吗  -不会  我的睡眠如婴儿一般
- Won't it keep you up? - No, I sleep like a baby.

329
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:21,070
除了办公室里有一具尸体在等我的时候
Except maybe when I know there's a corpse waiting for me at work.

330
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,570
对了
Oh, y-yeah.

331
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,880
克里夫  拉特罗布的验尸官
Cliff, is the coroner from Latrobe

332
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,110
明天会来接她吗
gonna pick her up tomorrow?

333
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,460
独自守着马洛里逐渐腐败的尸体
It's getting a little creepy being here alone

334
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,700
感觉越来越吓人了
with Mallory decomposing in there.

335
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,620
明天他们应该会来接走她
Yeah, they're supposed to come pick her up tomorrow morning.

336
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,210
谢天谢地
Thank God.

337
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,000
为什么不能送她去殡仪馆
I don't know why she can't be over at the funeral home.

338
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,460
因为她要埋在拉特罗布的波特墓园
'Cause she's going to Potter's Field in Latrobe.

339
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,340
而且我们新来的不同寻常的殡葬员
And 'cause our new unusual undertaker,

340
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,480
温斯顿女士手上已经有两个被闪电劈死的
Ms. Winston, has got those two golfers

341
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,890
高尔夫球手了  罗根夫妇
that were struck by lightning... the Logans.

342
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,190
谢谢  罗尼
Thanks, Ronnie.

343
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,990
没这个必要  不过
It's not really necessary, but...

344
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,130
我可以送你回家吗  明迪
Can I, uh, drive you home, Mindy?

345
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,160
同样没必要  罗尼  你知道我是开车来的
Also not necessary, Ronnie. You know I have my car here.

346
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,490
是啊
Oh, yeah.

347
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,450
-普锐斯开着如何  -挺好
- How is the Prius running? - Fine.

348
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,620
你那辆Smart挤得下两个人吗
Can you even fit two people in that little Smart car of yours?

349
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,540
当然了  两个人刚刚好
Well, yeah. Holds two nicely.

350
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,010
太阳还不下山让我很不踏实
This daylight thing is bothering me.

351
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,130
真奇怪
It's strange.

352
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:27,900
我能说什么呢
Well, what can I say?

353
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,970
最近这个世界是挺奇怪的
The world is kind of strange lately.

354
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,510
确实
Yeah, it sure is.

355
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,640
要我说的话  不会有好结局
If you ask me, this whole thing is gonna end badly.

356
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,150
你到底是什么意思  罗尼
So, what exactly do you mean, Ronnie?

357
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,370
说不好
Don't know.

358
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,860
只是有种预感
Just a feeling, I guess.

359
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,360
强烈的预感
Strong feeling.

360
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,900
天呐
Oh, boy.

361
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,160
克里夫  你一个人值夜班没问题吗
You okay doing the whole night shift alone, Cliff?

362
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,410
嗯  我可以睡一会儿
Yeah, I can take a nap.

363
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,250
我可以躺在隔壁牢房里
I mean, I can just lie down in that other cell

364
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,580
挨着老马洛里
next to old Mallory.

365
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,040
天啊
Oh, God.

366
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,710
挨着她的尸体吗
Next to her... her dead body?

367
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,340
或许会回忆起一些往事
Might bring back some old memories.

368
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,640
明天见
See you guys tomorrow.

369
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,770
-再见  克里夫  -明天见  警长
- See you, Cliff. - Yeah, see you tomorrow, Chief.

370
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,230
"不会有好结局"
"This is all gonna end badly."

371
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,400
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

372
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,370
我从孩提时代就认识马洛里·奥布莱恩了
I knew Mallory O'Brien since I was a kid.

373
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,670
信不信由你
And believe it or not,

374
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,790
她当年也美艳极了
sh-she was a pretty young thing, too.

375
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,790
拜托
Please.

376
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,790
不好意思  但是能摆脱那个老酒鬼真是太好了
Sorry, but good riddance to that drunken old goat.

377
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,500
别这么说  弗恩
Well, I-I-I don't know, Fern.

378
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,840
天呐  我得走了
Geez, I got to get up out of here.

379
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,590
我明天一早还要去五金店
I-I got to, uh, get to the hardware store early tomorrow morning.

380
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,970
二位女士  我们明天再见
I'm looking forward to seeing you ladies tomorrow.

381
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,490
保重  汉克
Take care, Hank.

382
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,940
晚安  汉克  祝你好梦
Good night, Hank. Sweet dreams.

383
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,020
汉克真是个绅士
Hank is such a gentleman.

384
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,360
没错
Sure is.

385
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,530
我还是赶紧开始打扫吧
Well, I better get started cleaning here.

386
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,240
听着  莉莉
Listen, Lily.

387
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,090
我一直特别想问你那个外国女人的事
I've been dying to ask you about that new foreign woman

388
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,660
就是那个接管殡仪馆的人
that took over the funeral home.

389
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:16,950
她叫什么名字
What's her name?

390
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,180
她叫泽尔达·温斯顿
Her name is Zelda Winston.

391
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,000
她确实很古怪
And she's strange, for sure.

392
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,220
她那双眼睛非常奇怪
And she's got these, like, really weird eyes,

393
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,000
好像能直接看透你
like she's, like, looking right through you.

394
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,210
不过她付钱很大方
She pays me really well, though.

395
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,050
泽尔达  这是什么鬼名字
Zelda. What-what kind of name is that?

396
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,770
不知道
I don't know.

397
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,390
她大概是爱尔兰或苏格兰人吧
She's probably, like, Irish or Scottish or whatever.

398
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,610
而且她说话的腔调也很怪
And she talks really funny, though,

399
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,810
所以有时候说什么我也听不懂
so I don't always get it right.

400
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,220
不过我喜欢泽尔达这个名字
But I like the name Zelda.

401
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:43,190
让我想起了泽尔达·菲茨杰拉德
It reminds me of, um, Zelda Fitzgerald.

402
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,520
那是谁
Who's that?

403
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,280
《了不起的盖茨比》的作者的老婆
That's Great Gatsby's wife.

404
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,440
那又是谁
And who's that?

405
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,610
1920年代一个超有钱的人
That's the really rich guy from the 1920s.

406
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,780
罗伯特·雷德福演的那个人
The Robert Redford guy.

407
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,420
不管怎样  她接管以后
Well, anyway, so what's it like over there

408
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,140
那些密室里情况如何
in those secret rooms since she took over?

409
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,890
里面有很可怕的密室
Well, there's these, like, really creepy back rooms,

410
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,750
所有的尸体都锁在那里面
you know, where they, like, keep all the stiffs.

411
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,920
旁边放着一个巨大的金佛
And then next to that, there's this big golden Buddha.

412
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,150
什么玩意
A what, now?

413
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,470
一个巨大的闪闪发光的金佛
There's a big, shiny, golden Buddha.

414
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,940
然后架子上还放了
And then there's these, like,

415
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,470
几把很古老的武士刀
old-looking samurai swords on a rack.

416
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,770
真的吗
Really?

417
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,610
阿弥陀佛
Amituofo.

418
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,920
真奇怪
That's peculiar.

419
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,560
你们别乱动  好吗
Now, stay put, will you?

705
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:52,330
但是发生的事听起来就像是
But what happened sounds like the start of

706
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:55,370
-恐怖电影的序章  -确实
- a gruesome horror film. - Sure does.

707
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,630
真的一点都不好玩  杰罗尼莫
Really, really not funny, Geronimo.

708
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:03,630
你们听说餐馆发生的可怕谋杀案了吗
You guys hear about those grisly murders at the diner?

709
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,380
嗯  我们正在聊这个
Yeah. Just talking about them.

710
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,260
可怕
Creepy.

711
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:10,030
我一直在听广播
I've been listening to the radio,

712
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:11,930
肯定是活死人干的
and I'm sure it's the undead, yo.

713
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:15,110
地球由于水力压裂开采偏离了自转轴
Reanimated by the Earth being thrown off its axis

714
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,560
于是死人复活了
from the polar fracking.

715
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:18,140
你想说什么
What are you saying?

716
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:20,150
我想说
I'm saying...

717
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:23,650
僵尸末日要来了  宝贝
full-on zombie apocalypse, baby.

718
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,000
很快它们就会成群结队地出现
Soon, there'll be hordes of them.

719
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,210
-杰罗尼莫  -靠
- Geronimo. - Shit.

720
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:30,280
你又想失去特权了是吧
Do you want to lose your privileges again?

721
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,070
不是  警官
No, sir.

722
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:33,580
那就走吧
Then let's go.

723
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,450
不可理喻
Unbelievable.

Cliff, why'd they used to separate

小孩的坟墓跟大人的坟墓分开
the children's graves from the adults'?

727
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,280
不知道  可能是十九世纪的习俗吧
Don't know. Some kind of a 19th-century thing.

728
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,160
感觉这主意不怎么样
Seems like a bad idea somehow.

729
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,790

Yeah. So, what exactly are we looking for here? Zombies?

730
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:33,890

Look over here.

Here's another one.

老天  一定不会有好结局
Oh, man. This isn't gonna end well.

733
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,870

Goddamn it.

734

食尸鬼
Ghouls.

735
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,660
这是复活的活死人
This is undead, reanimated,

736
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,940
吃人肉的僵尸
full-on, flesh-eating zombie shit.

737
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:30,470
毫无疑问
No question.

738

我本来该退休了
I was supposed to retire.

739

-两年前就该退休了  -我知道
- Two years ago. - I know.

-为什么不呢  -什么
- Why didn't you? - What?

为什么不两年前退休
Retire two years ago.

我们这是在即兴表演吗
Are we improvising here?

743

不是  随便问问
No, I was just asking.

744

But I probably know the answer anyway.

745

可能吧
Probably. Yeah.

746

应该是吧
I guess so.

750
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,840

Because we passed Farmer Miller's place a little while ago.

751
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,150
我们要去通知他吗
Do we need to inform him?

752
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:34,530
去他的农夫米勒
Fuck Farmer Miller.

753
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,160

Really?

他也是森特维尔的居民啊
He is a citizen of Centerville.

00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:43,280
你说得对
You're right.

756
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,290
让明迪打电话通知他吧
We'll have Mindy call him.

好的
Oh, okay.

758
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:02,780
罗尼  该怎么杀死一个僵尸呢
So, Ronnie, how the fuck do you kill a zombie?

759
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:05,020
你得把头砍下来
Well, you got to kill the head.

760
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,290
-"把头砍下来"  -对
- "Kill the head." - Yeah.

761
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:11,510
用什么手段都行  把头砍下来
By any means necessary, kill the head.

762
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,010
斩首  这是杀死它们的唯一方法
Decapitate. It's the only way to kill them.

763
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,670
老天
Jesus.

764
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:26,300
唯一能够真正阻止僵尸的方法
And that's really the only way to stop zombies,

765
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:28,350
就是砍掉它的头  汉克
is to kill the head, Hank.

766
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:33,910
我知道这很吓人  但是必须把头完全砍下来
I know it's gruesome, but complete decapitation.

767
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:39,000
不管你是用弯刀  钢丝
Doesn't matter if you use a-a machete, steel wire,

768
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,260
还是大剪刀  无所谓
hedge clippers, whatever.

769
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,890
只要切断脊柱就行  懂吗
Just as long as the spinal cord is severed, right?

770
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,640
头也要砍下来
And the head... is cut off.

771
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:52,810
就这样  死个彻底
And that's it. De-animated.

772
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,350
杀死死人的唯一方法
Only way to kill the dead:

773
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,490
把头砍下来
kill the head.

我不确定那就是僵尸
I-I'm not so sure it was zombies.

776
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:11,140
你说它们吃了莉莉和弗恩的肉
You said they ate Lily and Fern's flesh.

777
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:14,940
一般而言  它们会吃大脑
Usually, they go for the brains.

778
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,910
这有点不寻常  但是
It's unusual, but...

779
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,330
它还是会吃人
it's still cannibals, man.

780
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:26,010
绝对是僵尸  好吗
Definitely zombies. Okay?

781
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,880
汉克  你可以相信我
Hank, you can trust me.

782
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,160
我看过几乎所有的僵尸电影
I've seen almost every zombie film ever made.

Yeah, you're right.

你俩是串通一气的吧
Are you in this together?

879
01:01:57,890 --> 01:02:00,760
这样真的很不合适
I mean, this is really inappropriate.

880
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:03,070
我的天啊
Oh, good grief.

881

反正我们之中得有人...在社区内巡逻

如果这样有帮助的话

01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:07,810
会的
Oh, aye.

992
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:09,190
别担心
No bother.

993
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:10,500
当然会
Certainly.

994
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:12,070
如果还没坏的话
Yeah, if it still works.

995
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:14,140
我不确定
I don't know.

996
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:18,520
这有些不同寻常  不是吗  克里夫
That would be a little unusual, wouldn't it, Cliff?

997
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:22,050
特殊情况特殊处理  不是吗
Well, this is a highly unusual situation we're in, is it not,

998
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:23,720
克里夫德·罗伯特森警长
Chief Clifford Robertson?

999
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:29,250
或许我们稍后可以在墓园汇合
Perhaps we could all meet up again in a wee while in the cemetery.

1000
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:36,990
好的  我觉得没问题
Yeah, it's okay. I guess it's okay.

1001
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:38,320
我们出发吧
Let's go, guys.

1002
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,080
巡逻车上还有些武器
We've got some more weapons in the patrol car.

1003
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,420
不好意思  罗纳德·皮特森警官
Excuse me, Officer Ronald Peterson.

1004
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:43,650
我可以请求借用
Might I request that I have

1005
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:45,830
你的交通工具吗
the use of your own personal vehicle?

1006
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,380
好的
Okay.

1007
01:11:57,530 --> 01:11:58,690
《星球大战》
Star Wars.

1008
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:00,550
绝佳的科幻片
Excellent fiction.

1009
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:04,440
是那辆...
It's the, uh...

1010
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,190
红色的敞篷Smart吗
Red convertible Smart car?

1011
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:07,090
是的
Yes.

1012
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:18,010
路上小心
Mind how you go.

1013
01:12:52,290 --> 01:12:54,040
慢一点  克里夫
Slow down a second, Cliff.

1014
01:12:58,490 --> 01:12:59,500
不好意思
Excuse me.

1015
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:04,110
棒
Yes.

1016
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,060
把头砍下来
Kill the head.

1017
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:28,430
他们会被生前熟悉的事物所吸引
They gravitate towards things they did when they were alive.

1018
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:30,080
嗯
Yeah.

1019
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,190
网球女孩还挺可爱的
Tennis girl's kind of cute.

1020
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,840
天呐  克里夫
Geez, Cliff.

1021
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:40,270
这太诡异了
This is way too creepy.

1022
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:56,400
天啊
Oh, God.

1023
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:58,420
我认识这些小孩
I know those kids.

1024
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:01,320
但是他们都死了
But they're all dead.

1025
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,850
小心  克里夫
Watch it, Cliff.

1026
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:16,260
你一定要这样吗
Did you have to do that?

1027
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:18,640
不好意思  我没看见他
I'm sorry. I didn't see him.

1028
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:20,470
无所谓的  明迪
Well, it doesn't matter, Mindy.

1029
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:22,020
他们已经死了
They're already dead.

1030
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:25,010
准确来说  是活死人
Well, undead, to be precise.

1031
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:26,300
复活了
Reanimated.

1032
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:32,590
该死的闯入者
Fucking trespasser.

1033
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:34,400
去死吧
Kiss your ass goodbye.

1034
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:44,310
该死  他们都是从哪冒出来的
Shit, where are they all coming from?

1035
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,940
看起来没什么动静
It seems pretty quiet.

1036
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:14,970
不过三号房间的门是开着的  我去看看
But door number three is open, so I'm gonna check it out.

1037
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:16,870
我们一起去
Let's both check it out.

1038
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:19,000
我也一起去
Well, I'm coming, too.

1039
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:40,180
太惨了
That's bad.

1040
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:51,250
{\an8}丧尸未逝

1041
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,450
斯特吉尔·辛普森
Sturgill Simpson.

1042
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:16,640
天啊
Oh, my God.

1043
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:21,160
你为什么要这么做
Why did you do that?

1044
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:25,470
他们不是僵尸
They're not zombies.

1045
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:29,750
他们不过是死人而已
They're just dead people.

1046
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:32,250
目前他们只是死了的潮人而已
Well, yeah, for now, they're still just dead hipsters,

1047
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,970
还没转变成僵尸
but they haven't turned yet.

1048
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:35,490
需要一点时间
It can take a while.

1049
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,350
他说得对  明迪
He's right, Mindy.

1050
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:41,260
现在他们才是...
Now they're just...

1051
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,280
死透了的克利夫兰潮人
dead hipsters from Cleveland.

1052
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:49,230
天啊
Oh, my God.

1053
01:17:49,230 --> 01:17:50,420
我受不了
I can't.

1054
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,050
天啊
My God.

1055
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:28,890
看看你们
Well, look at all of you.

1056
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,760
饥渴贪婪
So very ravenous,

1057
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,360
但是早就该死了
yet well past your expiration date.

1058
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:53,380
天呐  好好瞧瞧这俩
Oh, man. Get a load of these two.

1059
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:56,580
咖啡
Coffee.

1060
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:59,370
咖啡
Coffee.

1061
01:18:59,690 --> 01:19:01,360
咖啡
Coffee.

1062
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:15,090
{\an8}丧尸未逝

1063
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,030
天啊
Oh, God.

1064
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:27,900
又是这首歌
Not that again.

1065
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:30,850
斯特吉尔·辛普森
Sturgill Simpson.

Goddamn it. I can't take any more.

1073
01:20:00,690 --> 01:20:02,670
有些冲动啊  克里夫
That was irrational, Cliff.

1074
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:38,250
操  你觉得汉克和鲍比·威金斯还在里面吗
Fuck. Do you think Hank and Bobby Wiggins are still in there?

1075
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:44,380
我们要去救他们出来吗
Should we try to get 'em out?

1076
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:48,090
克里夫  我们吸引了一些注意力
Cliff, we're drawing some attention.

1077
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:50,150
天啊  克里夫
Oh, God, Cliff.

1078
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,770
快带我们离开
Please get us out of here.

1079
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:56,170
求你了  克里夫
Please, Cliff. Please.

1080
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,390
应该能撑住
That should hold.

1081
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:05,980
该死的僵尸  鲍比
Goddamn zombies, Bobby.

1082
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:23,850
我认识他们
I know those guys.

1083
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:26,120
他们是我最好的顾客
They were two of my best customers.

1084
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:27,440
对  古德兄弟
Yeah, yeah, the Good brothers.

1085
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,520
崔维斯·古德和达拉斯·古德
Travis and Dallas Good.

1086
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,340
以前死于一场车祸
They died in a car crash some time back.

1087
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:34,560
该死
Oh, shit.

1088
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:36,780
我想起他们了
Yeah, now I remember those guys.

1089
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:39,310
古德兄弟
The Good brothers.

1090
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,980
他们很会弹吉他
They were really good guitar pickers.

1091
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:45,040
没错  就好像他们是
That's right. It's-it's like they came out of the birth canal

1092
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,140
抱着吉他出生的
with guitars in their hands.

1093
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:52,530
我觉得你救了我的命
I think you saved my life, man.

1094
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:55,240
别客气  汉克
No worries, Hank.

1095
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:02,710
该死
Shit.

1096
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:05,760
-怎么了  -该死的后门
- What? - The fucking back door.

1097
01:22:06,370 --> 01:22:07,930
通向储藏室的后门
The back door to the storage room.

1098
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:10,240
-什么  -这边
- What? - Here.

1099
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:16,220
天啊  鲍比
Jesus, Bobby.

1100
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:18,190
该死
Shit.

1101
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,780
太多了  汉克
There's way too many, Hank.

1102
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:27,470
这就是场噩梦  鲍比
This here is a nightmare, Bobby.

1103
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:29,250
我们死定了  伙计
We're goners, man.

1104
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:31,900
操
Fuck.

1105
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,890
快点  给我
Come on. Give me that!

1106
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:17,160
真是想不到
Well, I'll be a monkey's ass.

1107
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:20,520
报应终于来了
It's finally payback time.

1108
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:23,370
你们这些该死的难民  我要把你们都抓起来
You goddamn refugees! I'll get all of you!

1109
01:23:23,370 --> 01:23:25,150
你们要为此付出代价
You're gonna pay for this!

1110
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:30,690
滚出我的地盘
Get off my property!

1111
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:35,620
这鸡确实好吃
This is good chicken.

1112
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:40,500
该死的
Damn it!

1113
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:04,980
你不下去看看吗
You want to get out and check?

1114
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:10,650
还是算了吧
I'd-I'd rather not.

1115
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:15,750
真是太美妙了  不是吗
Well, that's perfect, isn't it?

1116
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,740
身处该死的墓园
Right in the middle of the fucking cemetery.

1117
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:20,880
一点也不美妙
No, it isn't perfect.

1118
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:24,390
你为什么要开车碾它们
Why did you run over them?

1119
01:24:28,210 --> 01:24:32,120
它们不是普通的行人
They are not ordinary pedestrians.

1120
01:24:46,410 --> 01:24:48,830
绝对不会有好结局
This is definitely gonna end badly.

1121
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:54,210
闭嘴  罗尼
Shut up, Ronnie.

1122
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:57,930
不  你闭嘴
No, you shut up.

1123
01:24:59,550 --> 01:25:01,370
闭嘴  罗尼
Shut up, Ronnie!

1124
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:04,520
别吵了好吗
Please stop fighting.

1125
01:25:04,610 --> 01:25:06,220
拜托
Please.

1126
01:25:07,490 --> 01:25:09,270
明迪
Mindy.

1127
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,760
明迪
Mindy...

1128
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:18,770
是我奶奶
It's my grandmother.

1129
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:23,210
天啊  奶奶
Oh, God, Granny.

1130
01:25:23,210 --> 01:25:25,070
-明迪  明迪  -不
- Mindy, Mindy. - No.

1131
01:25:25,070 --> 01:25:26,790
明迪  振作点
Mindy, get it together.

1132
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,400
它生前是你奶奶
It was your grandmother.

1133
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:36,340
我受不了了
I can't take this anymore.

1134
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:38,170
我撑不下去了
I can't do it!

1135
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:40,870
我受够了这场噩梦
I'm done with this nightmare.

1136
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:44,670
奶奶  我来了
Granny, I'm coming.

1137
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:46,710
-我来了  -明迪
- I'm coming. - Mindy?

1138
01:25:46,710 --> 01:25:48,810
不  明迪  不要
No, Mindy! No, don't!

1139
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,880
不
Oh, no!

1140
01:26:00,470 --> 01:26:02,480
我操
Holy fuck.

1141
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:04,760
上帝保佑我们
God help us.

1142
01:26:40,510 --> 01:26:42,020
森特维尔
Centerville.

1143
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:43,940
美国
USA.

1144
01:26:47,710 --> 01:26:50,040
一个好地方
A real nice place.

1145
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:05,440
真是台有趣的小机器
What an amusing little machine.

1146
01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:14,650
这位挺好玩的
Here's a curious one.

1147
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:24,060
你好啊
Hello there.

1148
01:27:25,650 --> 01:27:27,300
时尚
Fashion.

1149
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:32,590
我可以明确告诉你  这条格子裙不适合你
I can assure you that is not your tartan.

1150
01:27:34,710 --> 01:27:36,630
不过脖子挺好看的
Nice neck, though.

1151
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:02,860
来吧  我知道躲在哪里最安全
Come on. I know a safe place we can hide.

1152
01:28:15,110 --> 01:28:16,440
该死
Oh, shit.

1153
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:19,000
那是丹尼·珀金斯吗  这边的
Is that Danny Perkins? Over here.

1154
01:28:21,890 --> 01:28:23,940
看起来是他没错
Sure looks like him.

1155
01:28:30,770 --> 01:28:33,610
罗尼  抱歉我发脾气了
I'm sorry, Ronnie, if I've lost it.

1156
01:28:34,650 --> 01:28:36,310
没关系  克里夫
It's okay, Cliff.

1157
01:28:37,210 --> 01:28:38,980
不过我得说
But I got to say,

1158
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:43,630
自从开始发生这些怪事
you have been acting a lot different

1159
01:28:43,630 --> 01:28:46,640
你就变得很不一样
since all this weird shit started happening.

1160
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:48,910
你想说什么  克里夫
What-what are you saying, Cliff?

1161
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:53,670
我想说你看起来异常地沉着
I'm saying that you seem so oddly controlled.

1162
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:55,950
见鬼了
I mean, shit.

1163
01:28:57,140 --> 01:29:01,530
我只是在用自己的方式应对
Well, I'm just, you know, dealing with it in my own way.

1164
01:29:03,730 --> 01:29:06,580
不过我一直在跟你说  不会有好结局
But I've been telling you this is all gonna end badly.

1165
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:09,340
该死的  罗尼
Goddamn it, Ronnie.

1166
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,270
我能问你一个问题吗
May I ask you a question?

1167
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,890
当然  尽管问吧
Sure. Ask away.

1168
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:28,100
你确实一直在说
You have been saying

1169
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:33,280
不会有好结局  从一开始就说了
that this is all gonna end badly, from the very beginning,

1170
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:34,970
说了一遍又一遍
over and over.

1171
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:41,230
你他妈怎么能这么肯定
So, what made you so fucking sure of that?

1172
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:45,520
你怎么能事先知道一切
How did you know everything in advance?

1173
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:47,920
你真的想知道吗
Do you really want to know?

1174
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,450
对
Yes!

1175
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:51,830
我想知道  我真的想知道
I want to know. I really want to know!

1176
01:29:51,830 --> 01:29:55,520
好吧  我知道是因为我读了剧本
Okay. I know because I've read the script.

1177
01:30:00,370 --> 01:30:01,800
你
You...

1178
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:04,950
读了剧本
read the script.

1179
01:30:06,970 --> 01:30:08,510
完整的剧本
The whole script?

1180
01:30:11,330 --> 01:30:12,810
从头到尾
All of it?

1181
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:15,420
是啊  吉姆给了我完整的剧本
Yeah. Jim gave me the whole script.

1182
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:15,420
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}本片导演吉姆·贾木许

1183
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:20,890
他只给我看了我们演的部分
He only gave me our scenes.

1184
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:25,610
我没看过完整的剧本
I never saw a complete script.

1185
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,720
我为那家伙付出了那么多
After all... I've done for that guy.

1186
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:33,100
而且很多事你都不知道
And it's a lot that you don't even know about.

1187
01:30:37,090 --> 01:30:38,730
真是个混蛋
What a dick.

1188
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:18,530
真奇怪
That's weird.

1189
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,260
他们都走了
They're all leaving.

1190
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:47,010
好  来了
Right. Here we go.

1191
01:32:17,010 --> 01:32:20,420
你也看到那个了吗
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

1192
01:32:21,550 --> 01:32:23,490
好像看到了
I think I am.

1193
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:31,080
那个也在剧本里吗
Was that in the script?

1194
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,470
没有
No.

1195
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,320
起码我读过的没有
Not the one I read.

1196
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,610
真是出乎意料
Well, that was unexpected.

1197
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:27,770
我就知道她不同寻常
I knew there was something unusual about her.

1198
01:33:29,650 --> 01:33:30,980
嗯
Yeah.

1199
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:37,700
罗尼  结局是怎样的呢
So, Ronnie, how does it end, then?

1200
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:40,230
这个嘛
Well...

1201
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:46,910
我们必须全力以赴
We got to give it our best shot.

1202
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:49,110
"全力以赴"
"Our best shot."

1203
01:33:49,110 --> 01:33:51,320
好吧
Okay. Yeah.

1204
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:55,950
然后不会有好结局  对吧
But then it ends badly, right?

1205
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:57,620
对
Yeah.

1206
01:33:57,620 --> 01:33:58,940
不会有好结局
Yeah, it does.

1207
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:01,910
那好吧
Okay, then.

1208
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:04,260
我们上
Let's do it.

1209
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:07,800

01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:45,780
被死者包围
Among the dead.

1214
01:34:58,710 --> 01:35:01,470
苟延残喘的实利主义者
Remnants of the materialist people.

1215
01:35:07,170 --> 01:35:11,240
你休想  你休想
Oh, no, you don't. No, you don't.

1216
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,970
也许他们本来就是行尸走肉
I guess they've been zombies all along.

1217
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:19,140
鬼魂

Frank.

1222
01:35:45,930 --> 01:35:47,490
这是你自找的
You got this coming.

1223
01:35:49,690 --> 01:35:51,550
再见  弗兰克
Goodbye, Frank.

1224
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,870
罪有应得
You reap what you sow.

1225
01:35:53,870 --> 01:35:55,380
下一个是谁
All right, who's next?

1226
01:36:01,870 --> 01:36:03,260
真恶心
Yuck.

1227
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,070
好了
All righty.

很抱歉  兄弟
I'm so sorry, brother.

1233
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:37,210
我下不了手
I just can't do it.

1234
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:39,820
照顾好自己

我猜那些亡灵都失去了灵魂
I guess all them ghost people plumb lost their goddamn souls.

1250
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:04,330
肯定是把灵魂卖了
Must have traded 'em away

1251
01:38:04,330 --> 01:38:07,090
换了黄金之类的
or sold 'em for gold or whatnot.
