4
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,820
手枪子弹的时速超过11公里
A handgun bullet travels at more than 700 miles per hour.

5
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,090
绝对不行  不行
Absolutely not. No.

6
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,210
听着  如果你不想做
Look, if you don't wanna do it,

7
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,930
那就不必做了
you don't have to do it.

8
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,900
好吧  我不想做
Okay. Good, I don't wanna do it.

9
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,060
好
Fine.

10
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,930
该死  我还活着
Goddamn! I'm alive.

11
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,340
太神奇了
Oh, that's amazing!

12
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,840
我知道  对吧  所以说...
I know, right. So...

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,710
准备再来一遍
Ready to go again?

14
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,350
绝对不
Absolutely not.

15
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,520
好
Fine.

16
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,100
不要只是说"好"
Don't just say "fine"

17
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,730
然后开枪打我胸部
and then shoot me in the chest.

18
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,460
因为这样很不酷
'Cause it's not cool.

19
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,690
一点也不酷
Like at all.

20
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,720
好吧
Okay.

21
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,010
片名  海扁王2

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
我总是纳闷
I always wondered

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,300
怎么在我之前没人想到超级英雄
why no one tried to be a superhero before me.

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,760
其实有人尝试过
It turns out somebody had.

25
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,080
明蒂・麦奎迪
Mindy Macready.

26
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,780
她爸过世后  在警界的老搭档
After her dad died, his old partner on the force,

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,620
马库斯成为她的监护人
Marcus, became her guardian.

28
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,620
她背的是不是粉红马包  不错的背包
Is that a Pink Pony bag she's wearing? Nice backpack.

29
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,750
谢谢
Thanks.

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,550
从6岁小孩那里偷来的
Steal it from a six year old?

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,890
马库斯每天送她上学
Marcus dropped her off every day.

32
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,160
但是他一离开  她也离开
But as soon as he was gone, so was she.

33
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,030
校内没人发现
No one at school found out

34
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,430
因为她黑进了服务器
because she hacked into the server

35
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,670
给她自己全勤的奖励
and gave herself the award for perfect attendance.

36
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,900
超杀女和大老爸是玩真的
Hit Girl and Big Daddy had been the real deal.

37
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,640
明蒂原本打算一直戴着面具活动
Mindy was gonna keep wearing the mask

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,250
只要还有犯罪需要打击
as long as there were criminals to take down.

39
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,420
但是不管她阻止多少毒贩
But no matter how many drug dealers she stopped,

40
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,790
她总是觉得孤独
she couldn't stop feeling alone.

41
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,490
我呢  我已经放弃当超级英雄
Me? I'd given up being a superhero

42
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,430
因为实在太危险
because it was way too dangerous.

43
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,330
唯一的问题是  我快无聊死了
Only problem, I was dying of boredom.

44
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,660
跟很多高三学生一样
Like most high school seniors,

45
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,960
我不知道未来想干嘛
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life.

46
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,700
拜托  我都不知道想看哪个频道
Hell, I didn't know what channel I wanted to watch.

47
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,600
这只是电视  戴夫  不是中东和平问题
It's just TV, Dave, not peace in the Middle East.

48
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,180
我的好朋友陶德和马蒂
My best friends Todd and Marty

49
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,800
没想到我是第一个公开现身的超级英雄
had no clue I was the first superhero to go public.

50
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,040
你们昨晚有没有看《蜘蛛侠》
You guys watch Spider-Man last night?

51
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,710
梅婶令我硬起来会不会很怪
Is it weird that Aunt May gets me kinda hard?

52
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,440
除非你是熟女控
Not if you're a granny-slammer.

53
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,320
他们也许变装打扮  但这不是万圣节
They may wear costumes, but it isn't Halloween.

54
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,150
他们是真实人生中的超级英雄
They're real life superheroes,

55
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,660
之后两年内  自从第一批普通市民
and in the two years since the first ordinary citizens

56
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,390
开始穿戴披风面罩
donned capes and masks,

57
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,390
这项运动开始散播开来
the movement has started to spread.

58
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,470
因为海扁王  使我成为超级英雄
I became a superhero because of Kick-Ass.

59
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,830
对  你下班以后
Yeah, you just come home from work,

60
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,460
操起行头外出巡逻
you grab your gear and you go out on patrol.

61
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,370
帮助我们维持街头安全
Help us make the streets safe.

62
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,540
我启发那些人行动起来
I inspired all those people to get off their asses,

63
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,700
而我现在被困住了
and now I was stuck on mine.

64
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,760
所以那一夜吃完晚餐后
So that night after dinner,

65
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,250
我决定拿出旧服装
I decided to get my old costume out.

66
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,880
-对不起  -你不会敲门吗
-Sorry. -Can't you knock?

67
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:33,690
你知道的
You know, buddy,

68
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,680
这样非常正常  你会想自摸...
it's perfectly normal for you to touch yourself...

69
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,880
别说了  爸  出去
Oh, Jesus, Dad. Get out!

70
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,090
假如我想让海扁王重现江湖
If I was even thinking about a Kick-Ass sequel,

71
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,820
我必须认真点
I had to get serious.

72
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,390
我们能聊聊吗
Hey, can we chat?

73
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,930
求你了  明蒂
Please, Mindy?

74
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,400
快上车  表在跑了
Get in the cab. Meters running.

75
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,200
我想跟蝙蝠侠和罗宾一样结队出击
I wanna team up like Batman and Robin.

76
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,900
没人想当罗宾
Nobody wants to be Robin.

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,210
罗宾有什么不好
What's wrong with Robin?

78
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,540
你不是像大老爸的罗宾吗
Weren't you like Big Daddy's Robin?

79
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,020
罗宾希望他像我
Robin wishes he was me.

80
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,880
我想说的是我们应该合伙
What I'm trying to say is we should be partners,

81
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,850
你和我  像是强力双人组
you and me, like the dynamic duo.

82
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,050
我是大联盟等级  戴夫  你只是业余小子
I'm in the NFL, Dave. You play pee-wee.

83
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,090
又怎么样  训练我
So? Train me.

84
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,690
我想要有模有样
I wanna walk the walk,

85
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,430
你是我认识最像真正超级英雄的人
and you're the closest thing I know to a real superhero.

86
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,630
你不会厌倦独来独往吗
Aren't you tired of being on your own?

87
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,910
你不想知道有人想支持你吗
Don't you wanna know someone's there for you?

88
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,940
有人会罩你
Someone who's got your back?

89
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,890
你会完全照我的话做
And you'll do anything I say?

90
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,150
完全照做
Anything.

91
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,440
打我
Hit me.

92
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,220
你是15岁女生
You're a 15-year-old girl.

93
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,320
搞什么
What the hell?

94
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,430
举止像贱人  会被当成贱人扁
Act like a bitch, get slapped like a bitch.

95
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,260
该死
Oh, goddamn.

96
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,740
明蒂三个星期以来每天拿我当手枪打
Mindy beat me like morning wood every day for three weeks.

97
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,800
来吧  加强防守  左  右  加强防守
Come on. Guard up! Left, right, guard up!

98
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,340
即使我的神经末梢已经受损
Even with my damaged nerve endings,

99
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,280
还是疼的要命
it hurt like hell.

100
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,120
但是说来奇怪  我还算喜欢
But, in a weird way, I kinda liked it.

101
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,450
那令我有种使命感
It gave me a sense of purpose.

102
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,430
-你的脸怎么了  -没什么
-What happened to your face? -Nothing.

103
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,090
像是我们朝某个目标前进
Like we were driving towards something.

104
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,130
该死的
Goddamn!

105
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,960
太神了
Oh, that's amazing!

106
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,120
其他戴上面具的人
All the other people putting on masks

107
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,370
只是在假扮超级英雄
were just playing superhero.

108
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,440
我们则为了当真而受训
We were training to really do it.

109
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,480
我大可告诉我的女友凯蒂
I couldn't tell my girlfriend Katie,

110
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,500
或是马蒂  陶德
or Marty and Todd.

111
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,140
但是我不在乎  我们太过瘾了
But I didn't care. We were having too much fun.

112
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,950
左  右  左
Left, right, left!

113
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,720
我们新的超级英雄团队
Our own superhero team.

114
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,690
一定会很
It was gonna be balls.

115
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,540
搞什么  妈
What the hell, Mom?

116
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,490
你删除了摄像机里的新闻
Did you delete the news off the DVR?

117
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,830
对  我删了  克里斯托弗
Yes. Yes, I did, Christopher.

118
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,000
那里面介绍海扁王
That was the one with Kick-Ass.

119
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,150
克里斯托弗
Oh, Christopher,

120
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,210
你不能再那么迷超级英雄了
you've gotta stop obsessing over this superhero.

121
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,750
他不是超级英雄  妈  他是谋杀犯
He is not a superhero, Mom, he's a murderer.

122
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,040
他将爸爸炸死  天杀的
He blew up Dad with a bazooka, for fuck's sake!

123
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,240
你爸爸是死于火灾
Your father died in a fire.

124
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,550
火灾  你有什么毛病
A fire? What is your problem?

125
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,520
你  你就是我的毛病
You! You are my problem!

126
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,690
我试着把你调教成正常男孩
I am trying to raise you to be a normal boy!

127
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,040
所以我们搬到了长岛
That's why we moved to Long Island

128
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,600
在你爸出意外之后
after your father's accident.

129
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,120
火箭炮不是意外
A bazooka is not an accident,

130
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,830
你这臆想症的贱货
you delusional bitch!

131
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,170
这次谈话结束
This conversation is over.

132
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,900
好  那么我走了
Great. Then I'm leaving.

133
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,540
拜托  贾维尔  酷一点
Come on, Javier, be cool.

134
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,340
抱歉  克里斯  可是你妈雇佣我  不是要我耍酷
Sorry, Chris, but your mom pays me not to be cool.

135
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,550
我恨你
I hate you!

136
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,960
你要我在家自学  好像我是什么犯人
You home-school me like I'm a prisoner!

137
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,850
你丢掉我的红旋风服装
You threw away my Red Mist costume.

138
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,720
天啊  问题不出在我  而是出在你
God! I am not the problem! You are!

139
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,350
我-希-望-你-去-死
I wish you were dead!

140
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,360
妈咪
Mommy?

141
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,800
不要碰
Don't touch that.

142
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,040
对不起  这是什么
Oh, I'm sorry. What is it?

143
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,230
最后的撒手锏
It's a last resort.

144
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,880
假如一切失败  你快要死时用
Like if all else fails and you're about to die.

145
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,880
你不怕死吗
Are you not scared to die?

146
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,760
怕你永远长不大  裤子老是太大
Are you scared you're never gonna grow into your big boy pants?

147
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,490
我说真的
I'm serious.

148
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,830
假设蜘蛛侠或蝙蝠侠有天晚上遇害呢
What if Spider-Man or Batman got killed one night?

149
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,950
则有可能发生
It could happen.

150
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,660
假如你怕死
If you're scared of dying,

151
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,890
有件事很确定
one thing is certain,

152
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,090
你最后一定会死
you are going to die.

153
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,730
我爸爸从来不怕死
My daddy was never afraid of dying.

154
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,610
看他落得什么下场
Look where that got him.

155
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,970
他知道他有一天也许必须做出终极牺牲
He knew he might have to make the ultimate sacrifice one day.

156
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,580
所以他要我保证
And that's why he made me promise

157
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,240
我绝不会停止捍卫城市
I'd never stop defending this city.

158
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,480
在我心头画十字
Cross my heart,

159
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,150
以死立誓
hope to die.

160
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,490
你爸发疯了  你也知道  对吧
Your dad was insane. You know that, right?

161
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,000
你错了  戴夫
You're wrong, Dave.

162
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,960
我爸爸是第一位真正的超级英雄
My daddy was the first real superhero,

163
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,800
不是你或者红旋风  而是我爸爸
not you or Red Mist. It was my daddy,

164
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,480
与他并肩作战是一种荣耀
and it was an honor to serve by his side.

165
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,780
明蒂  学校还好吧
Hey, Min, how was school?

166
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,350
超级疯狂
Super crazy.

167
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,960
穆林丝老师今天请假
Miss Mullins was out today,

168
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,190
所以由库伯老师教生物  脾气好臭
so we had Mr. Cooper leaching us biology, such a grump.

169
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,240
是吗  好奇怪
Oh, really? That's weird

170
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,960
因为辛默夫校长昨天打电话给我
because Principal Himoff called me yesterday.

171
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,950
你原本应该得到全勤奖
You were supposed to get an award for perfect attendance,

172
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,160
但是你没出席
but you didn't attend.

173
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,010
我今早跟踪你
I followed you this morning.

174
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,910
看到你跟一个男生坐进出租车
Saw you get into a cab with some boy,

175
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,030
我在桥上跟丢你们
and I lost you guys over the bridge.

176
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,980
所以你现在要不要告诉我你今天到底去哪里
So now you wanna tell me where you really were today?

177
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,440
真的对不起  马库斯
I'm really sorry, Marcus.

178
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,850
我不想惹你生气
I didn't wanna make you mad.

179
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,550
少用眼泪攻势  明蒂  你15岁了  不是5岁
Cut the waterworks, Min. You're 15, not five.

180
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,660
好吧
Okay.

181
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,400
是他要我跷课去逛购物中心
Look, he asked me to cut class and go lo the mall.

182
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,830
所以  是的  是的  我去了
So, yeah, yeah, I did.

183
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,390
跟你当超杀女没关系
This has nothing to do with you being Hit Girl?

184
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,530
我不会在你床底下找到忍者刀
I'm not gonna find any ninja blades

185
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,900
或者流星镖吧
or throwing stars under your bed?

186
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,200
不  我只是想让他喜欢我  好吧
No. I just wanted him to like me. Okay?

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,780
宝贝  跷课不是让男生喜欢你的正途
Sweetie, skipping school's not a way to get boys to like you.

188
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,580
我太傻了
I'm so stupid.

189
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,600
你是我认识最聪敏的女孩之一
You're one of the smartest little girls I know.

190
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,150
我们去买披萨
Let's go get some pizza.

191
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,180
什么  你说我没被禁足
What, you mean I'm not grounded?

192
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,450
把这当成警告
Well, just consider this a warning.

193
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,030
你确定要把你妈的东西丢掉
Hey, you sure you wanna give all your mom's things away?

194
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,900
我留着她那些东西要干嘛
What the hell am I supposed to do with all her stuff?

195
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,100
不得了  她那对真漂亮
Damn, she had a nice pair of guns.

196
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,930
老兄  她死了  不要聊她奶子
Dude, she's dead! Don't talk about her tits.

197
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,040
我说的是这些
I was talking about these.

198
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,810
那些啊  是我爸的
Oh, those. Those were my dad's.

199
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,810
不如你留着吧
Why don't you keep them?

200
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,640
你确定
Are you sure?

201
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,770
对  它们是属于你的  对吧
Yeah. I mean, they belong to you, right?

202
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,750
来吧  克里斯  现在你独立了
Come on, Chris. You're your own man now.

203
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,080
-只是要小心  好吗  -好
-Just be careful, all right? -Yeah.

204
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,460
绝对不想留下它们
Definitely don't wanna keep those!

205
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,760
不  由我来处理
I'll take care of it.

206
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,130
今天放你一天假  待会见
You take the day off. Later.

207
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,280
所以  我们准备开始第一场实地测试吗
So, are you ready for your first field test?

208
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,580
我拿它们做什么
What am I supposed to do with these?

209
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,750
戴上去  去钓人
Put them on and, uh, go fishing.

210
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,530
我是最白的皮条客
I'm the whitest pimp ever.

211
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,860
就是这种打算
That's the idea.

212
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,940
下次右转  出来走到平刷街
Take the next right. Comes out on Flatbush.

213
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,010
你确定我不该使用行头
You sure I should be doing this without my gear?

214
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,170
这才是重点
That's the point.

215
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,560
海扁王不是只靠服装
Kick-Ass isn't a costume.

216
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,110
海扁王是你真正的本质
Kick-Ass is who you really are.

217
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,980
戴夫・莱佐斯基才是你的面具
Dave Lizewski is the mask.

218
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:16,380
我的面具快要被打断牙齿
Well, my "mask" is about to get his teeth kicked in.

219
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,190
同性恋诱饵
Hey, queer bait,

220
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,110
你拿那些袋子要去哪里
where are you going with those bags, man?

221
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,280
跟他说你正要去用12寸假磐彼妈
Tell him you're on your way to fuck his mother with a 12-inch strap on.

222
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,020
我只是散步
I'm just taking a walk.

223
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,630
我不习惯这么做
This really isn't what I do.

224
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,150
我通常直接报警
I usually just call the cops.

225
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,230
你在跟谁讲话  小子
Who are you talking to, man?

226
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,320
我只是在讲电话  是...
Uh, I'm just on a call. It was...

227
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,130
这里的手机信号很烂
You know, service round here, it sucks, man.

228
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,830
现在把袋子给我  死基佬
Now give me the bags, faggot,

229
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,000
否则我要你吹我的肥
before I make you suck my fat cock, huh?

230
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,840
来吧
Come on.

231
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,700
好吧  好吧
Okay, okay.

232
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,010
你能相信我让明蒂把我打得稀巴烂好几周
Can you believe I let Mindy beat the snot out of me for weeks

233
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,240
好让我再次被人修理
just so I could get my ass kicked again?

234
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,080
这算什么团队
So much for a team.

235
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,550
你真的死了  死基佬
You ready to die? You faggot!

236
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,770
讲这么多歧视同性恋的话
You know, all that homophobic shit

237
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,750
让你听起来超娘
makes you sound super gay.

238
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,050
加入我再次逮到你抢劫  屎蛋
If I ever catch you robbing again, shit-burger,

239
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,720
我要学沙特阿拉伯的做法  剁掉你的手
I'm gonna go Saudi Arabia on your ass and cut your hand off.

240
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,290
你这一生别想再犯罪
Promise me you're done with your life of crime.

241
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,730
我保证
I promise.

242
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,670
说谎不打草稿
Pants on fire.

243
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,970
-你想如何  -我想你差点害死我
-What do you think? -I think you almost got me killed!

244
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,100
不  你想我的台词怎么样
No. What do you think of my line?

245
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,910
"说谎不打草稿"  我写了一大堆
"Pants on fire." I wrote a whole bunch of 'em.

246
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,080
快跑  我会跟他们说你救了我  走
Run! I'll tell them you saved me. Go!

247
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,780
女性嫌犯从平刷街逃逸
Female suspect fleeing Flatbush.

248
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,010
不到五尺高  戴着面罩
Under 5 feet. Masked.

249
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,750
持有双截棍和一把刀
Armed with nunchucks and a sword.

250
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,500
-明蒂  -马库斯  什么事
-Hey, Min. -Hey, Marcus. What's up?

251
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,700
我看见你接听手机
I see you answered your phone.

252
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,870
说明人不在学校
That means you're not in school.

253
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,310
我本来在
I was,

254
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,140
但我觉得不太舒服
but I wasn't feeling so good,

255
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,470
所以护士决定让我回家
and so the nurse decided to send me home.

256
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,770
可怜啊  我快到家了
Poor thing. Well, I'm almost home.

257
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,820
我来煮汤  我们一起看《危机情境》
I'll make soup and we can watch Jeopardy!

258
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,780
好  待会见  好吗
All righty. I'll see you soon, okay?

259
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,950
好
All right.

260
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,870
该死
Shit!

261
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,340
你端来我的汤
You got my soup?

262
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,040
我先帮你量提问
Let me take your temperature first.

263
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,910
你出了好多汗
Oh, you're really clammy.

264
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,780
我睡一会就好了
I'll feel better after a nap-nap.

265
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,510
闭上眼睛  我端汤给你
Close your eyes. I'm gonna get you that soup.

266
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,620
那是血嘛
Is that blood?

267
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,920
该死  明蒂  我不能这么下去了
Damn it, Mindy. I can't do this anymore.

268
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,930
你父亲就像我兄弟
Your father was like a brother to me.

269
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,930
他是很棒的警察  也是英雄
He was a great cop and a hero.

270
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,200
但是大老爸  那不是你父亲  好吗
But Big Daddy? That was not your father, okay?

271
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,260
那是剥夺了你童年的人
That was someone who robbed you of your childhood.

272
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,770
至于这个
And this?

273
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,810
超杀女  这不是你的本质
Hit Girl? That's not who you are.

274
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,860
你是明蒂・麦奎迪
You are Mindy Macready

275
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,880
刚开始上高中
and you're just starting high school.

276
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,090
我了解你还没找到自我
I understand that you don't know who that person is yet,

277
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,820
但是你会的  只要你不断尝试
but you will, you've just gotta try.

278
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,090
我不想
I don't want to.

279
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,390
你不知道你要什么
You don't know what you want.

280
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,230
你不行  你还不是成年人
You can't. You're not an adult, not yet.

281
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,300
我15年以来做过的事情
Yeah, well, I've done more in my 15 years

282
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,130
比大部分成年人一生做的还多
than most adults have in their lifetime.

283
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,170
你父亲给你的那张字条
That note that your father gave you,

284
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,880
你要打开的那张字条
the one that you were supposed to open

285
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,970
要是出了什么事
if anything ever happened.

286
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,970
上面说什么
What did it say?

287
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,100
说你会照顾我
That you would take care of me.

288
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,480
以及你应该听我的话  对吧
And that you were supposed to listen to me, right?

289
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,670
所以听好
Well, listen up.

290
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,750
我要你去上学
I want you in school.

291
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,480
不要再跟那个男孩联络
I want you to stop talking to that boy.

292
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:19,950
我还要你向我保证
And I want you to promise me

293
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,610
永远不会在发生这种事
that this is never gonna happen again.

294
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,600
我在心头画十字
Cross my heart,

295
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,630
以死立誓
hope to die.

296
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,270
好
Good.

297
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,280
明蒂
Mindy!

298
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,350
搞什么
What the hell?

299
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,490
首先  你害我差点被干掉  然后放我鸽子
First you almost get me killed, then you stand me up.

300
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,530
戴夫  对不起
Dave, I'm sorry.

301
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,220
说真的
I mean, I... You are?

302
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,120
是的
I am.

303
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,230
对于这一切
For everything.

304
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,400
好的
Oh, okay, great.

305
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,640
我是说  我不会形容你擅长道歉
I mean, "apologetic" isn't a word I'd use to describe you.

306
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,040
我必须说几遍才行
How many times do I have to say it?

307
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,310
我们快离开这里
Look, let's get out of here.

308
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,840
你必须下手轻点  我想我也许断了一根肋骨
You gotta ease up. I think I might have broken a rib.

309
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,410
戴夫  我不玩了
Dave, I'm done.

310
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,020
训练吗
With training?

311
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,490
一切的事
With everything.

312
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,820
等等  你是指这一切
Wait, you mean everything?

313
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,090
你不能这样  你是超杀女
You can't. You're Hit Girl.

314
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,390
我们要组队  你不能这样退出
We were gonna start a team, you can't just quit.

315
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,330
这是你的身份
This is who you are.

316
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,560
已经不是了  戴夫
Not anymore, Dave.

317
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,170
对不起  但是结束了  我不玩了
I'm sorry, but it's over. I'm done.

318
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,500
她刚跟他分手吗
She just broke up with him?

319
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,700
不要烦我
Just leave me alone.

320
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,940
你别再道歉了好吗
Will you stop apologizing?

321
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,230
我不知道什么事更糟糕
I don't know what's worse,

322
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,080
你跟九年级学生上床
that you're fucking a 9th-grader

323
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,710
还是被九年级学生甩掉
or that you just got dumped by one.

324
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,840
恋童癖怪胎
Pedophile freak.

325
00:17:59,010 --> 00:17:59,950
事情不是这样
It's not like that

326
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,580
不然是怎样  告诉我
Then what is it like? Please, tell me.

327
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,680
我不能  会扯到那件事
I can't. It's to do with the Kick-Ass thing.

328
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,410
我告诉你一个秘密
I've got a secret for you.

329
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,590
记得马利克吗
You remember Malik?

330
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,920
在针具换新处当义工的家伙
Dude who volunteers at your needle exchange?

331
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,020
他的棍子比海扁王的粗大多了
His baton is so much bigger than Kick-Ass'.

332
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,860
-不  -真的
-No. -Yeah.

333
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,770
棍子指的是老二
And by "baton," I mean penis.

334
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,800
对  我懂  谢了
Yeah, I got that. Thanks.

335
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,610
玩15岁女生让你关20年  变态
Fifteen gets you 20, pervert.

336
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,210
玩新人  戴夫  好色的老狗
A freshman, Dave? You old, salty dog.

337
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,650
有什么问题
What's the problem?

338
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,710
送到嘴边的当然要吃  对吧
Grass on the field, play ball. Right?

339
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,770
不  陶德
No, Todd.

340
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,980
克里斯  你的家教来了
Chris, your tutor's here.

341
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,950
克里斯
Chris!

342
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,150
克里斯  你的...
Chris, your...

343
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,480
要命  怎么回事
Holy shit. What the hell is that?

344
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,120
我的命运
My destiny.

345
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,330
克里斯  只因你妈喜欢玩重口味
Chris, just because your mom liked to get a little freaky now.

346
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,400
我知道我该扮演什么角色  贾维尔
I know what my role is in this, Javier.

347
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,800
我爸是帮派老大  所以这很合理
My dad was a crime boss, so it just makes sense.

348
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,310
我是超级反派  这是演化
I'm a supervillain. It's evolution.

349
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,570
拜托  拜托
Come on, come on.

350
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,770
在你伤到别人前把它们放下  克里斯
Just put those things down before you hurt somebody, Chris.

351
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,900
我不叫那个名字
That's not my name.

352
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,650
好吧  好吧  红旋风...
Okay, okay. Uh, Red Mist...

353
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,510
红旋风是我的超级英雄别名
Red Mist was my superhero name.

354
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,280
从现在起  我叫做...
Henceforth I'll be known as

355
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,350
臭屁王
The Motherfucker.

356
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,450
明蒂退出后
After Mindy quit,

357
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,310
我决定不再打沙包了
I decided to stop hitting the heavy bag

358
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,650
而是上街头
and start hitting the streets.

359
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,920
海扁王  欢迎回来
Hey, Kick-Ass, welcome back!

360
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,920
你很棒了  老兄
You're the best, man!

361
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,470
唯一的问题是  我依然独立作战
Only problem, I was still on my own.

362
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,100
所以我上网  找到一位物理学教授
So I went online and found a physics professor

363
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
他自称"重力博士"
calling himself "Dr. Gravity."

364
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,730
当然  他不是超杀女
Sure, he wasn't Hit Girl,

365
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,370
但我总得有个起步
but I had to start somewhere.

366
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,000
这是我发明的零重力装置
This is the zero G device that I invented.

367
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,340
能使高达一吨的物体升起
Can levitate any object up to a ton.

368
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,640
真的
For real?

369
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,020
才怪  老兄  这是包锡箔纸的棒球棍
Hell, no, man. This is a baseball bat wrapped in tinfoil.

370
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,650
但是骗过了你
But it fooled you.

371
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,690
能给我一瓶健怡山露汽水吗
Hey, could I get a Diet Mountain Dew, please?

372
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,320
我不是物理学教授
I'm not even a physics professor.

373
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,950
只是广告公司的广告文案
Just a copywriter for an ad agency.

374
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,030
这是我那么爱它的原因
But that's why I love this stuff.

375
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,290
你相当什么样的人都行
You can be anyone you want!

376
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,740
你以前跟很多人搭档过
You done many team-ups before?

377
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,300
算是吧  对  不  不见得
Kind of. Yeah. No, not really.

378
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,500
我单打独斗有点紧张
I was getting kinda nervous about being on my own, you know?

379
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,570
我也是  我从来没参加过战斗
Yeah, me, too. I never even been in a fight.

380
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,510
希望你不必
Well, hopefully you won't have to.

381
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,970
我跟一个朋友谈到组队
I friended a guy talking about forming a team,

382
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,020
不知你是否有兴趣
if you're interested.

383
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,710
不知道他有多认真
I don't know how serious he is,

384
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,150
可他的照片蛮猛的
but his picture was pretty hard core.

385
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,380
开玩笑  我因此才联络你
Are you kidding me? That's why I contacted you.

386
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,990
我不想太早提到  把你吓跑
I didn't wanna freak you out by bringing it up too soon.

387
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,530
我先去上厕所  再给你看他的档案
I'll show you his profile after I hit the men's room.

388
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,890
雷夫叔叔不会喜欢这种事  克里斯
Your Uncle Ralph's not gonna be happy about this, Chris.

389
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,060
我不叫那名字
That's not my name.

390
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,600
我不叫你的别名  别想
I'm not calling you that, forget it.

391
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,730
贾维尔  你为我爸工作过
Javier, you worked for my dad.

392
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,870
你也我妈工作过  现在你为我工作
Then you worked for my mom. Now you work for me.

393
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,670
我大概是纽约市最有钱的孩子
I'm probably the richest kid in New York City.

394
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,180
但是你不喜欢的话
But if you don't like that,

395
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,180
自己去找另一份工作  行吗
find yourself another motherfucking job, okay?

396
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,780
喂  海扁王
Yo, Kick-Ass!

397
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,350
天啊  我真高兴见到你
Man, am I glad to see you.

398
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,010
有我能效劳的地方吗  先生
Is there anything I can do to help, sir?

399
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,560
是的  我希望你能帮我
Yeah. I was hoping you can help me

400
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,750
在油管上得到上百万点击

401
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,860
来吧  来吧
Come on. Come on.

402
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,610
天啊
God!

403
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,050
跑  海扁王  跑
Run, Kick-Ass, run!

404
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,820
肌肉男  去你们的
Jersey Shore motherfucker!

405
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,560
怎么你们没兴趣公平竞争
Hey, what, you not interested in a fair fight?

406
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,230
则不是公平竞争
That is no fair fight.

407
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,610
明天开小队会议
Team meeting tomorrow.

408
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,420
我把地址寄给你
I'll e-mail you the address.

409
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,900
小心重力博士
Beware Dr. Gravity!

410
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,010
你必须佩服博士的热忱
You had to admire the Doctor's enthusiasm.

411
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,570
我等不及想见他的朋友
I couldn't wait to meet his friends.

412
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,780
手举起来  春卷
Hands in the air, Spring Roll.

413
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,120

脸会炸的稀巴烂
You're gonna bust your own face when that gun kicks

424
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,870
你不拿好枪的话

你也许穿着言行不像我们
You may not dress like us or talk like us,

497
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,030
但是谈到男生  我们都一样

516
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:27,450
甚至在网上
and even set up a, you know, a thing on the Internet

517

让大家帮我们寻找汤米

但是我们什么收获都没有
But we got nothing.

519
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,430
我们再也没见过儿子

520
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,460
我想出"记住汤米"这个名字

521
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,760
我们每周有3晚这么做  于是...

她不能死而复生
Doesn't bring her back,

528
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,980

I've been bullied my whole life for being gay,

531
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:08,130
所以我现在力挺无力反击的人
so now I stand up for the defenseless.

532
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,460
因此我不戴面具
That's why I don't wear a mask.

533
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,020
不想被逼回柜中
Too much like being back in the closet.

534
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,360
你的心地正当
Long as your heart's in the right place,

535
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,130
我们不在乎你嘴巴含什么
we don't care what you put in your mouth.

536
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,330
-击拳  -谢谢  谢谢  先生

after my parents were mugged and killed coming home from the opera.

539

我会跟你说那个病态混蛋
Did I tell you that sick bastard

540
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,740
上色情网站刷爆他们信用卡吗

541
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,210
我希望我们有机会认识那家伙
I hope we get the chance to say hello to this guy someday

542
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,980
我才有机会亲自让他灵肉分离
so I can personally levitate his soul from his body.

543
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,710
我的天  马蒂
Oh, my God. Marty?

544
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,510
对  我就知道我认得你的声音

我不知道你在讲什么
No, I don't know what you're talking about.

546
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,520
我不认识什么马蒂  新来的
I don't know no Marty. New guy.

547
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:45,260

548
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,160
戴夫  你为何打扮成海扁王
Dave? Why are you dressed like Kick-Ass?

549
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,670
因为我就是海扁王
Because I'm Kick-Ass.

550
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,900
你们两人认识
You two know each other?

551
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,530
对  我们五岁开始

552
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,370
你在胡说什么父母被杀
What's all this bullshit about your parents getting killed?

553
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,030
嘴巴干净点  什么

我正在想该怎么解释
I'm trying to figure out how to explain this

556
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,120
听起来才不会完全像白痴
without sounding like a complete idiot right now.

557
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,420
我觉得不太可能  蝙蝠侠
Yeah, I'm not sure that's possible, Batman.

558
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,580
我也是
I'm not, either.

559
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,090
好  当我在网上发现你们
Okay. Well, when I found you guys online,

560
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,760
你们都交换很棒的起源故事
you were all swapping these awesome origin stories.

561
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,860
上校  你是前黑帮  天啊
I mean, Colonel, you're ex-Mafia, for Christ's sake.

562
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,030
别白白浪费老天之名
Don't take the Lord's name in vain.

563
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,730
对不起
I'm sorry.

564
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,900
我只是以为你们不会让我加入
I didn't think you'd let me join the team

565
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,030
除非我也讲出好故事来
unless I had a good story, too.

566
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:36,220
好  我们这次不追究你
All right, we'll let you off the hook this time,

567
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:36,970

这里好酷
Whoa, this is so cool.

571
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,620
这个装修小工程完全隐秘
Now this little renovation was totally clandestine,

572
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,890
所以没人知道
which means nobody knew about it.

573
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,990
我知道则不算什么
Now, I know it's not much,

574
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,230
但这只是开始
but this is just the beginning.

575
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,060
团结一致  我们能促成改变

有你加入是我们的荣幸

579
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,910
这是我想听到的回答
That's what I like to hear.

580
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,740
好  入会仪式开始

转过去  我帮你脱衣服
Turn around and I'll unzip you.

582
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,440
对不起  你说什么
I'm sorry, what?

583
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,490
只是开个玩笑  现在谈正事

我们帮你留了位置  但是你一直没出现
We saved you a seat in the caf, but you never showed.

587

就好像发现你最好的朋友
It's like finding out your best friend's

00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,100
值得晚上平安回家
deserves to make it home safe at night.

686
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,990
至于变态  恋童癖
And a pervert, pedophile,

687
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,170
值得用艾森豪威尔对付

688
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,760
咬
Schwantz!

689
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,030
别捏紧拳头打击
You don't wanna hit with your closed fist.

690
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,340
手可能受伤  然后你会毫无防御力
You might break your hand, then you're defenseless.

691
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:15,040
你应该打开手掌找支撑点
You wanna hit with open palm and pivot. Open palm and pivot.

692
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,200
打开手掌
Grab the back.

693
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,110
我从来没有入选过橄榄球队
I never made varsity football

694
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,120
或者选进校内舞台剧演出
or got cast in the school play.

695
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,450
我连荣誉榜都没上过
Hell, I never even made honor roll.

696
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,780
打我啊  贱人
Knock out, bitch!

697
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,220
但是假如我入选过
But if I had,

698
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,520
我必须相信感觉很想这样
I gotta believe it would've felt a lot like this.

699
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,850
当警察不再能保家为民
When the cops can no longer protect and serve,

700
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,660
你得到警告了  抢匪  手举起来  变态
be warned, mugger, heads up, perv.

701
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,200
我们有力量  我们有胆量
We got the strength, we got the nerve

702
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,830
给那些有需要的人应有的待遇
to give those in need what they deserve!

703
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
正义永存
Justice Forever!

704
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,500
我们是终极小集团
We were in the ultimate clique.

705
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,700
就算其他人都不知道也没关系
It didn't matter that no one else knew.

706
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,720
我们知道就好  我们觉得想摇滚巨星
We knew. And we felt like rock stars.

707
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,980
晚上好  伙计们  干得好  单挑王
Good night, guys. Nice job. Battle Guy.

708

晚上好  上校  谢谢这一切
Night, Colonel. Thanks for everything.

709

不  孩子  谢谢你
No, son, thank you.

710
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:03,020
你为我们证明每个人都能造成改变
You showed us that every man can make a difference.

711
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:06,320
少了海扁王  我们没人会在这里
Without Kick-Ass, none of us would be here.

712
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:09,900
发自内心  别冲昏头
That's from the heart. Don't let it go to your head.

713
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,400
我没那么累
I'm not really that tired.

714
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,910
好
Okay.

715
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,010
我们继续戴着面具
Let's leave the masks on.

716
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,220
怎么样
Yeah?

717
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,450
好
Yeah!

718
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,560
今晚的第一项重大行动
First big mission's tonight

719
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,360
这可不是社区服务
and it's not community service.

720
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,900
我们要挑战想不到坏的人
We're taking on some real bad guys.

721
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,770
怎么  你的队伍对付不了
What, can't your team handle it?

722
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,570
他们跟你不同  明蒂
They're not you, Mindy.

723
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,440
记住汤米是卖干果的
Remembering Tommy owns a dry fruit business.

724
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,880
暗夜骚货是教芭蕾的
Night Bitch teaches ballet.

725
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:56,450
暗夜骚货
Night Bitch?

726
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,240
她是什么  超级英雄还是拍三级片
What is she? A superhero or a soft core porno?

727
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,320
也许两种都有点
Maybe a little bit of both.

728
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,650
天啊  你上了她
Oh, God, you're plugging her?

729
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,720
我要吐了
I'm gonna vom.

730
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,120
你就像忍者
You're like a ninja.

731
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:11,490
你就不能等马库斯睡着了溜出来吗
Can't you just sneak out after Marcus goes to sleep?

732
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,290
你不懂  戴夫
You don't get it, Dave.

733
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,470
我向马库斯承诺过
I made a promise to Marcus.

734
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,300
打破承诺  你是超级英雄记得吗
So break it. You're a superhero, remember?

735
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:23,000
明蒂・麦奎迪只是伪装
Mindy Macready's just a disguise.

736
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,170
我不知道暗夜妓女是哪门子超级英雄
Yeah, well, I don't know what kind of superhero Night Whore is,

737
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,010
但是你假如以为我会说话不算话
but if you really think I'd ever break my word,

738
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,670
你根本不了解我
you obviously have no idea who I am.

739
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,920
我知道舞蹈队
I know that making dance team

740
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,410
不能使你不再实现自我
doesn't make you stop being who you are.

741
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,520
我知道超杀女一点也不在乎
I know Hit Girl couldn't give a shit

742
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,090
高中女生喜欢搞什么
about what high school girls are into.

743
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,260
我知道你不会去约会的
I know that you wouldn't go on a date

744
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,750
就算你命悬这一线了
if your life depended on it.

745
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:41,980
去死吧  戴夫
Go to hell, Dave.

746
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,990
怎样  你知道我说对了

我
Me?

749
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,500
你想不想和我约会
You wanna take me on a date sometime?

750
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,630
好  当然
Uh, yeah. Sure.

751
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,100
我叫西蒙
My name's, um, Simon.

752
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,670
很好  西蒙
Great, um, Simon.

753
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,840
约会一言为定
It's a date.

754
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,350
明蒂  对不起
Mindy, I'm sorry.

755
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,510
有问题吗  明蒂
Is there a problem, Min?

756
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,640
无
Zero.

757
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:08,650
好  我不喜欢问题
Good. Because I don't like problems.

758
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,020
戴夫  你最近晚上偷溜出门

看到你凌晨两点离开
she thought she saw you leaving at 2:00 in the morning.

761
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,790
莱波特太太疯了  爸
Miss Neipert's crazy, Dad.

762
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,020
她想教她的狗说西班牙语
She tried to teach her dog Spanish.

763
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,460
你在嗑药吗
Are you on drugs?

764
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,960
说真的
Seriously?

765
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,200
我必须问
I gotta ask.

766
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,670
你是我最好的朋友  可是你长得太快
You're my best bud and you're growing up so fast.

767
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:32,540

Promise me you're not doing anything foolish?

768
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,170
我保证

769
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,310
这样对我就够了  朋友
Good enough for me, pal.

770
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,510
你太聪明  不会做出傻事

772
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,690
我很高兴你能发泄出来
I'm glad you got that out of your system.

773
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,760
陶德发信息给我  又来了
Oh, Todd texted me. Again. What a loser.

Dude, how bad-ass is Colonel Stars and Stripes?

775
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,570
对  我还是不敢相信他以前当黑帮打手
Yeah, I still can't believe he's an ex-mob enforcer.

776
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,940
你怎么从那身份变成超级英雄
I mean, how do you go from that to being a superhero?

777
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,270
他信基督得重生

781
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,360
其他队员在哪里
Where's the rest of the team?

782
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,220
重力博士得了流感
Dr. Gravity has the flu,

783
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,560
记得汤米有一张摩门经的票  所以...
and Remembering Tommy got Book of Mormon tickets, so...

784
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,220

That's okay.

785
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,100
我们五个够了
Five of us should do.

786
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,760
你认为这个人怎么赚钱的  拉皮条
How did you say this guy made his money, sir? Prostitution?

787
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,760
不只是女孩  还有小孩
Not just girls. Kids.

788

从农村船运送过来的

警察睁一只眼闭一只眼
Boneheads in blue take a blind eye.

790
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,710
你怎么知道他今晚在这
How do you know he's here tonight?

791
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,980
因为周四是扑克之夜
Because Thursday night is poker night.

792
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,740
每周都是同样的五个人
Same five low-lifes every week.

793
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,440
有恶习的人不难找
Man with a habit ain't hard to find.

794
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,280
计划是什么  我们偷偷留进去
So what's the plan? Are we sneaking in?

795
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,750
我想我们敲门
I thought we'd knock.

796
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,090
-什么  -这样更礼貌
-What? -It's more polite.

797
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,750
大家冷静点
Stay frosty, team.

798
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,320
我以前拿这种小喽当早饭吃
I used to eat punks like this for breakfast.

799

耶和华见证人
Jehovah's Witness!

800
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,690
跟你1万

801
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,600
老大  外面有人

802
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,250
看看是谁  你站那儿干吗的  打飞机啊

803
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,830
到你了

804
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,180
对不起  我刚走神了
I'm sorry, I just zoned out for a second.

805
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,680
你说我们要对方5个匪徒
Did you say that we're going up against five gangsters?

806
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,350
加上保镖是6个
And bouncer makes six.

807
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,450
再加四分之三
And three-quarters.

808
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,650
你想干嘛
What the fuck do you want?

809
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,960
晚上好  年轻人  我想跟金・吉米聊聊
Good evening, young man. We'd like a word with Jimmy Kim.

810
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,430
假如方便的话
If it's not too inconvenient

811
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,650
赶紧滚蛋吧
Get the fuck out of here

812
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:43,660
不然我就扭断你的头  混蛋
before I tear your head off, you old fuck.

813
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:45,930
对不起
I'm sorry.

814
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,440
我想我们有麻烦了
I think we're in trouble.

815
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,810
我实在不了解为何有人觉得需要
I just don't understand why people feel the need

816
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,810
出口成脏
to use that kind of language.

817
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,460
他来了
There he goes.

818
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:05,060
老天啊
Oh, sweet Jesus.

819
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:05,920
单挑王
Battle Guy,

820
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,570
我不是给你说过不要有事没事提到天吗
what did I tell you about taking the Lord's name in vain?

821
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,790
对不起  先生
Sorry, sir.

822
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:13,300
艾森豪威尔  准备好
Eisenhower, at the ready.

823
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,960
虫人  到我后面
Insect Man, I want you right behind me.

824
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:17,470
其他人分开逮住别的人
Everybody else spread out, catch the strays.

825
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,660
试着玩得痛快
And try to have fun,

826
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,970
否则这么做干嘛
otherwise what's the point?

827
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:26,970
排队不错  有人想跳舞吗
Nice party. Anybody wanna dance?

828
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,590
你们要去哪
Where are you going?

829
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,560
很好  小心后面
Very nice. Behind you!

830
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,400
当心小鸟
Watch the birdie.

831
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:58,770
别动
Don't you move.

832
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:59,910
暗夜骚货  小心后面
Night Bitch! Behind you!

833
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,080
等等
Wait.

834
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,020
小心
Look out!

835
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,870
我抓住他的手臂了
Okay, I got his right arm.

836
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:27,100
你嘴里塞满东西时不该讲话
You know, you shouldn't talk with your mouth full.

837
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,700
那很粗鲁  来吧
It's very rude. Come on.

838
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,540
你们是什么人
Who the hell are you?

839
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:35,410
我们是好人
We're the good guys.

840
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,290
不  你们是作死的人
Oh, no, you're the fucking dead guys.

841
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,660
艾森豪威尔  咬
Eisenhower! Schwantz!

842
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:49,760
上
on!

843
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,230
女孩们在哪
Where are the girls?

844
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,670
快点  老兄  我有心脏问题
Come on, man. I've got a heart problem.

845
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,830
是吗
Oh, yeah?

846
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,660
不是
No.

847
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,440
你想要我帮你解决
Do you want me to solve that for you?

848
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:05,910
好  女孩们在楼上公寓里
Okay. The girls are upstairs in the apartments.

849
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,580
我弟弟在管钱
My little brother, he's on the till-

850
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,250
他是大学生
He's just a college kid.

851
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:12,120
-海扁王  暗夜骚货  -就来
-Kick-Ass, Night Bitch. -On it.

852
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:15,250
雷夫・达米克会杀了你们
Ralph D'Amico is gonna end you for this.

853
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:16,760
好痛
It hurts!

854
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:20,090
是啊  有只狗在咬你的蛋
Yeah, there's a dog on your balls.

855
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:24,960
你要钱吗  桌上有五万块
You want money? There's 50 grand on the table.

856
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:27,940
求你了让它停下  求你了
Please just make him stop! Please!

857
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:31,270
你以为能收买我们  你是这么想的
You think you can buy us? Is that what you think?

858
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,540
我们不是来抢钱的
We're not here to steal from you.

859
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:38,670
我们是来给你们这些混账捎信的
We're here to send a message to all the other bottom-dwellers.

860
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,950
-我们要你们关门大吉  -快点
-We're shutting you down. -Come on.

861
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:44,780
外面有受虐妇女庇护所的货车
There is a van waiting outside from a battered women's shelter.

862
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,190
他会带你们去安全地点
It'll take you some place safe.

863
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,320
-走  走吧  -我们不能离开
-Go. Go. -We really can't leave.

864
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:51,190
我们没有钱
We have no money.

865
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,120
单挑王  桌上有多少钱
Battle Guy, how much they have on the table?

866
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,160
我想有五万块
Oh, it's like 50 grand.

867
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,030
你们现在钱够了
You got plenty now.

868
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,640
谢谢
Thank you.

869
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,970
大家做得好
Good job, guys.

870
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,540
非常干净利落
Very tidy. Very tidy.

871
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,660
怎不敢相信  你用钱指着那人
I can't believe you pulled a gun on that guy.

872
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:19,380
你真的会开枪吗
Were you really gonna shoot him?

873
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,390
我告诉你一个秘密
Let you in on a little secret.

874
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,660
没子弹  别告诉坏人
Empty. Don't tell the bad guys.

875
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,580
原谅我的粗话  上校
Pardon my language, Colonel,

876
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,890
你他妈真有种
but you have got some serious balls.

877
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:32,230
绝对比金先生有种
Certainly more than Mr. Kim.

878
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,740
"有只狗在咬我的蛋"
"There's a dog on my balls."

879
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,870
该死
God damn it.

880
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:41,330
-贾维尔  -发生什么事了
-Javier! -What happened?

881
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,940
有个小弟发给我有关妓院报道的链接
Some douche just posted a link to a story about a whorehouse,

882
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,040
说海扁王破坏了他们
says that Kick-Ass' team took them out.

883
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,850
搞什么  我的手下呢
What the hell? Where's my crew?

884
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,110
克里斯  每个人都...
Chris, everybody's just...

885
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:53,790
你们先离开一下好吗
Uh, can you ladies excuse us for a second?

886
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:55,120
她们能听
Uh, no, they're my sidekicks.

887
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,590
不  她们是我的跟班
They can listen to what we have to say.

888
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,720
他们不是你的跟班  克里斯
They're not your sidekicks, Chris.

889
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,060
她们是妓女和目击者
They're prostitutes and witnesses, come on.

890
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,030
好吧  抱歉  别介意.
All right. Sorry, no offense.

891
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,070
每个人都太害怕雷夫叔叔
Everybody's just too afraid of your Uncle Ralph

892
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:05,860
接手这工作
to take the job.

893
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:06,960
但是他在坐牢
But he's in prison.

894
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,130
没错  他现在掌控家族
Doesn't matter. He runs the family now.

895
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,540
他要每个人保持低调
And he wants everybody to lay low.

896
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:12,940
但是算你好运
But, fortunately for you,

897
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:15,540
大汤尼不懂保持低调  所以他在这
Big Tony doesn't know how to lay low, so he's in.

898
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,980
-我不记得大汤尼  他块头大吗  -他爱说反话
-I don't remember a Big Tony. Is he huge? -He's ironic.

899
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,610
五尺四寸  但是凶狠的要命
5 foot 4, but mean as shit.

900
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:28,720
他杀人杀得性起
He's go! such a hard-on for killing people.

901
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:32,320
-他个子小  但是爱杀人  -对
-He's little and he kills. -Right.

902
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:34,400
叫他"恶瘤"
Call him "The Tumor,"

903
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:35,590
下一个是谁
Who's next?

904
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,800
有个前三合会的想找个工作
All right, we've got an ex-Triad member looking for work.

905
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,840
简单  "成吉痴汉"  来吧
Easy, "Genghis Carnage." Come on.

906
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:44,570
你不能老是用种族印象取名  克里斯
You gotta quit with the racist stereotypes, Chris.

907
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:46,630
这只是原型  继续
Archetypes. Keep going.

908
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,770
好  还有卡特莲娜・丹布罗斯基
We got, uh, Katarina Dumbrovski.

909
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:49,970
等等...还有女的
Wait, wait. A chick?

910
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,100
是的
Yeah.

911
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:52,620
你说你雇佣女的
Seriously, you hired a chick?

912
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:53,880
对  他是前克格勃特工
Yeah. Former KGB.

913
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,450
被关在古拉格  直到她吃掉狱友
She was locked up in the Gulag until she ate her eel/mate.

914
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,180
好吧  "俄国大妈"
Okay. "Mother Russia."

915
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:03,660
俄国大妈和臭屁王都在同一队里
Mother Russia and Motherfucker both on the same team?

916
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:04,820
那没用的  克里斯
That doesn't work, Chris.

917
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,690
我没让你提建议  混蛋
I am not asking for suggestions, asshole.

918
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:09,960
给他们服装  让他们准备好
Just get them costumes and get them ready!

919
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:11,490
干
Shit.

920
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:13,430
贾维尔  谢谢
Javier, thank you.

921
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:16,470
我没有你就做不到
I couldn't do this without you.

922
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,700
你就是我剩下的唯一家人
You're pretty much like the only real family I have left.

923
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,700
没问题  我罩你
Not a problem, man. I got your back.

924
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,550
你有点像阿福雷德  我则是邪恶的布鲁斯・韦恩
It's kinda like you're the Alfred to my evil Bruce Wayne.

925
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:29,350
你刚说我是你该死的管家
Did you just call me your fucking butler?

926
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:31,210
对  那不是赞美吗
Yeah, is that not a compliment?

927
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:34,610
妈的  是我不好
Shit. My bad.

928
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,160
大部分夜晚没什么动静
There wasn't much action most nights.

929
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:43,720
我是说  暗夜骚货总是有点动静
I mean, there was always a little action with Night Bitch.

930
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:49,800
但是身为超级英雄  实际上是经常巡逻
The reality of being a superhero is lots of patrols.

931
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,240
但那没阻止人们要求加入
But that didn't stop people from begging to join up.

932
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:57,970
我们有了很多新成员
With all our new members,

933
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:00,370
假如不问陶德  似乎没道理
it seemed kinda shitty not to ask Todd.

934
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,750
别偷看  你要毁掉它了
Stop peeking, man, you're gonna ruin it.

935
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,880
请看
Check it out.

936
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,330
你不能穿这种衣服打击犯罪
You can't fight crime in that

937
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:12,350
你裤子紧得青蛙眼原形毕露
Your pants are so tight, you got frog-eye.

938
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,020
什么是"青蛙眼"
What the hell's "frog-eye"?

939
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:15,720
-男性的骆驼指  -什么
-Male camel toe. -What?

940
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,650
我也不太确定想用你提出的那些名字
I'm not really sure about these names, either.

941
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,350
"海扁男"
"Whup-Ass," "Kick-Ass-Man."

942
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:22,700
"海扁博士"
"Dr. Kick-Ass"? Yeah.

943
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:25,830
对  他们听起来都类似
Yeah, they all kinda seem derivative.

944
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:27,240
我来翻译一下
Let me translate that.

945
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:29,940
你不能只是抄袭戴夫的别名  马屁精
You can't just copy Dave's name, you knob-gobbler.

946
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,110
好吧
Okay.

947
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:36,210
等等  我想到了
Oh, wait. Oh, I got it.

948
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,680
我想到了  我想到了
I got it. I got it.

949
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:41,190
扁海王
"Ass Kicker"

950
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:44,120
说真的
Seriously?

951
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,460
你好缺德  马蒂
You're such a dick, Marty.

952
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:47,090
所以你才不传短信给我
I know this is why you guys aren't texting me back,

953
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,260
我不是白痴
I'm not an actual idiot.

954
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:50,530
你可以骗过我  扁海王
Well, you could have fooled me, Ass-Licker.

955
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:53,890
-去你们的  -陶德...
-Yeah. well, screw you guys. -Todd...

956
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,870
你们去死吧
No, really. Fuck you guys.

957
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:57,200
我去找自己的小队
I'm gonna go find my own team.

958
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,800
陶德  等等  别这样
Todd. Wait. Come on.

959
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:03,640
陶德说得对  我们很缺德
Todd was right, we were being dicks.

960
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:04,490
但是老实说
But the truth is,

961
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:08,080
我唯一想找来的人是明蒂
the only person I really wanted on the team was Mindy,

962
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:11,720
但是她不想再当超级英雄
but she was too busy trying not to be a superhero.

963
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:14,050
好吧  明蒂  他来了
Okay, Min, he's here.

964
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,390
你第一次约会  感觉怎么样
Your first big date. How are you feeling?

965
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,470
就像大老爸第一次派我
Like the first time Big Daddy sent me into

966
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,230
只带一把小刀闯毒穴
a crack den with nothing but a penknife.

967
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:31,100
有点七上八下
I've got some butterflies.

968
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,300
你只要做好自己  让我负责紧张
You just be yourself and you let me be nervous.

969
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,790
不用担心我
Don't worry about me.

970
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:39,080
我能用他自己的手指杀了他
I can kill a man with his own finger.

971
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:42,180
我建议你别用这句话做开场白
A word of advice, I wouldn't open with that.

972
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:48,650
谢谢你终于答应让我带你出去
Thanks for letting me finally take you out.

973
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,260
要不我怎样要你别再打电话
how else was I gonna get you to stop calling?

974
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,590
-谢谢  -不客气
-Thanks. -You're welcome.

975
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,010
我们去哪
Where are we going?

976
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,270
参加派对
To a party.

977
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:14,210
为什么选这么荒凉的地方派对
Why is this party in the middle of nowhere?

978
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:17,620
因为酒桶派对经常都在这办
Because that's where keg parties usually are, right?

979
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,670
我想我们最先到
Guess we're the first ones here.

980
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:35,330
这种地方不适合办派对  笨蛋
This isn't where you have a party, moron.

981
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:36,840
这地方适合抛尸
This is where you dump a dead body.

982
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,500
有什么问题吗
What's your problem?

983
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,740
对不起
I'm sorry.

984
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:43,380
我不会再那么刻薄
I'll stop being such a bitch.

985
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:44,740
其实你似乎是好人
You actually seem like a nice guy.

986
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:48,080
所以...
So, um...

987
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:50,580
你想不想打炮
You wanna hook up?

988
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,880
还是个大白痴
And a total idiot.

989
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,890
西蒙  回车上去
Simon, get back in the car.

990
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,730
快
Now!

991
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,100
你到了
Yay, you made it.

992
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,740
布鲁克
Brooke?

993
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:15,250
这是为了祝贺你的
This is to celebrate you.

994
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,410
祝贺
Celebrate?

995
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,510
你是多么没救的人啊
What a total loser you are.

996
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,740
我们甩掉没用的人
And we ditch losers.

997
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,880
可怜的明蒂  你觉得呢
Poor Mindy. What did you think?

998
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:29,850
酷小孩看到你有点特别
The cool kids saw something special in you

999
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,400
邀请你参加第一次派对
and invited you to your first party

1000
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,420
你在那里喝第一杯啤酒
where you'd sip your first beer

1001
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,470
还能第一次跟人嘴对嘴
and finally suck face for the first time?

1002
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,030
简单说吧  你不特别
Newsflash, you're not special.

1003
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:47,100
跟蜂后对着干  你会盯得满头包
Fuck with the queen bee and you're gonna get stung.

1004
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,870
甩掉约会对象
Date ditch.

1005
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,980
在我家开派对
Party at my house!

1006
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:54,140
真可怜
Pathetic.

1007
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,580
西蒙  开车送我们
Simon, you can drive us.

1008
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:44,190
戴夫
Dave?

1009
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,260
天啊  明蒂
Oh, my God! Mindy?

1010
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:49,830
老天啊  怎么了
Holy shit. What are you doing?

1011
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,270
我只是我想见我的罗宾
Just needed to see my Robin, I guess.

1012
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,110
你还好吧
Are you okay?

1013
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,020
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do.

1014
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,280
那些女生  她们...
Those girls, they're...

1015
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,990
她们好邪恶
They're evil.

1016
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:15,830
高中就是这样  有谁在乎呢
It's just high school. Who gives a shit?

1017
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:18,080
你应该来到真实世界
You should be out there in the real world

1018
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,390
让它变得更美好的地方
making it a better place.

1019
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,700
戴夫  我不能
Dave, I can't.

1020
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:23,540
我知道  你向你爸保证过
I know, you promised your dad.

1021
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,180
但是他已经不在了
But he's not here anymore.

1022
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:31,810
这是你的人生  必须活的精彩
This is your life. You've gotta live it.

1023
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,080
我明天该怎么面对她们
How am I supposed to face them tomorrow?

1024
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,680
我觉得好丢脸
I'm so embarrassed.

1025
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:39,750
为什么
Why?

1026
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:41,280
你很聪明
You're smart.

1027
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,020
你很美丽
You're beautiful.

1028
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,320
你很风趣
You're funny.

1029
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:49,280
你是我见过最坚强的人
You're the strongest person I've ever met.

1030
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,430
你什么都能做到
You can do anything.

1031
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,670
而且你是超杀女
And you're Hit Girl.

1032
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:56,240
不管你戴面具或化妆都无所谓
Doesn't matter if you're wearing a mask or makeup,

1033
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:57,770
你的真正本质才重要
it's who you really are.

1034
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,270
我应该怎么做  割掉她们的舌头
So what should I do? Cut their tongues out?

1035
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:03,870
不  当然不行
No! Definitely not.

1036
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,420
我是在逗你
I'm fucking with you.

1037
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:10,750
只要以其人之道还其人之身
Just beat them at their own game.

1038
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,950
方法就是做你自己
By being yourself.

1039
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,860
如果你真的想受欢迎
Well, if you really wanna be popular,

1040
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,660
考虑这样东西
consider two little words,

1041
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:29,030
"性爱""录像带"
"sexy" "tape."

1042
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:48,320
露易丝  你不需要被损得体无完肤
Lois, you don't need these ax wounds.

1043
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,920
假如我能打扮得像她们  你也能
If I can dress like them, so can you.

1044
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,260
这是礼物  某个失踪毒贩送的
It's a gift from some drug dealer who went missing.

1045
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:58,400
只因为你打扮得像我们
Just because you dress like us,

1046
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,470
不代表你能跟我们一样
doesn't mean you can be like one of us.

1047
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:04,070
不管我穿什么衣服  你的或者我的
It doesn't matter what costume I wear, yours or mine,

1048
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,010
我都是超级英雄  我就是这种人
I'm a superhero. That's who I am.

1049
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:09,110
好  舔阴队长
Okay, Captain Muffin-Muncher,

1050
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:10,810
你去痛快的自欺欺人吧
have fun playing make-believe.

1051
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:11,940
这个
This?

1052
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,640
这一切是自欺欺人  布鲁克
This is all make-believe, Brooke.

1053
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,240
实际上你是邪恶的贱货
The reality is you're an evil bitch

1054
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,750
跟最恶劣的下流罪犯一样坏
who's just as bad as the worst criminal scum.

1055
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,360
你玩真的  明蒂
You wanna get real, Mindy?

1056
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,960
在真实世界  我会赢
In the real world, I win.

1057
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,150
我会上一流大学  嫁给猛男
I go to an awesome college, I marry a hot guy

1058
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:29,570
我生下漂亮宝宝给奶妈照顾
and I make adorable babies for my nanny to take care of

1059
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:30,960
我们则去巴黎度假
while we vacay in Paris.

1060
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:34,830
我是人生胜利组  你是人生失败组
My life is gonna rock and yours is gonna suck.

1061
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,130
不管你的穿着有多骚
And no matter how slutty you dress,

1062
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,770
没有男生想亲你叫做嘴巴的那个洞
no boy is ever gonna wanna kiss that hole you call a mouth.

1063
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,960
所以你不如少对我们哀叫
So why don't you spare us all the whining

1064
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,210
现在去割腕
and slit your wrists now?

1065
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,010
因为唯一能破坏我这一天的事
'Cause the only thing that's gonna ruin my day

1066
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,880
是看到你的脸
is looking at your face one more second.

1067
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:51,120
早就告诉她了
Told her. Damn.

1068
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:55,020
那是什么  贫民手机
What's that? A ghetto cell phone?

1069
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:57,810
连回嘴都要打电话找人帮忙
Gonna call for help with a come-back?

1070
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:02,730
其实我爸是从国防部的雇员手中买的
Actually, my daddy bought this from a disgruntled DARPA employee.

1071
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,860
你看  这是用来控制民众的
You see, it was designed for crowd control,

1072
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,860
但是被认为太过强烈
but deemed too severe.

1073
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:10,000
他会发送脉冲  造成上吐下泻
It emits a pulse that creates spontaneous nausea and diarrhea.

1074
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:12,640
他叫它为"病棍"
He called it "the sick stick."

1075
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:14,570
不是你爸骗人的吧
Either your daddy got ripped off,

1076
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:16,980
还是你自欺欺人  亲爱的
or you're back in make-believe land, sweetheart,

1077
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,640
因为我们感觉好美妙
because we feel fabulous.

1078
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,310
为时不久
Not for long.

1079
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:32,020
天啊
Oh, my God!

1080
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,160
不要靠近我  求你了  你赢了
You get away from me. Please, you win.

1081
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:36,990
我不想赢
I don't wanna win.

1082
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:38,830
我只是想让世界变得更美好
I just want to make the world a better place.

1083
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,510
爸
Dad?

1084
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,250
在家吗  爸
You home? Dad?

1085
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:03,420
看看你都做了些什么
Is this what you've been up to

1086
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,720
而我还要打夜工  就为你上大学
while I'm out working nights saving for your college?

1087
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:08,130
你装扮成这样就是为了跟人打架
You've been dressing up and fighting people?

1088
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:11,060
棍子上都有血迹
There is blood on these stick things.

1089
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,730
你在我房间干嘛
What are you doing in my room?

1090
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:15,700
我在找有没有毒品
I was looking for drugs.

1091
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,800
我在为你担心
I was worried about you.

1092
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,070
好吧  你能住手了
Okay, good. Now you can stop.

1093
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:19,970
不  我现在更担心了
No. Now I'm even more worried.

1094
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,100
天啊  戴夫  吸毒算是好的了
Jesus, Dave, drugs would have been better.

1095
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,870
这是丧心病狂
This is deranged.

1096
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,880
有些人表现更糟
Some people do a lot worse.

1097
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,780
-跟你混的那些人  -不
-Oh, the people you hang outwith? -No.

1098
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:30,110
跟我一起的都是超级英雄
The people I hang out with are superheroes.

1099
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:32,280
这种人不存在  戴夫
There is no such thing, Dave.

1100
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:35,220
这是真实世界  有真实后果
This is the real world with real consequences.

1101
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,620
你什么时候才会长大
When are you gonna grow up?

1102
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,390
假如代表成你这样  永远不要
If it means turning into you, never.

1103
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:40,790
我不是因为觉得丢脸才戴上面罩
I don't wear the mask because I'm ashamed of who I am.

1104
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,890
跟你不同
Not like you.

1105
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:44,900
你什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

1106
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,300
不在工作时  你做仰卧起坐
If you're not at work, you're here doing crunches.

1107
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:49,270
为的是什么  好让你看起来像别人
Why? So you can look like someone else?

1108
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:51,570
也许多过几年无所事事的生活
Maybe get a few more years of doing nothing?

1109
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:53,800
你的生活没有意义  爸
Your life has no meaning, Dad.

1110
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,570
当你过世时  谁会注意
When you're gone, who's gonna notice?

1111
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:56,640
你要去哪
Where the hell are you going?

1112
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:59,810
我要离开  人长大时都这么做
Oh, uh, I'm leaving. That's what you do when you grow up.

1113
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,920
他说过为什么见我吗
Did he say why he wanted to see me?

1114
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:12,690
当你的雷夫叔叔打来  我不发问
When your Uncle Ralph calls, I don't ask questions.

1115
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:18,130
就是这个孩子
Just the kid.

1116
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,430
克里斯  冷静面对  你会应付的
Chris, just be cool and you'll be fine.

1117
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,810
你好吗
Hey, how you doing?

1118
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:30,180
很好  雷夫叔叔
Good, Uncle Ralph.

1119
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:31,210
听我说  克里斯
Listen, Chrissy,

1120
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:33,940
你爸过世后各方面情况都很艰苦
things have been tough all around since your dad,

1121
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,110
你知道的
you know.

1122
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:39,110
我试着在监狱里把家族带上正轨
Well, I been trying to get the family back on track from in here.

1123
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,980
雷夫叔叔  他们会记录对话
They record these things.

1124
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,460
我知道  没关系
I know, it's fine.

1125
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:45,190
典狱长是我朋友  现在听我说
The warden's a pal. Now listen to me.

1126
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,730
想玩玩没关系
It's okay to have a bit of fun,

1127
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,960
但是你不能聘请一群强力打手
but you can't go hiring a gang of heavy hitters.

1128
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:51,030
贾维尔应该告诉你才对
Javier should have told you.

1129
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,530
不  没关系
No, it doesn't matter.

1130
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:53,460
雷夫叔叔
Uncle Ralph,

1131
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:56,630
海扁王对我们的仇我会要他付出代价
I am gonna make Kick-Ass pay for what he did to us.

1132
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,680
克里斯  你必须忘记那家伙
Chrissy, you need to forget that punk.

1133
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:01,640
更重要的是你别沾上这事
It's more important that you stay out of this.

1134
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,980
你跟我或者你爸不一样  你...
You're not like me, or your dad, you're, uh...

1135
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:07,140
很特别
Special.

1136
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,180
你再也不能指使我该怎么做了
You can't tell me what to do anymore.

1137
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:17,160
我知道我是什么人
I know who I am now.

1138
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,320
是吗
Oh, yeah?

1139
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,720
你是什么人
And who's that?

1140
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:22,200
臭屁王
The Motherfucker.

1141
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:30,100
你以为你是大坏蛋
You think you're the big bad guy, huh?

1142
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:35,040
让我给你看真正的邪恶是什么样子
Let me show you what real evil looks like.

1143
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:45,950
喂
Hello?

1144
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,550
贾维尔  你好吗
Javier, what's going on?

1145
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,250
克里斯  什么事
Chris, what's up?

1146
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:51,850
你拿卢的手机干嘛
What are you doing on Lou's phone, huh?

1147
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,790
你自己的又掉进马桶了
Drop yours in the toilet again?

1148
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,090
一切好吗
Everything okay?

1149
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:22,420
谢谢你  我需要它
Thank you for that I needed it.

1150
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,290
为接下来的事做准备
For what comes next.

1151
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:26,830
别傻了  克里斯
Don't be stupid, Chris.

1152
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,710
出城一阵子
Just get out of town for a while.

1153
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:30,130
去上大学子类的
Go to college or something.

1154
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:33,760
为什么  你只教过我该知道的一切
Why? You just taught me everything I needed to know.

1155
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,640
看啊
Voila!

1156
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:45,420
经典又别致  好极了
Presto and elegant, damn.

1157
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:48,580
他们设计的标志很有品味
Them boys designed a very tasty logo.

1158
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:55,790
怎么回事  你听见了什么
What's the matter, girl? You hear something?

1159
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,760
来吧  我们去看看  来吧
Come on, let's go see. Come on!

1160
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,660
这有人吗
Anybody out here?

1161
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:09,930
我什么都没看见
I don't see anything.

1162
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,140
你必须呆在这里
Gonna have to stay in there

1163
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,840
直到冷静下来  你个疯子
until you calm down, you lunatic.

1164
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:21,480
不知道你在烦心什么
I wonder what's bothering you.

1165
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:24,950
我知道  今晚你死了
I know. Tonight you die.

1166
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,160
女士优先
Ladies first.

1167
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:29,990
你不会开枪
You will not shoot me.

1168
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:31,700
你是超级英雄
You are superhero.

1169
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:34,820
你们帮助人们  而不是伤害他们
You help people. You do not hurt them.

1170
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:37,700
那是超级反派的领域
That's supervillain territory.

1171
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:39,200
我喜欢这样称呼我的小团体
Or as I like to call my little gang,

1172
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,700
剧毒超级组
the Toxic Mega-Cums.

1173
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:50,540
对  像你的头
Yeah, like your head.

1174
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,490
很疼啊
Ooh, it's gotta hurt!

1175
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,500
我对你做过研究的  上校
I did my homework on you, Colonel.

1176
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:23,510
你以前叫赛尔・贝托里尼  对不对
You used to be Sal Bertolini, didn't you?

1177
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:27,520
在"重生"之前  你为我爸爸做过一些事
Did a few jobs for my dad back in the day, before you got "born again."

1178
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:30,920
我以前跟很多烂人混
I used to hang with a lot of losers.

1179
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:35,130
你想过会这样死掉吗  赛尔
Is this how you thought you'd die, Sal?

1180
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:36,550
打扮得像个蠢货
Dressed like an idiot?

1181
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,090
你是什么家伙
Who are you supposed to be?

1182
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,030
我是臭屁王
I'm The Motherfucker!

1183
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:45,530
来终结海扁王  不只是杀了他
And I'm here to end Kick-Ass. Not just kill him.

1184
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:49,200
我还要搞臭他爱护的一切
I am gonna shit on everything that he loves.

1185
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:52,140
毁掉这个地方  伙计们
Let's trash this place, guys.

1186
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,380
"米兰达・斯维登"
"Miranda Swedlow"?

1187
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,690
这是谁  赛尔
Who's that, Sal?

1188
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:05,990
她是你队里的贱货之一
She one of the whores on your team?

1189
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:23,630
暗夜骚货  紧紧贴着海扁王
Night Bitch all snuggled up to Kick-Ass.

1190
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:26,170
看来这个小子有新的辣妹来泄欲了
Looks like our boy's got a new hot pocket.

1191
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:30,140
要我杀了他的狗吗
Want me to kill his dog?

1192
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,340
杀狗  拜托  我还没那么邪恶
The dog? Jesus Christ, I'm not that evil.

1193
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:37,180
砍掉那老家伙的头
Cut the old man's head off.

1194
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:39,480
你们饿了没  我饿死了  快
You guys hungry? I'm starving. Come on.

1195
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:41,680
披萨  我们能叫披萨吗
Pizza, can we get pizza?

1196
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:42,780
我们要叫披萨
We're getting pizza.

1197
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:45,660
别担心  我先杀了你
Don't worry, I kill you first.

1198
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:52,660
正义永存
Justice For ever.

1199
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,760
一名布鲁克林居民昨晚被发现遭人斩首
A Brooklyn resident was found decapitated last night.

1200
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:57,010
根据推特
According to Twitter,

1201
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:59,880
宣称是世上第一个超级反派的人犯下这起攻击...
a man claiming to be the world's first supervillain...

1202
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,770
我说过  不能看电视  你被禁足了
Hold you, no TV. You're grounded, remember?

1203
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,500
马库斯  我知道我向你保证过
Marcus, I know I made you a promise,

1204
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,980
但我不能伪装身份
but I can't keep being someone I'm not.

1205
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,880
当我看到邪恶时  必须阻止它
When I see evil, I have to stop it.

1206
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:11,340
明蒂  你对校内那些女生的做法
Mindy, what you did to those girls at school

1207
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,220
令人不能接受
was unacceptable.

1208
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:13,430
你可能会伤害他们
You could have really hurt them.

1209
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:14,320
对的  我有可能
You're right, I could have,

1210
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:16,290
但我只是让她们痛着肚子回去
but instead I sent them home with tummy-aches.

1211
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:17,950
有什么大不了的
Boo-fucking-hoo.

1212
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:18,700
我不懂
I don't get it.

1213
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:21,160
这种对复仇的执迷不健康
This obsession that you have with revenge is not healthy.

1214
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,130
假如你不让我和警方干正事
If you don't let me and the police do our jobs,

1215
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:25,030
我没别的事可做
there is gonna be nothing that I can do for you.

1216
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,630
你永远不能过正常生活
You're never gonna have a normal life

1217
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:28,170
下场会跟你父亲一样
and you'll probably end up like your father.

1218
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:29,970
马库斯  他们砍掉一个人的头
Marcus, they cut a guy's head off.

1219
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:31,970
还有谁能阻止他们
Who else is going to stop them?

1220
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:34,130
海扁王  你
Kick-Ass? You?

1221
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:37,340
回房间做功课
You go to your room and do your homework.

1222

现在
Now!

01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:55,700
各位  我们在给上校姐姐的慰问卡上签名
Hey, guys, we're signing a sympathy card for the Colonel's sister.

1224
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:57,420
你们想不想捐出五元
You wanna go 5 bucks each

1225
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:59,700
我们可以代表团队送花呢
so we can send flowers from the team?

1226
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:03,400
你看到臭屁王的推特没有
Did you guys see The Motherfuckers Twitter page?

1227
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:05,600
这家伙是谁  他有什么问题
Who is this guy? And what's his problem with us?

1228
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:08,370
我不知道  但他吃了熊心豹子胆
I don't know, but he has got some elephant-sized balls.

1229
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,690
他一直在网络上吹嘘
He's been bragging on the web

1230
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:11,070
他们对上校干了什么好事
about what they did to the Colonel.

1231
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,580
能追踪到他吗
Can that be traced?

1232
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:15,410
我试过  他的IP经过屏蔽
I tried. His IP address is masked.

1233
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:17,070
好吧  我们要这么做
All right, here's what we're gonna do.

1234
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:18,210
我们要组织攻击
We're gonna organize a fight.

1235
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:20,550
网上很多人说要他们要加入
There are a lot of guys online who said they're in if we need them.

1236
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:22,720
你开玩笑吧  这不是西城故事
Are you kidding me? This isn't West Side Story.

1237
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:24,690
我们加入不是为了混帮派
We didn't join up to be in a gang.

1238
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:26,130
我们是为了帮助人们
We did this so we could help people.

1239
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:28,360
说得对.这件事留给警方处理
Shannon! right. We need to leave this to the cops.

1240
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:29,960
我们最好现在开始两两一起行动
We better start walking in pairs.

1241
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:33,970
臭屁王说  上校只是一个开始
Motherfuckers tweeted that the Colonel was just the beginning.

1242
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:35,970
有人见过暗夜骚货吗
Anybody seen Night Bitch?

1243
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:49,050
你确定她在那团队里
Are you sure she's on that team?

1244
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:51,660
那蠢货在她网站上发帖子
Stupid gash posted on her superhero page

1245
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:53,280
说她和海扁王交往过
that shes dating Kick-Ass.

1246
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:55,450
所以是  我确定
So, yeah, I'm damn sure.

1247
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:00,760
你好啊  暗夜骚货
Hello, Night Bitch!

1248
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:05,990
她想到楼上玩
Oh, she wants to take the party upstairs.

1249
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:08,260
我们要来开派对
We're gonna have a party.

1250
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:10,240
她关上了门
She closed the door.

1251
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:17,610
别担心  亲爱的  我不会杀你
Don't worry, darling, I'm not gonna kill you.

1252
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:20,310
我要你传信给你男朋友
I want you to give a message to your boyfriend.

1253
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:23,780
来啊  虫子
Come on, wriggly.

1254
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:25,080
放手
Let go!

1255
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:27,950
你跟超级英雄上完床了  宝贝
You're done banging superheroes, baby.

1256
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,690
现在来看邪恶的jj是什么感觉
it's time to see what evil dick feels like.

1257
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,700
该死
Shit.

1258
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,670
有什么问题
What's wrong?

1259
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,940
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

1260
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,140
来吧
Come on!

1261
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:54,450
天啊  好吧  我只是...我情绪没上来
God, okay, I'm just... I'm not in the mood.

1262
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:56,680
我猜邪恶jj常感觉软趴趴的
I guess evil dick feels limp.

1263
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,780
弄她  下手狠点
Hurt her. Bad!

1264
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:03,350
警察来了
Cops are coming.

1265
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:05,080
让俄国大妈处理
Leave it to Mother Russia.

1266
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,900
她赚的钱是我们的十倍
She makes 10 times what we do.

1267
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:10,730
一星期五万  加上开销
Fifty thousand a week. Plus expenses.

1268
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:13,630
小心
Hey, watch out!

1269
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:36,650
掉头  掉头
Reverse it! Reverse it!

1270
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,900
不准动  停下
Don't move! Freeze!

1271
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:55,340
五万元  她值这个价!
Fifty thousand. She's worth it'

1272
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:05,920
她为什么后退
Whoa, whoa! Why are they backing up?

1273
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:07,850
行李箱上为什么有割草机
Why is there a lawnmower on the trunk?

1274
01:08:19,690 --> 01:08:21,400
需要支援  八人伤亡
We need back-up, eight men down.

1275
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:24,270
我想是十人
I think you mean 10.

1276
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:37,820
闪人了  把话传出去  我们要打造邪恶大军
Let's bounce! Put the word out I'm building an evil army.

1277
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:40,220
欢迎所有变态和歹徒
All psychopaths and ex-cons welcome.

1278
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:42,260
我想你不会有问题
I don't think you're gonna have a problem

1279
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:43,550
当人们听到时
when people hear about this.

1280
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:50,160
他们凭空消失了
They just disappeared?

1281
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,970
他们只要脱下面具就行
All they have to do is take off their masks,

1282
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:53,060
没人能认出来
no one's gonna recognize them

1283
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:54,470
他们穿便服
once they're back in their street clothes.

1284
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,440
请注意
Your attention, please!

1285
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,910
FBI追踪其他所有变装怪胎的IP
Feds traced the IP addresses for all those other costumed freaks.

1286
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,480
我们找来了州了所有执法单位
We got every law enforcement agency

1287
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:04,770
准备同时行动
in the state working to hit them at once!

1288
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,640
为什么海扁王在名单上
Why is Kick-Ass on this list?

1289
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:07,770
他的成员从事社区服务
His crew does community service.

1290
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:08,940
我不在乎
I don't give a shit.

1291
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:11,010
戴面具的都要拘留
Anyone wearing a mask is getting detained.

1292
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:13,520
今晚要一了百了
We're putting an end to this tonight!

1293
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:17,580
很多人说警察那一晚出手太重了
A lot of people said the cops were too heavy-handed that night.

1294
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,460
但是必须看当时情况
But you gotta put it into context.

1295
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,330
警方不介意我们在真实生活中搞超级英雄这套
The police didn't mind our real life superhero stuff

1296
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:25,830
当我们捡垃圾
as long as we were picking up litter

1297
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,630
或者扶老太太过马路时
or helping old ladies cross the street.

1298
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,860
但是突然间  事情变得严重
But suddenly it was serious.

1299
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:36,280
突然间  我们代表社会出的一切问题
Suddenly we represented everything that was wrong with society.

1300
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,110
别动
Freeze!

1301
01:09:38,370 --> 01:09:42,150
爸爸警告过我  真实世界有真实后果
Dad had warned me that the real world had real consequences.

1302
01:09:42,610 --> 01:09:43,520
他们开车过来时
As they pulled up,

1303
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,880
他一定觉得自己讲得有道理
he must have been feeling pretty damn vindicated.

1304
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:51,160
妈的  戴夫  你做了什么事
Oh, shit, Dave. What have you done?

1305
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,720
警察  开门
Police, open up.

1306
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,800
是我  海扁王
Uh, uh, it's me, Kick-Ass.

1307
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:13,880
面具下你其实很可爱.
You're actually pretty cute under that mask.

1308
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:18,320
我对发生的事感到抱歉
I'm so sorry about what happened.

1309
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,880
不必
Don't be.

1310
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:22,650
是我自己的错
It's my own fault.

1311
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:25,420
我们会找到这些混蛋  做出对的事
We're gonna find these assholes and make this right.

1312
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,220
做到又怎样
What's the point?

1313
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,060
我是说  我们超级英雄的程度
I mean, we're really superheroes

1314
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,830
跟我们交往的程度一样浅薄
about as much as we're really dating.

1315
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,030
我们连彼此的名字都不知道
We don't even know each others names.

1316
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:39,740
我想现在应该回归真实世界了
I think it's time to get back to the real world.

1317
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,600
我以为我们试着让世界更美好
I thought we were trying to make it a better place.

1318
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
那么为何世界更糟了
Then why is it worse?

1319
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:50,880
也许暗夜骚货是对的
Maybe Night Bitch was right,

1320
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:53,340
这表示爸爸也是对的
which means Dad was, too.

1321
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:57,350
事情已经失控
I mean, things had gotten out of hand.

1322
01:10:57,850 --> 01:11:00,230
也许我不该继续到马蒂家睡觉
Maybe it was time for me to stop crashing at Marty's

1323
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:02,200
应该开始道歉
and start apologizing.

1324
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,070
爸
Dad?

1325
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:15,540
那是我爸
That's my dad.

1326
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,150
你爸是海扁王  什么
Your dad's Kick-Ass? What?

1327
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,870
他刚招出自己来
Yeah, he just gave himself up.

1328
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:23,380
不  你们不了解  他这么做是想保护我
You don't understand. He's doing this to protect me.

1329
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:24,750
爸
Dad!

1330
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:26,710
爸
Dad!

1331
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:45,430
-明蒂  -戴夫
-Mindy? -Dave?

1332
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,100
我需要你帮忙  我爸被捕了
I need your help. My dad's been arrested.

1333
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:49,300
他们以为他是海扁王  你能跟马库斯谈谈吗
They think he's Kick-Ass. Can you talk to Marcus?

1334
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,240
-我被禁足了  -又怎样
-I'm grounded. -So?

1335
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:53,180
表示我不能参与
So that means I can't get involved.

1336
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:54,910
好  等等  我希望我能帮忙
Look. Wait a second. I wish I could help.

1337
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:57,310
明蒂  你在讲电话
Mindy! Are you on the phone?

1338
01:11:57,410 --> 01:11:58,510
我必须挂了  好吗
Look, I gotta go, okay?

1339
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,280
对不起  戴夫
I'm sorry, Dave.

1340
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:01,480
明蒂  等等  等等
Mindy, wait, wait.

1341
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:15,800
你到底在想什么
Hey, what the hell were you thinking?

1342
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:17,840
我也想问同样的问题
Yeah, I could ask you the same thing.

1343
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:19,970
我不敢相信你骗了他们
I can't believe you lied to them.

1344
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:21,670
我不能什么也不做
I wasn't gonna do nothing while you went to jail.

1345
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:25,010
这是我的选择  你应该让自己应付后果
I chose this. You should let me deal with the consequences.

1346
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:26,550
我以为你要我成长
I thought you wanted me to grow up.

1347
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,940
是啊  当你有一天自己有孩子后
Yeah? When you get a kid of your own one day,

1348
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:29,850
你会了解的
you'll understand.

1349
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:30,940
我要告诉他们真相
I'm gonna tell them the truth.

1350
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:33,110
不  这只会火上浇油
No. It'll just make things worse.

1351
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,190
我跟我律师谈过
Look, I spoke to my attorney.

1352
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,120
他说他们明天就得放我走
He said they gotta let me out by tomorrow.

1353
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,660
没有犯下实质罪行
No actual crime was committed.

1354
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:44,790
外面有人想杀了海扁王
There are people out there who wanna kill Kick-Ass.

1355
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:48,130
警察在外面找他们
Well, the cops are out there looking for them,

1356
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:50,390
所以对海扁王最安全的地方就是这里
so the safest place for Kick-Ass is right here,

1357
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:52,040
被关起来
locked away.

1358
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,510
我不知道你怎么扯进来的  可是...
I don't know how you got into all this shit, but...

1359
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:55,920
但是你必须保证
you gotta promise me

1360
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,810
你永远不能再穿上那套衣服
you will never dress up in that outfit again.

1361
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,810
听见了吗
Do you hear me?

1362
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:09,750
我保证
I promise.

1363
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:21,330
恶魔之巢归我了
This evil lair owns!

1364
01:13:21,490 --> 01:13:23,490
人们还在说那个词吗  "归我"
Do people still say that, "own"?

1365
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:25,400
是的  当然
Yeah, of course.

1366
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,600
你的鲨鱼  有点不对头
Your shark. Somethings wrong.

1367
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:29,230
估计你用错水了
Think you used the wrong kind of water.

1368
01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:30,510
搞什么  伊优
What the hell, Eyal?

1369
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:31,210
没事  克里斯
It's fine, Chris.

1370
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:32,910
它们本来就该躺在水底
They're supposed to lie at the bottom of the tank.

1371
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,080
这就是它们在环境中安顿下来的方式
It's just their way of, how you say, settling into their environment.

1372
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:38,020
别搞我好吗
Don't screw me on this, okay?

1373
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,250
你说我们会准备好
You said we'd be ready in two days,

1374
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:40,580
可是我们连男厕所都没有
we don't even have a men's room yet.

1375
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,920
别担心
Don't worry.

1376
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:43,920
那袋子是干什么的
What's with the bags of shit?

1377
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,790
用来制造炸弹的肥料
It's fertilizer for the bombs.

1378
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,140
算不上超级反派
You're not a supervillain

1379
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:49,260
假如你没有毁灭城市的计划
if you don't have a plan to destroy the city.

1380
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:51,770
这行不通  你需要化学肥料
It will not work. You need a chemical kind.

1381
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:54,350
一切都要我来动手吗
Do I have to do everything myself?

1382
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:55,200
你来补救
Just fix it!

1383
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,670
你必须放松
You must relax.

1384
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:59,210
一切按计划进行
Everything is going as planned.

1385
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:01,780
不  根本没有  好吗
Mmm, no. No. Except it's not, okay?

1386
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:04,880
那个苦瓜脸不是海扁王
That sad sack is not Kick-Ass.

1387
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,380
我见过海扁王  他和我年纪差不多
I've seen Kick-Ass, he's like my age.

1388
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,380
那家伙能当他老爸了
Guy's old enough to be his father.

1389
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,890
没开玩笑  对吧
No shit, right.

1390
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:13,890
抱歉  你是谁
I'm sorry, who are you?

1391
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:17,150
我自愿加入你的邪恶大军  跟其他人一样
I, uh, volunteered for your evil army, like the others.

1392
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,910
好的  我很感激
Right. I appreciate that.

1393
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:20,730
谢谢你为这目标加入
Thanks for joining the cause.

1394
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:24,330
这是核心群体的VIP区域
This is the VIP area for the core group.

1395
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,130
你会这么说真有趣
I just thought it was funny you said that.

1396
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:28,730
因为那是海扁王的爸爸
Because he is Kick-Ass, father.

1397
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:29,840
谁
Who?

1398
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:32,000
莱佐斯基先生,  他是海扁王的爸
Mr. Lizewski. He's Kick-Ass, dad.

1399
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,070
少来
Shut up!

1400
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:37,970
是的  你不会告诉其他人  对吧
Yeah. You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?

1401
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:39,410
不
No.

1402
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,980
但是你  我的朋友  你刚赢得
But you, my friend, have just earned

1403
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:44,610
VIP区的使用权
life-time access to my VIP area.

1404
01:14:44,810 --> 01:14:46,580
去找个位置坐下
Go take a little seat.

1405
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:47,850
给那小子一杯星冰乐
Hey, get the kid a Frappuccino,

1406
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:50,590
然后送回去工作
then put his little punk ass back to work.

1407
01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:57,360
好的
Okay.

1408
01:14:58,260 --> 01:14:59,600
来吧
Come on.

1409
01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:13,670
有什么事
Can I help you?

1410
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:16,880
臭屁王要我们和你一起照相
The Motherfucker wants us to take a picture with you.

1411
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,710
我爸是好律师  这很有帮助
It helps that my dad is a really good lawyer.

1412
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,480
我想我这帅哥
Because I don't think my beautiful ass

1413
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23,620
在牢里撑不了多久
would last too long in prison.

1414
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:25,240
好奇怪
Whoa, that's weird.

1415
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:27,690
克里斯・达米克刚传给我照片
Chris D'Amico just texted me a picture.

1416
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:30,860
红旋风  那家伙发生什么事
Red Mist? Whatever happened to that guy?

1417
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,040
什么照片
What is it?

1418
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:40,530
怎么了
Dude, what's wrong?

1419
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,010
这是什么
What is it?

1420
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:03,590
接下来的几天好像在迷雾里过去
The next few days passed in a fog.

1421
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,870
我跟警方提过克里斯  但是帮不上忙
It didn't matter that I told the police about Chris,

1422
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:11,200
他们找不到他
they couldn't find him.

1423
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:14,840
警方的确出席爸爸的葬礼
The cops did show up at Dad's funeral,

1424
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,410
不是表达敬意
not out of respect,

1425
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:19,710
而是他们害怕可能会出事
but because they were scared something would happen.

1426
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,540
我爸爸是个正派人
My dad was a decent man.

1427
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:25,680
他只想为我提供美好的生活
All he ever did was try and give me a good life,

1428
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,950
我跟他说当他过世时没人会注意
and I told him no one would notice when he was gone.

1429
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:31,860
我爱你  小子
I love you, pal.

1430
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,720
我也爱你  爸
I love you, too, Dad.

1431
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:42,970
你们出席了
You guys came.

1432
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:46,550
我们想帮你追踪克里斯・达米克这混蛋
We'd love to help you track down this Chris D'Amico d-bag,

1433
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:46,910
可是...
but...

1434
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,310
我们刚刚出狱
we just got out on parole.

1435
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,810
不  没关系
No, that's fine.

1436
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,400
我不是打算复仇
I'm not looking for revenge.

1437
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:55,120
我对爸做的最后保证
Last thing I promised my dad

1438
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,980
是我会放弃这件事
was that I was gonna give this up.

1439
01:16:57,370 --> 01:16:59,580
那正是我要做的
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

1440
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:01,420
但这一切是你开的头
But you started this.

1441
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:03,820
现在由我结束
Now I'm ending it.

1442
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,730
戴夫  对不起
Dave, I'm so sorry.

1443
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:17,340
你在恨我没帮忙吗
Do you hate me for not helping?

1444
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:19,460
不  一点也不会
No, not even a little bit.

1445
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:22,780
你说的对  你放弃了
You were right. You gave it up.

1446
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:27,680
假如我也放弃  我爸还会活着
If I had, too, my dad would still be alive.

1447
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,580
我唯一怪罪的是我自己
The only person I blame is myself.

1448
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:47,960
开始干吧
Let's do this!

1449
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:51,830
趴下
Get down!

1450
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:57,780
明蒂
Mindy!

1451
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:01,040
散开
Spread out!

1452
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:11,220
头趴下
Keep your head down!

1453
01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:23,030
快
Come on!

1454
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,240
抓住他
Get him!

1455
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:32,910
把车开过去
Get that van over here!

1456
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:36,810
快点
Hurry up!

1457
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:40,420
明蒂
Mindy?

1458
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:41,890
明蒂
Mindy!

1459
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:52,160
明蒂
Mindy?

1460
01:18:58,230 --> 01:19:00,330
你必须把它戴上
You gotta put this on.

1461
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,740
我不会照做
I'm not gonna do it.

1462
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:11,420
不论做什么事都伤不了我
There's nothing left you can do to hurt me.

1463
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:15,420
你想赌吗
You wanna bet?

1464
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,120
来玩啊  混蛋
Game on, cocksuckers!

1465
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:29,130
车顶上有个女孩
There's a girl on the roof!

1466
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:44,070
他还在上面
She's still up there!

1467
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:02,600
-我想我击中他了  -去看看
-I think I got her! -Go check!

1468
01:20:12,770 --> 01:20:13,910
探头出去
Get out there!

1469
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:31,620
快  把头移开
Come on! Move your head.

1470
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,820
停到路边
Pull over, pube-face.

1471
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:07,840
我们知道克里斯・达米克就是臭屁王
We know Chris D'Amico is The Motherfucker.

1472
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,800
他躲哪儿去了
Where is he hiding?

1473
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:09,860
吃屎去吧
Eat a dick.

1474
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,170
你会吃自己的  如果你不说的话
You're gonna eat yours if you don't start talking.

1475
01:21:11,230 --> 01:21:13,470
开枪啊  你这小贱人
Go ahead and shoot me, you little bitch.

1476
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:16,140
你不论做什么事  我都不会说
There's nothing you can do that would make me talk.

1477
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,760
听着  等一下
Look, hold on.

1478
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,430
我现在下不了手
I can't do this right now.

1479
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:20,810
这是我爸的葬礼
It's my dad's funeral.

1480
01:21:21,370 --> 01:21:23,880
戴夫  你父亲爱你
Dave, your father loved you.

1481
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:28,210
和我爸爸爱我一样
Just like my daddy loved me.

1482
01:21:28,210 --> 01:21:30,420
我知道这令人心痛
And I know it hurts, but maybe,

1483
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:34,490
也许这就是当超级英雄的意义
maybe that's the real meaning of being a superhero.

1484
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:38,360
肩负那种痛苦  转换成好事
Is taking that pain and turning it into something good.

1485
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:40,700
转换成正当的事
Something right.

1486
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:43,900
记得你对我说过的话吗
Remember what you told me?

1487
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:47,600
这是你的人生  你必须活的精彩
This is your life. You've gotta live it.

1488
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:51,110
现在帮我找个钳子
Now help me find some pliers.

1489
01:21:51,110 --> 01:21:53,080
我要让这家伙吃自己的
I'm gonna make this guy eat his own dick.

1490
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,210
说真的
Seriously?

1491
01:21:58,180 --> 01:21:59,710
-喂  -马库斯
-Hello? -Marcus?

1492
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,850
明蒂  怎么回事  你还好吗
Mindy. What's going on? Are you okay?

1493
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:02,910
我很好
I'm fine.

1494
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:05,190
我知道臭屁王藏哪了
We know where The Motherfucker's hiding.

1495
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,860
他招募超级反派
He's recruiting an army of supervillains

1496
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:07,850
制造土制炸弹
and making homemade bombs.

1497
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:09,900
马库斯  他想烧毁全城
Marcus, he wants to burn the city down.

1498
01:22:09,950 --> 01:22:11,060
你向我保证过
You promised me.

1499
01:22:11,190 --> 01:22:12,910
我知道你把我当小女孩看待
Know you see me as this little girl,

1500
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:16,470
但我不是小女孩  从来不是
but I'm not and I never was.

1501
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:18,270
你说的对
You're right.

1502
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,570
爸爸剥夺了我的童年
Daddy did take my childhood away,

1503
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:22,410
但我不确定那是坏事
but I'm not so sure that was a bad thing.

1504
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:24,410
马库斯  他给我一份天职
Marcus, he gave me a gift,

1505
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:26,910
不论我多努力也无法逃避
a gift that I can't escape no matter how hard I try.

1506
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:29,750
我不必花上四年
And I don't need to spend the next four years of my life

1507
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:31,220
试着探索我是怎样的人
trying to figure out who I am

1508
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,280
因为我早就知道
because I already know.

1509
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,750
我是超杀女
I'm Hit Girl.

1510
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:43,180
所有超级英雄注意  我们需要你们帮助

1511
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:45,990
我贴出地址  你想他们会出现吗
I posted the address. Do you think they'll show?

1512
01:22:47,090 --> 01:22:48,300
克里斯有一只大军
Chris has an army.

1513
01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:49,960
这些现实人生总的超级呆瓜
These real life super dweebs

1514
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:52,400
一生都在等待这种召唤
have been waiting their whole lives for a call like this.

1515
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:04,150
你还好吗
Are you okay?

1516
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:06,280
什么  对  我没事
What? Yeah, no... I'm fine.

1517
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:07,850
来
Here.

1518
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,850
拿着这个
Take this.

1519
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:12,680
撒手锏不适合我的风格
"Last resort" really isn't my style.

1520
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:14,600
戴夫  这不是漫画
Dave, this isn't a comic book.

1521
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,490
今晚会有真人死亡
Real people are going to die tonight.

1522
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,130
我爸爸对一切做了准备
My daddy was prepared for anything.

1523
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,100
那你呢
Are you?

1524
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:28,800
是的
Yeah.

1525
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:31,980
我准备好了
I am.

1526
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:42,790
他们早该回来了
They should be back by now!

1527
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:43,850
它一定是死了
It's definitely dead.

1528
01:23:43,950 --> 01:23:47,190
网上说应该用新鲜淡水养它们
Says on the Internet you're supposed to keep them in fresh water.

1529
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,990
它只是肚子饿  我们必须喂它
It is just hungry. We must feed it.

1530
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:53,970
为什么看着我
Why are you looking at me?

1531
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:55,800
我们必须开始行动
We gotta get this shit started.

1532
01:23:56,290 --> 01:24:00,370
我为你们这些贱人准备了好戏
Oh, yeah. Have I got a show for you bitches!

1533
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:09,040
臭屁王  臭屁王...
Motherfucker, Motherfucker...

1534
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:11,820
好  派对来宾们
All right, party people!

1535
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:14,820
我们要一起杀了海扁王
We are gonna kill Kick-Ass,

1536
01:24:14,910 --> 01:24:18,660
我们第一个超级英雄
the very first superhero, together.

1537
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:21,360
我们要把他切成小块
We are gonna cut him up into little pieces,

1538
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,760
喂鲨鱼
feed that shit to MC Shark

1539
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:27,100
然后传到油管上去  现场直播
and post it all over YouTube. For real!

1540
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:30,100
他在开玩笑
He's kidding, right?

1541
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:31,430
臭屁王不开玩笑
Motherfucker don't kid.

1542
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:35,170
不止这样  我还要给你们每个人
That's not it. I'm gonna give each and every one of you

1543
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:37,840
派对风味的肥料炸弹
party favor fertilizer bombs!

1544
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:39,510
我们要大闹一场
And we are gonna get our riot on!

1545
01:24:39,570 --> 01:24:41,520
这样才叫邪恶
That's what it means to be evil.

1546
01:24:41,670 --> 01:24:44,850
我们  我的朋友们  是真正的百分之一
We, my friends, are the real 1%,

1547
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:47,630
今晚我要恶搞这个城市
and tonight we are gonna fuck this city up

1548
01:24:47,630 --> 01:24:48,850
否则我不叫...
or my name is not...

1549
01:24:48,910 --> 01:24:50,950
克里斯・达米克
Chris D'Amico!

1550
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:54,350
我不叫那个名字
That is not my name!

1551
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,140
不  你说的对
No, you're right.

1552
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:00,430
你的新名字叫小贱货
Your new name's Little Bitch.

1553
01:25:04,530 --> 01:25:06,270
这真完美
Oh, this is perfect.

1554
01:25:07,230 --> 01:25:09,870
你真的这么笨吗
Are you really that stupid?

1555
01:25:10,530 --> 01:25:11,810
你们两个人
There's two of you

1556
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:15,240
我们有一只大军
and a whole army of us.

1557
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:18,980
你真的想到死亡就会硬梆梆
Do you really have such a hard-on to die?

1558
01:25:20,410 --> 01:25:21,720
不
No.

1559
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:24,290
所以我们找来了朋友
That's why we brought our friends.

1560
01:25:55,410 --> 01:25:56,990
怎么回事  克里斯
What's the matter, Chris?

1561
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:58,260
你拉在裤子里了
Shit hit your shorts?

1562
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:02,860
是的  我要用你的脸来擦屁股
Yeah, and I'm gonna wipe my ass with your face.

1563
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:07,770
你要为杀我爸付出代价
You're gonna pay for what you did to my dad.

1564
01:26:08,090 --> 01:26:09,090
你父亲
Your dad?

1565
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:12,100
你用火箭炮炸死我爸
You blew up my dad with a bazooka.

1566
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:48,040
你准备受死了吗  小女孩
Are you ready to die, little girl?

1567
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:50,510
也许  假如我必须一直看着
I might be if I have to keep looking at

1568
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:52,340
你称为脸的那团大便
that shit-stain you call a face.

1569
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:03,150
克里斯
Chris!

1570
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:03,050
抓住他  我要看他的胆子有多大
Hold him down. I wanna see what his guts look like.

1571
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,880
你们这些小子够了
That's enough from you boys!

1572
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,890
做得好  亲爱的.
Nicely done, sweetheart.

1573
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:24,630
只有这点能耐
That all you got?

1574
01:28:24,730 --> 01:28:27,500
不  我有致命的零重力装置
No, I got my lethal zero G device.

1575
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:28,630
鬼扯
Bullshit.

1576
01:28:30,270 --> 01:28:31,510
才怪
No shit.

1577
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:48,660
你还好吗
Are you okay?

1578
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:53,600
好  谢了  扁海王
Yeah. Thanks. Ass Kicker.

1579
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:57,360
很好
Nice.

1580
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:06,830
天啊  你真没用
Jesus, you are such a pussy.

1581
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,460
戴面具有什么用
What is the point of wearing a mask

1582
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:09,670
如果你不能为所欲为的话
if you can't do what you want?

1583
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:18,250
我想做好事
We want to do good.

1584
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:20,290
不  人们想赢得乐透彩
No, people want to win the lottery.

1585
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:24,580
人们想跟斯嘉丽・约翰逊上床
People want to fuck Scarlett Johansson.

1586
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:38,770
你以为能用一根小针杀我
You think you can kill me with little needle?

1587
01:30:57,450 --> 01:30:59,450
用途不是杀你
That's not what it's for.

1588
01:31:03,450 --> 01:31:05,060
这叫做肾上腺素  婊子
It's called adrenaline, bitch.

1589
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:08,660
那是什么  来阴的
What was that, some cheap shot?

1590
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,400
那是为了上校
That was for the Colonel.

1591
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:18,300
那是为了暗夜骚货
That's for Night Bitch.

1592
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,580
为了我爸爸
And that's for my dad.

1593
01:31:58,420 --> 01:32:02,420
我以为你这个烂货能应付

1594
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:05,860
你在干什么
What the hell are you doing?

1595
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:07,780
救你这个瘪三
Saving your whiny ass!

1596
01:32:07,850 --> 01:32:08,850
不
No!

1597
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:12,460
我不让你称心如意  我宁愿死
I won't let you have this. I'd rather die!

1598
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:14,260
你什么毛病  老兄
What is wrong with you, dude?

1599
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:16,630
这不是漫画  是真实人生
This is not a comic book, it's real life!

1600
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:19,020
死了一了百了
When you're dead, it's done.

1601
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:20,310
不会有续集
There's no sequel.

1602
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:21,630
你使这一切化为真实
You made this real.

1603
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:22,730
你开的头
You started it!

1604
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:25,170
我来结束
And I'm gonna finish it.

1605
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:28,880
我会变得不朽  像邪恶耶稣
I'll be immortal' like an evil Jesus.

1606
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:40,350
等等
Wait!

1607
01:32:52,930 --> 01:32:55,240
我还活着
I'm alive.

1608
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:56,670
戴夫  我真遗憾
Dave, I'm so sorry.

1609
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:08,220
这种感觉很难形容
The feeling was indescribable.

1610
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:10,890
克里斯・达米克死了
Chris D'Amico, dead.

1611
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:15,360
那帮超级反派被打败了
His wannabe supervillains, defeated.

1612
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:19,730
但我们使世界变得美好
But did we make the world a better place?

1613
01:33:20,690 --> 01:33:22,760
或者我们只是结束了一件
Or did we just finish something that began

1614
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,370
从我带面具时开始的事
when I first put on this mask?

1615
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,200
警察来了
The cops are coming.

1616
01:33:30,870 --> 01:33:32,370
他们会处理坏人
They'll take care of the bad guys.

1617
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:35,380
我们最好在他们到达前闪人
We better skedaddle before they get here.

1618
01:33:35,970 --> 01:33:36,970
我们成功了
We did it.

1619
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:38,070
没错
Fuck, yeah.

1620
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:39,880
别粗口
Hey, language.

1621
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:40,970
你说的对
You're right,

1622
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:42,830
假如我们要打扮得像英雄
if we're gonna dress like heroes,

1623
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:44,880
我们要表现的像英雄
we should act like heroes.

1624
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:48,060
他为你感到光荣  戴夫
He'd be proud of you, Dave.

1625
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:50,930
他会为我们全体感到光荣
He'd be proud of all of us.

1626
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:55,270
你们知道我们不该再这么做对吧
You know we can never do this again, right?

1627
01:33:57,290 --> 01:33:58,640
结束了
It's over.

1628
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,400
最后一次  来吧
One last time. Come on.

1629
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:11,650
你怎么说  超杀女  要来吗
What do you say, Hit Girl? Are you in?

1630
01:34:13,410 --> 01:34:15,250
为什么不
Why the hell not?

1631
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:19,080
正义永存
Justice Forever!

1632
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:33,600
谢谢你送我
Thanks for the ride.

1633
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:36,130
我们学校见
I'll see you at school.

1634
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:40,110
我要离开纽约  戴夫
I'm leaving New York, Dave.

1635
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:41,830
我不能回家
I can't go home.

1636
01:34:41,830 --> 01:34:44,210
不能害马库斯左右为难
I can't put Marcus in that position.

1637
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:46,000
为什么  他不会逮捕你
Why? He won't arrest you.

1638
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,440
你刚救了这个城市
You just saved the city.

1639
01:34:47,610 --> 01:34:50,610
是啊  我也用警枪杀了6个人
Yeah, well, I also killed six guys with a cop's gun.

1640
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:53,130
义勇军不能得到法外开恩
Vigilantes don't get a free pass.

1641
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:57,390
你不能走  人们需要你
You can't go. People need you.

1642
01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:00,360
-他们现在有你了  -明蒂...
-They've got you now. -Mindy...

1643
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:04,530
我不像你
I'm not like you.

1644
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:08,130
你不必身怀绝技才能当超级英雄
You don't have to be a bad-ass to be a superhero, Dave.

1645
01:35:10,170 --> 01:35:12,310
你只要勇敢
You just have to be brave.

1646
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:25,350
这是干嘛
What was that?

1647
01:35:28,550 --> 01:35:30,500
那是我的初吻
That was my first kiss.

1648
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:35,830
要乖一点  否则我从你嘴巴扯烂到你屁股
Be nice or I'll rip your ass out through your mouth.

当明蒂离开时

1650
01:35:44,770 --> 01:35:48,110
我终于了解我人生的发展方向

这种事最终总得发生
Just like it had to eventually happen,

1652
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:54,910
现实中的人想当超级英雄
that real people would try to be superheroes.

1653
01:35:55,550 --> 01:35:58,250
事情最终也要结束

超级英雄不能存在现实世界的原因有一个
Superheroes can't exist in the real world for a reason.

1655
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:22,740
因为现实世界需要现实的英雄
It's because the real world needs real heroes.

1656
01:36:23,470 --> 01:36:26,750
不是穿着异装的痞子玩换装游戏
And not some punk in a wet-suit playing dress-up,

1657
01:36:27,310 --> 01:36:31,760
而是能修理坏人的狠角色
but a genuine bad-ass who can really kick ass.

1658
01:42:18,330 --> 01:42:19,670
喂
Hello?

1659

别走
Don't go.

1661
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:28,480
有人吗
Is anybody there?

1662
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:32,980
喂
Hello?

1663
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:39,590
帮帮我好吗
Some help, please?

1664
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:41,710
鲨鱼吃掉了我的JJ
A shark bit my fucking dick off

1665
01:42:41,710 --> 01:42:43,360
我就不能喝点水吗
