到了
Here we are.

24
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,920
踩他上去
Get on his back.

快点
Hurry up.

26
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,720
他在那里  去抓他
There he is. Go get him.

27
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,590
我会让你付出代价的
Oh, you'll pay for that.

28
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,350
不要  不要  求你
No. No, please.

29
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,690
求你了  不要
Please, no.

30
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,590
站住
Hold it there.

31
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,120
我只抓到一只...
I only got one...

32
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,730
但他是个好样本
but he's a fine specimen.

33
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,410
-就这点  -对
- That's all? - Yeah.

34
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,450
那蘑菇咬了我两次
That shroom bit me twice.

35
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,710
彼岸花
Tomb Bloom.

36
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,960
很久很久以前
Once upon a time...

37
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,170
很久很久以前又一次
or perhaps twice upon a time,

38
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,240
你们可能还记得这个故事
for you may remember this story...

39
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,620
有一位叫玛琳菲森的强大仙子
there was a powerful Fey named Maleficent.

{\pos(192,225.6)}沉睡魔咒2：恶魔夫人

41
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,100
出于某些原因  这位恶魔夫人
For some reason, the mistress of evil

42
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,940
摩尔王国的守护者
and protector of the Moors...

43
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,680
过了这么久  依旧被人憎恶
was still hated after all this time.

44
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,860
的确  她对奥萝拉公主施过咒
True, she had cursed the princess, Aurora...

45
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,860
但那时的她还没有发现
but that was before she found light

46
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,780
人类孩童心中的善良之光
in the heart of a human child...

47
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,350
也还没有将她视如己出抚养长大
and raised the girl as her own.

48
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,460
毕竟  正是玛琳菲森的爱
After all, it was Maleficent's love

49
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,710
解开了那个诅咒
which broke that very same curse.

50
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,530
但这个细节却不知怎地被人遗忘了
But that detail was somehow mysteriously forgotten.

51
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,130
而王国里始终流传着的
For as the tale was told

52
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,370
被人一遍又一遍重复的故事
over and again throughout the kingdom...

53
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:35,040
是玛琳菲森又一次做了恶人
Maleficent became the villain once more.

54
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,320
时候到了  来吧  把大家都叫来
It's time, guys. Come on. Let's get everyone.

55
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,110
今天可是大日子
It's the big day!

56
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,570
-来吧  -走吧
- Come on. - Let's go!

57
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,430
醒醒  醒醒
Wake up. Wake up.

58
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,600
快来呀
Come on.

59
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,700
快点  泥沼精  时候到了
Hurry up, wallerbogs! It's time!

60
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,900
你们俩还记得秘密计划吗
Do you both remember the secret plan?

61
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,320
全在脑袋里呢
I've got it all right here.

62
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,190
我什么时候把秘密告诉给女王
When do I tell the queen the secret?

63
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,700
你必须得耐心点  绿蕨仙子
You must be patient, Thistlewit.

64
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,740
你们觉得奥萝拉女王醒了吗
Do you think Queen Aurora's awake yet?

65
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,730
反正她已经不是"睡美人"了
Well, she's not "Sleeping Beauty" anymore.

66
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,520
我听懂你这个双关了
I see what you did there.

67
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,700
接下来要讨论的是  仙子失踪
Next item of business, the missing fairies.

68
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,850
我已经派出更多精灵去搜寻彼岸花园了
I've sent more sprites to search the Tomb Bloom field.

69
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,750
傍晚时分他们会来汇报进展
They'll report back to me at nightfall.

70
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,710
在找到他们之前我们会继续搜寻
We will keep searching until we find them.

71
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,630
请别对我举树枝表达不满  叶夫
Please don't raise your roots at me, Lief.

72
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,760
用你的躯干碾压人类没有用
Crushing humans with branches is not going to help.

73
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,180
迪瓦尔  你应该站在我这边的
Diaval, you're supposed to be on my side.

74
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,940
我是摩尔王国的女王  我就是人类
Well, I'm Queen of the Moors, and I am a human.

75
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,440
我们须得学会心存一点善意
We must all learn a little kindness.

76
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,530
别挡道
Coming through.

77
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,740
借过
Excuse us.

78
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,300
官方精灵事务
Official pixie business.

79
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,470
借一步说话  陛下
A word, Your Majesty.

80
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,180
-或者借两步  -姑母们
- Maybe two. - Aunties...

81
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,050
你们得跟其他人一样等轮到自己再说
you need to wait your turn like everyone else.

82
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,390
不行  这件事不能等  女王陛下
No! This can't wait, Your Grace.

83
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,350
片刻不容
Not for a moment.

84
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,250
不然我就要炸了  我真的会炸
Or I might burst. Truly, I might.

85
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,210
那不是...
Is that...?

86
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,110
宾托
Pinto!

87
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,070
她带了礼物来
She's come bearing gifts.

88
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,240
暖树上的第一滴树汁
The first sap from the warming trees.

89
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,640
为了大日子准备的
It's for the big day!

90
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,740
闭嘴  绿蕨仙子
Quiet, Thistlewit.

91
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,970
什么大日子
What big day?

92
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,190
我的王冠
My crown!

93
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,490
我没心情陪你们逗趣
I'm not in the mood for this.

94
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,200
宾托
Pinto!

95
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:23,880
行了
Come on.

96
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,250
你们要去哪里  姑母们
Where are you going, aunties?

97
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,340
我没时间跟你玩  宾托
I don't have time for games, Pinto.

98
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,440
你们到底怎么回事
What's gotten into all of you?

99
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,330
她去那边了  陛下
There she goes, Your Majesty.

100
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,580
快回来
Come back here.

101
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,050
宾托  今天玩够了吧
Pinto. I've had enough of your games for today.

102
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,050
看我成什么样了
Look at me.

103
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,150
菲利普  你来做什么
Philip. What are you doing here?

104
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,460
我在找你
I was looking for you.

105
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,860
-你好吗  -你好
- Oh, well, hello. - Hello.

106
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,340
真的很抱歉  我现在没空跟你聊天
I'm really sorry, I can't talk right now.

107
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,130
摩尔王国一片混乱
The Moors have turned to madness.

108
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,590
我有一大堆投诉要处理
I've got a castle full of complaints.

109
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,820
我知道你有多忙
I know how busy you are.

110
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,130
我本想问你件事
I wanted to ask you something.

111
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:39,910
问吧
Yes.

112
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,330
你觉得奥斯戴王国和摩尔王国有可能结盟吗
Do you think there could be a union between Ulstead and the Moors?

113
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,620
结盟
A union?

114
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,750
将两地连接起来
To connect both lands.

115
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,000
带来和谐与和平
To bring harmony and peace.

116
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,090
我想可以架起一座桥
I've been imagining a bridge.

117
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,090
一座桥
Oh, a bridge.

118
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,970
没错  一座桥
Yes, a bridge.

119
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,760
结盟是个好主意...
A union's a wonderful idea...

120
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,430
如果双方同意的话
if both sides are willing.

121
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,180
这个嘛  我正在努力
Well, I'm working on that part.

122
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,950
他要搞砸了
He's going to blow it.

123
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,650
给他点时间  他还在热身
Give him time. He's warming up.

124
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,980
等等
Wait.

125
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,490
你今天穿得好正式
That's your formal coat.

126
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,870
你们都有份参与  对吧
You're in on all of this, aren't you?

127
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,130
如果你忙的话  我可以之后再来
If you're busy, I could always come back.

128
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,790
不不  不用
No. No, no.

129
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,390
我完全不忙
I'm not busy at all.

130
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,510
可是我不想...
No, because I'd hate to...

131
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,250
真的  我有空
Really. All ears.

132
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,750
你想说什么
What did you want to talk about?

133
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,630
你说得对  他要搞砸了
You're right. He's blowing it.

134
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,800
五年前  我以为自己永远失去你了
Five years ago, I thought I lost you forever.

135
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,640
我决定改变这一天的意义
I've decided to reclaim this day for us.

136
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,410
我对你一见钟情
I've loved you since the moment I met you

137
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,810
日渐情深
and every day since.

138
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,230
如果世间有真爱  那我找到了
If love has a truth, here is mine.

139
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,740
没有任何魔法或诅咒
There is no magic nor curse

140
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,900
能把我从你身边分开  奥萝拉
that could ever tear me away from you, Aurora.

141
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,250
你确定现在方便吗
Are you sure this is a good time?

142
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,280
菲利普
Oh, Philip.

143
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,970
他跪下了
He's on his knee.

144
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,080
他可真够磨蹭的
He took his sweet time about it.

145
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,250
你愿意嫁给我吗
Will you marry me?

146
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,580
我愿意
Yes.

147
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,540
-愿意  -愿意
- Yes? - Yes.

148
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,550
我愿意  快起来吻我
Yes! Yes, just stand up. Kiss me.

149
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,600
我们要办婚礼了
We're having a wedding!

150
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,770
秘密惊喜婚礼
A secret surprise wedding.

151
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,980
当然了  我们要告诉双方家长
Of course, we have to tell our parents.

152
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,780
一定要吗
Do we?

153
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,480
夫人
Mistress.

154
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,650
什么事
What?

155
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,650
我有个消息
I have a little bit of news.

156
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,480
那就说吧
Well, on with it.

157
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,210
不是什么大事
It's nothing of any real consequence...

158
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:23,620
绝对不必反应过激
and it's certainly no reason to overreact.

159
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,740
只不过是
It's just that...

160
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,180
菲利普王子...
Prince Philip has, um...

161
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,290
失踪了
Disappeared?

162
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,680
不是  菲利普...
No. No. Philip has...

163
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,710
染上黄热病了  不  等等
Yellow fever? No, wait!

164
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,850
得麻风病了
Leprosy!

165
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,090
不是  夫人
No, Mistress.

166
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,190
菲利普王子向奥萝拉求...
Prince Philip has asked Aurora if she'll become his...

167
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,300
不要
Don't...

168
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,680
毁了我的早晨
ruin my morning.

169
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,810
夫人  拜托
Mistress, please.

170
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,900
冷静点
Stay calm!

171
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,970
告诉我  殿下
So, tell me, sire...

172
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,220
我要当伴郎吗
am I to be a best man,

173
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,140
还是说您从摩尔找了个怪物伴郎
or did you choose a creature from the Moors?

174
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,180
将军  如果你想打听
General, if that's your way of asking me

175
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,890
她有没有答应
if she said yes, then I, uh...

176
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,920
我知道她答应了  殿下
I know she said yes, sire.

177
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,210
哪个人类不想离开那个鬼地方
What human wouldn't want to leave that place?

178
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,560
你对摩尔居民有什么不满吗  珀西瓦尔
What do you have against Moor folk, Percival?

179
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,840
"摩尔居民"  要这么称呼他们吗
"Moor folk"? Is that what we're calling them now?

180
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,110
长翅膀的野兽  凶残的树木
Winged beasts, murderous trees.

181
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,680
注意言辞  将军
Guard your tongue, General.

182
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,320
你对他们一无所知
You know nothing about them.

183
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,410
我知道玛琳菲森杀人如麻
I know that Maleficent is a killer of men...

184
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,390
毁灭军队  故事大家都知道
destroyer of armies. Or so the story goes.

185
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,480
她不是那样的
She's not like that.

186
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,900
保护这个王国是我的职责
It's my job to protect this kingdom.

187
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,190
老朋友  我会尽职尽责
And I will do so, old friend...

188
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,280
毫不犹豫
without hesitation.

189
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,450
走吧
Walk on.

190
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,010
开门
Open the gates!

191
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,450
开门
Open the gates!

192
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,150
陛下  吞并中部的
Your Majesty, spoils from the annexation

193
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,720
战利品送达了
of the Midlands have arrived.

194
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,550
是武器
Weapons.

195
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,140
不  我们不需要武器
No. We have no need of arms.

196
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,850
我们征战的日子结束了
Our days of war are over.

197
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,770
英格瑞斯
Ingrith...

198
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,770
看到我给你留的位置了吧
you see where I've had you placed.

199
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,230
就在我身后
Right behind me.

200
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,490
我永远都会在你身后
And that's where I'll always be.

201
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,990
英格瑞斯  我说了不需要武器
Ingrith, I said we had no need of arms.

202
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,910
有备无患
One can never be too careful.

203
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,880
陛下  弩上弦了
Your Majesty, it's cocked.

204
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,500
是吗
Is it, now?

205
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,930
-父亲  母亲  -怎么样
- Father, Mother. - Well?

206
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,550
她怎么说
What did she say?

207
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,180
她答应了
She said yes.

208
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,220
太好了
Yes!

209
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,810
真是天大的好消息
That is wonderful news.

210
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,230
两个王国终于团结一致了
Two kingdoms united at last. Yes.

211
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,530
太好了
Yes.

212
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,340
也许我太自私了
Perhaps I've been selfish...

213
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,320
对此事的看法有错
looking at this the wrong way.

214
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,950
你已经做出了选择
You've made your choice.

215
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,040
现在该庆祝了
Now is a time to celebrate.

216
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,290
很高兴你终于认可了
I'm glad you finally approve.

217
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,600
不仅如此
Much more than that.

218
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,720
我准备热情欢迎你的未婚妻
I am ready to welcome your fiancee with open arms.

219
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,440
她要来参加晚宴
She shall come to dinner.

220
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,610
那太好了
That would be incredible.

221
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,140
但有一个条件
Under one condition.

222
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,220
她要带上她的教母
She will bring her godmother.

223
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,620
陛下  我强烈...
Your Majesty, I strongly...

224
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,740
我们要在这座城堡里
We will meet the one who raised her

225
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,520
见一见养育她的教母
right here in this castle.

226
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,080
没错  王后说得对
Yes. The queen is right.

227
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,500
我不确定她的教母会不会...
I'm not sure her godmother will...

228
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,170
我坚持如此
No, but I insist.

229
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,860
毕竟  我们马上就要成为一家人了
After all, we will soon be family.

230
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,550
通知全国上下
Well, let it be known throughout the kingdom...

231
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:56,790
我儿子要娶奥萝拉了
that my son is to marry Aurora.

232
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,290
并且玛琳菲森要来参加晚宴
And Maleficent is coming to dinner.

233
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,090
我马上传话下去
I shall send word straightaway.

234
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,360
来了
Incoming.

235
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,490
抓住裙子别放
Hold on to your petticoats!

236
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,340
看啊
Well, well.

237
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,550
怎么样
So?

238
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,550
怎么样
So.

239
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,810
教母
Godmother...

240
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,600
菲利普向我求婚了
Philip asked me to marry him.

241
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,060
真可怜
Poor thing.

242
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,520
他会缓过来的
He'll recover.

243
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,280
我答应他了
My answer was yes.

244
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,070
-不行  -行
- No. - Yes.

245
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,120
不行
No.

246
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,680
我没有征求你的意见
I wasn't really asking.

247
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,950
我也没有
Nor was I.

248
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,580
你要怎么做
What's next?

249
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,830
把他变成山羊吗
You'll turn him into a goat?

250
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:27,880
别闹了
Stop.

251
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,630
你为什么不喜欢菲利普
Why don't you like Philip?

252
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,300
首先  他是人类
Well, for one thing, he's human.

253
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,820
我也是人类
I'm a human.

254
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,180
我从没因为这点而针对过你
And I have never held that against you.

255
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,930
直到我坠入爱河
Until I fell in love.

256
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,350
爱情未必会结局圆满  小怪物
Love doesn't always end well, Beasty.

257
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,210
你要知道菲利普可是一位王子
I'll have you know Prince Philip is a prince.

258
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,610
一位非常英俊有魅力的王子
A very handsome and charming prince.

259
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,320
求求你相信我
I'm just asking you to trust me.

260
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,450
给他一个机会
Please give him a chance.

261
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,580
让我们证明你是错的
Let us prove you wrong.

262
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,290
菲利普很善良
Philip is thoughtful...

263
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,310
很体贴
he's very kind...

264
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,620
体什么
Kind of what?

265
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,640
国王和王后邀请我们母女
The king and queen are celebrating tonight...

266
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,260
今晚去城堡参加庆祝晚宴
and they have invited both of us to the castle.

267
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,470
你想让我见他父母
You want me to meet his parents?

268
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,970
只是顿晚餐而已
It's just a dinner.

269
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,180
奥斯戴王国不欢迎我
They don't want me in Ulstead.

270
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,230
为什么我还要去
Why on earth would I go?

271
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,730
因为他母亲想见一见我母亲
Because his mother wishes to meet mine.

272
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,110
求你了
Please.

273
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,280
菲利普
Philip.

274
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,620
我想让你今晚佩戴这个
I want you to wear this tonight.

275
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,870
你的宝剑
Your sword?

276
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,060
因为你的缘故
Because of you,

277
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,460
奥斯戴王国和摩尔王国终于可以团结一致
Ulstead and the Moors will be united at last.

278
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:56,470
父亲  我对奥萝拉的爱不夹杂任何政治因素
Father, my love for Aurora has nothing to do with politics.

279
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,340
没错  但你们的爱情
Yes, but your love...

280
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,810
可以确保世世代代和平共处
will ensure peace for generations.

281
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,180
拿着它  佩戴上
Now take it. And wear it...

282
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,770
提醒自己我们再也无需兵戎相见
to know that you will never have to use it.

283
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,060
我的孩子
Oh, my son.

284
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,820
我从未感到如此自豪
I've never been more proud.

285
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,240
母亲那边怎么样
And what about Mother?

286
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,990
她能接受吗
Is she okay with this?

287
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,870
你母亲会学着爱上你爱的人
Your mother will learn to love who you love.

288
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,350
彼岸花  彼岸花
Tomb Bloom. Tomb Bloom.

289
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,320
我要失去耐心了
I'm losing my patience.

290
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,030
陛下
Your Majesty.

291
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,890
你得加快进度  马屁精
You need to move faster, Lickspittle.

292
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,410
遵命  陛下
Yes, Your Majesty.

293
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,290
奥萝拉答应了求婚
Aurora said yes.

294
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,880
一切即将完美
It's all coming together...

295
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,510
上演
perfectly.

296
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,350
你好
Hello.

297
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,940
你好
Hello.

298
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,940
你好
Hello.

299
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,870
试试别露太多尖牙
Try it with a little less fang.

300
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:29,950
这样如何
How's this?

301
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,210
练练问好
Try the greeting.

302
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:38,460
非常感谢你今晚的邀请
How kind of you to invite me this evening.

303
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,670
记住  这不是威胁
Remember, it's not a threat.

304
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,340
非常感谢你今晚的邀请
So very kind of you to invite me this evening.

305
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,800
这样好多了
Yeah. Better.

306
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,600
加上屈膝礼试试
Try it with a curtsy.

307
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,230
不加也挺好的
We can skip that part.

308
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,110
她真的很爱那个小伙子
She really loves that boy, you know.

309
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,820
你这样做是对她的体贴
You're doing her a great kindness.

310
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,220
体贴
Kindness?

311
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:10,970
夫人
Mistress...

312
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,970
她很漂亮吧
Doesn't she look lovely?

313
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,430
我有东西要给你
I have something for you.

314
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,340
遮住你的角
For your horns.

315
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,580
我觉得这样应该会
I just thought it might make

316
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,670
让菲利普的家人更自在些
Philip's family feel more comfortable.

317
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,650
你也更自在些
And you, as well.

318
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,980
也许是个馊主意
Maybe it's a bad idea.

319
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,420
不
No, it's...

320
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,900
没关系
It's all right.

321
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,350
我太兴奋了
I'm so excited.

322
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,880
我都快受不了了
It's more than I can bear.

323
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,710
是玛琳菲森
It's Maleficent!

324
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,820
干草叉
Pitchforks?

325
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,660
人类真可笑
Humans are hilarious.

326
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,560
有进步
It's getting better.

327
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,420
擅离岗位者死
Anyone leaves their post gets hung.

328
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,170
遵命  长官
Yes, sir.

329
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,270
他们到了
They're here.

330
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,420
你考虑过把我变成熊吗
Have you ever considered turning me into a bear?

331
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,530
我觉得我当熊肯定很厉害
I think I'd make quite an impressive one.

332
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,530
看看这利爪  太强壮了
Look at their claws. They're so strong.

333
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,260
你说熊干什么
Why are we talking about bears?

334
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,450
有请摩尔王国的奥萝拉女王
Presenting Queen Aurora of the Moors.

335
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,220

341
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,240
我明白你是怎么偷走菲利普的心了
I can see how you stole Philip's heart.

342
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,450
陛下
Your Majesty.

343
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,530
你头发上的花朵

我过敏
I'm allergic.

345
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,680
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

346
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,160
不不不  没关系
Oh, no. No, no. It's all right.

347
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,970
花朵很美
They're beautiful.

348
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,000
有请玛琳菲森

349
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,050
玛琳菲森  很高兴再次见到你
Maleficent, it's wonderful to see you again.

350
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,500
这是我父亲  奥斯戴王国的约翰国王
This is my father, King John of Ulstead.

351
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,750
还有我母亲  英格瑞斯王后

352
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,910
欢迎来我们家

354
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,450
别笑
Don't smile.

355
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:21,220
我想为你们引见迪亚瓦
And I would like to introduce you to Diaval.

356
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,090
找到这座城堡应该不太麻烦吧
I trust you had no trouble finding the castle.

357
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,260
为什么会有麻烦
Why would I have trouble?

358
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,760
他在和你闲聊
He's making small talk.

359
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,750
我晚点给你解释
I'll explain it later.

360
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,580
完全没有麻烦
No trouble at all.

361
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,590
国王和王后陛下  女士们先生们

362
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,940
晚宴准备好了

363
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:44,480
请不要拘束
Please, make yourselves at home.

364
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,550
鸟
Bird.

365
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,120
美味

366
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,470
有什么问题吗
Is there a problem?

367
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,030
餐具是铁的
It's iron.

368
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,680
陛下  就像你对花敏感
Majesty, as you are sensitive to flowers,

369
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,250
她厌恶铁
she is averse to iron.

370
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,470
我不知道
I had no idea.

371
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,710
立刻拿下去
Take it away at once.

372
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,860
你应该觉得用手更自在吧
I trust you'll be comfortable using your hands?

373
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,850
最近天气真暖和  不是吗
Such a warm spell of weather, isn't it?

374
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,460
确实是
It certainly is.

375
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,990
我们为菲利普和奥萝拉准备了一份小礼物
Well, we have a small gift for Philip and Aurora...

376
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:08,570
庆贺他们在一起的美好未来
to celebrate their glorious future together.

377
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,500
我等不及再次有小孩子在城堡里跑来跑去
I simply can't wait to have a little one running through the castle again.

378
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:26,770
这座城堡吗
This castle?

379
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,640
是的  当然
Yes, of course.

380
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,980
这里会是他们的家
This will be their home.

381
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,060
我听说奥萝拉有自己的城堡
I hear Aurora has a castle of her own.

382
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,180
是的  陛下
Yes, sir, I do.

383
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,310
好吧  我...
Yes... I'm...

384
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,440
我很好奇
I'm curious.

385
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,610
奥萝拉是怎么成为摩尔王国女王的
How did Aurora become Queen of the Moors?

386
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,520
我让她当的
I made her queen.

387
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,600
她的城堡相当漂亮  你一定得去看看
Her castle is quite stunning. You must see it.

388
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,980
好吧  但事实上  她有另一座城堡
Yes, but in fact, she has another castle.

389
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,140
不是吗
Does she not?

390
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,440
母亲
Mother...

391
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,350
一个在摩尔王国
One in the Moors,

392
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,410
一个她父王留下的
and one left behind by her father.

393
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,110
斯特凡国王的城堡  不是吗
King Stefan, was it not?

394
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,770
那座城堡从不是我家  已经送给人民了
That castle was never my home. It was given to the people.

395
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,460
所以说你也是真正的公主
So, you're also a true princess.

396
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,640
虽然斯特凡死了  被杀了
Even though Stefan died. Was killed?

397
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,230
提醒我一下  他是死了还是被杀了
Remind me, did he die or was he killed?

398
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,590
被杀而死
Both.

399
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,720
你说得没错  最近是很暖和
Yes, you're right, it is very warm recently.

400
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,260
因为我记得一个婴儿的故事
Because I remember the story of a baby.

401
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,180
婴儿被施咒沉睡
A baby cursed to sleep...

402
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,360
再也没有醒来
and never wake up.

403
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,130
真的吗
Really?

404
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,130
谁会对无辜的孩子做这么可怕的事
Who would do such a terrible thing to an innocent child?

405
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:46,570
有很多会对无辜者下手的人
Well, there are many who prey on the innocent.

406
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,380
你们一族肯定会认同
I'm sure your kind would agree.

407
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,170
我们一族是什么意思
What do you mean, my kind?

408
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,590
她的意思是人类
She means humans.

409
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,870
摩尔王国有仙子失踪
There are fairies missing from the Moors.

410
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,300
我缺失的是酒
What I'm missing is some wine.

411
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,260
被人类偷猎者偷走
Stolen by human poachers.

412
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,520
这是我第一次听说
That's the first I've heard of it.

413
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,170
有人下了令
Someone gave the order.

414
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,610
听起来你在指控国王
It sounds as if you're accusing the king.

415
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,450
不  她没那么说
No, she never said that.

416
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,980
等等  不好意思  谁会偷仙子
Wait... Sorry, who would steal a fairy?

417
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,420
陛下  我必须上报
Your Majesty, I must report

418
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,460
两个平民被发现死在摩尔王国外
that two peasants were found dead... just outside the Moors.

419
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,750
他们失踪了好几天
They'd been missing for several days.

420
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,570
明白了
I see.

421
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,710
我们都明白了
Yes, we all see.

422
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,670
边境开放  但并不欢迎人类  不是吗
The borders are open, but humans are not welcome. Isn't that right?

423
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,930
你到底在暗示什么  陛下
What exactly are you implying, Your Majesty?

424
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,880
无辜人类在摩尔王国被残忍杀害
Innocent men are being slaughtered on the Moors...

425
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,740
她却在说仙子
and she's talking about fairies.

426
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,530
管好你的动物
Contain your animal.

427
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,260
否则我替你管
Or I will.

428
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,380
要不是我明事理
If I didn't know better,

429
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,040
我会以为你在威胁
I'd say you were making a threat.

430
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,180
你是吗
Well, do you?

431
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,070
-我是什么  -明事理
- Do I what? - Know better?

432
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,180
够了
Enough.

433
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,540
把它放下
Put her down.

434
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,780
拜托  把它放下
Please, put her down.

435
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,140
我们是来庆祝的
We're here to celebrate.

436
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,610
原谅我  他说得对
Forgive me, he's right.

437
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,610
不要忘了我们在此的原因
Let's not forget why we're here.

438
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,230
奥萝拉新人生的开始
The start of a new life for Aurora.

439
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,500
-干杯  -干杯
- Cheers. - Cheers.

440
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:31,650
玛琳菲森  你的付出令人钦佩
You have done an admirable job, Maleficent...

441
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,620
违背自己的天性抚养这个孩子
going against your own nature to raise this child.

442
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,980
但是现在
But now...

443
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:41,950
奥萝拉终于要得到...
Aurora will finally get...

444
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,430
真正家庭的爱了
the love of a real family.

445
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,360
一位真正的母亲
A real mother.

446
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,880
因为我唯一后悔的
Because the one thing I regret...

447
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,670
就是没有自己的女儿
is never having a daughter of my own.

448
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,410
但今晚改变了这点
But tonight changes that.

449
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:01,370
今晚  我把奥萝拉当亲生女儿
Tonight, I consider Aurora my own.

450
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,120
卫兵
Guards!

451
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,620
我们把女巫请进了家门
We have opened our home to a witch!

452
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,010
住手
Stop!

453
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,690
不会有结盟
There is no union.

454
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,050
也不会有婚礼
There will be no wedding.

455
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,770
-玛琳菲森  -我们必须保护国王
- Maleficent! - We must protect the king!

456
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,820
玛琳菲森  请你快停手
Maleficent, please, stop now.

457
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,220
约翰  我好害怕
John, I'm so frightened.

458
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,260
她对我做了什么
What has she done to me?

459
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,270
父亲
Father!

460
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,140
约翰
John!

461
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,260
我们回家
We go home.

462
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,910
约翰
John!

463
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,490
这是诅咒
It's a curse.

464
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:02,450
这是诅咒
It's a curse!

465
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,140
玛琳菲森对国王施咒了
Maleficent has cursed the king!

466
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,550
你做了什么
What have you done?

467
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,980
我什么都没做
I've done nothing.

468
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,980
奥萝拉  我们立刻回家
Aurora, we go home now.

469
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,730
奥萝拉
Aurora!

470
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,500
奥萝拉
Aurora!

471
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,050
解除诅咒
Wake him!

472
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,650
解除诅咒  求你了
Wake him, please.

473
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,850
都让开
Stand aside!

474
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,340
快抬到卧室
To the bedroom!

475
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,100
这种魔力  我们没有办法解除
This magic, we have no tools to reverse it.

476
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,560
一定有伤口
There must be a lesion.

477
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,350
她施法的证据
Proof of her witchery.

478
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,950
请为陛下保留些颜面吧
Please, leave His Majesty his dignity.

479
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,240
我们都看见玛琳菲森对他做了什么
We all saw what Maleficent did to him.

480
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,000
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

481
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:28,060
诅咒我们的国王就是诅咒这个王国
A curse upon our king is a curse upon this kingdom.

482
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,510
他只是想要和平
All he wanted was peace.

483
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,790
这都是我的错
This is all my fault.

484
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:37,230
你完全不需要道歉  亲爱的
You have nothing to apologize for, my dear.

485
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,240
玛琳菲森对所有人都是威胁
Maleficent is a threat to everyone.

486
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,350
对你尤其如此
Especially you.

487
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,750
我们会尽全力保护你的
We'll do our best to protect you.

488
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,810
一定有办法能解除诅咒
There must be a way to reverse this.

489
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,530
母亲  你吻他一下试试
Mother, could you try kissing him?

490
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,790
真爱之类的
True love and all that.

491
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,340
我猜是没用的
I doubt that would work.

492
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,770
也许能救他呢
It could save him.

493
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:08,550
-吻就只是吻  -拜托了  母亲
- A kiss is just a kiss. - Please, Mother.

494
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,810
好吧
Very well.

495
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,650
你渴望和平
You wanted peace...

496
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:26,300
那就永远和平地安息吧
now rest in peace forever.

497
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,860
我早说过了
I told you.

498
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,150
这可不是童话
This is no fairy tale.

499
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,830
我必须回摩尔一趟
I have to return to the Moors.

500
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,380
这是唯一的办法
It's the only way.

501
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,110
等一下  过来
Wait, wait. Come here.

502
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,380
我必须找到她
I have to find her.

503
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,600
现在已经半夜了
It's the middle of the night.

504
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,610
她会解开诅咒的  我知道她会的
She will break the curse. I know she will.

505
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:51,970
好  那让我跟你一起去吧
Okay, well, let me come with you.

506
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,300
不  你应该和你的家人在一起
No. You should stay with your family.

507
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,480
你就是我的家人
You are my family.

508
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,900
让她去吧  菲利普
Let her go, Philip.

509
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,550
也许她可以拯救国王
Maybe she can save him.

510
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,310
玛琳菲森
Maleficent!

511
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,050
玛琳菲森
Maleficent!

512
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,520
教母
Godmother!

513
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,350
求你回来
Please come back.

514
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,810
她不在摩尔境内
She's not in the Moors.

515
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,320
迪瓦尔
Diaval.

516
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,690
没有人看到过她
No one's seen her.

517
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,030
见到你我太高兴了
I'm so happy to see you.

518
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,070
哪里都找不到她
She's nowhere to be found.

519
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,330
如果她再也不回来怎么办
What if she never comes back?

520
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,800
那我就要永远保持人形了
I could be stuck as a human forever.

521
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,350
我必须找到她
I have to find her.

522
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,670
只有她能解开诅咒
She's the only one who can break the curse.

523
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,040
告诉我  她已经死了
Tell me she's dead.

524
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,890
铁珠击穿了她的身体
The iron pierced her flesh.

525
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,240
她掉进河里  坠下了瀑布
She fell into the river and went over the falls.

526
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,620
那她的头颅在哪里
Then where is her head?

527
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,030
出现了别的东西
There was something else.

528
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,370
另一个怪物
Another creature.

529
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,690
它把她从海底救了起来
It pulled her from the depths of the sea.

530
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,120
它长什么样
What did it look like?

531
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,770
和她一样
Her.

532
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,710
它抱着她飞上了天空
It carried her up into the sky.

533
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,890
受伤的野兽突然发狂
A wounded animal lashes out

534
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,340
而现在她有同伙了
and now she's not alone.

535
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,550
我们必须做好开战的准备
We must be ready for war.

536
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,360
玛琳菲森对国王施咒了
Maleficent has cursed the king!

537
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,970
待在室内
Stay inside!

538
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,110
玛琳菲森对国王施咒了
Maleficent has cursed the king!

539
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,120
要不是康诺尔找到她  她早没命了
If Conall hadn't found her, she would be dead.

540
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,700
他们想用这玩意儿杀死她
They tried to kill her with this.

541
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,220
你们听到了吗
Do you hear it?

542
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,890
你们听到了吗
Do you hear it?

543
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,230
这是人类发出的信号
It's a message from the humans.

544
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,310
我听得再清楚不过了
I hear it loud and clear.

545
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:03,550
我们生死存亡的时刻到了
Time for us to die.

546
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,630
几百年来  人类一直用铁来对付我们
Humans have used iron against us for centuries.

547
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,450
我们差点因此灭族
And we are almost extinct because of it.

548
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:12,910
屠杀摩尔的平民
Killing peasants on the Moors

549
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,430
只会引发更多的冲突  博拉
will only lead to more conflict, Borra.

550
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,670
人类从土地中挖出铁
They've pulled the iron from the earth...

551
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,360
做成剑和盾  把我们逼到了地底
made their swords and shields, drove us underground.

552
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:21,340
而这个
But this...

553
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,290
会让我们彻底灭亡
This will finish us.

554
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:28,170
我们在这里仍然安全
Our people are safe here for now.

555
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,460
但能维持多久呢
But for how long?

556
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,130
人类会找到我们  他们不会停手
The humans will find us. They will not stop.

557
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,930
我提议发动战争
I call for war.

558
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:37,790
我提议发动战争
I call for war!

559
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,500
刻不容缓
Right now!

560
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,240
人类的数量太多了
There are too many humans.

561
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,160
人类的王国太多了
Too many kingdoms.

562
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,300
康诺尔  人类会不停地寻找
Conall, they will keep finding

563
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,270
毁灭我们的新手段
new ways to destroy us.

564
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,360
我们赢不了
We can't win.

565
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,580
我们赢不了
We can't win!

566
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:02,000
靠战争赢不了
Not this way.

567
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:05,190
不  你错了  康诺尔
No. You're wrong, Conall.

568
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,940
我们有他们意想不到的绝招
We have something they didn't plan on.

569
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:13,090
我们有她
We have her.

570
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,510
她有我们任何人都不具备的力量
She holds powers none of us possess.

571
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,830
她受伤了  博拉
She is wounded, Borra.

572
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,030
你们是谁
Who are you?

573
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,700
你散发着人类的恶臭
You reek of human.

574
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,940
也许我看错了你
Maybe I was wrong about you.

575
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,230
也许康诺尔应该把你留在海底
Or maybe Conall should have left you for dead

576
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,690
任由你死去
at the bottom of the sea.

577
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:58,490
不对
No.

578
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,930
它确实存在  对吗
It's there, isn't it?

579
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,210
它就在你体内
It's inside you.

580
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,490
你们看到了吗
You see?

581
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:31,420
你们看到她体内的力量了吗
You see what's inside her?

582
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,480
那将能拯救我们所有人
That is what will save us all.

583
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,600
你救了我
You saved me.

584
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,350
跟我来
Come.

585
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,350
我带你看我们是谁
Let me show you who we are.

586
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,620
我们是黑暗仙子
We're Dark Fey.

587
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:07,000
和你一样
Same as you.

588
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,540
我们是仅存的黑暗仙子了
We're all that remain.

589
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:24,810
躲藏在此处  远离人类
Unseen here, far away from mankind.

590
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:25,970
快看
Look!

591
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:29,030
当越来越多的人类王国出现
As more human kingdoms emerged,

592
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:30,590
世界各个角落的我们
we went into hiding...

593
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:32,720
不得不躲藏起来
from every corner of the earth...

594
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,250
为了生存竭尽全力
doing what we had to, to survive.

595
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:38,960
但我们失去了很多同伴
But many were lost.

596
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,610
仅仅几代仙子之前
Only a few generations ago...

597
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,710
我们一族遍布世界各处
our kind roamed every part of the world.

598
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,220
冻土平原
The tundra.

599
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:10,940
森林
The forest.

600
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:12,360
丛林
The jungle.

601
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,550
沙漠
The desert.

602
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:25,690
如今  我们仅存的避难所
Now, our only refuge is here...

603
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,480
就是这个洞穴
in this cave.

604
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:29,940
我们祖先的巢穴
Our nest of origin.

605
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:37,530
听着  去风中玩耍吧
Listen. Play in the wind.

606
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:40,400
去吧
Go!

607
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,320
那些孩子本该在树林和河流上方遨游
Those children should be soaring over the trees and rivers.

608
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,770
然而他们只能在流亡中长大
Instead, they are raised in exile.

609
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,890
我能保护他们
I could protect them.

610
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,240
怎么保护  靠跟人类开战吗
How? By waging war against the humans?

611
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,310
我一生都在和人类斗争
I've been at war with them my whole life.

612
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:15,750
并非所有的人类
Not all of them.

613
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,440
有一个人类孩子你视如己出
There was one you raised as your own.

614
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,300
也许我们不需要躲避人类
Maybe we don't have to hide from the humans.

615
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,520
也许我们能生存下去  摆脱恐惧
Maybe we can exist without fear...

616
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,810
摆脱战争
and war.

617
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,320
找到共存的办法
Find a way together.

618
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:34,190
那永远不可能实现
That will never happen.

619
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,000
抓到你啦
Gotcha!

620
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,370
欢迎来到你的新家
Welcome to your new home.

621
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:36,960
我们都很担心你  亲爱的
We've been worried about you, dear.

622
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:39,790
陛下
Your Majesty.

623
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:41,900
我找不到她
I couldn't find her.

624
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,600
我真为你心碎
My heart breaks for you.

625
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:49,820
她为你的幸福蒙上了一层乌云
She has brought a cloud of darkness upon your happiness.

626
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,790
我知道她反对这门婚事
I know she was against this marriage.

627
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,030
她也未曾信任过你作为女王的直觉
Never trusted your instincts as a queen.

628
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:58,580
当我在晚宴上见到她
When I saw her at dinner...

629
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:04,060
她的角被遮盖住
with her horns covered...

630
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:08,160
掩饰着扭曲
bent cowering...

631
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:10,360
是啊
Well,

632
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:15,490
她突然发狂一点也不奇怪
it's no wonder that she lashed out.

633
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,160
我不知道该怎么做
I just don't know what to do.

634
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:21,830
你确实很爱他  不是吗
You do truly love him, don't you?

635
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,300
我的儿子
My son.

636
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,420
我深爱着他
Deeply.

637
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:29,030
爱会治愈你
It is love that will heal you.

638
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,420
爱会治愈我们所有人
It's what heals us all.

639
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,970
让我们作为一家人
Let's move forward together...

640
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:37,760
一起向前看
as a family.

641
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,990
致摩尔王国的所有生灵
To all who live on the Moors...

642
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,150
那是什么声音
What is that noise?

643
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,020
以及远方的各国
...and kingdoms far and wide,

644
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,560
我们的国王和王后邀请你们
the king and queen invite you...

645
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,280
来参加他们的儿子菲利普
to attend the wedding...

646
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,580
和奥萝拉在三天后的婚礼
of their son Philip to Aurora in three days' time.

647
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,620
欢迎所有生灵
All are welcome.

648
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,740
所有生灵都应该到场
And all are expected!

649
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:22,080
你听到了吗  我们被邀请去城堡了
Did you hear that? We're invited to the castle!

650
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,100
我就知道奥萝拉不会丢下我们
I knew Aurora wouldn't abandon us!

651
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,490
我一直都知道自己会受邀的
I always knew I'd be invited.

652
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:28,640
很高兴你俩也能参加
Just glad you two made the cut.

653
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:30,920
谁要结婚了
Who's getting married?

654
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:42,920
奥萝拉  我们不用着急婚礼的事
Aurora, we don't have to think about the wedding right now.

655
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,570
王后说得对
The queen is right.

656
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,720
我们需要对大家有交代
We owe it to everyone...

657
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,340
尤其是国王
especially the king.

658
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:54,300
那玛琳菲森呢
What about Maleficent?

659
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:59,320
她已经不在了
She's gone.

660
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:14,370
凤凰
The Phoenix.

661
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:17,300
传说她是黑暗仙子的祖先
It is said the Dark Fey began with her...

662
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:19,940
经过了几个世纪的演化
evolved over centuries.

663
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,220
你是她最后的后裔
You are the last of her descendants.

664
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:26,630
你和她血脉相连
Her blood is your own.

665
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,440
你就是她
You are her.

666
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,890
你手中掌握着控制生死的能力
In your hands, you hold the power of life and death...

667
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,810
毁灭和重生
destruction and rebirth.

668
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,680
但自然最大的力量
But nature's greatest power

669
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:47,770
是真正蜕变的力量
is the power of true transformation.

670
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:52,740
你在抚养奥萝拉时蜕变了
You transformed when you raised Aurora.

671
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,280
你在痛苦中
When you found love...

672
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:59,350
找到了爱
in the middle of your pain.

673
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,490
我请求你把你的一切愤怒
I'm asking you to take all of your fury...

674
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,560
一切痛苦
all of your pain...

675
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:09,140
全部摒弃
and not use it.

676
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,570
帮助我们与人类和平共处
Help us broker peace with the humans.

677
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:15,850
因为和平
Because peace...

678
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:21,550
可能会是黑暗仙子最后的蜕变
could be the Dark Fey's final transformation.

679
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:31,940
摩尔王国是我们在世上最后的净土
The Moors are our last true nature on earth.

680
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:35,980
而你让一个人类当了女王
And yet you named a human as queen.

681
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:39,210
你爱护的女儿
A daughter you cared for.

682
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:43,420
我没有女儿
I have no daughter.

683
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,940
她已经选择了自己的立场
She has chosen her side.

684
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:02,930
我们刚刚听说
We've just heard.

685
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,780
三天后城堡中会举行婚礼
There's going to be a wedding at the castle in three days.

686
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,820
各地的人类都会过去
Humans will come from all over.

687
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:12,400
我们就在那时进攻
That's when we attack.

688
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,770
杀了奥斯戴的国王和王后
We'll kill the king and queen of Ulstead...

689
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,280
还有他们的小王子
and their young prince.

690
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:21,520
他们的王国将会灭亡
Their kingdom will fall.

691
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,830
仙子将再次崛起
And the Fey will rise again.

692
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:42,470
这是仙子们做的
The fairies made it.

693
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,830
这是我嫁给国王时穿的
I wore it when I married the king.

694
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:11,390
肯定是完美的嫁衣
I'm sure it's perfect.

695
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:14,310
我同意
So am I.

696
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,100
陛下  她真漂亮
Your Majesty, she's absolutely lovely.

697
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,790
考虑到她的身世背景
Considering how she was raised.

698
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:26,960
被那个对她施咒的邪恶女巫抚养长大
By the same evil witch who cursed her.

699
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,360
她能遇上菲利普王子真是奇迹
It's a miracle Prince Philip came along.

700
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,870
这可怜的姑娘能活下来就是奇迹了
It's a miracle the poor child is alive at all.

701
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:36,140
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

702
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:38,530
太精美了
It's exquisite.

703
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:09,750
等我长大了
When I'm older...

704
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:12,200
就和你一起住在摩尔王国
I'm going to live here, in the Moors, with you.

705
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:15,150
这样我们就能相互照顾
Then we can look after each other.

706
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:39,480
-跟我说说你有什么烦心事  -没什么
- Tell me what's troubling you. - It's nothing.

707
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:42,840
奥萝拉  我了解你
Aurora, I know you better than that.

708
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,010
这些珠宝
This jewelry...

709
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:48,860
我的发型
my hair...

710
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,650
那么多规矩
all these rules.

711
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,830
让我喘不过气
I just... I can't breathe.

712
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:57,380
我感觉自己不再是摩尔王国的女王了
I feel like I'm not Queen of the Moors anymore.

713
00:58:57,810 --> 00:58:59,700
我感觉像变了个人
I feel like a different person.

714
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,650
听着
Listen...

715
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:05,230
我爱上的是森林里的那个女孩  并且只爱她
I fell in love with a girl in the forest and only her.

716
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:07,020
你不必改变
You don't have to change.

717
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:08,860
我不想让你改变
I don't want you to change.

718
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,450
我真不该让她戴头巾
I should have never asked her to wear that scarf.

719
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:28,220
{\an8}铁粉

720
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,020
太棒了
Ah, yes.

721
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,720
怎么样
Well...

722
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,260
成功了吗
Does it work?

723
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:50,610
我只有屈指可数的几个仙子用来试验
I only have a handful of fairy specimens to work with...

724
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:53,590
而且提取过程很艰难
and the extraction process is painstaking.

725
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:56,050
提取什么
Extraction from what?

726
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:57,930
彼岸花
Tomb Bloom flowers.

727
00:59:57,930 --> 00:59:59,770
它们生长于仙子的坟墓
They grow from a fairy's grave,

728
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:01,830
含有仙子的精华
contain their very essence.

729
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:03,860
将它的花粉与铁粉混合
When you mix the pollen with iron powder...

730
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:06,750
形成的粉末能杀死仙子
the resulting dust ends a fairy's life.

731
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:08,760
我们需要几千朵彼岸花
We will need thousands more.

732
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,590
演示一下
Show me.

733
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,020
演示一下
Show me.

734
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:16,890
好的
Very well.

735
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:20,830
来吧
So...

736
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:14,500
摩尔王国终于是我的囊中之物了
Finally, the Moors will be mine.

737
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:18,090
仙子将不复存在
No more fairies.

738
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,990
保持警惕  兄弟们
Stay alert, men.

739
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,240
就是在这里找到的
This is where I found them.

740
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,310
很好
Excellent.

741
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:16,570
万一长翅膀的怪物回来怎么办
But what if the winged one returns?

742
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:18,430
用不着担心
Don't you worry about that.

743
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:20,800
我们会做好准备
We'll be ready.

744
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,520
去摘彼岸花吧
Take the Tomb Blooms.

745
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,350
动手吧
Get to work!

746
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:41,490
哨兵  保持警惕
Sentries, stay alert!

747
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:43,240
准备好武器
Keep your weapons on hand.

748
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,590
麻利点
Move it!

749
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:13,900
玛琳菲森
Maleficent...

750
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:59,340
我们在这里安葬死者
This is where we bury our dead.

751
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:03,050
被他们摧毁了
They've destroyed it.

752
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:09,920
人类就是这样
This is what the humans do.

753
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,780
他们不过是挤满大地的蝗虫
They're nothing but locusts that swarm the earth.

754
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:14,310
我们必须阻止他们
We have to stop them.

755
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,640
你花了很多年照顾一个人类
You spent years caring for a human...

756
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:22,770
现在该照顾你自己的同类了
now it's time to care for your own.

757
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:33,880
射击
Fire!

758
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,510
填弹  再来
Reload! We go again!

759
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,790
射击
Fire!

760
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:09,960
填弹  还有一个
Reload! There's another one!

761
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,670
大家跟紧点
Everyone, stay together!

762
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,510
我们要离开摩尔王国了
We're about to leave the Moors.

763
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:34,390
握住离你最近的手或翅膀  或尾巴
Grab the hand or the wing... or the tail of whoever is closest to you.

764
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:18,950
这边  这边
Hey, over here! Yeah, over here!

765
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:21,670
维持队形  卫兵们  维持队形
Hold formation, guards. Hold formation.

766
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:25,140
-不好意思  先生  -站住
- Excuse me, sir. - Stop right there.

767
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,100
我是新娘那边的
I'm with the bride.

768
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:29,410
我们奉命让怪物先就座
We've been told to let the, uh, other kind find their seats first.

769
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:30,770
但我不是人类
But I'm not a human.

770
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:32,640
-我是乌鸦  -什么
- I'm a raven. - What?

771
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,140
我是乌鸦  黑色的鸟
A raven. The black bird.

772
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,050
这米真好吃
This rice is delicious.

773
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:40,490
这是用来撒向新娘和新郎的
You're supposed to throw it at the bride and groom.

774
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:43,150
什么  浪费好好的米
What? And waste good rice?

775
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:44,710
为什么要拦着我们
What's the hold up?

776
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:46,450
让我进去
Let me in!

777
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:49,200
为什么人类不能进去
Why can't humans come in, too?

778
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:51,850
为什么我们不能进去
Why can't we come in?

779
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,130
我知道这样不吉利
I know it's bad luck...

780
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:01,660
但我必须见你
but I had to see you.

781
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:04,650
给你的
For you.

782
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:06,040
彼岸花
A Tomb Bloom?

783
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:07,780
你从哪里弄来的
Where did you get this?

784
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:09,300
从我母亲那里拿的
From my mother.

785
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:12,250
天亮了  今天是我们的大喜之日
The sun's up. It's our wedding day.

786
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,730
从我母亲那里拿的
From my mother.

787
01:11:11,290 --> 01:11:12,870
我们该坐在哪里  蓝蝶仙子
Where should we sit, Flittle?

788
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,210
坐在左边  我们是新娘那边的
On the left. We're with the bride.

789
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:16,290
没错
Yes, we are.

790
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,420
但新郎也很可爱
But the groom's lovely, too.

791
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,260
没错
Yes, he is.

792
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,380
我两边都是
I'm with both.

793
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:33,980
好了
Now.

794
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:57,880
怎么回事
What's this?

795
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:00,800
除了我  谁都不许进来
Nobody is allowed in here except me.

796
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,510
而我已经进来了  所以赶紧出去
And I'm already here, so go away!

797
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:24,030
玛琳菲森  请你快停手
Maleficent, please stop.

798
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:31,540
玛琳菲森
Maleficent.

799
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:33,910
不是她做的
She didn't do it.

800
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:38,330
出去
Get out!

801
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:41,170
否则我叫卫兵来了
Before I call the guards!

802
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:49,470
失踪的仙子
The missing fairies.

803
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:51,310
我说了出去  你听到了吗
I said get out. Did you hear me?

804
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,680
你做了什么
What have you done?

805
01:12:58,230 --> 01:12:59,400
你是精灵
You're a pixie.

806
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:01,610
你竟敢这么叫我
How dare you call me that?

807
01:13:01,730 --> 01:13:03,400
我是贵族马屁精
I'm Lickspittle, the nobleman...

808
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:05,110
我是王后的手下
and I serve the queen.

809
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,030
她夺走了你的翅膀
She took your wings.

810
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:13,450
我们得放了他们
We have to release them.

811
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,580
他们属于摩尔王国
They belong on the Moors.

812
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:17,370
你也是  奥萝拉
As you do, Aurora.

813
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:22,630
一个背叛了同类的人类
A human who has betrayed her kind.

814
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:31,050
是你对国王施了咒
You put the curse on the king.

815
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:32,470
亲爱的
Oh, dear.

816
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:34,310
你或许是女王
You may be queen...

817
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,100
但你太年轻了
but you are very young.

818
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,480
统治人类比你头戴鲜花
Ruling humans is a bit more complicated...

819
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:44,150
赤脚到处跑要更复杂
than running around barefoot with flowers in your hair.

820
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,650
我年轻时
When I was young...

821
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:53,280
我娘家的王国与摩尔王国接壤
my family's kingdom bordered the Moors.

822
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:58,000
在一个异常寒冷的冬天
And one particularly harsh winter...

823
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,500
我们的庄稼死了
our crops died...

824
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:02,330
人民开始遭罪
and the people began to suffer.

825
01:14:03,550 --> 01:14:05,880
我们的视线越过城墙
And as we looked over our walls...

826
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:09,300
看到仙子繁荣生活着
we could see the fairies thriving.

827
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:13,100
我哥哥和我认为应该夺取所需
My brother and I believed we should take what we needed...

828
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:17,600
但我的父王亲却指望着仙子的仁慈
while my father, the king, sought their kindness.

829
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:21,270
选择了和平  而不是我们的子民
Choosing peace over our people,

830
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:23,270
他派我哥哥去商议
he sent my brother to do his bidding.

831
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:25,070
但他一去不回
He never came back.

832
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,780
那些野蛮的
Those savages...

833
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:30,570
连话都不会说的怪物
creatures who could barely grunt,

834
01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:32,990
不由分说地杀了他
let alone engage in talks, killed him.

835
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:35,280
我不相信
I don't believe that.

836
01:14:35,410 --> 01:14:37,040
我们的人民开始恐惧
Our people became fearful.

837
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,830
他们推翻了我父王
They overthrew my father.

838
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:43,250
王国陷入混乱  我被驱逐了
The land fell into chaos. I was cast out.

839
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:48,130
命运迫使我嫁给了奥斯戴的约翰国王
Forced by fate into marriage with King John of Ulstead.

840
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:50,220
又是一个软弱的国王
Another weak king

841
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:52,550
满口包容与礼待
speaking of tolerance and civility.

842
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:55,180
现在  我的亲生儿子
And now, my own son...

843
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:57,850
也被追求和谐的幻想蒙蔽了
corrupted with visions of harmony.

844
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,190
但我们不会被和平毁灭
But peace will not be our downfall.

845
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:08,230
把她锁起来
Now lock her up.

846
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:11,900
战争就要来了
A war is coming.

847
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:19,580
不  不
No! No!

848
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,800
真希望你能出席婚礼
I wish you could be here with me.

849
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,390
康诺尔想要和平
Conall wanted peace...

850
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,650
他们却用铁攻击他
and they filled him with iron.

851
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:50,400
我们的战争要打响了
Now, we will have our war.

852
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:55,820
我们的战斗现在开始
Our fight begins now!

853
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:58,280
我们将一起崛起
We will rise together!

854
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:00,160
我们一起战斗
We fight together.

855
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:04,830
我们绝不会手下留情
And we will show them no mercy!

856
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:23,930
快点  出发
Come on! Go!

857
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,150
快  快
Go! Go!

858
01:16:31,230 --> 01:16:33,940
快  快  快
Go! Go! Go!

859
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,880
菲利普的客人都在哪
Where are all Philip's guests?

860
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:52,130
人类真不守时
Humans are poor timekeepers.

861
01:17:18,570 --> 01:17:20,740
开始奏乐
Start the music.

862
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,010
快点  快点
Come on! Come on!

863
01:18:44,910 --> 01:18:45,910
她不见了
She's gone.

864
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:01,760
是陷阱  躲起来
It's a trap! Get down!

865
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:21,070
陛下
Your Majesty...

866
01:19:22,410 --> 01:19:24,160
他们从海上来了
they're coming from the sea.

867
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:35,790
她逃走了
She escaped!

868
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:43,550
这边走  快点
Down this way, come on!

869
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:52,810
陛下
Your Highness.

870
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,020
听我指挥
Upon my command.

871
01:20:05,410 --> 01:20:06,660
检查每一间屋子
Check every room!

872
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,620
她跑不远的
She can't be far!

873
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:44,110
等着
Wait.

874
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:46,360
等着
Wait.

875
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:11,350
怎么回事
What's going on?

876
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:17,270
发射
Now.

877
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:19,230
发射
Fire!

878
01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:28,820
不
No!

879
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:57,850
他们看起来和她一样
They look just like her.

880
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,070
撤退
Withdraw!

881
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,860
撤退
Withdraw!

882
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,030
撤退
Pull back!

883
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:10,490
玛琳菲森挑起了战争
Maleficent's starting a war.

884
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:12,070
先是我父亲  现在又这样
First my father, and now this.

885
01:22:12,910 --> 01:22:14,950
菲利普  她没有对他施咒
Philip! She didn't curse him.

886
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,000
-玛琳菲森  -什么
- Maleficent. - What?

887
01:22:17,330 --> 01:22:18,870
她根本没有对他施咒
She never cursed him.

888
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:21,330
是你母亲做的
It was your mother.

889
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,040
你在说什么
What are you saying?

890
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:24,550
是纺锤
It was the spindle.

891
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,340
上面还有诅咒
The curse is still in it.

892
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,430
你母亲用它对付你父亲
Your mother used it against your father.

893
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:36,810
看
Look.

894
01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:41,060
一模一样
It's the same.

895
01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:43,900
她把摩尔居民锁在了教堂里
She's locked the Moor folk in the chapel.

896
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:45,610
这不是婚礼
This isn't a wedding.

897
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:46,690
而是陷阱
It's a trap.

898
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,160
记住你来自哪里
Remember where you came from.

899
01:22:55,990 --> 01:22:57,410
记住你是谁
Remember who you are.

900
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:02,670
我已经做出了选择
I've made my choice.

901
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,840
你也得做出选择
You'll have to make yours.

902
01:23:34,370 --> 01:23:35,780
飞低一点
Stay low!

903
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:39,700
散开
Divide!

904
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:43,040
跟着我
Follow me!

905
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:53,590
进攻
Attack!

906
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,180
进攻
Attack!

907
01:24:07,190 --> 01:24:09,070
-点火  -点火
- Ignite! - Ignite!

908
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:21,450
不
No!

909
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:06,960
姑母  姑母
Aunties! Aunties!

910
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:10,210
太重了
It's too heavy!

911
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:12,880
奥萝拉
Aurora!

912
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,840
迪亚瓦  你来了
Diaval! You're here.

913
01:25:18,090 --> 01:25:19,430
怎么回事
What's happening?

914
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,830
换武器
Weapon change!

915
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,700
换武器  快
Weapon change! Go!

916
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:25,490
母亲
Mother!

917
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:27,870
你得阻止这一切
You have to stop this.

918
01:26:28,370 --> 01:26:29,500
我们在打仗
We are at war.

919
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:31,500
这不是战争  这是屠杀
This isn't a war. It's a massacre.

920
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,630
菲利普  你不明白
Philip, you don't understand.

921
01:26:33,630 --> 01:26:36,250
这些怪物阻挡我们
These creatures stand between us...

922
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:39,220
获取生存所需的资源
and everything we need to survive.

923
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:40,220
你错了
You're wrong.

924
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,140
我们可以共存
We can stand together.

925
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:44,390
你这个傻瓜居然真信
Well, you're a fool to believe that.

926
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:48,230
你不知道为我们的同类而战要付出什么
You don't know what it takes to fight for our kind.

927
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:50,230
你骗了我
You lied to me.

928
01:26:51,690 --> 01:26:53,230
我是在保护王国
I am protecting the kingdom...

929
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:55,400
以及你的王位
and your throne.

930
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:57,530
那父亲呢
What about Father?

931
01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:00,570
你也是在保护他吗
Were you protecting him, too?

932
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:06,910
王子身体不适
The prince is not feeling well.

933
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:09,500
带他回房休息
See him to his chambers.

934
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:14,920
马上
Now.

935
01:27:19,470 --> 01:27:20,970
殿下  不要
Sire, stop!

936
01:27:47,490 --> 01:27:49,240
停手  停手
Yield! Yield!

937
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:50,370
我母亲对国王施咒
My mother cursed the king

938
01:27:50,370 --> 01:27:52,080
目的是毁灭摩尔居民
so she could destroy the Moor folk.

939
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,960
你的手下正在为此付出惨重代价
Your men are paying heavily for it.

940
01:28:01,050 --> 01:28:02,800
我们必须做点什么
We have to do something!

941
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:08,470
再见  姐妹们
Goodbye, girls.

942
01:28:09,770 --> 01:28:11,470
不  回来
No, come back!

943
01:28:12,270 --> 01:28:14,100
蓝蝶仙子  不
Flittle! No!

944
01:28:26,410 --> 01:28:28,120
不
No!

945
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:29,830
去跟同类待在一起
Hey, you, stay with your own!

946
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:31,910
快跑  奥萝拉  快跑
Run, Aurora, run!

947
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:33,210
放开他
Let him go!

948
01:28:38,170 --> 01:28:40,380
不  不
No! No!

949
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:08,570
教母
Godmother.

950
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:09,130
为了蓝蝶仙子
For Flittle!

951
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:18,600
抓到她了
We've got her!

952
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:09,070
快跑  快跑
Go! Go!

953
01:31:09,070 --> 01:31:11,780
这边  这边
This way! This way!

954
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:12,660
快跑
Go!

955
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,240
退下
Stand down!

956
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,620
我不想打这场仗
This is not my fight.

957
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:04,370
我母亲想要战争  而你让她如愿以偿
My mother wanted a war, and you're giving it to her.

958
01:32:05,170 --> 01:32:08,570
我不会允许她的仇恨毁灭你我的王国
I won't allow her hatred to ruin my kingdom or yours.

959
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:29,170
我手上不会沾染仙子的血
There will be no Fey blood on my hands.

960
01:32:50,430 --> 01:32:52,570
这边  这边
This way! This way!

961
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,220
玛琳菲森回来了
Maleficent's back!

962
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:02,880
她要去找王后
She's going for the queen.

963
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:11,340
停手  停手
Yield! Yield!

964
01:33:11,710 --> 01:33:12,650
停手
Stand down!

965
01:33:12,650 --> 01:33:14,200
放下武器
Lower your weapons!

966
01:33:26,370 --> 01:33:29,330
我跟他们预言的恶魔出现了
There's the evil that I promised them.

967
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:36,050
你们比人类还容易预测
Your kind is more predictable than humans.

968
01:33:42,030 --> 01:33:42,970
住手
Stop!

969
01:33:43,950 --> 01:33:44,870
住手
Stop!

970
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:47,390
大致如此
Well, almost.

971
01:33:47,390 --> 01:33:48,430
住手
Stop.

972
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:51,620
很抱歉我怀疑了你  但你不是这样的
I'm sorry I doubted you, but this isn't you.

973
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:53,260
这不是唯一的方法
There's another way.

974
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:55,200
我了解你
I know who you are.

975
01:33:57,560 --> 01:33:58,970
我了解你
I know you.

976
01:34:00,350 --> 01:34:01,920
你不了解
You do not.

977
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:05,400
我了解
Yes, I do.

978
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:08,440
你是我母亲
You're my mother.

979
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:46,050
不
No!

980
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:04,000
你知道伟大领袖的必备条件吗  奥萝拉
Do you know what makes a great leader, Aurora?

981
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:08,100
向子民灌输恐惧的能力
The ability to instill fear in your subjects...

982
01:35:08,190 --> 01:35:09,660
并且利用那种恐惧
and then use that fear...

983
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:10,750
陛下
Your Majesty.

984
01:35:12,030 --> 01:35:13,850
对付你的敌人
against your enemies.

985
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:15,870
所以...
So...

986
01:35:16,990 --> 01:35:20,240
我散布了那个关于邪恶女巫
I spread the story of the evil witch...

987
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:23,340
以及被她施咒的公主的故事
and the princess she cursed.

988
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:27,700
谁唤醒了睡美人并不重要
It didn't matter who woke Sleeping Beauty.

989
01:35:28,910 --> 01:35:30,840
他们都吓坏了
They were all terrified.

990
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:34,310
而故事成为了传说
And the story became legend.

991
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:38,570
我知道你认为我是恶魔
I know you think I'm a monster.

992
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:44,080
但我对国王  玛琳菲森和我儿子所做的
But what I did to the king, to Maleficent, to my son...

993
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:47,220
都是为了奥斯戴王国
I did for Ulstead.

994
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:50,510
你背叛了你的同类
You are a traitor to your kind,

995
01:35:50,510 --> 01:35:52,290
你要为此付出代价
and you will pay for it.

996
01:35:53,460 --> 01:35:55,680
玛琳菲森已死
Maleficent is dead!

997
01:35:58,260 --> 01:36:01,100
我们再也不会生活在恐惧之中了
We will never again live in fear!

998
01:36:01,950 --> 01:36:03,270
回来
Get back here!

999
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:10,040
奥斯戴王国终于自由了
Ulstead is free at last!

1000
01:36:10,630 --> 01:36:11,900
放开我
Let me go!

1001
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:22,290
怎么回事
What's happening?

1002
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:49,280
看啊
Well, well.

1003
01:39:50,530 --> 01:39:52,070
你好  小怪物
Hello, Beasty.

1004
01:40:11,370 --> 01:40:12,580
我想你了
I missed you.

1005
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:15,900
你撞到脑袋了吗
Did you bump your head, then?

1006
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:17,350
对
I did.

1007
01:40:20,290 --> 01:40:21,330
菲利普
Philip.

1008
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:23,020
什么
Yes?

1009
01:40:25,290 --> 01:40:27,080
你爱我女儿吗
Do you love my daughter?

1010
01:40:30,170 --> 01:40:31,620
全心全意
With everything I have.

1011
01:40:40,770 --> 01:40:41,780
那好
Good.

1012
01:40:50,490 --> 01:40:54,120
我想这个是你的
I believe this belongs to you.

1013
01:41:00,590 --> 01:41:02,060
诅咒是无法结束的
Curses don't end.

1014
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:04,100
只能被解开
They're broken.

1015
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:30,860
结束了
It ends.

1016
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:39,990
不会再有战争了
There will be no more fighting.

1017
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,730
奥斯戴再也不会进攻摩尔了
Ulstead will never attack the Moors again.

1018
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:44,380
从今日起
And from this day on...

1019
01:41:44,740 --> 01:41:46,370
我们携手向前
we move forward...

1020
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:48,950
找到前行的道路

不  绿色
No, in green.

它们曾因恐惧而生嫌隙

今天  你们教会了我们

我们是谁并非取决于我们来自哪里

1067

而是取决于我们爱的是谁
