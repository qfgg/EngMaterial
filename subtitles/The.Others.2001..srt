1
00:00:19,105 --> 00:00:23,466
孩子们  都坐得舒服吗?
Now, children, are you sitting comfortably?

2
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,841
我开始了
Then I'll begin.

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,007
故事始于几千年前
This story started many thousands of years ago,

4
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:33,177
但只历时了七天
but it was all over in just seven days.

5
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:35,187
在那个远古时代
All that long, long time ago,

6
00:00:35,222 --> 00:00:37,247
我们现在熟悉的
none of the things we can see now,

7
00:00:37,324 --> 00:00:40,691
太阳  月亮  星星  地球
the sun, the moon, the stars, the earth,

8
00:00:40,727 --> 00:00:44,229
动物和植物  全部都不存在
the animals and plants not a single one existed.

9
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:46,265
只有上帝存在
Only God existed,

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,932
他是唯一的创造者
and so only He could have created them.

11
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:50,296
他创造了一切
And He did.

12
00:00:51,264 --> 00:00:55,991
小 岛 惊 魂

13
00:02:13,264 --> 00:02:16,791
"泽西岛  海峡群岛"  "1945年"

14
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:03,702
辛普森  真是大好人
Simpson. What a character he was.

15
00:03:03,737 --> 00:03:05,732
现在不知怎么样了?
I wonder whatever became of him?

16
00:03:05,772 --> 00:03:08,206
大概和其他人一样死了
Oh, I imagine he's dead like all the rest.

17
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:11,103
当时真是好时光
Ah, those were the days.

18
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:22,578
特德先生  注意你的头发
Mr. Tuttle, your hair.

19
00:03:30,117 --> 00:03:31,228
什么事?
Yes?

20
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:34,834
早安  太太  我们是...
Good morning, ma'am. We've come about the...

21
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:36,463
哦  当然
Oh, yes, of course.

22
00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:39,767
进来
Come in.

23
00:03:41,408 --> 00:03:43,672
想不到这么快就到了
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

24
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:52,882
你们是?
You are?

25
00:03:52,953 --> 00:03:54,648
我是贝莎米尔丝  太太
I'm Bertha Mills, ma'am.

26
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:56,814
这位是艾德蒙・特德
And this is Edmund Tuttle.

27
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,482
幸会  太太
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

28
00:03:58,558 --> 00:04:00,321
你一定是花匠了
You must be the gardener.

29
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,624
没错  是花匠
That's right. The gardener.

30
00:04:02,662 --> 00:04:06,655
这位姑娘叫丽蒂亚
And this young lady is called Lydia.

31
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,191
你有帮佣的工作经验吗?
Have you had much experience in service?

32
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:12,603
别被她的娃娃脸骗了  太太
Oh, don't let that angel face fool you, ma'am.

33
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,504
其实她年纪不轻
She's older than she looks.

34
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,441
会烫衣服吗?
Can you iron?

35
00:04:18,678 --> 00:04:20,839
怎么了?  哑巴了?
What's the matter? Has the cat got your tongue?

36
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:24,515
她不会说话  太太
She can't talk, ma'am.

37
00:04:25,285 --> 00:04:26,843
这个可怜的小姑娘是个哑巴
The poor little mite's a mute.

38
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,221
噢
Oh.

39
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:29,923
但手脚很灵活
Oh, but she's a good little worker.

40
00:04:29,923 --> 00:04:31,247
这点我可以保证
I can promise you that.

41
00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:33,952
好吧
All right.

42
00:04:33,994 --> 00:04:36,622
从前那个姑娘太笨拙了
All right. The other girl I had spoke too much, anyway.

43
00:04:36,663 --> 00:04:37,328
跟我来
Follow me.

44
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:38,758
米尔丝太太  你和姑娘的房间
Mrs. Mills, you and the girl

45
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:41,763
在顶楼
will sleep in the attic room at the top of the stairs.

46
00:04:42,102 --> 00:04:45,560
-而你  -特德 太太
-And you, Mr.  -Tuttle, ma'am.

47
00:04:46,305 --> 00:04:50,042
你可以睡在后面的库房
You could sleep in the shed around the back.

48
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:53,212
佣人们一周前失踪后
As you can see, the housework has been rather neglected

49
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:55,878
从那时起就没人打扫过
since the servants disappeared almost a week ago.

50
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,077
他们都不辞而别?
You mean they just vanished?

51
00:04:58,151 --> 00:04:59,881
都蒸发了
Into thin air.

52
00:05:00,354 --> 00:05:01,321
一声不响
No notice, nothing.

53
00:05:01,321 --> 00:05:03,417
甚至连工资都没拿
They didn't even collect their wages. They...

54
00:05:04,256 --> 00:05:06,157
都消失了
They just left us.

55
00:05:06,192 --> 00:05:08,212
真奇怪!
What a strange thing to do.

56
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:10,363
你们不久就会发现
You'll soon find out there are times

57
00:05:10,363 --> 00:05:13,021
这间屋子不是十全十美
when this house is not exactly an ideal home.

58
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:15,596
所以我在广告声明
Hence my advertisement in the newspaper

59
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:19,271
要老实  勤劳的人
requesting honest, hardworking people.

60
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:22,036
谁也不及我们老实  勤劳
There's nobody more honest or hardworking than us.

61
00:05:22,075 --> 00:05:23,474
对吧  特德先生
Isn't that right, Mr. Tuttle?

62
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,637
我们是老实人
Oh, aye, we're very honest.

63
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:28,807
而且很勤劳
And, um, very hardworking.

64
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:34,083
这是厨房
The kitchen.

65
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,020
我八点用早餐
I have breakfast at 8:00

66
00:05:36,056 --> 00:05:38,047
孩子们九点
the children at 9:00.

67
00:05:38,124 --> 00:05:41,389
午餐一点  晚餐七点半
Lunch will be served at 1:00 and dinner at 7:30.

68
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:43,726
男主人呢  太太?
And the master, ma'am?

69
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:48,824
男主人一年半前
The master went off to war

70
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:50,699
去战场了
a year and a half ago.

71
00:05:50,737 --> 00:05:53,730
停战后杳无音信
I've had no news since the war ended.

72
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:56,241
谁负责煮食?
Which of you does the cooking?

73
00:05:56,276 --> 00:05:58,676
真遗憾  太太
I'm so sorry, ma'am

74
00:05:58,712 --> 00:06:00,737
谁负责煮食?
Which of you does the cooking?

75
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,680
看到我做什么吗
You'll notice what I'm doing.

76
00:06:02,716 --> 00:06:06,043
这间屋子关了门
In this house, no door must be opened

77
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:08,480
才可以开另一扇门
without the previous one being closed first.

78
00:06:08,555 --> 00:06:11,115
一定要紧记
It is vital that you remember this.

79
00:06:11,191 --> 00:06:13,182
实行起来不简单
It's not as easy as it may seem.

80
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,387
十五把锁匙开启五十扇门
There are 15 different keys for all of the 50 doors

81
00:06:16,429 --> 00:06:18,730
要看你们在屋子的哪个地方
depending on which area of the house you're in at the time.

82
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:22,260
米尔丝太太  明天开始
Mrs. Mills, from tomorrow onwards

83
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,970
我会交一套钥匙给你负责
I will be leaving a set of keys in your charge.

84
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:26,529
好的  太太
Yes, ma'am.

85
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:28,341
音乐室
The music room.

86
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:30,444
我们搬来已有的那架老钢琴
That old piano was already here when we moved in.

87
00:06:30,444 --> 00:06:34,074
不要让孩子们乱弹
Please do not let the children thump away on it.

88
00:06:34,615 --> 00:06:36,778
我听了会头痛
It sets off my migraine.

89
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:38,716
安静
Silence is something that we prize

90
00:06:38,785 --> 00:06:40,515
比什么都重要
very highly in this house.

91
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:43,822
屋子里没有电话  收音机
That is why you will not find a telephone, a radio

92
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:45,957
也没有任何弄出响声的东西
or anything else that makes a racket.

93
00:06:46,393 --> 00:06:48,752
我们也没有电
Oh, we don't have electricity, either.

94
00:06:48,795 --> 00:06:50,861
战争时  德国人不断切电
During the war, the Germans kept cutting it off

95
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:53,798
所以已经习惯了  我们继续生活在不用电的日子里
so we learned to live without it. Let's continue.

96
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:56,466
太太  其实没必要看整间屋子
Ma'am, there's no need to show us the whole house.

97
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:57,629
有!
Yes!

98
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,030
有必要
Yes, there is.

99
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:02,843
屋内经常漆黑一片不见五指
Most of the time, you can hardly see your way.

100
00:07:02,843 --> 00:07:04,545
很难看清
It's often difficuIt to make out

101
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:08,006
有桌子椅子门餐柜
if there is a table, a chair, a door, a sideboard

102
00:07:09,082 --> 00:07:12,674
或是孩子们在玩捉迷藏游戏
or one of my children playing hide and seek.

103
00:07:12,752 --> 00:07:15,012
这话怎么说?
What do you mean, ma'am?

104
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:18,915
是时候见见我的孩子了
Perhaps I should introduce you to the children.

105
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:26,892
特德先生  请你现在去花园
Mr. Tuttle, you can see to the garden now.

106
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:28,161
工具在库房里
You'll find tooIs in the shed.

107
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:29,828
是的  太太
Yes, ma'am.

108
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:32,497
你们两个拉上窗帘
You two can start closing the curtains.

109
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:34,131
全部窗帘
All of them.

110
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:06,001
来吧
Come.

111
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:18,685
我去叫醒他们  你们稍候
I'll wake them. You wait here.

112
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,415
千万别拉开窗帘
Whatever you do, don't open the curtains.

113
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:28,090
醒醒  醒醒
Wakey, wakey.

114
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,525
快醒醒
Now, come on.

115
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:35,398
合起眼  合起手
Eyes closed, hands together.

116
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:38,071
祈福日伊始
Let it be, at light of day

117
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:40,535
祷告主耶稣
Jesus, to whom now I pray.

118
00:08:40,573 --> 00:08:43,139
祈福玛丽亚
Blessed be the Virgin pure

119
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:44,969
洁净如朝露
whom I greet with faith too short.

120
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:47,306
耶稣与玛丽  无瑕圣玫瑰
Jesus, Mary, spotless rose.

121
00:08:47,306 --> 00:08:50,778
愿主保佑我  直至夕阳红
Keep us till this day doth close.

122
00:08:55,989 --> 00:08:58,389
他们还未完全醒
They're still half asleep.

123
00:08:58,424 --> 00:09:01,882
多可爱的孩子
What sweet little children.

124
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:05,294
应该说些什么呀?
Well what do you say?

125
00:09:05,331 --> 00:09:07,390
你好吗?
How do you do?

126
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:09,333
你好吗?
How do you do?

127
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:12,805
你们好吗? 孩子们
How do you do, children?

128
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,602
我是米尔丝太太
My name is Mrs. Mills

129
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:17,872
不过也可以叫我贝莎
but you can call me Bertha if you like.

130
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:19,742
你们叫什么?
What are your names?

131
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:21,741
-安  -尼古拉斯
-Anne.  -Nicholas.

132
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:26,942
安和尼古拉斯  真是好听的名字
Anne and Nicholas. What pretty names.

133
00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:29,819
你是新保姆?
Are you going to be our new nanny?

134
00:09:32,926 --> 00:09:36,327
是的亲爱的  我是你们的新保姆
Yes, my dears. I'm your new nanny.

135
00:09:36,362 --> 00:09:37,693
该吃早餐了
It's time for their breakfast.

136
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:40,358
丽蒂亚  去关上厨房的窗
Lydia, go to the kitchen and close every shutter.

137
00:09:47,273 --> 00:09:50,106
医生找不到根治方法
The doctors were never able to find a cure.

138
00:09:50,143 --> 00:09:52,111
治什么?
For what?

139
00:09:52,145 --> 00:09:54,579
他们的病情
Their condition.

140
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:57,851
孩子们对光非常敏感
The children have a very serious allergy to light.

141
00:09:59,085 --> 00:10:01,117
他们绝不能暴露在
They are photosensitive and must never be exposed

142
00:10:01,117 --> 00:10:03,854
比现在强烈的光线之下
to any light much stronger than this.

143
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,154
否则他们即刻
Otherwise, in a matter of minutes

144
00:10:06,192 --> 00:10:08,023
就会出现疱疹  呼吸困难
they will break out in sores and blisters

145
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:11,326
然后会开始窒息
and begin to suffocate.

146
00:10:11,364 --> 00:10:12,922
严重的话会致命
It would eventually be fatal.

147
00:10:12,966 --> 00:10:15,230
我的天
Good heavens.

148
00:10:16,302 --> 00:10:17,997
我不喜欢这种土司
I don't like this toast.

149
00:10:18,037 --> 00:10:19,664
哦?  为什么?
Oh? Why not?

150
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,867
味道怪怪的
It tastes funny.

151
00:10:21,908 --> 00:10:23,876
从前的较好吃
I liked it better before.

152
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:28,279
因为从前是别人做的
That's because before, somebody else made it.

153
00:10:28,314 --> 00:10:30,612
他们几时回来?
When are they coming back?

154
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:34,109
他们不会回来了  孩子们
They're not coming back, child.

155
00:10:34,187 --> 00:10:37,156
和爸爸一样
Just like Daddy.

156
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,658
爸爸会回来的
Daddy is coming back, though.

157
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:43,856
米尔丝太太  爸爸去法国打仗
Mrs. Mills, our father's fighting in a war in France.

158
00:10:43,896 --> 00:10:45,227
是世界大战
It's the World War.

159
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:46,933
我知道  但他在法国
I know, but he's in France.

160
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:48,634
说够了  别唧唧喳喳
That's enough, chatterboxes.

161
00:10:48,668 --> 00:10:51,566
快吃早餐
Finish up your breakfasts.

162
00:10:51,604 --> 00:10:55,131
你也会走吗?
Are you going to leave us, too?

163
00:10:55,174 --> 00:10:57,507
当然不会
Of course not!

164
00:10:58,144 --> 00:11:00,341
我为什么要走?
Why should I leave you?

165
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,610
他们也说不会
The others said they wouldn't

166
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:04,480
但还是走了  出事了
but they did, and then it happened.

167
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,518
别乱说!
Be quiet!

168
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:09,748
什么意思?
What do you mean, Anne?

169
00:11:09,822 --> 00:11:12,950
出什么事了?
What happened?

170
00:11:12,992 --> 00:11:17,258
妈妈变疯了
Mummy went mad.

171
00:11:17,297 --> 00:11:20,061
-没事  -有事
-Nothing happened.  -Yes, it did.

172
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:22,067
-不  没事!  -有事的!
-No, it didn't!  -Yes, it did!

173
00:11:22,101 --> 00:11:24,228
不要吵
Be quiet.

174
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:29,108
怎么回事?  我要你们
What's going on? I want those plates empty

175
00:11:29,142 --> 00:11:31,474
一分钟内吃完  听到吗?
in less than a minute. Is that clear?

176
00:11:34,814 --> 00:11:37,044
米尔丝太太  能出来一会吗?
Mrs. Mills, would you come outside a moment?

177
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,142
我有话和你说
I'd like a word with you.

178
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,387
是的  太太
Yes, ma'am.

179
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:48,991
邮差每逢星期三来收信
The postman usually comes every Wednesday.

180
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,497
但我刚看了邮箱
But I just checked the letterbox

181
00:11:51,497 --> 00:11:52,929
这星期他没来过
and this week he hasn't.

182
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:56,101
我不太明白太太的意思
I'm afraid I don't follow, ma'am.

183
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:58,126
这封信件应该
This letter should have been collected

184
00:11:58,171 --> 00:12:00,731
在五天前送到报馆
and delivered to the newspaper five days ago.

185
00:12:00,773 --> 00:12:02,240
就是聘佣广告
It's an advertisement for servants.

186
00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:03,469
它没有刊登
Since it was never published

187
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:06,307
你们怎么会上门的?
would you explain what you're doing here?

188
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:08,847
噢  明白了
Oh, I understand.

189
00:12:09,082 --> 00:12:12,076
太太  那就是你开门时
Ma'am, that's what I was going to say to you

190
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:13,942
我想解释的
when you opened the door to us.

191
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,511
事实上我们只是路过
The truth is that we just come by

192
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:18,853
碰碰运气
on the off chance.

193
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:20,415
这样的豪宅
A big house like this

194
00:12:20,493 --> 00:12:23,087
通常需要我们这种老手
is always in need of someone who knows the ropes.

195
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:25,764
你们曾在类似的大屋工作过?
You've served in a house like this one before?

196
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:28,293
这真是巧得很  太太
This may come as a surprise to you, ma'am, but

197
00:12:29,735 --> 00:12:32,501
我们其实就在这里干过活
we, in fact, used to work here.

198
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:34,667
这里?
Here?

199
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:39,569
是几年前的事了
Oh, now, it was a few years ago.

200
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:42,604
实不相瞒  太太
If you don't mind my saying so, ma'am

201
00:12:42,648 --> 00:12:46,345
那是我一生最快乐的时光
they were the best years of my life.

202
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:48,852
我们路过是因为这间屋子
That's why we come by, because this house

203
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:51,654
对我们有特殊意义
means a lot to us.

204
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:54,751
或许我该出示推荐信  太太
Perhaps I'd best show you our references, ma'am.

205
00:12:54,794 --> 00:12:55,886
不  不
No, no, no.

206
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:57,623
别担心  没必要
Don't bother. There's no need.

207
00:12:57,663 --> 00:12:59,790
那你们很熟悉这屋子了?
So you say you know the house well?

208
00:12:59,832 --> 00:13:02,198
了如指掌
Like the back of my hand.

209
00:13:02,235 --> 00:13:05,329
除非墙生出了脚
That is assuming the walls haven't sprouted legs

210
00:13:05,371 --> 00:13:07,396
移了位置
and moved in the meantime.

211
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,603
在这里移位的只有光
The only thing that moves here is the light.

212
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:15,205
但它改变了一切
But it changes everything.

213
00:13:19,952 --> 00:13:22,512
令人感到困惑
It's rather difficult, to say the least.

214
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,054
可以说是难以忍受
One might almost say unbearable.

215
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:33,765
只有头脑冷静才能坚持下去
The only way of enduring it is by keeping a cool head.

216
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,166
对  太太
Oh, yes, ma'am.

217
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:38,830
我不喜欢无中生有
I don't like fantasies.

218
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:41,203
胡思乱想  明白吗?
Strange ideas. Do you know what I mean?

219
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,077
是的  太太
I think so, ma'am.

220
00:13:44,077 --> 00:13:48,404
孩子们有时会胡言乱语
My children sometimes have strange ideas.

221
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:51,178
你别信以为真
But you mustn't pay any attention to them.

222
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,310
孩子毕竟是孩子
Children will be children.

223
00:13:54,387 --> 00:13:56,617
当然  太太
Yes, of course, ma'am.

224
00:13:56,656 --> 00:14:01,719
好吧  你们留下吧
All right. You can stay.

225
00:14:03,262 --> 00:14:05,856
非常感谢  太太
Thank you very much, ma'am.

226
00:14:17,043 --> 00:14:19,470
的确有事
It did happen.

227
00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:31,556
罗马统治者后来试图
The Roman governor tried to make them

228
00:14:31,591 --> 00:14:33,388
逼他们改变想法...
change their minds afterwards...

229
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:36,691
逼他们改变想法  句号
To make them change their minds. Full stop.

230
00:14:36,729 --> 00:14:38,754
-后来  -嗯
-Afterwards  -Mm- hmm.

231
00:14:38,798 --> 00:14:40,390
他下令对他们用刑
He ordered them to be beaten.

232
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:43,826
但祖斯特和巴斯达却不畏屈服
But Justus and Pastor, far from being afraid

233
00:14:43,826 --> 00:14:47,132
乐意为基督而献身
rejoiced and showed themselves willing to die for Christ.

234
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:48,702
他见此情景
When he saw this,

235
00:14:48,702 --> 00:14:50,772
统治者勃然大怒
the Roman governor was filled with rage

236
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,368
下令斩首示众
and ordered their heads to be cut off.

237
00:14:57,351 --> 00:14:59,445
有什么好笑?
What do you find so amusing?

238
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:02,954
哇哦
Well.

239
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,957
哇哦  什么?
Well, what?

240
00:15:05,024 --> 00:15:07,492
那些小孩真笨
Those children were really stupid.

241
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:08,829
为什么?
Why?

242
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:11,294
因为他们说只信耶稣
Because they said they only believed in Jesus

243
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:14,159
就为了这个被杀了
and then they got killed for it.

244
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,566
你会怎样? 背叛耶稣?
And what would you have done, deny Christ?

245
00:15:16,602 --> 00:15:17,899
嗯  是的
Well, yes

246
00:15:17,937 --> 00:15:19,905
我会暗地里信
Inside I would have believed in him

247
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:22,772
但不会说出来
but I wouldn't have told the Romans that.

248
00:15:25,511 --> 00:15:27,638
你也那样认为?  尼古拉斯
Is that what you think, too, Nicholas?

249
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,648
明白了
I see.

250
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:37,280
你们宁愿撒谎  背弃耶稣
So you would have lied to the point of denying Christ.

251
00:15:37,356 --> 00:15:39,984
暂时是可以保住脑袋
You'd have saved your heads from the Romans,

252
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:41,687
没错
that's true.

253
00:15:41,727 --> 00:15:43,490
但之后怎样?
But what would have happened afterwards?

254
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:44,689
几时?
When?

255
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,062
死了之后
In the next life.

256
00:15:47,099 --> 00:15:49,226
死后会去一个地方
The one waiting for us after we die.

257
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:50,933
你会到哪里去?
Where would you have gone?

258
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:54,003
去哪里?  尼古拉斯
Where, Nicholas?

259
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,701
去小孩的边狱
To the children's limbo.

260
00:15:55,741 --> 00:15:57,675
什么是边狱?  安
What is the children's limbo, Anne?

261
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,537
四狱之一
One of the four Hells.

262
00:15:59,537 --> 00:16:01,244
何谓四狱?
Which are?

263
00:16:04,383 --> 00:16:06,252
我  我回答
Me, me, me! Me!

264
00:16:06,252 --> 00:16:08,943
让他答  是什么?
No, Let him answer, Which are?

265
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:11,615
不赦之徒入地狱
There's the Hell where the damned go,

266
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:13,993
还有炼狱
then there's Purgatory.

267
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:14,758
是
Yes.

268
00:16:14,758 --> 00:16:16,855
亚伯拉罕之胸狱
And the bosom of Abraham where the just go

269
00:16:16,896 --> 00:16:18,359
小孩入边狱
and limbo where children go.

270
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:20,097
在地底中心
At the center of the earth.

271
00:16:20,132 --> 00:16:22,158
非常非常热
Where it's very, very hot.

272
00:16:22,802 --> 00:16:24,726
说谎的小孩去那里
That's where children go who tell lies

273
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,572
而且不是几天
but they don't just go there for a few days.

274
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:28,305
噢  不
Oh, no.

275
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:32,038
是永世不得超生
No, they're damned. Forever.

276
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,536
仔细想想
Think about it.

277
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:40,348
想想万劫不复
Try to imagine the end of eternity.

278
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:42,051
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

279
00:16:42,388 --> 00:16:44,924
闭上眼睛想一下
Close your eyes and try to imagine it.

280
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:47,782
永世
Forever.

281
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:53,065
永世万劫不复
Pain forever.

282
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:56,561
我觉得头晕
I'm getting dizzy.

283
00:16:57,903 --> 00:16:59,496
现在明白
Now do you understand

284
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:02,765
为何祖斯特和巴斯达不说谎?
why Justus and Pastor told the truth?

285
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:07,246
好了
All right.

286
00:17:07,746 --> 00:17:10,850
翻到第六课
Open your readers at lesson six.

287
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,018
可以去玩吗?
Can't we play?

288
00:17:12,018 --> 00:17:13,879
当然不可以
You most certainly cannot.

289
00:17:13,953 --> 00:17:15,420
先熟读课文
First you're going to read the lesson

290
00:17:15,455 --> 00:17:17,582
然后背诵全文
then you're going to learn it by heart.

291
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:18,851
全部?
All of it?

292
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:20,290
再讨价还价
Any more protests

293
00:17:20,326 --> 00:17:22,794
今天就别想玩了
and there'll be no playing at all today.

294
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:26,356
对了  你们应该分开做功课
In fact, I think you can study in separate rooms.

295
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:27,593
不不不!
No, no, no!

296
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:29,200
就这样
Yes, yes, yes!

297
00:17:29,235 --> 00:17:30,998
我们分开会害怕的
But we get scared if we're separated!

298
00:17:31,037 --> 00:17:34,063
害怕?  你们早习惯这屋子了
Scared? As if you weren't used to this house by now.

299
00:17:34,107 --> 00:17:36,075
看见鬼怎么办?
What if we see a ghost?

300
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:39,237
姐姐又讲鬼故事了?
Has your sister been telling you one of her stories?

301
00:17:39,278 --> 00:17:40,973
我什么也没有讲
I haven't told him anything!

302
00:17:41,013 --> 00:17:42,480
看见鬼就说你好
If you see a ghost you say "Hello"

303
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:43,948
然后继续念书
and continue on studying.

304
00:17:43,983 --> 00:17:46,247
-安  跟我去音乐室  -为什么是我?
-Come to the music room.  -Why me?

305
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,184
因为我要你去  快点
Because I say so! Now come on.

306
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:50,155
拿好书本
Take your book.

307
00:17:50,189 --> 00:17:51,850
尼古拉斯  我要你一小时内

308
00:17:51,891 --> 00:17:53,222

309
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:55,887
-妈咪  -什么?
-Mummy  -What?

310
00:17:56,928 --> 00:17:58,192
吻我一下
Give me a kiss.

311
00:17:58,231 --> 00:18:01,064
吻我一下 吻我一下
"Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss."

312
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,269
安  出去等我
Anne, wait for me outside.

313
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:05,432
你知道我不行
You know I can't.

314
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:08,531
来这边
Over there.

315
00:18:10,643 --> 00:18:14,072
米尔斯太太  拉上窗帘
Mrs. Mills, close all the curtains.

316
00:18:14,913 --> 00:18:17,371
我女儿要过客厅
My daughter is going to cross the living room.

317
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:19,442
是的  太太
Yes, ma'am.

318
00:18:26,325 --> 00:18:27,656
好了  安
All right, Anne.

319
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,188
宝贝
Darling.

320
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,736
妈妈不能整天陪你
Mummy can't be with you all the time, hmm?

321
00:18:38,871 --> 00:18:42,568
你必须学会独立学习
You must learn to be on your own.

322
00:18:43,876 --> 00:18:46,310
你的念珠呢?
Where's your rosary?

323
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,048
感到害怕时
Whenever you feel afraid,

324
00:18:52,118 --> 00:18:54,951
就用力握紧它
I want you to squeeze it with all your might

325
00:18:54,987 --> 00:18:58,582
念一次经文  就不会害怕了
say an Our Father, and your fear will go away.

326
00:18:58,658 --> 00:19:02,992
-没用的  -当然有用
-It won't.  -Yes, it will. Honestly.

327
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:04,792
你要知道  念经的时候
Don't you see that when you do that

328
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,731
主与你同在
the Lord is with you?

329
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:10,331
不必感到害怕
There's no reason to be afraid.

330
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:52,075
屋子和家人
The house and the family

331
00:19:52,111 --> 00:19:55,342
全家人都住在同一间屋
We all live in a house with our family.

332
00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:58,839
家人包括双亲
The family is usually made up of parents,

333
00:19:58,884 --> 00:20:01,580
孩子和其祖父母
children, and their grandparents.

334
00:20:01,654 --> 00:20:03,246
我们要乖乖听话
We must be obedient

335
00:20:03,322 --> 00:20:06,723
服从尊重其他家人
and kind towards other members of our family

336
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:09,492
兄弟姐妹之间
and we must never argue or fight

337
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:12,062
不应争吵打斗
with our brothers and sisters.

338
00:20:12,097 --> 00:20:14,088
你有孩子吗?
Do you have any children?

339
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:15,657
没有
No.

340
00:20:15,701 --> 00:20:19,831
只有特德先生和丽蒂亚
Mr. Tuttle and the girl Lydia are all I've got and

341
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:21,339
我也是他们的仅有
I'm all they've got.

342
00:20:21,373 --> 00:20:23,307
她天生就是这样?
Was she born like that?

343
00:20:23,342 --> 00:20:25,936
我不明白  太太
Beg your pardon, ma'am?

344
00:20:25,978 --> 00:20:29,209
那个姑娘  她天生是哑巴?
The girl. Was she born a mute?

345
00:20:30,048 --> 00:20:31,048
不
No.

346
00:20:33,118 --> 00:20:35,211
这里我打扫干净了
I think I've finished here, ma'am.

347
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:37,346
如果没有什么事  我想出去
If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go

348
00:20:37,423 --> 00:20:39,914
看看特德先生要不要帮忙
and see if Mr. Tuttle needs a hand.

349
00:21:09,922 --> 00:21:11,355
尼古拉斯!
Nicholas!

350
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:18,159
尼古拉斯  我来了!
Nicholas, I'm coming!

351
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:22,327
噢!
Oh!

352
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,438
-尼古拉斯?  -什么事?
-Nicholas?  -What's the matter?

353
00:21:27,473 --> 00:21:28,440
你哭什么?
Why were you crying?

354
00:21:28,474 --> 00:21:31,204
我没哭  我在读书
I wasn't crying. I was reading.

355
00:21:31,243 --> 00:21:34,303
我刚刚听到  安!
But I just heard you, Anne!

356
00:21:42,454 --> 00:21:43,751
安!
Anne!

357
00:21:45,691 --> 00:21:47,522
安?
Anne?

358
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:49,618
我还没背熟  妈妈
I haven't learned it yet, Mummy.

359
00:21:49,662 --> 00:21:53,257
-你没事吧?  -是的
-Are you all right?  -Yes.

360
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:56,393
-你哭什么?  -我没哭
-Why were you crying?  -I wasn't.

361
00:21:56,435 --> 00:22:00,132
我刚才明明听到
I just heard you a moment ago.

362
00:22:00,172 --> 00:22:02,106
不必感到难为情  宝贝
There's no need to feel ashamed, darling.

363
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:03,438
我没哭
I don't.

364
00:22:03,475 --> 00:22:05,875
要是我哭了  会告诉你的
If I'd been crying, I'd tell you.

365
00:22:05,911 --> 00:22:08,004
那我是无中生有了?
Oh, really. So I imagined it, did I?

366
00:22:08,047 --> 00:22:10,481
不  是那男孩在哭
No. It was that boy.

367
00:22:10,516 --> 00:22:12,416
哪个男孩?
What boy?

368
00:22:12,484 --> 00:22:13,951
维克多
Victor.

369
00:22:13,986 --> 00:22:16,352
谁是维克多?
Who's Victor?

370
00:22:16,388 --> 00:22:19,789
刚才在这里的男孩
The boy that was here a moment ago.

371
00:22:19,825 --> 00:22:21,690
我叫他安静让我读书
I told him to let me study

372
00:22:21,727 --> 00:22:23,622
但他不停地哭
but he wouldn't stop crying.

373
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:25,863
他很蛮不讲理
I think he's a spoiled brat.

374
00:22:25,898 --> 00:22:28,162
要我们离开这屋子
He said we'd have to leave the house.

375
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,795
是吗?  那他为什么哭?
Oh, did he, now? And why was he crying?

376
00:22:31,837 --> 00:22:33,600
因为他不喜欢这屋子
Because he doesn't like this house

377
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:36,733
但必须住着  他爸爸是钢琴家
but he has to live here. His father's a pianist.

378
00:22:36,775 --> 00:22:39,243
-他爸爸是钢琴家?  -是的
-His father's a pianist?  -Yes.

379
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:42,679
我警告他不许碰钢琴
I already told him he's not allowed to touch the piano.

380
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:43,841
不能碰  对吗  妈妈?
He isn't, is he, Mummy?

381
00:22:45,651 --> 00:22:47,846
你和他爸爸也说了?
So, you've spoken to his father as well?

382
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,254
没  只和维克多说了
No, only with Victor.

383
00:22:49,254 --> 00:22:51,287
他爸爸和其他人都在厅里
His father's with the others in the hall.

384
00:22:51,323 --> 00:22:53,655
我从厅里进来  那里没有人
I've just come from the hall. There's no one there.

385
00:22:55,427 --> 00:22:57,725
大概是上楼去视察屋子了
They must've gone upstairs. They're viewing the house.

386
00:22:57,725 --> 00:23:00,230
行了  安  够了
That'll do, Anne! That's enough!

387
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:03,569
你为什么要哭?
Now why were you crying?

388
00:23:03,604 --> 00:23:04,331
是维克多在哭
It was Victor!

389
00:23:04,331 --> 00:23:07,032
-他在哪里?  -他从那边出去了
-So where is he now?  -He went out through there!

390
00:23:07,073 --> 00:23:09,097
那告诉我一个男孩
Would you mind telling me how a boy

391
00:23:09,141 --> 00:23:12,133
门锁住了是怎么进出的?
can get in and out of this room if it's locked?

392
00:23:16,115 --> 00:23:19,448
我说得很清楚了
I thought I made myseIf quite clear.

393
00:23:19,518 --> 00:23:20,753
关门之后
No door is to be opened

394
00:23:20,753 --> 00:23:22,816
才能开另一扇门
without the previous one being closed first.

395
00:23:22,888 --> 00:23:25,118
难道不明白?
Is that so hard to understand?

396
00:23:25,157 --> 00:23:27,216
这屋子就像船
This house is like a ship.

397
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:29,284
光线就像水必须排除在外
The light must be contained as if it were water

398
00:23:29,328 --> 00:23:31,593
只能依靠开门  关门
by opening and closing the doors.

399
00:23:32,631 --> 00:23:34,390
我的孩子有生命危险!
My children's lives are at stake!

400
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,300
太太
But, ma'am

401
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,396
别狡辩!  闭嘴!
Do not argue with me! Be quiet!

402
00:23:38,437 --> 00:23:40,429
最后一个进房的是谁?
Which was the last of you to enter that room?

403
00:23:41,473 --> 00:23:42,735
丽蒂亚?
Lydia?

404
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,613
她没有锁匙  我告诉过你
She hasn't got a key. I already told you that.

405
00:23:47,613 --> 00:23:49,415
那就是你了
That leaves you, then.

406
00:23:49,415 --> 00:23:51,273
我一直在厅里
But I was in the hall the whole time.

407
00:23:51,316 --> 00:23:52,840
然后去了花园
And then I went out into the garden.

408
00:23:52,918 --> 00:23:54,078
你亲眼看见的
You saw me with your own eyes.

409
00:23:54,153 --> 00:23:57,589
你意思是指我了!
I hope you are not suggesting that it was me!

410
00:23:57,623 --> 00:23:59,921
你以为我会粗心大意到
Do you think that I would overlook such a thing

411
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:03,052
害死自己的女儿?
and endanger the life of my own daughter?

412
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:11,636
不要在餐桌上看书
You're not supposed to read at the table.

413
00:24:12,571 --> 00:24:13,599
那又怎样?
Oh, really?

414
00:24:13,939 --> 00:24:17,072
谁会告诉妈妈?  你?
Who's going to tell Mummy? You?

415
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:23,475
或是你?
Or perhaps you?

416
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,448
你真的见到男孩?
Did you really see a boy?

417
00:24:30,448 --> 00:24:32,688
是  他叫维克多
Yes. He's called Victor.

418
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,691
他是鬼吗?
Is he a ghost?

419
00:24:36,728 --> 00:24:39,094
笨蛋  鬼不是那样的
Don't be stupid. Ghosts aren't like that.

420
00:24:39,131 --> 00:24:41,031
那他们怎样的?
What are they like?

421
00:24:41,066 --> 00:24:43,369
告诉你一千次了
I've told you a thousand times.

422
00:24:43,369 --> 00:24:46,461
他们披白布戴锁链
They go about in white sheets and carry chains.

423
00:24:46,461 --> 00:24:49,105
-你怎么知道?  -因为我见过
-How do you know?  -Because I've seen them.

424
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:51,735
他们晚上行动
They come out at night.

425
00:24:51,777 --> 00:24:53,870
胡说  在哪里?
Fibber. Where?

426
00:25:00,752 --> 00:25:03,312
-你笨蛋  -没你笨
-You're stupid.  -Not half as much as you.

427
00:25:03,388 --> 00:25:05,650
我才不信你见到了那个男孩
I don't believe you saw that boy.

428
00:25:05,651 --> 00:25:06,923
信不信由你
Believe what you like.

429
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:09,923
很快你就会要我们陪你玩
You'll soon be begging us to play with you.

430
00:25:22,508 --> 00:25:24,475
尼古拉斯
Nicholas!

431
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:27,775
干嘛?
What?

432
00:25:27,813 --> 00:25:30,407
看
Look.

433
00:25:30,449 --> 00:25:32,440
你为何拉开窗帘?
Why have you opened the curtains?

434
00:25:32,484 --> 00:25:34,452
-不是我  -那是谁?
-It wasn't me.  -Who was it, then?

435
00:25:34,486 --> 00:25:36,784
是维克多
It was Victor.

436
00:25:36,822 --> 00:25:39,256
他搞了一晚
He's been doing it all night.

437
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,152
说谎  我要告诉妈妈
You're lying. I'm going to tell Mummy.

438
00:25:41,152 --> 00:25:44,087
-我说谎?  -是
-So I'm a liar, am I?  -Yes.

439
00:25:44,129 --> 00:25:46,559
维克多  快从窗帘后出来
Victor, come out from behind that curtain

440
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,697
让我笨弟弟看看
so my stupid brother can see you.

441
00:25:58,577 --> 00:26:00,374
不要吓我
Leave me alone.

442
00:26:00,412 --> 00:26:02,380
你不想见他?
So you don't want to see him now, eh?

443
00:26:02,414 --> 00:26:04,041
你是胆小鬼
You're a cowardy custard.

444
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:08,041
胆小  胆小  胆小鬼
Cowardy cowardy custard.

445
00:26:09,855 --> 00:26:12,585
我只好亲自动手了
I'll just have to do it myself, then.

446
00:26:29,808 --> 00:26:31,332
够了  维克多
That's enough, Victor

447
00:26:34,313 --> 00:26:36,406
尼古拉斯  尼古拉斯
Nicholas. Nicholas.

448
00:26:36,448 --> 00:26:37,779
叫他别弄窗帘
Tell him to leave the curtains alone.

449
00:26:37,816 --> 00:26:39,113
他不听我的话
He won't listen to me.

450
00:26:39,184 --> 00:26:41,148
住手  你们两个离开我的床
Stop it, Get off my bed, both of you.

451
00:26:41,158 --> 00:26:43,215
床是我们的
This is our bed.

452
00:26:43,288 --> 00:26:44,846
不  是我的
No, it's mine

453
00:26:44,923 --> 00:26:48,051
安  不要扮怪声
Anne, please stop putting on that voice.

454
00:26:48,093 --> 00:26:50,721
闭嘴  胆小鬼
You be quiet, cowardy custard.

455
00:26:50,762 --> 00:26:53,993
听着  还不停手  我就叫妈妈
Listen, if you don't stop, I'll call my mother

456
00:26:54,032 --> 00:26:55,590
赶你出去
and she'll kick you out.

457
00:26:55,634 --> 00:26:57,495
你见识过她的厉害
You don't know my mother.

458
00:26:57,495 --> 00:26:59,265
你未见识过我的父母
And you don't know my parents.

459
00:26:59,275 --> 00:27:02,403
安  我要告诉妈妈你吓我
Anne, I'm going to tell Mummy about you.

460
00:27:02,441 --> 00:27:05,842
真笨  不是我
Don't be stupid. Can't you see it's not me?

461
00:27:05,877 --> 00:27:09,278
维克多  摸他的脸让他感觉一下
Victor, touch his cheek so he knows you're real.

462
00:27:20,392 --> 00:27:22,519
妈咪!  救命!
Mummy! Help!

463
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:24,756
救命!  救命!  妈咪
Help! Help, Mummy!

464
00:27:24,796 --> 00:27:27,560
什么事?  什么事?
What is it? What is it?

465
00:27:28,967 --> 00:27:30,332
出什么事?
What is it?

466
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:33,964
她吓我  我叫她别说了
She was fighting with me, and I told her to be quiet.

467
00:27:34,006 --> 00:27:36,440
我忍无可忍  听到吗!
I'm fed up. Do you hear me?

468
00:27:36,475 --> 00:27:38,170
你太过份了!
I am fed up with you!

469
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,837
不是我干的
I didn't do anything!

470
00:27:43,182 --> 00:27:45,949
因此上帝将他
Therefore the Lord God sent him forth

471
00:27:45,949 --> 00:27:48,182
从伊甸园
from the Garden of Eden

472
00:27:48,182 --> 00:27:50,952
放逐到农田耕地
to till the ground from whence he was taken.

473
00:27:50,989 --> 00:27:52,513
他赶走众人
So he drove out the man

474
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:55,321
在伊甸园东首
and placed to the east of the Garden of Eden

475
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,794
竖立起烈火剑
cherubims and a flaming sword

476
00:27:57,829 --> 00:27:59,854
旋回转动  确保了
which turned every way to keep the way

477
00:27:59,898 --> 00:28:01,422
生命之树世代相传
of the Tree of Life,

478
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:04,128
行了  我念完了
There, I finished.

479
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:06,795
很好
Very good.

480
00:28:08,507 --> 00:28:11,703
现在向圣母认错
Now you can ask the Virgin for forgiveness.

481
00:28:11,743 --> 00:28:15,076
什么?  我们没这样说过
What? That's not what we agreed!

482
00:28:15,113 --> 00:28:17,013
我们不必说什么
We didn't agree anything, young lady.

483
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:19,675
今天你受罚  一切我说了算
Today you're being punished, and you'll do as I say.

484
00:28:19,675 --> 00:28:22,177
您不能逼我向圣母认错
You can't make me ask the Virgin for forgiveness.

485
00:28:22,254 --> 00:28:23,253
大胆
How dare you!

486
00:28:23,253 --> 00:28:26,420
妈妈  我不会为没做过的事认错
Mummy, I won't ask forgiveness for something I didn't do!

487
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,785
你告诉弟弟房间里有人
You told your brother someone else was in the room!

488
00:28:28,785 --> 00:28:30,260
-的确有!  -你说谎!
-There was!  -You're lying!

489
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,153
我没有!
I am not!

490
00:28:33,265 --> 00:28:34,626
安
Anne,

491
00:28:35,026 --> 00:28:39,326
记得祖斯特和巴斯达的故事吗?
do you remember the story about Justus and Pastor?

492
00:28:39,371 --> 00:28:42,568
说谎的小孩入边狱
Children who don't tell the truth end up in limbo.

493
00:28:42,607 --> 00:28:45,037
那是你说的  我看过书
That's what you say, but I read the other day

494
00:28:45,037 --> 00:28:48,312
边狱是未受洗礼的小孩去的
that limbo's only for children who haven't been baptized.

495
00:28:48,647 --> 00:28:51,283
我已受过洗礼
And I have!

496
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,318
亚伯拉罕将炭木
And Abraham took the wood

497
00:28:54,353 --> 00:28:58,483
置予儿子以撒的身上
of the burnt offering and laid it upon lsaac his son.

498
00:28:58,557 --> 00:29:02,425
他手持火把与利刃
And he took the fire in his hand and a knife

499
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:04,622
两人一起离去
and they went, both of them together.

500
00:29:04,663 --> 00:29:07,689
以撒对亚伯拉罕说
And lsaac spake unto Abraham his father

501
00:29:07,733 --> 00:29:09,792
"我父啊"
and said, 'My father'

502
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:13,430
他回道:"我在  孩子"
and he said, "Here I am, my son,"

503
00:29:28,754 --> 00:29:30,415
去看过尼古拉斯吗?
Did you look in on Nicholas?

504
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:31,751
是的  太太
Yes, ma'am.

505
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,281
他如小天使般睡着了
The little angel is fast asleep.

506
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,725
安呢?
What about Anne?

507
00:29:36,762 --> 00:29:38,423
还在楼梯上?
Is she still on the stairs?

508
00:29:38,463 --> 00:29:41,330
是的  太太
Oh, yes, ma'am.

509
00:29:41,366 --> 00:29:43,066
我倒是想看着她
I'd prefer to have her where I can see her

510
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:46,532
但那里光线太暗无法刺绣
but I can't embroider in such poor light.

511
00:29:49,608 --> 00:29:51,439
还要惩罚多久?
How long is this punishment going to go on?

512
00:29:51,476 --> 00:29:53,467
已经有三天了
It's been three days now.

513
00:29:53,512 --> 00:29:55,070
这要取决于她了
It's up to her.

514
00:29:57,149 --> 00:29:58,676
她必须懂得收敛嚣气
She's got to learn to swallow her pride

515
00:29:58,676 --> 00:30:01,318
低头认错
and ask for forgiveness.

516
00:30:01,353 --> 00:30:04,186
而且也是时候读读圣经了
Anyway, it's time she started to read the Bible.

517
00:30:05,622 --> 00:30:08,484
神父知道了会很高兴的
The priest will be very pleased to hear that, ma'am.

518
00:30:08,484 --> 00:30:10,361
他能上门一次就好了
If he ever deigns to pay us another visit.

519
00:30:10,361 --> 00:30:12,889
他明知孩子们不能出门
He knows perfectly well that the children can't go out.

520
00:30:12,931 --> 00:30:13,996
昨天他说了
He told me yesterday

521
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:17,199
他会尽快登门造访
he'd be by as soon as possible.

522
00:30:17,235 --> 00:30:21,103
我渐渐觉得完全与世隔绝
I'm beginning to feel totally cut off from the world.

523
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:24,006
尤其是这片迷雾
This fog doesn't exactly help.

524
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:25,703
如此之久都未散去
It's never lasted this long before.

525
00:30:25,744 --> 00:30:27,505
没错  太太
Oh, that's true, ma'am.

526
00:30:27,505 --> 00:30:30,210
连海鸥都销声匿迹了
Even the seagulls have gone quiet.

527
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:35,046
安!
Anne!

528
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,782
安  我听不到你读书
Anne, I can't hear you.

529
00:30:42,127 --> 00:30:43,355
米尔丝太太  坦白地说
Incidentally, Mrs. Mills,

530
00:30:43,395 --> 00:30:44,419
我真受不了
I've had to put up with the noise

531
00:30:44,463 --> 00:30:46,488
丽蒂亚在楼上大声走动
of Lydia running around above my head.

532
00:30:46,532 --> 00:30:48,295
她走来走去
She's been hurtling backwards and forwards

533
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,164
吵得就像有三个人
as if there were three of her.

534
00:30:50,202 --> 00:30:51,999
请你告诉她
Would you kindly tell her it's not necessary

535
00:30:52,037 --> 00:30:53,265
清洁不必如此
to kick up quite such a rumpus

536
00:30:53,305 --> 00:30:54,772
兴师动众
just to do a little cleaning?

537
00:30:54,807 --> 00:30:57,742
我不想头痛又再发作
I couldn't bear to get another migraine attack.

538
00:30:57,776 --> 00:30:59,505
我会告诉她  太太
I'll tell her, ma'am.

539
00:31:00,545 --> 00:31:01,604
谢谢
Thank you.

540
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:50,557
她太过份了
Now she's really gone too far.

541
00:31:50,596 --> 00:31:53,622
丽蒂亚!  丽蒂亚!
Lydia! Lydia!

542
00:32:13,385 --> 00:32:16,377
能看见上帝之巅
in the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.

543
00:32:16,455 --> 00:32:18,047
然后上帝的天使...
And the angel of the Lord...

544
00:32:18,123 --> 00:32:19,681
楼上怎么了?
What's going on up there?

545
00:32:19,758 --> 00:32:22,283
没事  妈妈  我在念书
Nothing, Mummy. I'm just reading.

546
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:26,661
-你听到吗?  -听到什么?
-Did you hear it as well?  -Hear what?

547
00:32:30,702 --> 00:32:32,162
然后上帝的天使
And the angel of the Lord

548
00:32:32,162 --> 00:32:34,168
再次呼唤亚伯拉罕入天堂
called unto Abraham out of Heaven

549
00:32:34,206 --> 00:32:36,071
并说道,
the second time and said,

550
00:32:36,108 --> 00:32:39,042
以我名义已发誓忠奉上帝...
By myself, I have sworn, saith the Lord...

551
00:32:50,655 --> 00:32:51,652
是什么?
What was that?

552
00:32:51,652 --> 00:32:52,757
不知道
I don't know.

553
00:32:53,091 --> 00:32:56,227
安  告诉我谁在弄响声
Anne, tell me who's making that noise.

554
00:32:56,261 --> 00:32:58,390
我不能告诉你  妈妈
I can't tell you, Mummy.

555
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,294
告诉我
You tell me.

556
00:33:00,332 --> 00:33:02,197
我说过有人在房间里
I told you there was someone in the room

557
00:33:02,234 --> 00:33:03,963
你就惩罚我
and you punished me.

558
00:33:04,002 --> 00:33:05,299
要我怎么说
Now I don't know what to say.

559
00:33:05,337 --> 00:33:08,773
安  告诉我真相
Anne, I want the truth.

560
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:11,573
告诉我楼上有没有人
Tell me if there is someone upstairs.

561
00:33:13,845 --> 00:33:15,775
在杂物房间里
There. In that junk room.

562
00:34:05,563 --> 00:34:07,523
妈咪  你让光照进来了
Mummy, you're letting the light in.

563
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:10,621
-是个女的  -是什么?
-She's a woman,  -She's what?

564
00:35:34,552 --> 00:35:35,414
他们去哪里了?
Where did they go?

565
00:35:35,487 --> 00:35:37,914
刚经过  你没看见吗?
They just came past here. Didn't you see them?

566
00:35:37,914 --> 00:35:39,281
往哪里去了?
Which way did they go?

567
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:42,759
那里  那里  还有下面
Over there, over there, and down there as well.

568
00:35:48,966 --> 00:35:52,400
到处都有  他们说屋子是他们的
They're everywhere. They say this house is theirs.

569
00:35:52,437 --> 00:35:56,100
还说要把窗帘都拆下
And they're going to take the curtains down as well.

570
00:35:57,642 --> 00:35:59,669
太太  请镇静
Ma'am, stay calm, please.

571
00:35:59,669 --> 00:36:01,071
我无法镇静
I will not stay calm!

572
00:36:01,071 --> 00:36:02,577
沦陷的五年来
For five whole years during the occupation

573
00:36:02,614 --> 00:36:05,508
我阻止了纳粹踏入这间屋子
I managed to avoid a single Nazi stepping foot in this house

574
00:36:05,508 --> 00:36:09,117
现在居然有人在这里擅自出入
and now there is someone here, opening and closing the doors.

575
00:36:09,154 --> 00:36:11,354
太太  这已是老房子
Ma'am, this is a very old house.

576
00:36:11,389 --> 00:36:14,481
地板水管时常会有响声
The floorboards squeak and the plumbing clanks.

577
00:36:14,481 --> 00:36:16,024
分明是说话声
There were voices. I'm telling you.

578
00:36:16,061 --> 00:36:18,889
-妈妈  你看  -有男孩和两个女人在说话
-Mummy, look!  -A boy and two women, talking together.

579
00:36:18,889 --> 00:36:20,823
妈妈  你看
Mummy, look!

580
00:36:22,534 --> 00:36:24,593
我昨天画的
I did it yesterday.

581
00:36:24,636 --> 00:36:26,331
这是父亲  母亲
This is the father, this is the mother,

582
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:29,738
维克多  还有老妇人
this is Victor, and this is the old woman.

583
00:36:29,775 --> 00:36:31,675
这些数字是什么意思?
What do these numbers stand for?

584
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,940
是我看见他们的次数
That's the number of times I've seen them.

585
00:36:33,979 --> 00:36:36,447
老妇人最常见
I've seen the old woman the most.

586
00:36:40,886 --> 00:36:42,786
噢  我的天
Oh, God in Heaven.

587
00:36:42,821 --> 00:36:44,820
米尔丝太太  去叫特德先生  告诉他
Mrs. Mills, go and call Mr. Tuttle. Tell him

588
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,690
我们要立刻搜屋
we have to search the whole house immediately

589
00:36:46,725 --> 00:36:47,692
天黑前必须搜清楚
before it gets dark.

590
00:36:47,759 --> 00:36:50,057
-是的  太太  这就去  -妈咪!
-Yes, ma'am. There, now.  -Mummy!

591
00:36:50,095 --> 00:36:51,357
宝贝  别怕
Yes, darling. It's all right.

592
00:36:51,396 --> 00:36:54,661
妈妈会保护你们
Nothing will happen to you while Mummy's here.

593
00:36:54,699 --> 00:36:57,930
妈妈  我真的好害怕
Look, Mummy, She really scares me.

594
00:36:57,969 --> 00:36:59,027
看起来她没在看你
It's as if she's not looking at you,

595
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,594
其实她盯着你
but she can see you.

596
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:03,574
整天都在说  "跟我来"
And she's always around saying "Come with me".

597
00:37:03,608 --> 00:37:05,371
安  别对我说谎
No, Anne, don't lie to me.

598
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:08,072
我没说谎  她还问这问那
Honestly, Mummy, and she asks me things.

599
00:37:08,113 --> 00:37:10,104
维克多说她是巫婆
Victor told me she's a witch.

600
00:37:10,148 --> 00:37:11,513
问你什么?
What does she ask you?

601
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:13,517
什么都问
Things.

602
00:37:15,153 --> 00:37:18,281
她呼吸散发臭味
Her breath smells.

603
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:23,654
必须拉开所有窗帘
We have to open all the curtains.

604
00:37:23,654 --> 00:37:26,061
搜遍每一个昏暗角落
I don't want any dark corners where someone could hide.

605
00:37:26,061 --> 00:37:27,094
是的  太太
Yes, ma'am.

606
00:37:27,132 --> 00:37:28,190
你们两个搜右面
You both search the right side

607
00:37:28,233 --> 00:37:29,530
我搜左面
and I'll take the left.

608
00:37:29,568 --> 00:37:31,433
然后上楼搜
Then we'll search upstairs.

609
00:38:42,574 --> 00:38:44,474
也许他们是鬼
Perhaps they're ghosts

610
00:38:44,509 --> 00:38:46,670
从前就住在这屋子
who lived in this house before.

611
00:38:46,711 --> 00:38:49,339
别犯傻  告诉过你
Don't be stupid. I've already told you.

612
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,847
鬼披着白布
Ghosts go about in white sheets

613
00:38:50,882 --> 00:38:53,612
戴着锁链  并且发出呜呜的声音
and carry chains and go "Ooo".

614
00:38:53,685 --> 00:38:54,947
安
Now, Anne.

615
00:38:55,019 --> 00:38:57,544
你为什么胡编故事?
Why do you make up such stories?

616
00:38:57,622 --> 00:38:59,647
不是编的  书上写的
I don't. I read them in books.

617
00:38:59,724 --> 00:39:01,589
你不可全信
Well, you shouldn't believe everything

618
00:39:01,626 --> 00:39:02,888
书上写的东西
that you read in books.

619
00:39:02,927 --> 00:39:04,417
妈妈也这么说
That's what our mother says.

620
00:39:04,462 --> 00:39:08,057
她说鬼故事都是垃圾
She says all this stuff about ghosts is rubbish

621
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:10,033
她要我们
and then she expects us

622
00:39:10,068 --> 00:39:12,298
相信圣经里写的东西
to believe everything written in the Bible.

623
00:39:12,337 --> 00:39:13,827
你信不信?
And don't you believe it?

624
00:39:13,872 --> 00:39:15,032
不可不信
I believe some things.

625
00:39:15,073 --> 00:39:17,439
但不可全信  比如不信
But, for example, I don't believe

626
00:39:17,475 --> 00:39:20,069
上帝七天创造了世界
that God made the world in seven days.

627
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:21,772
也不信诺亚方舟
And I don't believe that Noah

628
00:39:21,813 --> 00:39:24,043
能装载全部的动物
got all those animals into one boat

629
00:39:24,082 --> 00:39:26,676
不信圣灵是鸽子
or the Holy Spirit is a dove.

630
00:39:26,751 --> 00:39:29,015
对  我也不信
No, I don't believe that, either.

631
00:39:29,087 --> 00:39:30,782
鸽子根本不神圣
Doves are anything but holy.

632
00:39:30,855 --> 00:39:32,713
它们在窗台拉屎
They poo on our windows.

633
00:39:38,196 --> 00:39:42,193
和你妈妈说过这些吗?
Have you mentioned any of this to your mother?

634
00:39:46,004 --> 00:39:47,665
哦
Oh.

635
00:40:47,565 --> 00:40:49,531
太太
Ma'am.

636
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:51,228
什么事?
Yes?

637
00:40:51,669 --> 00:40:53,567
到处都搜过了  太太
They've searched everywhere, ma'am.

638
00:40:53,605 --> 00:40:55,095
没有人
There's no one.

639
00:40:55,139 --> 00:40:56,970
知道了
I see.

640
00:40:58,943 --> 00:41:01,741
米尔丝太太
Mrs. Mills.

641
00:41:01,779 --> 00:41:03,337
是的  太太
Yes, ma'am?

642
00:41:03,381 --> 00:41:06,282
你对这个有何见解?
Do you have any idea what this might be?

643
00:41:08,253 --> 00:41:10,221
是本相册  太太
This is a photograph album, ma'am.

644
00:41:10,255 --> 00:41:11,745
看  他们都睡着了
No, but look. They're all asleep.

645
00:41:11,823 --> 00:41:13,848
看
Look.

646
00:41:13,925 --> 00:41:16,621
他们不是在睡觉  是死了
They're not asleep, ma'am. They're dead.

647
00:41:18,363 --> 00:41:20,125
这是本遗照相册
This is a book of the dead.

648
00:41:20,164 --> 00:41:22,064
在上个世纪
In the last century, I believe

649
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,000
人死后通常被拍成遗照
they used to take photographs of the dead

650
00:41:24,035 --> 00:41:25,935
以期待他们的灵魂
in the hopes that their souls

651
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:28,803
能得以续存于世
would go on living through the portraits.

652
00:41:31,609 --> 00:41:33,907
甚至有集体照
There are even group portraits.

653
00:41:33,945 --> 00:41:36,937
还有小孩
And children!

654
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:39,779
噢  太可怕了
Oh, it's macabre!

655
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:44,147
怎么会如此迷信?
How could these people be so superstitious?

656
00:41:44,222 --> 00:41:46,588
失去亲人的悲情
Grief over the death of a loved one

657
00:41:46,624 --> 00:41:50,754
会令人做出不可思议的事
can lead people to do the strangest things.

658
00:41:54,032 --> 00:41:57,160
扔掉它  别留在屋里
Get rid of it, I don't want it in the house.

659
00:41:57,201 --> 00:41:59,066
是的  太太
Yes, ma'am

660
00:42:11,214 --> 00:42:12,283
米尔丝太太  这里很冷
Mrs. Mills, it's cold.

661
00:42:12,283 --> 00:42:14,474
何不坐过来取暖?
Why don't you come and sit by the fire?

662
00:42:26,497 --> 00:42:29,128
太谢谢了  太太
Thank you very much, ma'am.

663
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:33,126
说说你以前在这里干活的事
So tell me about when you worked here before.

664
00:42:33,171 --> 00:42:35,306
也要照看小孩吗?
Did you have to look after children then?

665
00:42:35,306 --> 00:42:39,834
不  我只负责管家
No, I was in charge of organizing the housework.

666
00:42:39,877 --> 00:42:42,737
嗯  有很多佣人吗?
Hmm. Were there many servants?

667
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,512
大概有十五个
Oh, about fifteen.

668
00:42:46,784 --> 00:42:47,676
不过最后
Though in the end

669
00:42:47,676 --> 00:42:50,113
只剩下我们三个
there were just the three of us left.

670
00:42:50,188 --> 00:42:51,519
为什么?
Why?

671
00:42:51,556 --> 00:42:53,820
主人搬到伦敦去了
My employers moved to London.

672
00:42:53,858 --> 00:42:57,817
他们渐渐就不常来了
They came here less and less,

673
00:42:57,862 --> 00:42:59,955
没了以前那么热闹
it being so out of the way like.

674
00:42:59,998 --> 00:43:04,067
屋子就这样被空置了
So gradually the house just became empty.

675
00:43:05,202 --> 00:43:08,037
大家最终都离开这个岛
Everybody ends up leaving this damned island.

676
00:43:09,973 --> 00:43:12,572
1940年夏  我家人也走了
My family left in the summer of 1940

677
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,546
就在沦陷之前
just before the invasion.

678
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,310
此后再也没有音讯
That was the last I've heard of them.

679
00:43:20,351 --> 00:43:21,875
噢
Ohh.

680
00:43:23,054 --> 00:43:25,716
我不责怪他们
I don't blame them.

681
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:29,351
其实我们也走了
Actually, we left, too.

682
00:43:29,394 --> 00:43:31,089
但你知道
Although, you know,

683
00:43:31,129 --> 00:43:33,256
有时即使是人走了
sometimes when you leave a place

684
00:43:33,297 --> 00:43:37,791
心还是一直在
it's like it's there with you all the time.

685
00:43:37,835 --> 00:43:41,566
我总觉得从未离开过这间屋
I always felt like I never left this house.

686
00:43:41,606 --> 00:43:42,836
你为什么要走?
Why did you leave?

687
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:46,207
是因为肺结核肆虐
Oh, it was on account of the tuberculosis.

688
00:43:46,244 --> 00:43:49,475
全区都被疏散了
The whole area was evacuated.

689
00:43:49,514 --> 00:43:51,982
噢
Ohh.

690
00:43:52,016 --> 00:43:54,177
丽蒂亚因此变成哑巴了?
Was that when Lydia went dumb?

691
00:43:54,252 --> 00:43:57,244
我想是的
Yes, I think so

692
00:43:57,321 --> 00:44:01,155
不过近来我的记性不太好
though my memory's a bit rusty these days, ma'am.

693
00:44:01,192 --> 00:44:02,819
她发生什么事了?
What happened to her?

694
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:11,158
有一天她突然
It was suddenly one day,

695
00:44:11,202 --> 00:44:15,161
不再说话了
she just stopped talking.

696
00:44:15,206 --> 00:44:18,403
必定有原因
There must've been a reason.

697
00:44:18,443 --> 00:44:20,707
不会莫名其妙变哑巴
People don't just stop talking.

698
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:22,269
一定是受到什么
These things are always the result

699
00:44:22,313 --> 00:44:25,476
精神刺激之类的事
of some sort of trauma.

700
00:44:25,516 --> 00:44:27,609
肯定发生了一些事
Something must've happened to her.

701
00:44:31,923 --> 00:44:33,618
主人对你们好吗?
Did your employers treat you well?

702
00:44:33,658 --> 00:44:35,626
他们对我们很好
Oh, they were always very kind to us.

703
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,720
视我们如同一家人
They treated us just like family.

704
00:44:41,032 --> 00:44:44,031
太太  我该去休息了
You know, ma'am, I think I will go to bed.

705
00:44:44,031 --> 00:44:47,132
否则明天不能早起
I'll never be able to get up in the morning.

706
00:44:47,171 --> 00:44:48,729
去吧
Off you go.

707
00:44:48,773 --> 00:44:50,638
我想一个人再坐会儿
I'm going to stay here a while longer.

708
00:44:50,675 --> 00:44:52,472
好  太太
Yes, ma'am.

709
00:45:26,511 --> 00:45:30,174
妈妈对你太严格了
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

710
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,888
原谅妈妈好吗?
Can you forgive me?

711
00:45:44,529 --> 00:45:46,121
安
Anne.

712
00:46:05,149 --> 00:46:06,343
妈咪
Mummy.

713
00:46:06,417 --> 00:46:07,475
怎么了?
What?

714
00:46:07,552 --> 00:46:09,986
爸爸几时回来?
When's Daddy coming home?

715
00:46:10,021 --> 00:46:13,115
打完仗就回来
When the war's over.

716
00:46:13,191 --> 00:46:15,751
他为什么去打仗?
Why did he go to war?

717
00:46:15,793 --> 00:46:19,957
没有人欺负我们的
I mean, nobody's done anything bad to us.

718
00:46:19,997 --> 00:46:22,124
爸爸去...
Daddy went...

719
00:46:24,835 --> 00:46:28,703
是因为他很勇敢
Daddy went because he's very brave

720
00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:31,264
因为他不愿意
and because he wasn't prepared

721
00:46:31,309 --> 00:46:34,642
屈服听从德国人
to let the Germans tell him what he had to do.

722
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:36,374
为什么?
Why?

723
00:46:44,288 --> 00:46:47,621
查尔斯
Charles,

724
00:46:47,658 --> 00:46:49,626
你在哪里?
where are you?

725
00:49:37,461 --> 00:49:40,362
米尔丝太太!
Mrs. Mills!

726
00:49:40,398 --> 00:49:42,263
米尔丝太太!
Mrs. Mills!

727
00:49:43,534 --> 00:49:45,058
什么事?  太太
What's the matter, ma'am?

728
00:49:45,102 --> 00:49:47,696
快给我音乐室的锁匙
The key to the music room, give it to me!

729
00:49:47,738 --> 00:49:48,705
快点!
Quickly!

730
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:49,706
怎么了?
What's happening, ma'am?

731
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,367
快点!
Come on!

732
00:50:00,184 --> 00:50:02,675
噢  天哪
Oh, my God.

733
00:50:02,753 --> 00:50:04,550
噢!
Ohh!

734
00:50:04,588 --> 00:50:07,557
我亲自查过房间
I checked that room myself.

735
00:50:09,627 --> 00:50:11,561
里面没有人
It was empty.

736
00:50:11,595 --> 00:50:13,862
吃点药片  太太
Take these tablets, ma'am.

737
00:50:13,862 --> 00:50:15,664
-但...  -对你身体有益
-And yet...  -They'll do you good.

738
00:50:15,664 --> 00:50:18,603
我感到那里确实有人
I felt as if there was someone else there.

739
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:22,869
不是人类
And it wasn't human.

740
00:50:23,407 --> 00:50:26,638
屋里有东西
There is something in this house.

741
00:50:26,677 --> 00:50:28,577
不祥之物
Something diabolic.

742
00:50:28,612 --> 00:50:30,102
太太
Ma'am.

743
00:50:30,147 --> 00:50:33,139
那是尚未...
Something which is not...

744
00:50:34,952 --> 00:50:37,648
尚未得到安息的冤魂
not at rest.

745
00:50:40,891 --> 00:50:43,553
我知道你不相信
I know you don't believe it.

746
00:50:43,594 --> 00:50:46,222
你不信的  对吗?
You don't believe it, do you?

747
00:50:46,263 --> 00:50:47,696
我不责怪你
I don't blame you.

748
00:50:47,731 --> 00:50:51,827
以前我也不信
I used to not believe these things.

749
00:50:53,037 --> 00:50:56,632
我相信  太太
I do believe it, ma'am.

750
00:50:58,108 --> 00:51:01,271
我一直都相信这些事
I've always believed in those things.

751
00:51:01,312 --> 00:51:03,576
虽然难以说清
They're not easy to explain,

752
00:51:03,614 --> 00:51:05,445
但确实存在
but they do happen.

753
00:51:05,483 --> 00:51:10,284
幽灵的故事
We've all heard stories of the beyond

754
00:51:10,354 --> 00:51:12,448
我们时有所闻
now and then,

755
00:51:13,524 --> 00:51:20,521
我想有时阴界
and I think sometimes the world of the dead

756
00:51:20,564 --> 00:51:24,295
会和阳界交错在一起
gets mixed up with the world of the living.

757
00:51:25,935 --> 00:51:27,395
这不可能
But it's impossible.

758
00:51:27,438 --> 00:51:29,838
上帝绝不允许这种异事
The Lord would never allow such an aberration.

759
00:51:29,874 --> 00:51:30,932
活人和死人
The living and the dead

760
00:51:30,975 --> 00:51:35,071
只有在终世审判时才相会
will only meet at the end of eternity.

761
00:51:36,112 --> 00:51:37,842
圣经是这么写的
It says so in the Bible.

762
00:51:37,882 --> 00:51:40,373
太太
Ma'am,

763
00:51:40,451 --> 00:51:45,252
不是所有事都有合理解释
there isn't always an answer for everything.

764
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,329
太太您要上哪里?
Where are you off to, ma'am?

765
00:51:58,369 --> 00:52:01,167
我要去村庄拜访迈格拉神父
I'm going to the village to pay Father McGraw a visit.

766
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:03,435
他不愿来  我就上门
If he won't come here, then I shall go to him.

767
00:52:03,474 --> 00:52:04,668
我要带他来这里
I shall bring him back.

768
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:06,235
太太您应该等天气变好
Ma'am, you should wait till the weather improves.

769
00:52:06,235 --> 00:52:08,674
我等得太久了
I've waited long enough.

770
00:52:08,712 --> 00:52:11,342
太太  神父告诉我...
Ma'am, the priest told me that...

771
00:52:11,342 --> 00:52:13,142
我不管他告诉你什么
I don't care what he told you!

772
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:15,310
我要他亲自告诉我
I want him to tell me personally!

773
00:52:15,386 --> 00:52:16,944
他今天一定得来
He must come today!

774
00:52:17,021 --> 00:52:18,818
那你打算怎么说?
But what are you going to tell him?

775
00:52:18,856 --> 00:52:21,620
我们搜遍了整间屋子
That we have searched every room inch by inch,

776
00:52:21,959 --> 00:52:24,321
现在需要他的祈福
and now I need them to be blessed.

777
00:52:25,963 --> 00:52:27,858
太太  请等等
Ma'am, please, wait.

778
00:52:27,898 --> 00:52:29,298
现在太早了
Still, it's very early.

779
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:31,597
-特德先生  -早安  太太
-Mr. Tuttle.  -Morning, ma'am.

780
00:52:31,635 --> 00:52:34,661
我要你在花园里找墓碑
I need you to search the garden for gravestones.

781
00:52:34,705 --> 00:52:35,499
墓碑?
Gravestones?

782
00:52:35,499 --> 00:52:37,220
对  我先生买屋时
Yes. When my husband bought this house

783
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,237
我们听说这里有个小墓地
we were told there was a little cemetery.

784
00:52:39,276 --> 00:52:41,642
好像就在那里的树林里
I think it was over there, amongst the trees.

785
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:42,805
我没看见
I've not seen anything.

786
00:52:42,846 --> 00:52:46,043
仔细查  可能被遮住了
Check carefully. It could be overgrown.

787
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:47,000
好的  太太
Yes, ma'am.

788
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,751
看看是否有一家人葬在这里
I need to know if there was a family buried here

789
00:52:49,787 --> 00:52:52,449
是否有个叫维克多的男孩
and if they had a little boy Victor.

790
00:53:07,638 --> 00:53:10,903
她认为屋子里闹鬼
Now she thinks the house is haunted.

791
00:53:10,941 --> 00:53:13,808
让她出去安全吗?
Do you think it's safe to let her go?

792
00:53:13,844 --> 00:53:14,811
放心
Oh, don't worry.

793
00:53:14,845 --> 00:53:17,075
她在迷雾里走不远
The fog won't let her get very far.

794
00:53:17,114 --> 00:53:18,672
说得对  迷雾
Oh, yes, the fog.

795
00:53:18,716 --> 00:53:21,241
迷雾  没错
The fog, of course.

796
00:53:21,318 --> 00:53:22,910
你认为几时
And when do you think

797
00:53:22,987 --> 00:53:26,320
我们才该揭露真相?
we should bring all this out into the open?

798
00:53:26,357 --> 00:53:28,257
快了  特德先生
All in good time, Mr. Tuttle.

799
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,760
快了
All in good time.

800
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:33,456
说到真相
Speaking of which.

801
00:55:27,205 --> 00:55:29,639
查尔斯?
Charles?

802
00:55:29,674 --> 00:55:31,005
葛蕾丝?
Grace?

803
00:55:45,023 --> 00:55:48,459
你回来了  你回来了
You're here. You're here.

804
00:55:48,493 --> 00:55:50,654
他们说已经没希望了
They said there was no hope.

805
00:55:50,695 --> 00:55:53,892
他们叫我死心  说就当你死了
They said I should give you up for dead.

806
00:55:53,932 --> 00:55:56,492
他们口无遮拦
They say a lot of things.

807
00:56:00,905 --> 00:56:03,635
噢  谢谢
Oh, thank you.

808
00:56:03,675 --> 00:56:05,336
感谢上帝
Thank you, God.

809
00:56:05,376 --> 00:56:06,866
感谢上帝
Thank you, God.

810
00:56:06,945 --> 00:56:09,971
每晚我祈求上帝
Every night I prayed for this,

811
00:56:10,048 --> 00:56:12,539
让你平安归来
begging God to bring you back.

812
00:56:14,452 --> 00:56:16,818
让孩子重享天伦之乐
Bring the children their father back.

813
00:56:16,855 --> 00:56:18,447
让他归来
Bring him.

814
00:56:20,859 --> 00:56:24,124
你究竟去了哪里?
But where have you been all this time?

815
00:56:24,162 --> 00:56:28,792
我一直在找回家的路
Out there looking for my home.

816
00:56:35,807 --> 00:56:38,833
你变了很多
You're so different.

817
00:56:38,877 --> 00:56:40,970
变了很多
So different.

818
00:56:41,045 --> 00:56:43,775
有时我会流血
Sometimes I bleed.

819
00:57:20,819 --> 00:57:22,480
太太
Ma'am.

820
00:57:24,488 --> 00:57:27,152
米尔丝太太
Mrs. Mills,

821
00:57:28,193 --> 00:57:30,161
这位是我先生
this is my husband.

822
00:57:33,264 --> 00:57:36,028
真是幸会  先生
I'm very pleased to meet you, sir.

823
00:57:36,067 --> 00:57:38,092
他很虚弱
He's very weak.

824
00:57:38,136 --> 00:57:39,364
这边
Here.

825
00:57:41,906 --> 00:57:45,332
去准备热水澡和些干净衣服
I want you to prepare a hot bath and some clean clothes.

826
00:57:46,076 --> 00:57:47,274
再弄点吃的
And something to eat.

827
00:57:47,345 --> 00:57:49,870
这就去  太太
Right away, ma'am.

828
00:58:08,632 --> 00:58:10,523
我的小宝贝都好吗?
How are my little ones?

829
00:58:12,904 --> 00:58:13,832
爸爸!
Daddy!

830
00:58:16,941 --> 00:58:19,142
你怎么去了那么久?
Why did you take so long?

831
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:27,617
你好  尼古拉斯
Hello, Nicholas.

832
00:58:27,652 --> 00:58:28,880
我说了  是不是
I told you, you see.

833
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,683
我说了他会回来的
I told you he'd come back.

834
00:58:37,762 --> 00:58:39,696
你们乖不乖?
Have you both been well-behaved?

835
00:58:39,731 --> 00:58:41,392
我们很乖
We've been very good.

836
00:58:41,432 --> 00:58:42,922
听不听妈妈的话?
Have you been good to your mother?

837
00:58:42,967 --> 00:58:44,229
听
Very good.

838
00:58:44,269 --> 00:58:47,500
我们天天都为圣礼而学习
We study every day for our First Communion.

839
00:58:47,538 --> 00:58:51,167
爸爸  你杀了人吗?
Daddy, did you kill anyone?

840
00:58:56,147 --> 00:58:58,809
噢  他来了
Oh! Here he comes!

841
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,720
亲爱的  午餐准备好了
Darling, we've prepared lunch for you.

842
00:59:05,757 --> 00:59:08,021
你下来吃还是想...
Are you coming down or would you prefer...

843
00:59:20,505 --> 00:59:22,200
爸爸几时下来?
When's Daddy coming down?

844
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:26,199
别吵  安  爸爸不舒服
Be patient, Anne, Daddy is not well.

845
00:59:26,244 --> 00:59:28,635
他说见到很多死人
He said he'd seen a lot of dead men.

846
00:59:32,984 --> 00:59:35,949
妈咪  战争中死去的人
Mummy, when people die in the war,

847
00:59:35,987 --> 00:59:37,181
会去哪里?
where do they go?

848
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:39,155
问得真好
Oh, what a question.

849
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:42,956
-要看情况  -什么情况?
-It depends.  -On what?

850
00:59:42,994 --> 00:59:46,631
看他们为正义还是邪恶而战
Whether they fought on the side of the goodies or the baddies.

851
00:59:46,631 --> 00:59:49,225
你们的爸爸为英国而战
Your father, for example, fought for England

852
00:59:49,267 --> 00:59:51,394
是正义的一方
on the side of the goodies.

853
00:59:53,237 --> 00:59:55,831
怎么知道谁是正义谁是邪恶?
How do you know who the goodies and the baddies are?

854
00:59:56,874 --> 00:59:58,739
问得太多了  快吃
That's enough questions. Eat your food.

855
00:59:58,776 --> 01:00:00,437
你不用去打仗
You'll never go to war.

856
01:00:00,511 --> 01:00:02,479
我们哪里也去不了
We'll never go anywhere.

857
01:00:04,782 --> 01:00:07,751
不出去没什么关系
You're not missing out on anything.

858
01:00:07,785 --> 01:00:10,447
在家里和爸爸妈妈一起最开心
You're much better off at home with your Mummy and Daddy

859
01:00:10,488 --> 01:00:12,353
他们最疼爱你们
who love you very, very much.

860
01:00:14,325 --> 01:00:15,690
还有不速之客
And the intruders.

861
01:00:17,762 --> 01:00:19,930
这里没不速之客
There are no intruders here.

862
01:00:20,264 --> 01:00:22,091
但你说过有的
But you said that there were.

863
01:00:22,133 --> 01:00:23,600
不  我说没有
No, I said that there are no intruders here.

864
01:00:23,634 --> 01:00:25,568
不要再为这事争执了
I don't want to hear another word on the subject.

865
01:00:25,603 --> 01:00:28,163
-但你说...  -够了!
-But you said...  -That is enough!

866
01:00:28,606 --> 01:00:30,640
我不能说话吗?
Can I say something?

867
01:00:30,675 --> 01:00:31,699
-不能!  -为什么?
-No!  -Why not?

868
01:00:31,743 --> 01:00:34,371
因为  你不能!
Because you can't!

869
01:00:40,984 --> 01:00:42,618
安  不要那样呼吸
Anne, stop breathing like that.

870
01:00:45,322 --> 01:00:46,583
听到吗  停止!
You heard me, Stop it!

871
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:52,028
停止呼吸
Stop breathing.

872
01:00:54,532 --> 01:00:56,124
好  进你房间去
Right, you go to your room.

873
01:00:56,167 --> 01:01:00,160
进房间  今天你没甜点吃
Go to your room. No dessert for you today.

874
01:01:04,008 --> 01:01:08,206
不要哭  不要哭
Ohh, no crying now, no crying.

875
01:01:08,279 --> 01:01:10,247
别哭了
Oh, stop that here.

876
01:01:10,314 --> 01:01:13,750
看你哭起来变成丑八怪了
Look what an awful face you've got when you cry.

877
01:01:13,818 --> 01:01:14,785
我不管
I don't care!

878
01:01:14,852 --> 01:01:17,412
那里  还有那里
There, there.

879
01:01:17,455 --> 01:01:20,788
听我说
You listen to me.

880
01:01:20,825 --> 01:01:23,191
我也见过他们
I've seen them, too.

881
01:01:23,827 --> 01:01:25,422
真的?
You have?

882
01:01:26,463 --> 01:01:27,632
是
Yes.

883
01:01:27,632 --> 01:01:29,226
何不告诉我妈妈
Why don't you tell my mother?

884
01:01:29,267 --> 01:01:30,791
她就会信我
Then maybe she'll believe me.

885
01:01:30,835 --> 01:01:33,963
有些事你妈妈听不进去
There are things your mother doesn't want to hear.

886
01:01:34,005 --> 01:01:37,031
她只相信书本上的东西
She only believes in what she was taught.

887
01:01:37,075 --> 01:01:41,774
但是放心  迟早
But don't worry, sooner or later,

888
01:01:41,846 --> 01:01:43,871
她会见到他们
she'll see them.

889
01:01:43,948 --> 01:01:46,109
然后一切都会改变
Then everything will be different.

890
01:01:46,184 --> 01:01:49,085
怎样改?
How?

891
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,452
到时你就知道了
Oh, you'll see.

892
01:01:51,489 --> 01:01:55,220
会有出乎意料的事
There are going to be some big surprises.

893
01:01:55,259 --> 01:01:59,923
会有大改变
There are going to be changes.

894
01:01:59,964 --> 01:02:01,932
改变?
Changes?

895
01:02:13,444 --> 01:02:17,081
现在她装得若无其事
Now she's behaving as if nothing had happened.

896
01:02:17,915 --> 01:02:20,247
她女儿呢?
What about her daughter?

897
01:02:20,284 --> 01:02:22,514
她不太固执
Oh, she's not so stubborn.

898
01:02:22,553 --> 01:02:25,050
小孩比较容易哄骗
The children will be easier to convince.

899
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:30,018
问题是母亲比较棘手
No, it's the mother who's going to cause us problems.

900
01:02:30,862 --> 01:02:34,798
她的丈夫起疑心吗?
Do you think her husband suspects anything?

901
01:02:34,832 --> 01:02:39,599
不  他根本不知道身在何处
No. I don't think he even knows where he is.

902
01:02:54,018 --> 01:02:58,512
啊  我的女儿真漂亮
Ohh, look what a pretty daughter I've got.

903
01:03:00,258 --> 01:03:04,524
妈妈特地为你缝了面纱
Mummy made this veil especially for you.

904
01:03:05,563 --> 01:03:07,292
我像个新娘
I look like a bride.

905
01:03:08,533 --> 01:03:11,661
是  说得对
Yes. You do.

906
01:03:15,973 --> 01:03:19,002
袖子要改短些
I need to shorten the sleeves a little.

907
01:03:19,043 --> 01:03:20,469
脱下来吧
You can take it off now.

908
01:03:20,469 --> 01:03:21,438
不
No.

909
01:03:21,512 --> 01:03:23,673
这是受圣礼穿的  要洁白无瑕
This dress has to be spotless for your First Communion.

910
01:03:23,748 --> 01:03:25,215
我不会弄脏的
I promise I won't dirty it.

911
01:03:25,283 --> 01:03:28,275
再让我穿一会儿
Just let me wear it for a little longer. Just a little.

912
01:03:28,352 --> 01:03:30,820
噢  就一会?
Oh, just a little?

913
01:03:30,855 --> 01:03:35,519
好吧  我马上回来
All right. I'll be back shortly.

914
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,960
别坐在地上或蹭到墙上
No sitting on the floor or leaning against the walls.

915
01:03:37,995 --> 01:03:39,292
不会的
No.

916
01:03:55,379 --> 01:03:58,348
先生  能赏面跳只舞吗?
Monsieur, would you like to dance?

917
01:04:00,985 --> 01:04:03,044
荣幸之至
I'd love to.

918
01:04:26,077 --> 01:04:28,222
查尔斯  不要再这样
Charles, you can't go on like this.

919
01:04:28,222 --> 01:04:31,279
你得吃点东西
You must eat something.

920
01:04:51,702 --> 01:04:55,263
天空
In the sky,

921
01:04:55,306 --> 01:05:00,266
不知晴或雨
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright.

922
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:06,015
眼中只得
But I only have eyes

923
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:10,851
爱人你一个
for you, dear.

924
01:05:10,888 --> 01:05:15,291
月亮不知圆或...
The moon may be high...

925
01:05:47,491 --> 01:05:49,491
安  现在脱下礼服
Anne, you need to take the dress off now.

926
01:05:53,697 --> 01:05:56,323
安  听见了吗?
Anne, are you listening to me?

927
01:05:58,135 --> 01:05:59,368
安?
Anne?

928
01:06:03,607 --> 01:06:06,303
我叫你不要坐在地上
What did I tell you about sitting on the floor?

929
01:06:06,344 --> 01:06:07,709
地上很干净
But it's clean.

930
01:06:07,778 --> 01:06:09,040
干净又怎样
It makes no difference.

931
01:06:09,113 --> 01:06:11,980
你怎么就这么不听话...
Why can't you ever do as you're told...

932
01:06:35,306 --> 01:06:36,864
怎么了?
What's the matter?

933
01:06:36,907 --> 01:06:39,068
我女儿呢?
Where is my daughter?

934
01:06:42,545 --> 01:06:44,673
你把我女儿怎么了?
What have you done with my daughter?

935
01:06:44,749 --> 01:06:48,582
你疯了?  我就是你女儿
Are you mad? I am your daughter.

936
01:06:49,153 --> 01:06:51,780
不  你不是我女儿
No! You're not my daughter!

937
01:06:52,523 --> 01:06:55,754
不!  不!
No! No!

938
01:06:56,861 --> 01:06:59,961
你不是我女儿!  不!
You're not my daughter! No!

939
01:07:00,698 --> 01:07:03,929
不!  啊!
No! Aah!

940
01:07:13,644 --> 01:07:15,339
太太  我听到尖叫声
Ma'am, I heard shouts.

941
01:07:15,413 --> 01:07:16,778
她要杀我!
She wants to kill me!

942
01:07:16,814 --> 01:07:19,408
她不杀死我们不罢休!
She won't stop until she kills us!

943
01:07:19,483 --> 01:07:21,474
她不会罢休!
She won't stop!

944
01:07:21,552 --> 01:07:23,076
好了  乖乖  跟我来
Hush, child. Come with me.

945
01:07:23,154 --> 01:07:25,554
你恶毒!  恶毒!  恶毒!
You're wicked! You're wicked! Wicked!

946
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:28,023
恶毒!
Wicked!

947
01:07:38,436 --> 01:07:40,063
她怎样了?
How is she?

948
01:07:40,104 --> 01:07:42,664
她无法平静
There's no calming her,

949
01:07:42,706 --> 01:07:44,630
我交给她爸爸安抚
so I've left her with her father.

950
01:07:45,476 --> 01:07:47,910
她坚持要和他说话
She insisted on speaking with him.

951
01:07:51,482 --> 01:07:54,418
发生什么事?  为什么打她?
What happened? Why did you fight?

952
01:07:54,418 --> 01:07:56,113
不是她
It wasn't her.

953
01:07:57,353 --> 01:08:00,415
是个有怪眼的老妇人
It was the old woman with the strange eyes.

954
01:08:00,415 --> 01:08:02,822
模仿我女儿的声音
She was imitating my daughter's voice.

955
01:08:02,822 --> 01:08:06,554
我向上帝发誓不是我女儿
I'd swear to God that it wasn't my daughter.

956
01:08:08,498 --> 01:08:12,399
噢  主啊  帮帮我
Oh, God. God help me.

957
01:08:12,436 --> 01:08:15,667
老天  我这是怎么了?
God help me. What's the matter with me?

958
01:08:15,706 --> 01:08:18,436
不知道我究竟怎么了
I don't know what's the matter with me.

959
01:08:18,476 --> 01:08:21,210
你要多休息
You must get more rest.

960
01:08:23,247 --> 01:08:27,775
别再为屋子烦劳操心了
You can't take on the whole responsibility of this house.

961
01:08:27,852 --> 01:08:29,410
让我们来
Leave it to us.

962
01:08:29,487 --> 01:08:31,819
我们知道该做什么
We know what has to be done.

963
01:08:35,092 --> 01:08:36,821
什么意思?
What do you mean by that?

964
01:08:38,395 --> 01:08:40,625
"知道做什么"是什么意思?
What do you mean you know what has to be done?

965
01:08:40,664 --> 01:08:42,495
没什么  我只不过建议...
Nothing, ma'am. I was just suggesting...

966
01:08:42,533 --> 01:08:45,434
没什么好建议的
There's nothing to suggest.

967
01:08:45,469 --> 01:08:46,936
你们懂什么?
Who do you think you are?

968
01:08:46,971 --> 01:08:48,905
你们不知该做什么
You have no idea what has to be done.

969
01:08:53,644 --> 01:08:55,236
或许知道?
Or do you?

970
01:08:58,682 --> 01:09:01,150
这是什么?
What are these?

971
01:09:03,254 --> 01:09:06,088
头痛药片  太太
The tablets for your migraine, ma'am.

972
01:09:07,124 --> 01:09:09,287
你一直服用的
The ones you always take.

973
01:09:09,826 --> 01:09:12,487
拜托了  我想静一静
Please, I need to be on my own.

974
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:15,090
是的  太太
Yes, ma'am.

975
01:09:38,722 --> 01:09:40,587
来  孩子
Come, child.

976
01:10:03,147 --> 01:10:05,707
安都告诉我了
Anne told me everything.

977
01:10:11,822 --> 01:10:15,087
我希望能解释  但办不到
I wish I had an explanation, but I haven't.

978
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:17,457
起初我以为屋里有人
At first, I thought there was someone else in the house.

979
01:10:17,494 --> 01:10:19,018
甚至想是鬼
Even thought there were ghosts.

980
01:10:19,063 --> 01:10:21,964
我要说的不是鬼的事
I'm not talking about the ghosts.

981
01:10:21,999 --> 01:10:25,025
是那天发生的事
I'm talking about what happened that day.

982
01:10:32,176 --> 01:10:33,973
我不懂你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

983
01:10:34,044 --> 01:10:36,012
告诉我那不是真的
Tell me it's not true.

984
01:10:36,046 --> 01:10:38,947
告诉我发生了什么
Tell me what happened.

985
01:10:38,983 --> 01:10:42,851
发生?
Happened?

986
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:49,648
我不知那天发生了什么
I don't know what came over me that day.

987
01:10:49,693 --> 01:10:53,459
佣人半夜都走了
The servants had left during the night.

988
01:10:53,497 --> 01:10:57,160
他们不敢当面和我说
Hadn't the courage to tell me to my face.

989
01:10:58,969 --> 01:11:05,204
他们知道我不会离开这屋子
They knew that I couldn't leave the house.

990
01:11:05,242 --> 01:11:09,736
他们知道的
They knew.

991
01:11:09,813 --> 01:11:12,611
安
Anne.

992
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:15,676
安  怎么了?
Anne, what happened?

993
01:11:17,554 --> 01:11:19,818
她打我
She hit me.

994
01:11:19,857 --> 01:11:23,327
她疯了  像那天一样
She went mad like she did that day.

995
01:11:23,962 --> 01:11:25,763
你还记得吗?
Do you remember?

996
01:11:27,497 --> 01:11:28,992
不
No.

997
01:11:30,933 --> 01:11:33,300
原谅我  查尔斯
You must forgive me, Charles.

998
01:11:34,338 --> 01:11:38,001
求孩子们原谅你吧
Not me. The children.

999
01:11:38,442 --> 01:11:41,534
他们知道我爱他们
They know that I love them.

1000
01:11:42,012 --> 01:11:44,081
不会伤害他们
They know I'd never hurt them.

1001
01:11:44,081 --> 01:11:46,447
我愿为他们而死
I'd die first.

1002
01:11:49,787 --> 01:11:51,551
你想做什么?
What are you going to do?

1003
01:11:53,089 --> 01:11:55,524
生我的气了?
Are you angry with me?

1004
01:11:58,328 --> 01:12:00,258
我回来只是想
I just came back to say good-bye

1005
01:12:00,258 --> 01:12:02,360
和妻儿道别
to my wife and children.

1006
01:12:02,999 --> 01:12:04,629
我得走了
Now I must go.

1007
01:12:05,268 --> 01:12:06,499
去哪里?
Go where?

1008
01:12:07,837 --> 01:12:09,335
去前线
To the front.

1009
01:12:09,373 --> 01:12:10,840
不  战争结束了
No. The war's over.

1010
01:12:12,574 --> 01:12:13,707
战争还没结束
The war is not over.

1011
01:12:13,777 --> 01:12:15,878
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

1012
01:12:17,214 --> 01:12:19,239
不要去  听到吗?
You're not going, do you hear me?

1013
01:12:19,316 --> 01:12:21,914
你已经丢下我们一次了  不能再去
You left us once already. You can't go!

1014
01:12:23,152 --> 01:12:24,621
为什么?
Why?

1015
01:12:24,688 --> 01:12:27,255
为什么你要去打仗?
Why did you have to go to that stupid war

1016
01:12:27,255 --> 01:12:30,059
打毫无意义的仗?
that had nothing to do with us?

1017
01:12:30,094 --> 01:12:33,063
你就不能像其他人一样留下?
Why couldn't you have stayed here like the others?

1018
01:12:33,097 --> 01:12:34,325
他们投降了
The others surrendered.

1019
01:12:34,364 --> 01:12:36,355
我们都投降了!
We all surrendered!

1020
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,733
全岛沦陷了!
The whole island was occupied!

1021
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:42,364
还有什么办法?
What did you expect?

1022
01:12:46,677 --> 01:12:50,044
你去打仗有何意义?
What were you trying to prove by going to war?

1023
01:12:50,114 --> 01:12:52,776
这里才是你的家
Your place was here with us.

1024
01:12:54,184 --> 01:12:56,550
和家人在一起
With your family.

1025
01:13:02,258 --> 01:13:03,217
我爱你
I loved you.

1026
01:13:05,262 --> 01:13:07,129
我够知足了
That was enough for me.

1027
01:13:08,165 --> 01:13:12,693
守着这片黑暗
Living in this darkness.

1028
01:13:12,736 --> 01:13:15,136
守着这个监狱
In this prison.

1029
01:13:17,874 --> 01:13:19,539
但你不满足
But not for you,

1030
01:13:21,478 --> 01:13:23,670
你不满足于我
I wasn't enough for you.

1031
01:13:24,348 --> 01:13:27,010
所以要离我而去
That's why you left.

1032
01:13:28,819 --> 01:13:31,083
打仗只是藉口
It wasn't just the war.

1033
01:13:34,024 --> 01:13:37,516
你想离开我  是不是?
You want to leave me, don't you?

1034
01:15:43,754 --> 01:15:44,948
安!
Anne!

1035
01:15:46,423 --> 01:15:48,050
尼古拉斯!
Nicholas!

1036
01:15:57,801 --> 01:16:00,201
怎么了?
What is it? What?

1037
01:16:05,642 --> 01:16:07,803
噢  天啊
Oh, my God!

1038
01:16:07,844 --> 01:16:11,371
这里  老天
Here! Oh, my God!

1039
01:16:17,754 --> 01:16:18,948
这边
Here!

1040
01:16:30,033 --> 01:16:31,967
窗帘呢?
Where are the curtains?

1041
01:16:36,673 --> 01:16:39,198
米尔丝太太
Mrs. Mills!

1042
01:16:53,991 --> 01:16:56,789
让我看看  让我看看
Let me see. Let me see.

1043
01:16:56,827 --> 01:16:58,818
噢  你没事的!
Oh, you're all right!

1044
01:16:58,862 --> 01:17:00,090
你没事的!
You're all right!

1045
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:03,725
我要爸爸
I want my daddy!

1046
01:17:07,504 --> 01:17:09,028
爸爸走了
Daddy's gone.

1047
01:17:09,072 --> 01:17:11,233
你骗我!
It's not true!

1048
01:17:11,274 --> 01:17:14,334
没骗你
Yes, it is.

1049
01:17:14,378 --> 01:17:16,778
是真的
It is true.

1050
01:17:18,148 --> 01:17:20,582
我爱你  妈妈
I love you, Mummy.

1051
01:17:27,991 --> 01:17:30,516
找回窗帘
Find the curtains.

1052
01:17:33,096 --> 01:17:35,223
是谁?
Who was it?

1053
01:17:35,265 --> 01:17:36,493
谁干的?
Who did this?

1054
01:17:36,533 --> 01:17:38,160
快说!
Tell me!

1055
01:17:38,201 --> 01:17:39,930
告诉我!
Tell me!

1056
01:17:41,905 --> 01:17:43,133
你知道这里发生了什么
You know what's happening here!

1057
01:17:43,173 --> 01:17:45,505
因为你也经历了!
You know because it happened to you, too!

1058
01:17:45,542 --> 01:17:47,703
告诉我
You'll tell me.

1059
01:17:47,778 --> 01:17:49,370
写下来
You write it down.

1060
01:17:49,446 --> 01:17:51,947
写下来  求你
Write it down! Please!

1061
01:17:51,947 --> 01:17:55,078
那种态度只会更坏事  太太
That attitude won't solve anything, ma'am.

1062
01:17:56,718 --> 01:17:58,482
何况她不会写字
Anyway, she can't write.

1063
01:17:58,482 --> 01:18:00,185
-在哪里?  -什么?
-Where are they?  -What?

1064
01:18:00,223 --> 01:18:01,622
窗帘!
The curtains!

1065
01:18:01,658 --> 01:18:04,525
孩子们赖以生存的窗帘
The curtains my children's lives depend on!

1066
01:18:04,561 --> 01:18:06,328
有人拆了窗帘!
Someone has taken the curtains!

1067
01:18:06,328 --> 01:18:07,360
我看到了  太太
I have noticed, ma'am.

1068
01:18:07,397 --> 01:18:10,491
不必这样大声叫唤
There's no need for you to raise your voice.

1069
01:18:10,534 --> 01:18:14,367
特德先生  我正想找你
Oh, Mr. Tuttle. I was just on the point of calling you.

1070
01:18:14,367 --> 01:18:17,897
你注意到有人拆了窗帘吗?
Did you know that someone has taken all the curtains?

1071
01:18:18,941 --> 01:18:21,240
窗帘?
The curtains?

1072
01:18:21,811 --> 01:18:22,902
噢  是啊
Oh, dear.

1073
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:27,372
怎么会有人要拆窗帘?
Why should anyone want to take all the curtains?

1074
01:18:28,451 --> 01:18:32,287
我想是想让日光照进来
To let some daylight into this house, I imagine.

1075
01:18:32,287 --> 01:18:34,618
日光  对啊
Daylight. Of course.

1076
01:18:34,658 --> 01:18:37,058
有人想害死我的孩子
Someone wants to kill my children.

1077
01:18:37,094 --> 01:18:39,892
为什么日光会害死他们?
Why do you think that the daylight would kill them?

1078
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:43,491
你疯了?
Are you mad?

1079
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:45,967
我告诉过你
I told you.

1080
01:18:46,402 --> 01:18:47,629
我已经说过
I already told you!

1081
01:18:47,671 --> 01:18:49,104
孩子对光线敏感
The children are photosensitive!

1082
01:18:49,139 --> 01:18:51,073
见光会死的!
The light will kill them!

1083
01:18:51,108 --> 01:18:53,599
是  那时从前
Yes, but that was before.

1084
01:18:53,643 --> 01:18:56,612
现在情形或许有所不同
The condition could have cleared up by itself.

1085
01:18:56,646 --> 01:18:59,244
不让日光照进来
If you never expose them to daylight

1086
01:18:59,244 --> 01:19:01,041
你怎么知道他们敏感?
how do you Know they're not cured?

1087
01:19:01,118 --> 01:19:05,919
我嫂子本来有严重风湿病
My sister-in-law had terrible attacks of rheumatism

1088
01:19:05,956 --> 01:19:08,186
在腿部和背部
in her legs and back.

1089
01:19:08,225 --> 01:19:11,023
后来有一天
Then one fine day

1090
01:19:12,429 --> 01:19:14,329
突然就治愈了
they disappeared.

1091
01:19:15,799 --> 01:19:17,596
我要找回窗帘
I am going to find those curtains

1092
01:19:17,634 --> 01:19:19,864
你们替我挂上之后
and when you have finished helping me hang them

1093
01:19:19,903 --> 01:19:21,928
请你们立刻走人
you will leave this house!

1094
01:19:35,285 --> 01:19:37,344
男主人怎么说?  太太
And what about the master, ma'am?

1095
01:19:37,387 --> 01:19:40,356
他有什么意见?
What has he got to say about all of this?

1096
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:42,551
把钥匙给我
Give me your keys.

1097
01:19:42,592 --> 01:19:44,457
快把钥匙给我!
I want your keys now!

1098
01:19:48,965 --> 01:19:51,160
我知道你们想干嘛
I know what you want.

1099
01:19:51,201 --> 01:19:52,828
你们想吓唬我们
You want to frighten us.

1100
01:19:52,869 --> 01:19:54,596
想把我和孩子都吓走
You want to get us out, me and my children.

1101
01:19:54,596 --> 01:19:55,935
由第一天起
You've wanted to take over this house

1102
01:19:55,935 --> 01:19:58,307
你们就想霸占这间屋子
ever since the first day you arrived.

1103
01:19:58,341 --> 01:20:02,477
现在把锁匙给我  一笔勾销
Now, you give me those keys. I will not ask again.

1104
01:20:02,477 --> 01:20:04,306
请你镇静点  太太
You should try and calm down, ma'am.

1105
01:20:04,306 --> 01:20:07,240
把锁匙给我!
Give me the keys.

1106
01:20:08,385 --> 01:20:09,818
快给我
Give them to me.

1107
01:20:16,193 --> 01:20:18,161
立刻滚出去
And now get out of here.

1108
01:20:36,178 --> 01:20:38,608
你怎么认为?  特德先生
You know something, Mr. Tuttle?

1109
01:20:38,982 --> 01:20:41,974
我已经是忍无可忍
I think I've reached the end of my tether.

1110
01:20:42,052 --> 01:20:43,713
你呢?
What about you?

1111
01:20:44,254 --> 01:20:48,521
完全同意
Oh, yes. Definitely.

1112
01:20:49,059 --> 01:20:52,586
是时候去揭开墓碑了
We'd better go and uncover the gravestones.

1113
01:21:31,434 --> 01:21:32,992
妈妈在做什么?
What's Mummy doing?

1114
01:21:33,036 --> 01:21:35,334
我告诉你了  她疯了
I've already told you. She's gone mad.

1115
01:21:35,372 --> 01:21:36,437
说谎
Liar.

1116
01:21:36,437 --> 01:21:41,904
-疯了!  疯了!  -说谎!  说谎!
-She's gone mad!  -Liar, liar!

1117
01:21:47,217 --> 01:21:49,208
九点
Nighttime.

1118
01:21:50,486 --> 01:21:51,777
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

1119
01:21:51,855 --> 01:21:53,015
我受够了
I've had enough.

1120
01:21:54,958 --> 01:21:57,453
我要去树林找爸爸
I'm going into the woods to look for Daddy.

1121
01:21:57,453 --> 01:21:59,855
你是想出走?
Are you going to run away?

1122
01:22:01,665 --> 01:22:03,057
如果我沿着水管向下爬
If I hang onto the pipe

1123
01:22:03,057 --> 01:22:04,995
就能到屋外院子里
I can climb down to the ground.

1124
01:22:05,035 --> 01:22:06,969
非常容易
It's very easy.

1125
01:22:20,317 --> 01:22:23,684
妈妈知道了  你就惨了
If Mummy finds out, you're in for it.

1126
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,984
好  好
Yes, yes, yes.

1127
01:22:35,332 --> 01:22:37,266
安  等等
Anne, wait!

1128
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,530
我也要去找爸爸
I want to come and look for Daddy, too.

1129
01:22:39,569 --> 01:22:42,902
说谎  你不敢一个人呆着
Liar. You just don't want to be left on your own.

1130
01:22:42,939 --> 01:22:44,497
胆小鬼  胆小鬼
Scaredy-pants, scaredy-pants!

1131
01:22:44,541 --> 01:22:45,803
住嘴!
Be quiet!

1132
01:23:39,929 --> 01:23:41,861
安  我们迷路了
Anne, I think we got lost.

1133
01:23:41,898 --> 01:23:45,026
我们还没出花园  笨蛋
We still haven't left the garden yet, silly.

1134
01:23:45,068 --> 01:23:49,061
-我害怕  -怕就不要跟来
-I'm scared.  -Shouldn't have come, then.

1135
01:23:52,142 --> 01:23:55,305
-说说话  -说什么?
-Say something.  -What shall I say?

1136
01:23:55,378 --> 01:23:57,676
不知道  说什么都行
I don't know. Anything.

1137
01:23:57,747 --> 01:24:00,746
我叫安  在走路
Let's see. My name is Anne and I'm walking.

1138
01:24:00,746 --> 01:24:03,109
在走路  我叫安
I'm walking and my name is Anne.

1139
01:24:30,146 --> 01:24:32,614
那里是什么?
What's that over there?

1140
01:24:33,650 --> 01:24:36,118
好像是墓地
I think they're graves.

1141
01:24:37,153 --> 01:24:38,745
不要过去!
Don't go near!

1142
01:24:38,788 --> 01:24:40,415
干嘛不?
Why not?

1143
01:24:40,457 --> 01:24:42,789
有鬼跳出来怎么办?
What if a ghost jumps out?

1144
01:24:42,826 --> 01:24:45,920
墓地没有鬼  只有骷髅
Graves don't have ghosts. Only skeletons.

1145
01:25:03,179 --> 01:25:04,544
上面有字
There's something written here.

1146
01:25:04,581 --> 01:25:06,014
走吧
Let's go!

1147
01:25:06,049 --> 01:25:08,483
等等
Wait!

1148
01:25:13,189 --> 01:25:14,936
"1891年12月"

1149
01:25:30,807 --> 01:25:33,499
安  写了什么?
Anne! What does it say?

1150
01:25:33,578 --> 01:25:34,875
"贝莎・米尔丝之墓 1829-1891"

1151
01:25:41,417 --> 01:25:43,578
你们要坚强些  孩子
You must be strong now, children.

1152
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:45,486
尼古拉斯  快来!
Nicholas, come here!

1153
01:25:46,022 --> 01:25:49,480
米尔丝  别告诉妈妈我们出走
Mrs. Mills, please don't tell Mummy we've run away.

1154
01:25:49,526 --> 01:25:50,788
不要和他们说话!
Don't speak to them!

1155
01:25:52,227 --> 01:25:52,818
为什么?
Why?

1156
01:25:52,862 --> 01:25:55,296
-他们是死人!  -什么?
-They're dead!  -What?

1157
01:25:55,331 --> 01:25:57,231
他们是鬼!  快过来!
They're ghosts! Please come here!

1158
01:25:57,867 --> 01:25:59,265
孩子!
Children!

1159
01:25:59,802 --> 01:26:01,502
尼古拉斯!
Nicholas!

1160
01:26:02,038 --> 01:26:03,301
他们是鬼?
They're ghosts?

1161
01:26:03,339 --> 01:26:05,999
他们怎么没披白布戴锁链?
Why aren't they wearing sheets and clanking chains?

1162
01:26:05,999 --> 01:26:06,669
你曾说过的...
You said that...

1163
01:26:06,669 --> 01:26:09,535
别管我说过什么  快点跑!
I don't care what I said! Get away from them!

1164
01:26:09,612 --> 01:26:12,638
你老是唬弄我骗我
You're always teasing me and telling lies

1165
01:26:12,715 --> 01:26:13,814
我受够了
and I'm sick of it!

1166
01:26:13,814 --> 01:26:16,680
我没唬弄你  我说真的
I'm not teasing you! I'm telling the truth!

1167
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:18,649
快过来!
Come here!

1168
01:26:20,956 --> 01:26:22,356
快!
Quick!

1169
01:26:22,392 --> 01:26:25,828
啊!  妈妈!  妈妈!
Aah! Mum! Mum!

1170
01:26:26,562 --> 01:26:28,558
孩子们!
Children!

1171
01:26:33,937 --> 01:26:35,666
快跑!
Run!

1172
01:26:35,705 --> 01:26:37,195
快跑!
Run!

1173
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:40,607
快跑!  跑进屋子!
Go! Into the house!

1174
01:26:42,411 --> 01:26:44,241
别再靠近!
Don't come any closer!

1175
01:26:44,814 --> 01:26:47,783
别动!
Don't move!

1176
01:26:51,588 --> 01:26:53,419
别再自寻烦恼了  太太
Don't trouble yourself, ma'am.

1177
01:26:53,456 --> 01:26:56,254
半个世纪前
Tuberculosis finished us off

1178
01:26:56,292 --> 01:26:58,920
我们都已死于肺结核
more than half a century ago.

1179
01:27:19,182 --> 01:27:20,547
滚开!
Go away!

1180
01:27:26,756 --> 01:27:28,648
太太  请开门
Open the door, ma'am, Please.

1181
01:27:28,691 --> 01:27:30,056
你们想干嘛?
What do you want?

1182
01:27:30,093 --> 01:27:32,721
妈妈  别开门
Mummy, don't open the door. Don't.

1183
01:27:32,762 --> 01:27:34,889
我们看见他们的坟墓
We've seen their graves.

1184
01:27:34,931 --> 01:27:36,831
躲到楼上去
Go upstairs and hide.

1185
01:27:36,866 --> 01:27:38,766
-快  -我害怕
-Go on.  -I'm scared.

1186
01:27:45,341 --> 01:27:48,139
-不要分开!  -噢
-Don't separate!  -Oh!

1187
01:27:54,183 --> 01:27:57,619
无论如何都不要分开
Whatever you do, don't separate.

1188
01:27:57,654 --> 01:28:01,920
躲起来  快点
Go hide. Go. Go.

1189
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:04,620
我们一直试图使你明白
We've been trying to make you understand.

1190
01:28:07,496 --> 01:28:08,925
明白什么?
Understand what?

1191
01:28:08,965 --> 01:28:10,489
这间屋子
About the house.

1192
01:28:10,933 --> 01:28:13,229
和新的状况
About the new situation.

1193
01:28:13,669 --> 01:28:15,430
什么状况?
What situation?

1194
01:28:15,871 --> 01:28:19,840
我们必须学会和睦共处
We must all learn to live together,

1195
01:28:19,876 --> 01:28:21,607
活人和死人
the living and the dead.

1196
01:28:22,712 --> 01:28:26,705
你们死了就请放过我们
If you're dead, leave us in peace!

1197
01:28:26,783 --> 01:28:29,251
放过我们!
Oh. Leave us in peace!

1198
01:28:30,185 --> 01:28:32,618
放过我们!
Leave us in peace!

1199
01:28:37,727 --> 01:28:40,257
这里  进去
In here. Get inside.

1200
01:28:45,634 --> 01:28:47,532
就算我们放过你
And suppose we do leave you.

1201
01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:49,800
他们会放过吗?
Do you think they will?

1202
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:51,306
谁?
Who?

1203
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:53,399
不速之客
The intruders.

1204
01:28:53,943 --> 01:28:55,507
没有不速之客
There are no intruders.

1205
01:28:55,507 --> 01:28:57,040
窗帘是他们拆的
They took the curtains down.

1206
01:28:57,346 --> 01:29:01,175
我可以肯定就是他们
Oh, yes, I assure you it was them.

1207
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:05,346
他们现在就与你和孩子一起
And now they're in there with you and the children.

1208
01:29:05,388 --> 01:29:06,714
等着你
Waiting for you.

1209
01:29:06,714 --> 01:29:07,750
不
No!

1210
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:12,159
相信我  迟早
Yes. And believe me, sooner or later,

1211
01:29:12,195 --> 01:29:14,663
他们会找上你
they'll find you.

1212
01:29:14,697 --> 01:29:16,631
等在这里  我马上回来
Listen, wait here and I'll be back in a minute.

1213
01:29:16,666 --> 01:29:19,601
不  妈妈说了我们不分开
No, no, no. Mummy said we shouldn't separate.

1214
01:29:19,635 --> 01:29:21,903
我们不能留下她不管
We can't leave her on her own.

1215
01:29:26,308 --> 01:29:29,141
不要那样呼吸
Stop breathing like that.

1216
01:29:35,818 --> 01:29:38,651
尼古拉斯  别那样呼吸
Nicholas, stop breathing like that.

1217
01:29:41,524 --> 01:29:43,287
停止呼吸!
Stop breathing!

1218
01:29:45,194 --> 01:29:49,995
你没听见?  外面有人
Can't you hear it? There's someone there.

1219
01:29:52,802 --> 01:29:55,300
跟我来  孩子们
Come with us, children.

1220
01:29:55,738 --> 01:29:58,307
跟我来
Come with us.

1221
01:30:05,047 --> 01:30:06,576
尼古拉斯?
Nicholas?

1222
01:30:08,784 --> 01:30:09,978
安?
Anne?

1223
01:30:12,655 --> 01:30:14,680
你们在哪里?
Where are you?

1224
01:30:17,393 --> 01:30:19,061
回答我!
Answer me!

1225
01:30:19,061 --> 01:30:20,862
不速之客找到了他们
The intruders have found them.

1226
01:30:20,896 --> 01:30:23,490
我们无能为力了
There's nothing we can do now.

1227
01:30:23,532 --> 01:30:28,765
你只能上楼和他们谈谈
You'll have to go upstairs and talk to them.

1228
01:30:45,722 --> 01:30:48,820
我们的天父啊
Our Father, who art in Heaven

1229
01:30:48,858 --> 01:30:51,019
愿你的圣名显扬
hallowed be Thy name.

1230
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:52,960
愿你的国度降临
Thy kingdom come.

1231
01:30:52,995 --> 01:30:55,156
我们将在人间奉行你的旨意
Thy will be done on earth

1232
01:30:55,197 --> 01:30:57,893
犹如在天堂
as it is in Heaven.

1233
01:30:57,933 --> 01:31:00,333
求你赐予我们每天的食粮
Give us this day our daily bread

1234
01:31:00,369 --> 01:31:02,064
求你原谅我们的罪过
and forgive us our trespasses.

1235
01:31:05,108 --> 01:31:08,206
你们怕什么?  孩子们
Why are you afraid, children?

1236
01:31:08,244 --> 01:31:11,304
我们不是朋友吗?
Why don't you want us to be your friends?

1237
01:31:13,315 --> 01:31:17,115
来吧  和我们说话
Come on, speak to us.

1238
01:31:17,153 --> 01:31:19,644
和我们说话
Speak to us.

1239
01:31:23,893 --> 01:31:27,192
告诉我发生了什么事
Tell me what happened.

1240
01:31:28,531 --> 01:31:31,591
不要说!  不要说!
Don't tell her! Don't tell her!

1241
01:31:31,634 --> 01:31:35,536
不要说
Don't tell her.

1242
01:31:35,571 --> 01:31:40,099
说了  他们就会放过我们
If I tell her, they'll leave us in peace.

1243
01:31:41,043 --> 01:31:42,601
妈咪!
Mummy!

1244
01:31:44,113 --> 01:31:45,971
妈咪!
Mummy.

1245
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:48,949
你们为何哭?  孩子
Why are you crying, children?

1246
01:31:49,485 --> 01:31:52,021
这里发生什么事?
What happened in this room?

1247
01:31:52,955 --> 01:31:56,017
妈妈对你们做了什么?
What did your mother do to you?

1248
01:32:08,237 --> 01:32:10,467
好像是关于枕头
Something about a pillow.

1249
01:32:10,506 --> 01:32:14,101
她就是这样杀了你们?
Is that how she killed you?

1250
01:32:15,078 --> 01:32:16,568
用枕头?
With a pillow?

1251
01:32:16,568 --> 01:32:18,000
她没有杀我们
She didn't kill us!

1252
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,948
孩子  你们死了
Children, if you're dead,

1253
01:32:20,015 --> 01:32:22,745
为什么还留在这屋里?
why do you remain in this house?

1254
01:32:22,785 --> 01:32:24,650
我们没死!
We're not dead!

1255
01:32:25,555 --> 01:32:27,389
为什么还留在这屋里?
Why do you remain in this house?

1256
01:32:27,389 --> 01:32:29,083
我们没死!
We're not dead!

1257
01:32:29,125 --> 01:32:30,387
我们没死!
We're not dead!

1258
01:32:30,426 --> 01:32:33,129
我们没死!
We're not dead!

1259
01:32:33,129 --> 01:32:36,423
为什么还留在这屋里?
Why do you remain in this house?

1260
01:32:36,465 --> 01:32:40,231
我们没死!  我们没死!
We're not dead. We're not dead.

1261
01:32:40,269 --> 01:32:41,327
我们没死!
We're not dead!

1262
01:32:41,370 --> 01:32:44,771
我们没死!
We're not dead!

1263
01:32:45,808 --> 01:32:47,708
我们没死!
We're not dead!

1264
01:33:03,959 --> 01:33:05,426
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

1265
01:33:05,461 --> 01:33:11,066
没事  只是有点晕
Yes. Just a bit dizzy, that's all.

1266
01:33:11,066 --> 01:33:13,265
发生什么了?
What happened?

1267
01:33:13,302 --> 01:33:16,430
他们有通灵反应
They made contact.

1268
01:33:16,472 --> 01:33:18,064
三个都有?
All three?

1269
01:33:18,107 --> 01:33:21,099
一点没错
Apparently, yes.

1270
01:33:21,143 --> 01:33:24,909
母亲和两个孩子
The mother and the two children.

1271
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:26,641
很有趣  是吧?
Quite interesting, don't you think?

1272
01:33:26,715 --> 01:33:28,683
有趣?
Interesting?

1273
01:33:28,717 --> 01:33:30,514
我吓得半死
I was scared out of my wits!

1274
01:33:30,553 --> 01:33:31,520
镇静些
Darling, calm down.

1275
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,886
不  我们一直都听你的
No. So far, we have handled this matter your way,

1276
01:33:34,886 --> 01:33:36,717
现在轮到我做主
but now you listen to me.

1277
01:33:36,759 --> 01:33:39,193
我们不能再在这里住下去
We can't possibly stay in this house any longer.

1278
01:33:39,228 --> 01:33:40,325
很显然
It is quite clear

1279
01:33:40,325 --> 01:33:42,622
那些鬼魂不欢迎我们
that these beings do not want us to live here.

1280
01:33:42,665 --> 01:33:44,223
我们还未搞清楚
We don't know anything about them yet.

1281
01:33:44,266 --> 01:33:45,824
很清楚了
Yes, we do!

1282
01:33:45,868 --> 01:33:47,893
那个女人疯了
We know the woman went mad,

1283
01:33:47,937 --> 01:33:50,770
闷死了两个孩子后开枪自杀
smothered her two children, and then shot herself.

1284
01:33:50,806 --> 01:33:54,003
还不够清楚?  想想我们的儿子
That's quite enough. Think of our son.

1285
01:33:54,043 --> 01:33:55,674
维克多没什么事
There's nothing wrong with Victor.

1286
01:33:55,674 --> 01:33:58,709
有事!  他做噩梦
Yes, there is! He has nightmares.

1287
01:33:58,781 --> 01:34:00,481
说见到那女孩
He says he has seen that girl

1288
01:34:00,481 --> 01:34:03,048
还附上了这老妇人的身体
and even this lady has been possessed by her.

1289
01:34:03,085 --> 01:34:06,111
我们搬吧  离开这所房子
Please, let us leave this house.

1290
01:34:06,155 --> 01:34:07,588
好吧
All right.

1291
01:34:07,623 --> 01:34:10,751
明天一早就搬
We will leave tomorrow morning.

1292
01:34:10,793 --> 01:34:13,284
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God for that.

1293
01:34:14,697 --> 01:34:17,029
我去看看维克多
I'll just go and check on Victor.

1294
01:34:20,069 --> 01:34:22,367
再次感谢你能来
Once again, thank you so much for coming.

1295
01:34:22,404 --> 01:34:23,371
不客气
A pleasure.

1296
01:34:23,405 --> 01:34:25,173
希望真的有所帮助
I hope we've been of some help.

1297
01:34:25,173 --> 01:34:28,399
当然  不过有点不太顺利
Oh, yes, of course. Though I must admit.

1298
01:34:32,047 --> 01:34:35,374
起初我不明白...
At first, I couldn't understand...

1299
01:34:35,951 --> 01:34:39,553
枕头怎么会在我手上
what the pillow was doing in my hands

1300
01:34:42,191 --> 01:34:45,058
为什么你们不动了?
or why you didn't move.

1301
01:34:48,831 --> 01:34:51,129
后来我知道了
But then I knew.

1302
01:34:53,936 --> 01:34:55,927
出了事
It had happened.

1303
01:34:59,708 --> 01:35:02,336
我杀了我的孩子
I had killed my children.

1304
01:35:08,384 --> 01:35:12,684
我拿起枪
I got the rifle.

1305
01:35:12,721 --> 01:35:14,951
对准自己额头
I put it to my forehead.

1306
01:35:19,061 --> 01:35:21,359
扣动了扳机
Then I pulled the trigger.

1307
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:27,364
什么都没发生
Nothing.

1308
01:35:34,043 --> 01:35:39,003
随后我听见你们在睡房嬉笑
Then I heard your laughter in the bedroom.

1309
01:35:42,017 --> 01:35:43,284
你们在玩枕头
You were playing with the pillows

1310
01:35:43,284 --> 01:35:45,919
就像什么都没发生
as if nothing had happened.

1311
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:54,658
我想慈悲的上帝
And I thought the Lord in his great mercy

1312
01:35:54,697 --> 01:36:00,602
给了我第二次机会
was giving me another chance,

1313
01:36:00,636 --> 01:36:05,130
告诉我  不要放弃
telling me, "Don't give up."

1314
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:09,937
要努力
Be strong.

1315
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:13,645
做孩子们的...
Be a good mother...

1316
01:36:15,918 --> 01:36:17,317
好妈妈
for them.

1317
01:36:21,390 --> 01:36:24,521
但现在
But now,

1318
01:36:26,562 --> 01:36:27,552
现在
now,

1319
01:36:31,567 --> 01:36:33,558
这都意味着什么?
what does all this mean?

1320
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:39,439
我们在哪里?
Where are we?

1321
01:36:40,977 --> 01:36:43,971
丽蒂亚得知我们三个死去
Young Lydia said the very same thing

1322
01:36:44,046 --> 01:36:48,483
也问了同样的问题
when she realized the three of us were dead.

1323
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:51,849
之后她就变哑了
And that was the last time she ever spoke.

1324
01:36:54,123 --> 01:36:57,024
我一直都不能告诉你
But I couldn't tell you that before now.

1325
01:37:01,663 --> 01:37:05,030
弄杯热茶喝吧  太太
Shall I make us a nice cup of tea, ma'am?

1326
01:37:08,871 --> 01:37:11,032
不速之客要走了
The intruders are leaving,

1327
01:37:11,073 --> 01:37:13,105
但新的还会来
but others will come.

1328
01:37:13,105 --> 01:37:15,603
有时我们会感觉到他们
Now, sometimes we'll sense them.

1329
01:37:15,644 --> 01:37:19,136
有时感觉不到
Other times, we won't.

1330
01:37:19,214 --> 01:37:22,615
从来就是如此
But that's the way it's always been.

1331
01:37:24,586 --> 01:37:25,848
太太
Ma'am.

1332
01:37:30,092 --> 01:37:31,286
妈咪
Mummy.

1333
01:37:32,286 --> 01:37:35,196
爸爸打仗死了  是吗?
Daddy died in the war, didn't he?

1334
01:37:35,230 --> 01:37:36,297
是的
Yes.

1335
01:37:36,297 --> 01:37:38,597
我们会再见到他吗?
Will we ever see him again?

1336
01:37:38,634 --> 01:37:41,569
不知道
I don't know.

1337
01:37:41,603 --> 01:37:46,267
如果我们死了  那边狱呢?
If we're dead, where's limbo?

1338
01:37:50,279 --> 01:37:53,248
我不知道边狱是否存在
I don't know if there even is a limbo.

1339
01:37:55,451 --> 01:37:58,352
我知道的不比你们多
I'm no wiser than you are,

1340
01:38:00,656 --> 01:38:04,683
我只知道我爱你们
but I do know that I love you.

1341
01:38:04,726 --> 01:38:07,593
一直都爱你们
I've always loved you.

1342
01:38:10,632 --> 01:38:13,301
这间屋子是我们的
And this house is ours.

1343
01:38:14,937 --> 01:38:16,873
一起跟我说
You say it with me.

1344
01:38:17,873 --> 01:38:19,399
这间屋子是我们的
This house is ours.

1345
01:38:19,441 --> 01:38:20,965
这间屋子是我们的
This house is ours.

1346
01:38:21,009 --> 01:38:23,204
这间屋子是我们的
This house is ours.

1347
01:38:43,732 --> 01:38:47,327
妈咪  看  没事的
Mummy, look. It doesn't hurt anymore.

1348
01:38:58,146 --> 01:39:01,115
没人能赶走我们
No one can make us leave this house.

1349
01:39:27,309 --> 01:39:29,472
走吧  维克多
Come along, Victor.

1350
01:39:52,436 --> 01:40:00,096
"出售"
