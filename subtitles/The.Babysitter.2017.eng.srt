-Looking good.

156
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,373

157
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,166
Nope.

-Ten and two.

[engine revs, fades]

161
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:15,304
Dad, did you know that seven teenagers
die a day from driving?

162
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,139
Really? Wow.

163
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:21,852
Did you know that, uh, 14 teenagers
die a day from over-worrying?

164
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,563
I went on the Internet,

165
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,107
and there's pictures of them.
They die like this:

166
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,279
Maybe next week.

167
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,115
All right, buddy, sure. You wanna swap?

168
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,450
-Yeah.
-Good. All right. You did good.

169
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,704
You started the car,
you put the seat belt on.

170
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,123
Don't worry about it, pal.
There's no rush.

171
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,917
It's okay to be scared.
It's not a big deal, okay?

172
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,672
Hey, let me ask you something.
Do your friends--

173
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,049
Do they make fun of you
for having a babysitter?

174
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,426
Yeah.

175
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,012
But then they see her
and get really jealous.

176
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,806
Yeah. Heck, yeah, they do. [chuckles]

177
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,851
I don't know about you, buddy,
but I'm feeling like a cop.

178
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,145
I'm craving some donuts.

179
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,730
[shouting]

180
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:08,941
[Dad] All right!

181
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,653
[both laughing]

182
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,452
What are you watching?

183
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,829
Your dad is bingeing on <i>Mad Men.</i>

184
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:22,872
Again.

185
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,373
You wouldn't like it.

186
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,125
It's on HBO?

187
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,794
-[chuckles]
-No, it's not-- It's not dirty, buddy.

188
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,754
It's not on HBO.

189
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,256
It's dense, you know.
So, it might go over your head.

190
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,092
When you get a little older,
we'll binge-watch it together.

191
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,052
How about that?

192
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,971
-[Cole] All right.
-Cole, will you clean up the toys

193
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,139
in the hallway for me?

194
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,557
Okay, Mom. Jeez.

195
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,475
Thank you.

196
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,607
[Cole] Much cleaner.

197
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,341
Who cares?

198
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:17,510
Hey. Oh.

199
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,762
Hey, that doesn't seem safe at all.

200
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,639
-I can handle it.
-Yeah. No, I get it.

201
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,640
Stop. Stop.

202
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,266
And hand me the knife.

203
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,020
Fabulous.
Why you cutting up your car with a knife?

204
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,731
I'm gonna switch the roof
with a fastback,

205
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,024
-so it's aerodynamic.
-Uh-huh.

206
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,276
It's gonna give me more downforce
on the turns.

207
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,362
When it hits the ramp,
it'll do a barrel roll

208
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,823
and smash into the crash zone
exactly how I intend--

209
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,617
Got it, got it.
I applaud your passion for aerodynamics.

210
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,829
I absolutely do, but only use this
if you're cutting a flank steak.

211
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,455
And don't do that. That's my job.

212
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,291
And if you take that job,
what am I doing at this house?

213
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,252
Do you want me to put it back?

214
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,962
[Dad] No. I'm gonna put this
in the dishwasher,

215
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,172
'cause it's coated in my sweat and fear.

216
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,344
My parents are going away again.
I think they go to have sex,

217
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,347
but it just makes me feel like they go
to get away from me.

218
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,975
They're definitely having sex.

219
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,935
They probably have sex
when you're home, too.

220
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:12,064
Besides, I bet Bee has boys over
at your place all the time doing it.

No way. Not a chance.

Yeah. That's what babysitters do.

They put the kids down,
sneak their boyfriends in. Doing it.

after she's fallen asleep?

So, you're basically saying,
intergalactic dream team on a mission.

-Yeah. So, there's an epic villain, right?
-Right.

283
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,165

But you can't have a Predator

Are you ready for this shit?

00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,860

-No way.
-Yeah.

296
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,782
Yes. Yes. Okay. Here's the plan.

297
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,702
Kirk and Picard team up to captain,
then when they get close,

298
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,121
they send Will and Goldblum
to get inside the lair.

Will and Goldblum get her inside the lair.

463
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,968
Damn, that's all I'm asking.

464
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,761
-[Bee] All right.
-[John] Freaky shit.

465
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,807
Smell good. The spit is nice.
Brushed your teeth this morning.

466
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,643
[Max laughing] Okay.

467
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,231
-[John] Weird.
-[Bee] Hi.

468
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,775
-[John howling]
-[Allison laughing] Yeah!

469
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,486
[Max cat-calling] Sammy's turn.

470
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,281
-[John laughing]
-[Max chanting] Sammy.

471
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,575
-[Allison] She's so hot.
-[John] Okay.

472
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,619
[Max] Come on, Sam. You got this.

473
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,246
Make out with her.

474
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:04,456
[Sam] I'm sorry.

475
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:09,502
This is kind of weird.
I don't even really know you guys.

476
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,047
[Max] Come on, Sam.
Freak you out, there, stud?

477
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,924
-Sam, don't be a puss.
-[Sam] I don't even know you guys.

478
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,301
[Sam] I'm not. I'm-- I just--

479
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:19,054
-You're staring at me.
-[Max] Oh, we're not looking.

480
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,347
[Allison] Hey, it's not weird.

481
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:21,931
-[Bee] Hey.
-[John] Yeah.

482
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,266
Just close your eyes.

483
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:24,726
Okay?

484
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,311
Pretend they're not even here.

485
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,063
You can do this.

486
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,773
You got this.

487
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,691
[hushes]

488
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:39,032
Just because I close my eyes
doesn't mean that they're not here.

489
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,285
Do you trust me?

490
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:44,788
Yes.

491
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,039
Just relax.

492
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,250
It's not weird, okay?
We're just having fun.

493
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,045
[John howls]

494
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,672
There he goes.

495
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:55,673
[John chuckles]

496
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,190
[screaming]

497
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,497
Shh.

498
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:32,293
You're helping fulfill a great purpose.
Know this.

499
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,880
I don't wanna fulfill a great porpoise.

500
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,258
[grunts] Did he just say "porpoise"?

501
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,592
Yo, I think he did.

502
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,761
He didn't even get a chance
to understand.

503
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,471
[panting]

504
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,557
Ready?

505
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,475
-[Sonya] Ready.
-Yep.

506
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,687
-[John grunts] Oh, okay.
-[exhales]

507
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,356
[John] That shit leaking.

508
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,406
Wait, hold on. My shit ain't working.
I think it ran out of blood.

509
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,159
-Oh, shit!
-Oh, shit.

510
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,953
[John yells] Oh, shit!

511
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,914
[Max]
All that blood was just in his boner.

512
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,917
Max, don't laugh, okay?
John, relax. This blood is serving you.

513
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,587
I did not sign up for this shit
to serve me in my mouth.

514
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,214
This shit's still warm.
I think he got a fever.

515
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,718
You know what you signed up for.
You want to go platinum, John?

516
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,429
Things can get messy
when you make a deal with the devil.

517
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:25,555
Now collect it.

518
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:26,890
-[John] Like this?
-[Bee] There you go.

519
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:30,435
[Allison] How long is this gonna take?
I just want my shit to come true.

520
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,646
[Bee]
Allison, you'll all get what you want.

521
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,403
Okay, let's go.

522
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,074
[John] I don't think this is funny.
Look at my outfit.

523
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,911
I just got this shit, you feel me?
Thirty percent off.

524
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,663
Macy's. Top rack. I don't play games.

525
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,415
You look like Carrie,

526
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,001
-but black.
-Carrie would've been better black.

527
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,629
She would have been covered in Hennessy,
all right?

528
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,340
What are you wearing?
Looking like Big Bird's side bitch.

529
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:03,551
I just came from a game.
That's why I'm wearing this, obviously.

530
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,011
I was not gonna miss this.

531
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:10,308
Look at this shit.
That would go viral so hard.

532
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,185
I mean, nobody's done human sacrifice.

533
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,229
People have always done human sacrifice.

534
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:18,233
Yeah, but, like...
not in America with hot people.

535
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,610
Sonya, get the cases.

536
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,613
Listen,
when you're done being totally useless,

537
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:27,617
get a rag and wipe Sacrifice Samuel
out my damn eye. OMG.

538
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,785
Hey.

539
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:29,869
Nice one, John.

540
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,247
[gasps] Oh, my God.

541
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,124
I've got Sacrifice Samuel all over me.

542
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,293
What's in the box?

543
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:45,969
Yo, so, Bee, why do you need the book
if you already know what to do?

544
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,304
It's like Jesus asking directions
to heaven.

545
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,931
Just fucking go up, you know?

546
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:54,102
Well, the Jews have their scrolls,

547
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,979
Christians have their Bibles,

548
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,856
and the devil has his verses.

549
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,817
Don't touch it.
It's very old and very delicate.

550
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,277
It's the only one.

551
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,613
You recite the verse
while the blood hits the page.

552
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,323
Without it, none of this happens.

553
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:13,246
Let's get started before we head upstairs
and get the blood of the innocent.

554
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,831
[gasps]

555
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,427
[woman]
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

556
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,471
My name is Cole Johnson.
A guy was murdered in my living room.

557
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,433
The address is, uh... 2455 Bigby Drive.

558
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:36,936
-Can you please send someone?
-<i>Are the attackers still in the house?</i>

559
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,605
They're downstairs having a blast.

560
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,648
-<i>How many are there, Cole?</i>
-Too many.

561
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,402
Can you please get my mom?
She's at the Hyatt in the city.

562
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,528
Living large.

563
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:49,157
<i>Of course, Cole. Now listen to me.</i>
<i>It's important that you stay hidden.</i>

564
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,453
-I gotta protect myself. Thanks.
<i>-Do not do that. No, no, no--</i>

565
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,650
-Okay.
-[chattering]

566
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,540
[Bee] ...we shed about 15 percent
of our dead cells.

567
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,583
[John] Whoo!

568
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,170
Yo, this kid's hobby
must be getting bullied.

569
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,382
He's reading <i>The Secret?</i>

570
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,051
He's ten years old.
What secret he need to know?

571
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,594
Won't he hear us?

572
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,973
With the amount of drugs I gave him?
Hell, no.

573
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:59,686
-[Sonya] Good boy. Pretty boy.
-Do you have the needle?

574
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,189
Of course, I have the needle.

575
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,197
You know, there is a faster way
to get all that blood.

576
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,033
[Bee] What happens when you kill someone?

577
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,369
[John] They lose, like,
all they Instagram followers.

578
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,497
-[gasps] Oh, my God, that would suck.
-No, they die.

579
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,833
And then I'd have
to find another innocent kid.

580
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:25,628
And all of this only works
if we get that top-shelf pure shit.

581
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,340
And Cole is basically a faucet
of that for us.

582
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,187
[Bee] After this, we finish the ritual...

583
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,732
and your wish comes true.

584
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,820
-Damn, I missed the vein.
-[Sonya] Mm.

585
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,450
[Bee] Premium real estate. Go for it.

586
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,663
[Sonya incanting]

587
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,715
Wait, you gotta give him a Band-Aid.

588
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,467
Okay. Let's go mix some blood.

589
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,760
John, alley-oop.

590
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:15,928
[John] LeBron James.

591
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,974
Good boy.

592
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,708
[panting]

593
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,106
Why is he shirtless?

594
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,027
-That's your first question?
-How can you ask that? Just look at him.

595
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,195
I still don't get it.

596
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,616
[grunting]

597
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:02,869
Give him a cookie.

598
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,957
-No, thanks.
-Eat the cookie.

599
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:11,127
I just don't really like cookies, okay?
Bee knows that.

600
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,590
You'll feel better if you eat.
You fainted.

601
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,591
No, I didn't.

602
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,508
Yes, you did.

603
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,844
After I took your blood,

604
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,305
I waited in the room,
because something felt off.

605
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:25,224
I crouched behind the door.
A few seconds later, you got up,

606
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,935
tied a sheet to your bed,
threw the sheet out the window.

607
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,354
And then you fainted. So, you know...

608
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,356
Your blood sugar is low. Eat the cookie.

609
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,322
Are you mad at me?

610
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,490
Cookie.

611
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,411
This is gonna be so good.

612
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:47,914
What the...

613
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,082
Oh, there you go.

614
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,001
There you go.

615
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,422
That's a good boy.

616
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,266
-Why are you awake, Cole?
-Because I couldn't sleep.

617
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,227
-I don't believe you.
-[Cole] Okay, fine. I--

618
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,895
I was gonna go smoke in the woods.

619
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,688
[Bee] You were gonna go smoke
in the woods.

620
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,068
Yeah. You know, like... marijuana.

621
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,737
You weren't gonna share with your boy?
Come on, man.

622
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,490
We could've got high,
listen to my mix tape. My shit's fire.

623
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,951
-I wanna smoke pot.
-Why didn't you drink the shot?

624
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,370
Why is he shirtless?
Why did you take my blood?

625
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,997
-Cole.
-Okay. Fine. Because I don't like alcohol.

626
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,708
I just drank it
because I wanted you to think I was cool.

627
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,755
Why did you give a 12-year-old alcohol?

628
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,508
'Cause I put shit in that alcohol
that makes them conk out

629
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,759
for eight hours or more.

630
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,512
What else did you see?

631
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,390
I just see you.

632
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:51,143
And these assholes,
who I don't know, in my house.

633
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:57,358
-Why is his shirt covered in blood?
-No one would let me borrow a shirt.

634
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,361
-That's not even an answer.
-Oh, my God.

635
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,948
Does he not see the mirror behind him?
We can see you cutting the rope.

636
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,784
Well, he does now.

637
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,205
Aw, it's so cute,
you're still cutting the rope.

638
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,833
Look at you.
You're really trying there, aren't you?

639
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,712
-Why are you cutting ropes?
-I don't like being tied up.

640
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,672
-Why do you have a knife?
-It was a gift.

641
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:20,631
Oh, my God.

642
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,633
He's still cutting the ropes.

643
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,136
Determined little fucker, aren't you?

644
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,140
Look, I won't tell anyone.

645
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,684
Okay? You know me.
I'm good with secrets.

646
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,437
I won't tell my parents
that you were having an orgy

647
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,855
and needed my blood to do it.

648
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,398
[John and Allison laughing]

649
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,488
Do you even know what an orgy is?

650
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,074
I'm guessing it's something sad people do

651
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,535
'cause they want other sad people
to like them,

652
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:53,039
and they can forget for one minute
how sad they are in general.

653
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,000
That's actually a pretty good answer.

654
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,794
It was for a science project, okay?

655
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,379
The orgy?

656
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,381
No. The blood.

657
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,717
Orgy is when a bunch of people
have sex together.

658
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,052
We wouldn't need your blood for that.

659
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,723
You could've just asked.

660
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,768
I would've let you have some blood
for science.

661
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,644
I knew you were afraid of needles.

662
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,688
This was clearly a misunderstanding.

663
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,939
Sonya, untie him.

664
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,984
I'm sorry we scared you, Cole. We good?

665
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,277

00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,868
-Not good.
-Fucking police.

669
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,204
Why are the cops outside, Cole?

670
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,206
-I don't know.
-Did you call them?

671
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:38,000
-No. You said you were in the room.
-Makes me think you saw something

672
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,461
that scared you enough
to call the cops. Right, Cole?

673
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,839
-[knock on door]
-Oh, fuck!

674
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,007
Answer me, Cole.

00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,968
Help! Help!
I'm tied up inside! They're about--

Titty gone!

688

Don't you move. Keep your hands up.
Nobody move!

-Don't you move.

Chill. You Mexican, right?

[John] Max, what you doing, man?

697
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,558

Whoo!

Look, man.
Three out of four people got an STD.

705
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,034
I got two people's blood on me.

706
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,288
You do the math.
I got AIDS. I know I got AIDS.

707
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,664
You killed him!

708
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,417
-Kind of your fault, bud.
-Are you insane?

709
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,835
No, Cole. I'm just trying--

[man on radio] <i>What's the status</i>

I can't go to jail.
Y'all killed the cops, man.

I ain't involved with this shit.

[John] It's the statistics.

717
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,645
They say you either end up in jail
or dead.

It's gonna be both for me, Bee.

It's 10-4. Obviously.

We need to call an ambulance, guys.

Why not?

it'll take your parents

to find your body down here? [chuckles]

Even later?

Or we could just burn your body, Cole.

No.
