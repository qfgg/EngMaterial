00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,780
你不说话是吧  医生
you ain't talking, huh, Doc?

82
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,500
我第一次见你时你也不怎么说话
Weren't talking much first time I met you neither.

83
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,420
小男孩一个
Little boy...

84
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,930
不得不在那个可怕的地方度过漫长的冬天
set to spend a long winter at that rotten old place.

85
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,430
只有他和他爸爸妈妈
Just him and his mommy and daddy.

86
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,850
爸爸有多黑暗  小男孩就有多光明
Daddy as dark as that boy is bright.

那个小男孩可明亮了
And, boy, is he bright.

88
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,140
他的闪灵像团火一样发着光
He's shining like fire...

89
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,110
然而那个地方
in the one place...

90
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,480
对于有闪灵能力的人而言是最不好的
the worst place for someone who shines.

91
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,860
你还记得我们第一次真正的交流吗
You remember the first time we really talked?

92
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,120
我在你脑子里说话的那次
When I spoke up inside your head?

93
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,290
那次让你感觉很好  是吧
Made you feel good, right?

94
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,330
得知自己并不孤独
Knowing you weren't alone.

95
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,330
爸爸想杀了我
Daddy tried to kill me.

96
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,020
他那时已经不是他了  你得理解
It wasn't all him, you gotta know.

97
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,050
那个地方供养了他的黑暗  蚕食了你的光明
That place fed his dark, like it fed on your light.

98
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,840
他内心也是有光明的
And he had some light in him, too.

99
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,430
就和你内心也是有黑暗的一样
Just like you got some dark.

100
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,350
我们都是既光明又黑暗
We all got both.

101
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,390
它还没有放过我
It's not done with me.

102
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,230
你有没有想过我每次都是怎样出现的
It ever strike you funny how I showed up when I did?

103
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,820
每当你需要我的时候
When you needed me.

104
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,650
有人也这样帮助过我
Someone did that for me, too.

105
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,320
我奶奶教我的
My grandma taught me,

106
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,370
而我教给了你
and I taught you.

有朝一日  丹尼·托伦斯
And some day, Danny Torrance,

108
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,660
你也会教给别人
you'll teach someone else.

109
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,370
我不会的
I won't.

110
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,710
你不会是吗
Oh, you won't, huh?

111
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,250
我是说我不会再用闪灵了
I won't shine, I mean.

112
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,500
不会了  太危险了
No more. It's dangerous.

113
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,170
我猜有时候是的
Reckon it is sometimes.

114
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,720
她找到我了
She found me.

115
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,800
她会不断来找我  直到她抓到我
She'll come back and come back until she gets me.

116
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,930
你说得对
You're right.

117
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,280
眺望酒店已经荒废了  被封起来了
The Overlook's condemned. Boarded up.

118
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,820
那些饥饿的老鬼魂
They're starvin' old ghosts,

119
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,600
他们在到处找你
and they're reachin' out for you.

120
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,610
不会只有她一个的
Won't stop with her, either.

121
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,530
书里的插画
Pictures in a book.

122
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,000
你说过他们只是书里的插画
You said they were just pictures in a book

123
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,240
他们伤害不了我
and they couldn't hurt me.

124
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,990
对于一些东西而言
Some things,

125
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,910
一些黑暗的东西  闪灵如同食物
dark things, the shining's like food.

126
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,250
他们就是闻到腥味的苍蝇
They're mosquitoes landing for blood.

127
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,710
眺望酒店
The Overlook,

128
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,170
对于我而言它向来都只是插画
it was always just pictures to me.

129
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,970
但我的闪灵能力没你强
But I didn't shine like you.

130
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,510
没有人的闪灵能力有你强
Nobody shines like you.

131
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,540
所以你在那个破酒店里
So, you in that damn hotel,

132
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,730
就像是个百万伏的电池
you was like a million-watt battery all plugged in.

133
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,100
酒店被充了电
And it ate it up.

134
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,400
你让它变成了真的
You made it real.

135
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,940
你踏进酒店门的那一刻就开始了
Started soon as you walked through the door.

136
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,040
我们对此无能为力  很抱歉告诉你这点
Can't do nothing about that, I'm sorry to tell you,

137
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,290
但你已经不是小孩子了
but you're not a child.

138
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,370
你已经长大了
You're older now.

139
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,620
从某种程度上讲  成熟了不少
Much older, in a way.

140
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,830
你必须听好了
You gotta hear this.

141
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,870
这是个饥肠辘辘的世界
World's a hungry place.

142
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,430
最黑暗的东西也是最饥饿的
And the darkest things are the hungriest,

143
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,340
他们会蚕食一切发光的东西
and they'll eat what shines.

144
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,960
他们就像蚊子蚂蝗一样成群结队
Swarm it like mosquitoes or leeches.

145
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,550
人们对此无能为力
Can't do nothing about that.

146
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,550
而你能做的
What you can do...

147
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,970
就是用他们渴求的东西来对付他们
is turn what they come for against 'em.

148
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,810
我爷爷
My grandfather,

149
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,230
他是个刻薄的老混蛋

和你爸爸一样的黑暗
Same type of dark as your dad.

152
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,300
他曾把我和我奶奶打到不省人事
Beat me senseless, and my grandma, too,

153
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,200
他死的时候  我开心得手舞足蹈

他抓伤了我  医生

00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,420
别光是看  摸摸它
Don't just look at it. Touch it.

169
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,340
把鼻子探进去  闻闻有没有味道
Stick your nose inside and see if there's a smell.

170
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,090

Why?

173

因为你要在脑袋里造一个一模一样的盒子
Because you're gonna build one just like it in your mind.

你被蛇咬的那一次

一条穿着白色上衣的蛇
A snake in a white blouse

298
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,020
面孔却是一片空白
whose face is a blank.

299
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,620
还真有意思
That is interesting.

Excuse me, miss?

302
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,480
女士  你落了东西在影院里
Miss. Miss, you left something in the theater.

303
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,880
你不想打扰我
You wanna leave me alone.

304

那你可以抱着它  小寿星
Well, then you get to hold him, birthday girl.

327
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,280
来  抱住了吗
There you go. You got him?

328
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,200
我的下一个戏法...天啊  抱歉

330
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,540
抱歉
Sorry.

331
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,580
有人看到我的勺子了吗
Has anyone seen my spoons?

332
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,130
这个我也会
I can do that.

- They're on you! - Oh, they're on me?

335
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,880
你们可千万不能这样
Okay, make sure you guys don't do this.

336
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,480
别想睡午觉了
We can forget about naptime.

337
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,060
再坚持几小时就好
Just a few more hours.

338
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,620
跟着我说  "再坚持几小时就好"
Say it with me. "Just a few more hours."

339
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,280
再坚持几小时就好
Just a few more hours.

抱歉
Sorry.

347
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,400
我不得不让你睡沉一点
I had to sleep you pretty hard.

348
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,150
你很难搞定
You're a tough one.

349
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,030
意志很强
Willful.

350
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,740
知道吗  我查了
You know, I checked.

三个月里有六个男人
Six men in three months

352
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,370
脸上被文了那种蛇咬文身
with those little snakebite tattoos on their cheeks.

353
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,290
你还真忙啊
Why, you've been busy.

354
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,630
蛇咬安蒂  原来就是你
Snakebite Andi, that's who you are.

355
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,800
那么  我是谁
So, who am I?

356
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,430
你是绑架了我的疯婆子
You're some crazy bitch who kidnapped me.

357
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,640
现在开始只说实话
Just the truth from now on.

358
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,600
你将只说实话
You will only speak the truth.

359
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,690
你是我见过的最美的女人
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

360
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,400
天  效果也太好了点  是吧
My God. Works a little too well, don't it?

361
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,950
听好了  蛇咬安蒂
Here's the deal, Snakebite Andi.

362
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:38,200
你是个说服者  对吧  你可以说服人们
You're a pusher, hmm? You can push people.

363
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,090
我们有一阵子没有说服者了
We haven't had a pusher around here for a little while,

364
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,260
所以我要给你开一个条件
so I'm gonna offer you a deal

365
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,710
这条件我快四十年没给人开过了
I haven't offered anyone in almost 40 years.

366
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,260
你多大了  亲爱的
How old are you, darlin'?

367
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,920
十五岁
Fifteen.

368
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:53,630
十五岁
Fifteen?

369
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,390
天  多好的年纪啊
Oh, God, what an age.

370
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,180
正是含苞待放的时候  是吧
Springtime of your womanhood, isn't it?

371
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,740
你已经不是小女孩了
You're not a girl anymore,

372
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,610
但你也还没有一点岁月的痕迹
but you don't have a single dent yet either.

373
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,900
地心引力甚至都没注意到你
Gravity hasn't even noticed you.

374
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,650
十五岁的时候不会
Not at 15.

375
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,740
不过男人嘛
Men, though...

376
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,240
不不不  不用害羞
No, no, no. No shame.

377
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:22,580
你通通还回去了  对吧
You paid that back, didn't you?

378
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,080
这就是我要提供给你的  青春永驻
That's what I'm offering you. Springtime forever.

379
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,930
从现在起十年后  你还是十五岁
Ten years from now, you're still 15.

380
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,300
一百年后  可能十七岁
A hundred, maybe 17.

381
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,050
吃得好
Eat well,

382
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,970
永葆青春  长生不老
stay young, live long.

383
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,490
所以你和你朋友...
So, you and your friend...

384
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,560
不是我的朋友  那是我的家人
Not my friend. That's my family.

385
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,400
我们是真结族  亲爱的
We're the True Knot, dear.

386
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,610
真结族
The True Knot.

387

抱歉  我只是...
Sorry. I was just...

392
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,650
没关系  人们总喜欢凑近了看
That's okay. People love to look at it.

393

我们以前都是在图书馆里布置这些的

See, we started with the clock tower there.

396
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,830
-是吗  -越建越多
- Oh, yeah. - Just keeps growing.

397
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,170
孩子们叫它迷你镇
Kids call it Teenytown.

398
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,540
这是孩子们建的
The kids build this?

399
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,040
在一些帮助之下  是的
With some help, oh, yeah.

400
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,340
继续下去就能建好整个城镇广场
Keep it up, build the whole town square.

401

你是坐大巴来的还是搭的顺风车
Are you off the bus or riding your thumb?

大巴
Yeah, the bus.

403
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,350
很少有人会坐大巴来这么北部的地方
Not many ride the bus this far north.

404
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,310

Unless they're looking for work.

405

嗯
Yeah.

406
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:55,500
是想换个环境
Change of scenery,

407
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,240
还是在逃离什么
or you running away from something?

408
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,950
别介意  希望我没有...
Don't mind me. I hope I'm...

Running away from yourself. That is a pickle.

You take yourself with you wherever you go.

我甚至让他把墙刷成了黑板
Even let him paint the wall all blackboard,

424
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,020
好让他在上面演算他的谜题
so he could scribble his little puzzles up there.

425
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,980
根本不安静  一点都不
Wasn't quiet. No, sir.

00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,800
走的时候都没给我刷回原样  不过幸好没刷
Didn't even paint over this when he left, but I'm glad he didn't,

427
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,990
这样就能让你轻松记住了
'cause I can make this easy for ya,

00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,380
我在楼下  一楼  有需要可以找我
I'm downstairs, ground floor, if you need anything.

435
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,640
明天来找我  聊聊工作的事
Find me tomorrow, talk about some work.

436
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,020
你为什么要做这些
Why are you doing this?

437
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,850
你都不认识我
You don't know me.

438
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,310
是的
No, I don't.

439
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,110
但我认识你那表情  我之前说过了
But I know the look, like I said.

440
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,500
有时候我对人会有种第六感
And sometimes I get this feeling about people.

441
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,990
可能很难理解
Hard to understand, I guess.

442
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,950
没你想的那么难
Easier than you think.

443
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,080
-谢了  -没事
- Thanks. - All right.

444
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,760
准备好了吗
You ready?

445
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,600
她准备好了
She's ready.

446
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,530
这些人是谁
Who... Who are these people?

447
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,110
你一会就知道了
You'll find out after.

448
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,170
那边那个是弗力克大爷
That over there is Grampa Flick...

449
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,910
他会引导我们  躺下
and he'll lead us. Lie down.

450
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:21,870
来
There.

451
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,630
不要害怕  明白吗
No fear. You understand?

452
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,550
我们是真结族
We are the True Knot

453
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,640
我们生生不息
and we endure.

454
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,020
我们是天选之子
We are the chosen ones.

455
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,690
我们是幸运之人
We are the fortunate ones.

456
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:59,660
绑定之物无法解绑
What is tied cannot be untied.

457
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,490
这里有一个女人
Here is a woman.

458
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,160
她会加入我们吗
Would she join us?

459
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:13,590
她会把自己的命与我们绑定吗
Would she tie her life to our life?

460
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,340
是的
Yes.

461
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:19,220
说是的
Say yes.

462
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,180
是的
Yes.

463
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,010
这个很特别
This one's special.

464
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,740
她叫维奥莱特
Her name's Violet.

465
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,940
她已经所剩无几了
There's not much of her left.

466
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:34,230
而她的味道
And she tastes...

467
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,480
如同花朵
like flowers.

468
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,430
深吸气
Breathe deep.

469
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,480
对  接受它
There. Embrace it.

470
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,570
接受它
Embrace it.

471
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,540
不
No!

472
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,670
不  不
No! No!

473
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,220
他们还没找到我们
They haven't found us yet.

474
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:33,640
他们听惯了他的哭声
They were used to hearing him cry

475
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:36,600
因为我总是扔下他一个人
'cause I left him alone so much.

476
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,900
所以他们无动于衷
So they didn't do anything.

477
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,450
他们还没发现我们
And they haven't found us yet.

478
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,660
妈妈
Mommy?

479
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,690
你说你认识我的表情
Uh, you said that you knew my look.

480
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,950
是什么意思
Well, what did you mean?

481
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,530
兄弟
Brother...

482
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,080
你病了
you're sick.

483
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:35,290
你很累  我看得出来
You're tired. I can see that much.

484
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,080
但是你又十分厌倦这种状态
But you're sick and tired of being sick and tired.

485
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:44,920
我需要帮助
I need help.

486
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:50,590
进来吧
Come on in.

487
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,100
我们聊聊
We'll talk about it.

488
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:00,240
上帝  请赐予我平静的心去接受我无法改变的
God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,

489
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,870
赐予我勇气去改变我能改变的事情
the courage to change the things I can,

490
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:05,360
赐予我智慧去分辨两者
and the wisdom to know the difference.

491
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,840
博比今天过生日
Well, Bobbie's got a big birthday today.

492
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,210
三年整  戒酒三年
Three years. Three years sober.

493
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,110
棒
Yeah.

494
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,090
我太为你骄傲了
I'm so proud of you.

495
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,290
谢谢  约翰
Thanks, John.

496
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,710
我忘记谁了吗
Now, am I forgetting anybody?

497
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,800
有没有一年整的  或者半年的
Does anybody got a year? Or six months?

498
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,810
现在轮到屋子里最重要的人了
Well, now for the most important person in the room.

499
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,590
有新来的吗
Is, uh, anybody here a newbie?

500
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,180
有人戒酒24小时了吗
Somebody got 24 hours?

501
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:38,350
有
Yeah.

502
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,780
新搬来的
New to town, huh?

503
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,090
是的  我...
Yeah, I, uh...

504
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:51,800
没别的意思  这屋子里有一半人是我接生的
Nothing personal. I delivered half the people in the room.

505
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,510
-只是看到了新面孔而已  -这位是丹·托伦斯
- Just new faces pop, that's all. - This here is Dan Torrance.

506
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,160
刚乘大巴来的
He's fresh off the bus.

507
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,500
看样子也刚摔了一跤
Fresh off the ground, by the look.

508
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,350
这里不会评头论足  兄弟
There's no judgment here, brother.

509
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:04,100
我们都经历过
I mean, we've all been there.

510
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,920
-经历过更惨的  相信我  -是的
- And worse, trust me. - Oh, yeah.

511
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:09,110
这位医生  我记事起他就在我们镇上工作
Doc, he's served our town most my life.

512
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,730
-我弟弟就是他接生的  -是的
- Delivered my baby brother. - Yeah.

513
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,090
弗兰基最近怎么样
How is Frankie these days?

514
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:15,030
他会迷途知返的
Well, he'll find his way back.

515
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,470
他内心深处是个好人
You know, he's got a good heart under it all.

516
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:20,640
比利真的尽力帮他了  我们都尽力了
Billy really tried with him. Well, we all did.

517
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:22,370
比利  要知道
Well, Billy, you know,

518
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:24,560
如果你需要一个可以避风的港湾
if you're looking for a wing to climb under...

519
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,020
绝对找不到比比利·弗里曼更靠谱的了
I can't say you'll do any better than Billy Freeman here.

520
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,030
谢谢你的热情招待
Thank you for your hospitality. I...

521
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,820
我有点
I'm a little, uh...

522
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,570
我可能还是不习惯
I guess I'm not used to it.

523
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,880
你知道有句话
Well, you know we say,

524
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,180
"不了解来龙去脉  就不能妄加评判别人"
"You can't judge someone till you know their whole story."

525
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,720
你可能觉得自己明白
You might think you understand,

526
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,290
-但其实不明白  -不明白
- but you don't. - You don't.

527
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,930
你今天过得怎么样  还好吗
So, how are you today? All right?

528

-谢谢  -希望很快能再见面
- Thanks. - Hope to see you again soon.

535
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,470
我会再来的
I'll... I'll come back, yeah.

536
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:01,200
人特别好  他很有天赋
Really good man. He's got a gift...

537
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,680
是  比利  等下
Yeah. Hey, Billy, hang on.

538
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,060
医生
Hey, Doc.

539
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,730
你的手表
Your watch.

540
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:12,030
你的手表丢了  你当时担心那个孩子  得了

古雪氏
Goocher's.

542
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:16,710
什么
What?

543
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,540
得了古氏或者高氏的那个孩子  骨头的病
The kid with Goocher's or Gaucher's. The bone thing.

544
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,120
高雪氏症
Gaucher's disease.

545
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,000
对
Right.

546
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,710
你在医院的洗手间洗手
You were washing your hands in the hospital bathroom

547
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:32,090
你把它放在洗手液旁边了
and you left it on the soap dispenser.

548
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,930
去看看洗手液旁边就行了
Just check on the soap dispenser.

549
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:37,970
-很高兴认识你  -好

551
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:47,430
{\an8}约翰·道尔顿医生

552
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,900
我也希望能说清楚
I wish I could say.

553
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:51,270
碰巧猜到的
Lucky guess.

554
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,650
瞎说
My ass.

555
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:01,240
应该是直觉  直觉告诉我的
Intuition, I suppose. Like a feeling in my gut. Maybe a...

556
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:03,790
碰巧猜中了
A lucky guess.

557
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,000
你想在这里做什么
What do you wanna do here?

558
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:08,960
什么意思
What do you mean?

559
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,500
我是说在弗雷泽  你为什么来这里
I mean here in Frazier. Why are you here?

560
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,270
别跟我说套话  丹
And don't bullshit me, Dan.

561
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:17,470
我更相信自己的直觉
I'm prone to gut feelings of my own.

562
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,800
我不知道  我也说不好
I don't know. I don't know.

563
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,470
做些跟我以前做的不一样的事
Something different than I've been doing.

564
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,390
好一点的事
Something better.

565
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,810
老实说  做什么都比以前好
Anything's better, frankly.

566
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:32,730
你做礼拜吗
You go to church?

567
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:34,880
重要吗
Does it matter?

568
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,030
你有信仰吗  比你
Do you believe in something? Something...

569
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,240
更宏大的东西
bigger than you?

570
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,160
信仰不能让我们成为更好的人
Our... Our beliefs don't make us better people.

571
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:48,210
行动才能让我们成为更好的人
Our actions make us better people.

572
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,230
比利说  你有过做护工的经验
So, Billy says you have orderly experience.

573
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:54,090
是的
That's right.

574
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:55,960
你现在有工作吗
You workin' right now?

00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,840
在迷你镇做零工 帮忙看小火车
A few shifts at Teenytown. Helping with the train.

576
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:03,390
我每周在利文顿临终安养院工作三天
'Cause I do three days a week at Rivington House, the hospice.

577
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,270
好的护工很难找
Good orderly is tough to find.

578
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:06,640
留住更难
Tougher to keep.

579
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,940
你害怕垂死的人吗
Do dying people bother you?

580
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:11,400
不怕
No.

581
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,310
我们都会死
We're all dying.

582
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:16,940
这世界就是个空气清新的大型安养院
The world is one big hospice with fresh air.

583
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,950
你好啊
Well, hi there.

584
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:14,580
-我睡了多久...  -几天
- How long was I... - Oh, few days.

585
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:17,590
你说不会疼的
You said it didn't hurt.

586
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:21,590
现在不疼了  对吧
Doesn't now, does it?

587
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,890
当时感觉我要死了
Felt like I was dying.

588
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:26,890
我知道
I know.

589
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:28,350
你确实死了
You did.

590
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:32,560
你把我复活了
You brought me back.

591
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,060
等你吃了东西就会好受些
You'll feel better when you eat.

592
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:36,020
我还是人类吗
Am I still human?

593
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:38,860
你在乎吗
Do you care?

You're scared of me.

Anything.

晚安  亲爱的
Goodnight, my heart.

别去烦他
Let him be.

608
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:16,460
阿兹里  别烦他
Azreel, leave him be.

609
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:27,760
阿兹
Azzie?

610
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:30,640
阿兹  过来
Azzie, come on.

611
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:34,390
过来  阿兹
Come on. Azzie.

612
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,640
医生
Doc.

613
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:38,100
是你吗  医生
That you, Doc?

614
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:40,230
不  我不是医生
No, I'm not a doctor.

615
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,190
需要我帮你叫医生过来吗
Do you want me to get you a doctor?

616
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,190
猫到我的床上来了
The cat's on my bed.

617
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:45,580
我把它弄走
I'll move her.

618
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:46,440
不
No.

619
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:48,700
我知道它会来
I knew she would be.

620
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:53,240
这只猫似乎一直都知道
That cat always seems to know...

621
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:56,790
大限是什么时候
when it's time.

622
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,960
-我猜大限到了  -不
- I guess it's time. - No.

623
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,840
阿兹就是一只傻乎乎的猫
It's just Azzie being a silly old cat.

624
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:04,800
不
Nope.

625
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,340
自从我来到这里就一直这样
Been that way ever since I got here.

626
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:11,090
这只猫知道
The cat knows

627
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,550
什么时候该长睡不醒了
when it's time to go to sleep.

628
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,560
大家都知道
Everybody knows that.

629
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,980
我要死了
I'm gonna die.

630
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,240
是的
Yes.

631
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:33,670
我帮你叫人来
Let me get you someone.

632
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,410
不
No.

633
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,120
知道大限到了
Known it was comin'.

634
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,460
不代表就不感到害怕了
Doesn't make it less scary.

635
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:44,960
是的
Yeah.

636
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,210
但也许就像你说的
But maybe it's just like you say,

637
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:49,380
只是睡过去了
just going to sleep.

638
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:53,680
没什么好怕的  只是睡着了
I mean, there's nothing scary. It's just sleeping.

639
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:56,390
你真是奇怪的医生
You're a strange type of doctor.

640
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,730
-我说过了  我不是医生  -我觉得你是
- I told you, I'm not a doctor. - Oh, I think you are.

641
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,650
睡梦医生
Doctor Sleep.

642
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:07,000
医生  我怕会疼  会很黑
Doc, I am so scared it's gonna hurt, or be dark,

643
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,170
或者会化为虚无  我不想...
or... or be nothing at all. And I don't wanna...

644
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,570
没什么好怕的
Nothing to be scared of.

645
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,280
只是睡着而已
Just going to sleep.

646
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:20,830
终于能真正安宁地睡着
Finally, true, restful sleep.

647
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,960
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

648
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:28,800
谢谢你  医生
Thank you, Doc.

649
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:33,070
我不应该在这里  我去帮你叫...
Look, I shouldn't be here. Let me go get you some...

650
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:34,590
不  不用
No, no, no.

651
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:38,390
你恰恰应该在这里
You're exactly where you should be.

652
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:41,810
就在这里
Exactly.

653
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:48,440
我看见我的妻子了
I see my wife.

654
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:40,290
{\an8}你好

655
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:02,520
{\an8}你好

656
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:50,870
{\an8}{\pos(192,108.8)}第三章

657
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,870
{\an8}{\pos(192,164)}小间谍

658
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,880
我是丹  我酗酒
Dan, alcoholic.

659
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:19,380
{\an8}{\pos(192,99.2)}八年后

660
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:17,210
你好  丹
Hi, Dan.

661
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:19,380
我不是一个善于言辞的人
I'm not much of a speech guy.

662
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,680
我觉得我应该握着这个纪念章
I just thought I'd hold the chip and

663
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:24,850
想到什么说什么
talk about whatever popped up.

664
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,350
我站在了这里
So, here I am.

665
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,560
我想到了我爸
And I'm thinkin' about my dad.

666
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,190
我有一次见过他手里拿着这样的纪念章
I saw a chip like this in his hand once.

667
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,780
就在他去世前的几个月
A couple months before he died.

668
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,820
五个月纪念章  我很确定
Five month chip, I'm pretty sure.

669
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,160
有一次他喝醉后伤害了我
He hurt me once when he was drunk.

670
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,330
弄断了我的胳膊
Broke my arm.

671
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,040
然后他就戒酒了
Then he dried right out.

672
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:02,090
我五岁时他去世了  所以我了解他的唯一方式
He died when I was five, so the only way I got to know him,

673
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:06,490
真正了解他的方式  就在我堕落的时候
really got to know him, was when I went dark.

674
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:10,480
我喝得天昏地暗的时候
When I... When I drank to dull the...

675
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,100
或者
or, uh...

676
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:15,360
我想要暴打别人的时候
whenever I wanted to break someone's face,

677
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:19,740
因为喝酒  发脾气以及愤怒
'cause the drinking and the temper and the anger,

678
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,210
都是他遗传给我的
those things in me were his.

679
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:23,990
这些是我对他的全部了解
And they were all I could know of him.

680
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:30,760
但是现在  我对他的了解有所不同
But now, well, now I get to know him a little different...

681
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:35,040
因为他也曾站在这样的一个房间里
'cause he also stood in a room like this once...

682
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:40,550
希望为了我和我妈好起来
wanting to get well for me and my mom.

683
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:44,760
他手里握着这样的纪念章
And he held the chip in his hand

684
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:46,890
上面写着五个月
and the chip said five months,

685
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,310
在那天  他...
and on that day, he...

686
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:51,140
在一切发生之前
Before it all...

687
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:55,750
那天  他最大的愿望
Well, on that day, all he wanted in the world

688
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,730
就是站在我今天所站的位置
was to stand where I'm standing now.

689
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:01,030
而我做到了  所以
And here I am, so

690
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,410
谢谢大家给我们两个的机会
thank you for us both, I guess.

691
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:08,240
这个也是杰克·托伦斯的
This is for Jack Torrance.

692
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:28,970
查理
Hey, Charlie.

693
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,140
医生
Doc?

694
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:41,280
看来我不需要问你为什么这个时候来
Guess I don't need to ask why you're here at this hour.

695
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:44,780
你疼吗
Do you have pain?

696
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:48,030
要我去找克劳戴特给你拿药吗
Do you want me to get Claudette to bring you a pill?

697
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:50,950
药没用了
Pill won't matter.

698
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:56,000
我听说过你的上门服务
I heard about these house calls.

699
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:02,050
睡梦医生来拜访的真实原因
What a visit from Doctor Sleep really is.

700
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:06,680
你都看到了什么  医生
So, what do you see, Doc?

701
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,520
我看到了你的双胞胎儿子
I see your twin sons.

702
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,520
四岁
Four years old.

703
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:20,480
你能看到他们吗
Can you see them?

704
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:22,780
能
I do.

705
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:25,990
法尔毛拖拉机
Farmall tractor.

706
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:28,990
座位上有一把条纹雨伞
A striped umbrella over the seat.

707
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,280
五岁
Five years old,

708
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:33,910
拉着红色的小车
pulling a red wagon.

709
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,710
主啊  快瞧瞧
Lord, look at that.

710
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:41,920
就像一副纸牌
Like a deck of cards.

711
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,920
全部按序排列
All out of order.

712
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:49,590
我并不害怕地狱  医生
I'm not scared of hell, Doc.

713
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:56,100
我度过了体面的一生
Uh, I lived a decent life.

714
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:59,400
再说我觉得并没有地狱
I don't think there is such a place anyway.

715
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:01,610
我猜我只是害怕
I guess I'm scared...

716
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:04,730
化为虚无
there's nothing.

717
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:08,950
从虚无中出生
There was nothing before.

718
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:16,540
万一  死后也是虚无呢
So, what if there's nothing after?

719
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:19,960
生命没有终点  查理
We don't end, Charlie.

720
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,750
我非常确定
I know that for certain.

721
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:24,960
其他的东西我了解不多  但是
I don't know much else... but

722
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,090
我知道生命没有终点
I know that we don't end.

723
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,510
蓝莓
Blueberries.

724
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:39,600
我能尝到我妈妈从前种的蓝莓
I can taste blueberries my mother used to grow.

725
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:42,150
你能尝到吗
Can you taste them?

726
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:43,650
我尝到了
Yeah, I can.

727
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:48,820
我还能听到你那台老收音机里放着法兰克的歌
And I can hear Frank on your old radio.

728
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,030
你总是把它放在工具台上  摆在工具旁边
The one you used to have on your workbench next to your tools.

{\an8}早上好

737
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:29,110
好久不见  笔友
Been a minute, little pen pal.

738
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:43,270
{\an8}上学

739
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:47,000
阿布拉  该上学了
Abra? School.

740
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,920
好  我知道
Fine, I know.

741
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,150
大爷  看到萝西了吗
Hey, Gramps, you seen Rosie?

742
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:12,150
瞭望塔
Watchtower.

743
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:15,860
你还好吗
You feelin' okay?

744
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:18,120
好得不得了
Peachy keen.

745
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,570
抱歉打扰你了
Sorry to interrupt.

746
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:42,520
有收获吗
Any luck?

747
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:44,810
快了
Gettin' closer.

748
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:47,730
我觉得他应该在爱荷华
He's somewhere in Iowa, I think.

749
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:52,190
找到他后  我们就要开始长途公路旅行
We'll all take a nice long road trip once I'm sure I've found him.

750
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:56,820
在我找到他之前  我们
Until I do, we...

751
01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:00,080
你得开一个罐子  萝西
You gotta open a canister, Rosie.

752
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:02,190
我们六个月前吸过灵气  乌鸦
We took steam six months ago, Crow.

753
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,870
六个月算不了什么
Six months is nothing.

754
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,240
特拉华州那孩子灵气不够强
That kid in Delaware wasn't so steamy

755
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,620
而且已经开始显现了
and it's already showing.

756
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:10,140
你看到弗力克大爷的头发了吗
You see Grampa Flick's hair, yeah?

757
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:10,920
看到了
Yeah.

758
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:12,550
我觉得他状态不太好
I don't think he's well.

759
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:15,940
尼克松执政的时候弗力克大爷就不太好了
Grampa Flick hasn't been well since Nixon was in office.

760
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:16,720
我知道
I know.

761
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:20,930
但是我们需要进食  所有人都需要
But we need to eat. All of us.

762
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:24,100
罐子不够了吗
Are the canisters low?

763
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:25,580
当然不是
'Course not.

764
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:29,270
马上就能猎杀了  没必要再浪费一个
Just no need to waste one if you're close to the kill.

765
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:31,900
萝西
Rosie.

766
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,690
我可能需要进食才能找到他
I might need it just to find him.

767
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,260
以前世界上的灵气比现在要多
There used to be more steam in the world, you know?

768
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:42,370
别傻了  得了吧
Oh, don't be daft. Come on.

769
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:43,510
正如凡人们说的
That's like when rubes say,

770
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:46,300
"五十年前  邻里之前友好得多"
"50 years ago, people used to be more neighborly."

771
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:47,560
但这是事实  萝西
But it's true, Rosie.

772
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,830
世界上的灵气越来越少  也越来越微弱
There's less steam out there, and it's weaker, too.

773
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:52,100
我不知道是因为他们的手机还是饮食
I don't know if it's their cell phones or diets

774
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:53,270
又或是电视剧什么的
or their Netflix or what,

775
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:55,690
我最近都感觉不到他们了
but I am not picking up many scents these days,

776
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:57,190
即使我能感受到  萝西  也没有那么...
and the ones that I do, Rosie, are just not that...

777
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:59,400
今晚我开一个罐子帮大家度过难关
I'll open a canister tonight to tide everyone over.

778
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,510
谢谢
Thank you.

779
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:09,620
-你知道吗  萝西  -知道什么
- You know it, Rosie. - I know what?

780
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:10,910
这就是你每天都到这上面来的原因
It's why you're up here every day.

781
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:13,860
无论你对大家怎么说  你每天都会上来
It's why you're always up here no matter what you tell the others.

782
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:16,260
这世界灵气不再充裕
The world's not as steamy

783
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,360
你在寻找一个灵气强大的人
and you are looking for a whale.

784
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:05,750
{\an8}{\pos(192.6,95.2)}爱荷华州  阿代尔

785
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:09,080
你看那个孩子  十九号
Oh, watch this kid. Number 19.

786
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:11,040
那孩子是个天才
That kid is a natural.

787
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,500
他每次都能击中球
He hits the ball every time.

788
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,250
就像能看透投手的想法一样
Like he can read the pitcher's mind.

789
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,050
是吗
Is that right?

790
01:03:25,570 --> 01:03:28,780
看见了吧  早晚有一天  会有球探
See? You watch, one of these days, one of those talent scouts

791
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:31,440
听说这个布莱德  你就等着瞧吧
is gonna get wind of Brad there. You watch.

792
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:55,170
你好啊  十九号
Hey, 19,

793
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:57,290
刚才看了你的比赛
just saw your game.

794
01:03:58,310 --> 01:04:00,230
你已经可以参加职业联赛了
You are ready for the majors.

795
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:02,150
-打得真漂亮  -谢谢
- Well played. - Thanks.

796
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:03,300
你是要回家吗
Hey, you headin' home?

797
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:06,050
上车吗  我载你一程
You wanna hop in? I'll give you a ride.

798
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:08,890
不用  挺近的
No, it's real close.

799
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:10,430
不用了
I'm good.

800
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:14,190
没事的
It's okay.

801
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:18,520
我们是朋友  你想上车  我们带你回家
We're friends. You wanna hop in. We'll take you right home.

802
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:20,650
你可以带我回家
You can take me right home.

803
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,150
你相信我
You trust me.

804

求你们了
Please.

815
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:52,240
你要伤害我吗
Are you gonna hurt me?

是的

该死  我以为他还能再撑几分钟
Damn. I thought he had another few minutes in him.

842
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:44,560
准备好了吗
Okay, ready?

843
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,160
他们杀了他
They killed him.

844
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:03,030
他们杀了他
They killed him.

845
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:09,990
没事了
It's okay.

{\an8}谋杀
谁
棒球男孩

848
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:37,780
刚刚有个窥视者
We had a looker.

849
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:43,940
今晚
Tonight?

850
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:46,810
对
Yeah.

851
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,780
灵气强吗
Big steam?

852
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:51,870
亲爱的  灵气极强
Oh, honey, it was huge.

853
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:54,530
在哪
Where?

854
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:57,970
应该是东海岸
East Coast, I think.

855
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:03,990
你是说有人在2400公里之外窥视了我们
You're saying someone looked in from 1,500 miles away?

856
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,690
也许更远
Maybe further.

857
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:10,100
男孩还是女孩
Boy or girl?

858
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,860
应该是女孩
Girl, I think.

859
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:14,470
她很快就离开了
She was out of there so fast.

860
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:17,170
但是我发誓  乌鸦老爹
But I swear, Crow Daddy,

861
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:20,840
我从没感受到过这样的力量
I haven't felt power like that,

862
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,530
这样原始的力量
raw power like that

863
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:26,850
太久没有过了
in so long.

864
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:29,960
那我们需要调查一下
Then we need to look into it.

865
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:32,130
-越快越好  -对
- Sooner the better. - Yeah.

866
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:34,020
万一吓到了她的父母
Case her parents freak out,

867
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:36,290
送她去精神病院
send her to a psychiatrist.

868
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:39,980
医院会她吃药  灵气就被毁了
You know, they get her on pills, could ruin the steam.

869
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:40,710
可能会抑制她...
Might muffle her just...

870
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:42,490
给这孩子吃帕罗西汀
No, giving Paxil to this kid,

871
01:11:42,490 --> 01:11:46,220
就像是在探照灯上包上保鲜膜
it's like throwing a piece of Saran Wrap over a searchlight.

872
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,020
我不知道她在哪
I don't know where she is,

873
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:51,250
等她下次再来  她一定会再来的
but when she comes back, and she'll be back,

874
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,340
我会准备好的  亲爱的
oh, I'll be ready, honey.

875
01:11:56,990 --> 01:11:58,480
我会准备好的
I'll be ready.

Guess what.

881

我交到新朋友了
I made a new friend.

882

他叫丹
His name's Dan.

883
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:11,360

Yeah? At school?

884
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,150
不  他不住在这
No. He doesn't live here.

885
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:15,960
他住得很近
I mean, he lives close.

886
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,320
应该是在弗雷泽
Frazier, I think.

887
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:18,710
没什么大不了的
No big deal.

01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:20,530
阿布  你还好吗
Abs, are you okay?

Last night, I...

01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:23,580
我没事
I'm okay.

891
01:13:24,490 --> 01:13:25,610
昨晚的事很抱歉
Sorry about that.

892
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:28,950
我知道你的脑子有时候就像无线电
I know that head of yours is like a radio sometimes.

893
01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:33,310
你会收听到一些奇怪的频道
And you pick up some weird stations.

894
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:35,010
没什么奇怪的
Nothing weird like that.

895
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:36,830
不会再发生了
Not anymore.

896
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:47,610
天呐
My God.

897
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:50,380
我得学习  不学习的话
I've gotta study. If I don't study...

01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,760
跑阵  传给十一号然后
Running play. Hand-off to 11 and...

899
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:56,460
记不住的话教练会杀了我的
Coach is gonna kill me if I don't get these.

900
01:13:57,650 --> 01:13:59,500
他为什么不喜欢我
Why doesn't he like me?

901
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:01,470
因为头发吗  我应该换个发型
My hair? I should change my hair.

902
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,160
那个怪胎又盯着我看了
The freak is staring at me again.

903
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,850
她看什么看
What is she staring at?

904
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:06,210

还以为你中风了  托尼是谁
Thought you was having a stroke. Who's Tony?

What?

939
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,480
你一直在说  "请帮帮我  托尼"
You kept saying, "Please help me, Tony."

01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:28,950
-跟我说说  -那个窥视者
- Talk to me. - The looker?

944
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:31,290
她又找到我了
Yeah, she found me again.

945
01:20:31,630 --> 01:20:32,970
-怎么会  -我不知道
- How? - I don't know.

946
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:34,370
我不在乎
I don't care.

947
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:37,660
我们得抓到她  乌鸦  必须抓到
We have to have her, Crow. We have to.

948
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,410
她知道你是谁  我们在哪吗
Does she know who you are? Where we are?

949

不  我不知道  应该没有...
No, I don't know. I don't think...

950
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,690
那不重要  听着
That's not the important... Look.

951
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:46,970
-我说她的灵气很强  对吧  -嗯
- I said she's huge steam, right? - Mm-hmm.

952
01:20:46,970 --> 01:20:48,870
事实上比那还强
Yeah, it's even bigger than that.

953
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:50,690
我试图在她脑中与她对抗
I tried to turn around in her

954
01:20:50,690 --> 01:20:54,000
而她不费吹灰之力就把我赶了出来
and she blew me out of her like I was nothing.

955
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,550
-胡说吧  -不  我从未有过这种遭遇
- Bullshit. - No. Never happened to me, ever.

956
01:20:56,970 --> 01:20:58,940
我以前会说这不可能
I would have said that was impossible.

957
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:02,740
我们是要吃了她  还是转化她
Is she food or do we turn her?

958
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:05,250
我们不转化她
We don't turn her.

959
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:06,890
萝西  你确定吗
Rosie, are you sure?

960
01:21:06,890 --> 01:21:08,140
如果她真如你所说  那...
If she's what you say she is, then...

961
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:11,160
我们真结族里面不能允许有这种能力的人
Then we don't want anyone with that power in the Knot.

962
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:13,220
天啊  好好想想
Jeez. Think about it.

963
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:22,120
万一她都不是呢
What if she's neither?

964
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:23,800
什么意思
What do you mean?

965
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:26,090
我们不杀她
I mean, we don't kill her.

966
01:21:26,430 --> 01:21:28,130
也不转化她
And we don't turn her.

967
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:30,780
想想如果是一头奶牛
Think of a cow.

968
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:34,300
杀了它  能吃一个月的肉
You butcher one, that gives you meat for a month.

969
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:36,970
让它活着
Keep it alive,

970
01:21:38,030 --> 01:21:39,680
好好照顾
take care of it,

971
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:43,070
能喝几年的牛奶
it gives you milk for years.

972
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:45,210
-萝西  我们从没那么做过  -我知道
- Rosie, we've never tried that. - I know.

973
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:47,380
因为有灵气的头脑很危险
Because a steam head is dangerous.

974
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:48,760
让它活着  可能会有危险
You keep it alive, it could be dangerous.

975
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,660
我知道  重点...
I know. The point...

976
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,140
乌鸦  重点是
The point, Crow,

977
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:56,710
她就是我的大白鲸
is she's the great white whale.

978
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:58,820
我要她
And I want her.

979
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,370
我要她
I want her.

You tracked me down?

比我想得容易  像我大脑中有导航系统一样
It was easier than I thought. Like GPS, but in my head.

991
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:33,910
听着  我无意冒犯  但在如今

01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:07,580
他们害怕
They're scared of it,

1005
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:09,850
但他们以为能力消失了  除了几件事
but they think it's gone except for a few things.

1006
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:12,240
比如我妈妈有时会让我帮她
Like, my mom sometimes asks me to help her

1007
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,920
找她弄丢的东西
find something she's lost.

1008
01:25:14,030 --> 01:25:15,700
上个月  是她的车钥匙
Last month, it was her car keys.

1009
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:18,390
她落在了车库里我爸爸的工作台上
She left them on my dad's worktable in the garage.

1010
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:20,330
但他们避而不谈
But they don't talk about it.

1011
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:24,150
如果我使用能力  他们会用异样的眼神看我
Or if I use it, they look at me different.

1012
01:25:24,470 --> 01:25:26,040
或者完全不看我
Or not at all.

1013
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:28,270
有一次一整天都没看我
Not for a whole day once.

1014
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:30,580
不肯直视我的眼睛
Wouldn't look me in the eyes.

1015
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,630
所以我尽力不去使用
So, I try not to use it.

1016
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:36,590
因为如果别人发现了
Because if people find out,

1017
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,060
会认为我是个怪胎  知道吧
"Eek, a freak." You know?

1018
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:42,140
你肯定知道
Sure you know.

1019
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,410
你也尽力不去使用
You try not to use it, too.

1020
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,580
你已经坚持很久了
You've been trying a long time,

1021
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:52,570
她也不肯直视你的眼睛
and she couldn't look you in your eyes either.

1022
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:57,830
我小时候
When I was a kid,

1023
01:25:57,830 --> 01:26:01,080
我不理解闪灵  我叫它"托尼"
I didn't understand the shining. I called it "Tony."

1024
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:03,710
我以为他是我的幻想好友
I thought he was my imaginary friend.

1025
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:06,420
我以为你是我的幻想好友
I thought you were my imaginary friend...

1026
01:26:06,910 --> 01:26:08,600
那样想了很久
for a long time.

1027
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:11,990
我们这样的人有多少
How many of us are out there?

1028
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:15,780
很多人都有一点闪灵能力
There's a lot of people who have a little bit of shine,

1029
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:17,380
他们自己都不知道
they don't even know it.

1030
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:18,900
他们总在妻子伤心时
They always seem to come home with flowers

1031
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:20,050
正好带着花回家
when their wives are sad,

1032
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:22,750
或者没有复习就考得很好
or they do well on the school test they didn't study for.

1033
01:26:22,930 --> 01:26:24,320
但我一辈子也只认识
But I only met two or three people

1034
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:27,190
两三个知道自己有闪灵能力的人
in my whole life who knew they shined.

1035
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:31,220
棒球男孩有闪灵能力
The baseball boy shined.

1036
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:33,620
他叫布莱德利·特雷弗
His name was Bradley Trevor.

1037
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:38,180
这些人
These people...

1038
01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:41,950
他们看起来都不像人  抓走了他
they look like people anyway, they took him.

1039
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:44,530
他们吃了他
And they ate him.

1040
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:47,830
他们吃了他的闪灵
They ate his shine.

1041
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:50,200
你可以感觉到吗
You could feel it?

1042
01:26:51,190 --> 01:26:53,680
我觉得他们能感觉到我
And they could feel me, I think.

1043
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:56,420
至少其中一位能  一位女士
At least one of them did. A lady.

1044
01:26:57,630 --> 01:26:59,210
戴帽子的女士
The lady with the hat.

1045
01:27:00,570 --> 01:27:03,630
我想找到他们  阻止他们
I wanna find them, stop them,

1046
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:06,710
因为我觉得他们杀害过其他很多孩子
because I think they've done this to a lot of other kids, too.

1047
01:27:08,010 --> 01:27:10,630
所以我得做些什么  对吧
So, I have to do something, right?

1048
01:27:11,210 --> 01:27:13,120
你为什么要来这里
Why did you come here?

1049
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:14,910
为什么是我
Why me?

1050
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:16,560
因为你能听到我的声音
Because you can hear me.

1051
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:19,100
你会相信我  你也有闪灵能力
You'd believe me. You shine, too.

1052
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:21,580
他们伤害我们这样的人
And they hurt people like us.

1053
01:27:23,370 --> 01:27:25,290
你会怎么做
I mean, what would you do?

1054
01:27:28,230 --> 01:27:29,590
如果你能拿到他身上的东西
If you could get something of his,

1055
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:30,680
如果你能去爱荷华
if you could go to Iowa...

1056
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:32,830
-等等  -我可以帮你找到他
- Whoa, hang on. - I can help you find him.

1057
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:34,410
那样他的父母就能知道他的下落
Then his parents would know where he was.

1058
01:27:34,410 --> 01:27:36,450
至少可以好好埋葬他
They could bury him right, at least.

1059
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:38,420
我们还可以拿到他的手套
We could also get his glove.

1060
01:27:38,590 --> 01:27:40,560
如果我能碰到手套  就可以追踪他们
If I can touch that glove, I can track them.

1061
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:41,330
等等  等等
Easy. Easy.

1062
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:44,530
因为大块头巴里  那人好像叫这个名字
Because Barry the Chunk, I think that was his name,

1063
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:46,860
他们杀死他之前的一段时间
for a while, before they killed him,

1064
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,620
那人戴过他的手套
he was wearing it.

1065
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:02,680
阿布拉  回家去
Abra, go home.

1066
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,690
想想你的学业  想想你的父母
Think about your school. Think about your parents.

1067
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:07,070
想想你的余生
Think about the rest of your life.

1068
01:28:07,070 --> 01:28:09,750
别追踪这些人
Don't chase these people.

1069
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,710
别激怒他们
Don't aggravate them.

1070
01:28:11,710 --> 01:28:14,350
无论如何  都不要吸引他们的注意力
And whatever you do, don't attract their attention.

1071
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,420
别使用闪灵能力
Don't shine.

1072
01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:18,320
想想办法  任何办法
Find something, anything...

1073
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:22,340
差不多是任何办法吧  阻止你的闪灵
Well, almost anything, to stop that shine of yours.

1074
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:24,990
低调行事  掩藏你的闪灵  祈求上帝
Keep your head down, keep your shine down and hope to God

1075
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,420
让那些人  或者类似的生物
that these people or anything like them,

1076
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:29,560
不会发现你
that they don't see you.

1077
01:28:30,670 --> 01:28:32,480
如果他们发现了你  他们会回来
If they see you, they come back.

1078
01:28:33,190 --> 01:28:34,770
阿布拉  你明白吗
Abra, do you hear me?

1079
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:37,490
他们会回来
They come back.

1080
01:28:40,510 --> 01:28:42,460
低调行事  注意安全
Keep your head down. Stay safe.

1081
01:28:44,290 --> 01:28:45,690
对不起
I'm sorry.

1082
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:00,720
那年很不容易
Things were tough that year.

1083
01:29:00,730 --> 01:29:02,820
很多演员都失业了
A lot of actors were out of work.

1084
01:29:04,770 --> 01:29:05,950
大家好
Hey, fellas.

1085
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:07,040
杂耍大明星埃尔默·福德来了
Here comes Elmer Fudd that big vaudeville star.

1086
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,550
怎么了
What is it?

1087
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:10,610
没事  医生
Oh, it's nothing, Doc.

1088
01:29:11,310 --> 01:29:12,750
没事
It's nothing.

1089
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:15,060
想起爸爸了
Thinking about Dad.

1090
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:19,630
我没有
No, I'm not.

1091
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:23,030
你有  而且你不愿想起
You are. And you don't want to.

1092
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:29,510
别担心我  医生
Don't worry about me, Doc.

1093
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,530
我没事
I'm fine.

1094
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:35,480
我们都没事
We're fine.

1095
01:30:13,010 --> 01:30:14,450
阿兹
Hey, Azzie.

1096
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:29,840
你今晚搞错了吧
You got your wires crossed tonight.

1097
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,270
那是个空房间  阿兹
That room's empty, Az.

1098
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:40,340
那房间里没人
There's no one in that room.

1099
01:30:48,970 --> 01:30:51,640
等等  医生
Whoa! Hang on, Doc.

1100
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:53,900
迪克
Dick.

1101
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,250
我很抱歉
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1102
01:30:56,510 --> 01:30:57,700
我...我还以为是...
I... I... I thought it was...

1103
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:59,840
以为我是眺望酒店里那些东西
Thought I was from the Overlook.

1104
01:30:59,910 --> 01:31:01,670
差点把我锁起来
Almost locked me up.

1105
01:31:02,050 --> 01:31:04,470
那些老鬼魂还来找你吗
Still getting visits from them old ghosts?

1106
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:06,420
没有  好几年都没来了
No, not for years.

1107
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:07,830
霍勒斯·德文特是最后一位
Horace Derwent was the last one,

1108
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:09,840
他的西装上都是五彩纸屑
confetti on his suit.

1109
01:31:09,850 --> 01:31:11,990
和我说  "派对很棒吧"
Said, "Great party, isn't it?"

1110
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,220
脸上挂着欠揍的笑容  直到我把他关进盒子
Shit-eating grin on his face till I pulled out a box for him.

1111
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:17,080
他的笑容消失得很快
That grin went fast.

1112
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:20,720
我过去一直都没想到要问你
Hey, it never occurred to me to ask you back then.

1113
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:22,500
把他们关进盒子后会怎么样
What happens to them in those boxes?

1114
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:24,030
他们会死在里面吗
Do they die in there?

1115
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:25,480
你在乎吗
Do you care?

1116
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:30,780
我想你了
I missed you.

1117
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:32,640
已经很久没见了吗
Has it been a long time?

1118
01:31:33,550 --> 01:31:35,040
我分不清
Can't tell.

1119
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:39,150
这个世界现在对我来说是一个梦中梦
This world is a dream of a dream to me now.

1120
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:42,320
八年多一点
Eight years. Little more.

1121
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,570
上次我见你时
Last time I saw you,

1122
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:46,550
你陷入了低谷
you was at the bottom.

1123
01:31:47,730 --> 01:31:49,330
现在看起来好多了
You look better now.

1124
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:51,150
你为什么来这里
Why are you here?

1125
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:54,560
我来这里是因为一切都是轮回
I'm here because it all comes 'round.

1126
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:57,170
灵魂周而复始  医生
Ka's a wheel, Doc.

1127
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:00,950
听好了  孩子
You listen, son.

1128
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,870
我来这里很痛苦  所以我只说一次
It hurts to be here, so I'll only say it once.

1129
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:07,290
如果那些空洞的恶魔
These empty devils ever found you

1130
01:32:07,290 --> 01:32:08,850
在你小时候找到了你
when you was a tyke,

1131
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:11,330
只要他们嗅到你的一丝气息
if they'd even sniffed you,

1132
01:32:11,540 --> 01:32:13,210
你早就死了
you'd be long dead.

1133
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:17,490
他们就像是大地患上的癌症
They're on the land like a cancer on the skin.

1134
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:21,190
他们曾在沙漠里骑骆驼
Once, they rode camels in the desert.

1135
01:32:21,190 --> 01:32:24,770
也曾组织车队穿越东欧
Once, they drove caravans across Eastern Europe.

1136
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:27,750
他们以尖叫为食
They eat screams,

1137
01:32:28,030 --> 01:32:30,080
以痛苦为饮
and drink pain,

1138
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:33,640
他们已经注意到了那个小女孩
and they've noticed that little girl.

1139
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:36,130
他们可能会杀了她
They might kill her,

1140
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:39,070
可能会转化她
might turn her,

1141
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:43,550
或者养着她  直到她被榨干
or might keep her till she's all used up,

1142
01:32:43,550 --> 01:32:45,170
那是最坏的情况
and that'd be worst of all.

1143
01:32:45,170 --> 01:32:47,250
你不能让他们得逞
You can't let 'em.

1144
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,950
为什么是我
Why me?

1145
01:32:51,430 --> 01:32:53,570
因为她找到了你
Because she found you.

1146
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:56,970
因为她出现了  见鬼  医生  为什么是我
Because she showed up. Hell, Doc, why me?

1147
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:59,660
你也有一天突然走进我的厨房
You just walked on into my kitchen one day,

1148
01:32:59,660 --> 01:33:01,270
到现在我都解脱不了
and I'm still on the hook.

1149
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:03,340
我到底该怎么做
What the hell am I supposed to do?

1150
01:33:05,390 --> 01:33:07,670
她要什么就给她
Get her what she asked for.

1151
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,180
你不会再见到我了  医生
You won't see me again, Doc.

1152
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:15,060
这是我最后的梦
This is my last dream.

1153
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:24,530
看来你成长为一个好人了  孩子
It seems to me you grew up fine, son,

1154
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,970
但你还欠一笔债
but you still owe a debt.

1155
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:33,470
还清它
Pay it.

1156
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:49,450
见鬼  什么事
God, damn it. What?

1157
01:33:52,150 --> 01:33:53,920
抱歉打扰了
Sorry to interrupt.

1158
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:56,750
我告诉过你"不许打扰我"  是不是
I told you, "No distractions." Didn't I?

1159
01:33:57,070 --> 01:33:58,880
不吃不喝
Nothing to eat, nothing to drink.

1160
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:01,980
安宁平静地冥想
Just peace, quiet, and meditation.

1161
01:34:02,010 --> 01:34:05,070
我今晚要集中精力对付她  乌鸦
I need all my wits for her tonight, Crow.

1162
01:34:05,910 --> 01:34:08,320
所以我才要来  我有发现
That's why I'm here. I found something.

1163
01:34:13,390 --> 01:34:15,270
{\an8}安尼斯顿发生小型地震

1164
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:18,970
最微弱的地震能有多微弱
"How small can an earthquake be?

1165
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:21,990
安尼斯顿的里奇兰街在索科河中断
Pretty small, if the people of Richland Court,

1166
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,300
如果那里的居民可信
a short Anniston street that

1167
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:26,200
那么地震可以非常微弱
dead-ends at the Saco River, are to be believed.

1168
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,670
周二深夜
Late Tuesday night,

1169
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:30,120
这条街上几名居民称有地震
several residents of the street reported a tremor

1170
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:32,090
致使窗户作响  地板摇晃
that rattled windows, shook floors,

1171
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:35,590
架子上的玻璃器具滚落
and sent glassware tumbling from the shelves.

1172
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:38,910
尽管伦瑟姆的地质监测中心
Although the Geological Survey Center in Wrentham

1173
01:34:39,910 --> 01:34:43,120
报告上周二新英格兰地区没有地震"
reports there were no temblors in New England last Tuesday."

1174
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:45,300
你怎么想
What do you think?

1175
01:34:45,310 --> 01:34:46,850
我想  也许吧
I think, maybe.

1176
01:34:47,210 --> 01:34:51,130
不能百分百确定  但有五成可能也不错
I'm not a hundred percent, but I'll take fifty-fifty.

1177
01:34:51,510 --> 01:34:52,760
如果那真的是她
If that's actually her...

1178
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:53,270
里奇兰街
Richland Court.

1179
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:55,620
真的是她摇动了新罕布什尔的整条街
She did that, shook a whole street in New Hampshire...

1180
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:57,200
有一个可以集中调查的地方
Having a place to actually focus on,

1181
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:59,360
不是一个城镇  而是一条街
not just a town, but a street,

1182
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:02,110
会让我今晚容易得多
is gonna make things a hell of a lot easier for me tonight.

1183
01:35:03,130 --> 01:35:04,630
查得好
Good catch.

1184
01:35:10,750 --> 01:35:12,390
你要怎么对付她
How you coming at her?

1185
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:15,990
到时候她睡着了
Well, she'll be asleep.

1186
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:20,790
我探查一下  看看是不是她
I'll just wanna look around, see if she is.

1187
01:35:21,430 --> 01:35:25,140
植入一些暗示  如同小虫子
Plant some suggestions, like little worms.

1188
01:35:25,790 --> 01:35:27,570
让它们挖掘
Let them burrow.

1189
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:32,310
一百条关于她亲爱的朋友  真结族的虫子
A hundred worms about her dear friends, the Knot.

1190
01:35:33,530 --> 01:35:35,420
等我们出现
And when we roll up,

1191
01:35:36,010 --> 01:35:39,850
她会高兴得迫不及待跳上车
she'll be so happy to see us, she'll just hop right in the van.

1192
01:35:44,190 --> 01:35:46,530
如果这是她干的
If she did this...

1193
01:35:46,530 --> 01:35:48,740
她真的摇动了整条街
really shook a whole street,

1194
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:51,100
你应该小心点
I think you should be careful.

1195
01:35:51,670 --> 01:35:53,470
她只是个小女孩
She's a little girl.

1196
01:35:58,790 --> 01:36:01,000
而你永远是最凶悍的女王
And you are the queen bitch of all time.

1197
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,930
我知道
I know.

1198
01:36:03,150 --> 01:36:04,570
就是说说
Just saying.

1199
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:07,920
小心点
Be careful.

1200
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:34,220
妈妈
Mom.

1201
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:35,700
你感觉还好吗
You feeling okay?

1202
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:37,200
你没下来吃晚饭
We missed you at dinner.

1203
01:36:37,780 --> 01:36:40,990
我挺好  只是今天过得不顺
I'm okay. Just had a rough day.

1204
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:47,500
我明早要坐飞机去看奶奶
I'm flying out to see momo in the morning.

1205
01:36:48,170 --> 01:36:49,990
我会尽早回来
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1206
01:36:51,830 --> 01:36:53,480
阿布  她...
Abs, is she...

1207
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:58,980
她这次能挺过去吗
Is she gonna pull through this time?

1208
01:37:03,370 --> 01:37:04,870
我不知道
I don't know.

1209
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:07,520
我希望能
I hope so.

1210
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:09,870
告诉她我爱她
Tell her I love her.

1211
01:39:53,050 --> 01:39:55,290
接着睡  公主
Keep sleeping, princess.

1212
01:40:08,910 --> 01:40:11,040
你们这些凡人
You rubes.

1213
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:15,150
一辈子都在做小盒子
Spend your whole lives making little boxes,

1214
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:17,200
渺小的记忆
little memories.

1215
01:40:18,410 --> 01:40:21,680
你们以为这样就无比充实了
Oh, you think they make you so rich.

1216
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,760
你真该看看我的  孩子
You should see mine, kiddo.

1217
01:40:25,490 --> 01:40:28,030
我的脑子就像个大教堂
Oh, my mind's a cathedral.

1218
01:40:31,870 --> 01:40:34,530
你好啊
Well, hi there.

1219
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:00,390
他说你会回来的
He said you'd come back.

1220
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:03,260
你的确回来了
And you did.

1221
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:06,140
很好
Good.

1222
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:07,710
不
No!

1223
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:11,230
退后  退后
Get back! Get back!

1224
01:41:12,290 --> 01:41:14,710
你只是个小孩
You're just a fucking child!

1225
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:23,400
你在哪里
Where are you?

1226
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:24,350
哪里  你在哪里  哪里
Where? Where did you...? Where...?

1227
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:25,630
你在哪里  你在哪里
What did you...? Where did you...?

1228
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:28,640
不
No.

1229
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:32,490
出去  出去
Get out! Get out!

1230
01:41:32,490 --> 01:41:33,840
出去
Get out!

1231
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:20,510
萝西
Rose?

1232
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:21,880
陷阱
Trap.

1233
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:23,220
陷阱
Trap.

1234
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:24,960
发生了什么
What the hell happened?

1235
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:28,110
-那小贱人给我设了个陷阱  -老天  你的手
- Little bitch set a trap for me. - Oh, my God. Your hand.

1236
01:42:28,110 --> 01:42:29,700
萝西  萝西  冷静
Rose! Rose, calm down.

1237
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:31,780
我们知道她在哪里了  对吗  我们现在知道了
We know where she is now, right? Now we know.

1238
01:42:31,780 --> 01:42:33,320
她刚刚在我脑子里
She was in my head!

1239
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:34,870
-什么  -偷东西
- What? - Stealing!

1240
01:42:34,870 --> 01:42:36,180
她知道了什么
What does she know?

1241
01:42:36,180 --> 01:42:37,450
我不知道  我不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

1242
01:42:37,450 --> 01:42:39,660
-她知道了多少...  -我不知道
- How much does she... - I don't know!

1243
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:42,180
-我不知道  -出了个问题
- I don't know... - There's a problem.

1244
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:43,420
现在不行
Not now!

1245
01:42:43,420 --> 01:42:44,960
弗力克大爷
Grampa Flick...

1246
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,240
他开始循环了
I think he's cycling.

1247
01:42:52,610 --> 01:42:55,620
丹叔叔  丹叔叔  我伤到她了
Uncle Dan! Uncle Dan, I hurt her.

1248
01:42:55,630 --> 01:42:56,820
我真的伤到她了
I really hurt her.

1249
01:42:56,820 --> 01:42:58,050
我伤到她了  她活该
I hurt her and she deserved it

1250
01:42:58,050 --> 01:42:59,640
这还不是最棒的  最棒的是...
and that's not the best part. The best part is...

1251
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:03,060
最棒的是我进入了她的脑子  我进入了她的脑子
The best part is I got in her head. I got in her head.

1252
01:43:03,610 --> 01:43:05,840
-丹叔叔  你听到了吗  -天呐  阿布拉
- Uncle Dan? Are you there? - Oh, God, Abra.

1253
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:06,810
你能听到吗
Can you hear me?

1254
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:08,270
你做了什么
What have you done?

1255
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:26,050
跟那孩子聊聊吧
Just talk to the kid.

1256
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:29,650
如果我们要做的话  那就豁出去了
If we're gonna do this, then let's do this.

1257
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:34,450
你好  阿布拉
Hi, Abra.

1258
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:39,390
我听得到
I can hear you.

1259
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:45,400
我不明白
I don't understand.

1260
01:43:45,550 --> 01:43:46,850
你会明白的
You will.

1261
01:43:48,710 --> 01:43:50,770
我以为我们永生不死
I thought we lived forever.

1262
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:53,770
有人跟你这么保证过吗  安蒂
Did someone promise you that, Andi?

1263
01:43:54,330 --> 01:43:56,820
有人说过你不朽不灭吗
Did someone say you're immortal?

1264
01:43:57,930 --> 01:44:01,900
我说的是"长生不老  吃得好"
I said, "Live long, eat well."

1265
01:44:02,910 --> 01:44:04,980
我们能活得很久  非常久
We can live long, very long.

1266
01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:06,020
我们的确如此
And we do,

1267
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:07,530
绝大多数如此
most of us.

1268
01:44:07,730 --> 01:44:09,830
但我们吃得不好
But we haven't been eating well.

1269
01:44:11,050 --> 01:44:13,140
很长时间了
Not for a long time.

1270
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:15,780
萝西  他不行了
Rosie, he's going.

1271
01:44:17,010 --> 01:44:18,420
萝西
Rosie.

1272
01:44:24,190 --> 01:44:25,750
怎么  亲爱的
Yes, love?

1273
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:28,520
我害怕
I'm scared.

1274
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:30,420
不  你不害怕
No, you're not.

1275
01:44:31,530 --> 01:44:35,730
你目睹过王朝的兴衰
You watched empires rise and fall.

1276
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:39,220
在罗马为角斗士喝彩
Cheered the gladiators in Rome.

1277
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,860
扬帆大海
Sailed across oceans,

1278
01:44:41,870 --> 01:44:43,700
驶向新世界
to new worlds,

1279
01:44:43,890 --> 01:44:49,530
你曾猎食国王  王子  教皇
while you fed on kings, and princes, and popes.

1280
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:51,900
人们书写你的传说
They wrote myths of you,

1281
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:54,770
为你塑雕像
and made statues,

1282
01:44:55,140 --> 01:44:59,850
他们在村庄里  被窝里
and they trembled in their villages, and beds,

1283
01:44:59,980 --> 01:45:02,570
摩天大楼里战栗
and skyscrapers.

1284
01:45:03,820 --> 01:45:04,870
所以
So, no...

1285
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:08,720
你不害怕
you're not scared.

1286
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:11,700
你是王
You're a king...

1287
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:15,520
你以恐惧为食
and you eat fear.

1288
01:46:07,530 --> 01:46:08,210
兄弟
Hey, bro.

1289
01:46:08,690 --> 01:46:10,080
现在是凌晨四点
You know, it's 4:00 a.m.

1290
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,730
你和我朝夕相处  比利
You've always seen me, Billy.

1291
01:46:12,220 --> 01:46:14,820
你看人很准  这么说对吗
You have a good sense about people, is that fair to say?

1292
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:16,500
对  怎么...
Yeah, what...

1293
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:18,740
你认为我诚实吗  是好人吗
You think I'm an honest man? A good man?

1294
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:20,670
是  是  丹  我...
I do, I do. Dan, I...

1295
01:46:20,670 --> 01:46:21,540
我需要你帮忙
I need your help.

1296
01:46:22,130 --> 01:46:23,850
首先需要你听我讲个故事
The first thing I need is for you to listen to a story

1297
01:46:23,850 --> 01:46:26,280
并且尽你所能去相信我
and try harder than you've ever tried to believe me.

1298
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:44,630
如何
How's it going?

1299
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:48,740
你不是该准备上学了吗
Shouldn't you be getting ready for school?

1300
01:46:48,950 --> 01:46:51,070
是  但我想跟着
Yeah, but I wanted to tag along.

1301
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:52,860
你开了多久了
How long have you been driving?

1302
01:46:53,110 --> 01:46:54,140
几个小时吧
A few hours or so.

1303
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:56,140
我们今天夜里应该能到
We should get there tonight. Late.

1304
01:46:59,210 --> 01:46:59,870
那是谁
Who's that?

1305
01:47:00,930 --> 01:47:01,740
他是我朋友
He's my friend.

1306
01:47:03,150 --> 01:47:04,390
也许是我最好的朋友
Maybe my best friend.

1307
01:47:06,270 --> 01:47:07,720
你应该看看她的脸
You should've seen her face.

1308
01:47:08,180 --> 01:47:09,970
她害怕了  丹叔叔
She was scared, Uncle Dan.

1309
01:47:10,060 --> 01:47:11,950
就像那些孩子一样害怕
Scared like all those kids were scared.

1310
01:47:11,950 --> 01:47:13,340
那些被她杀害的孩子
All those kids she's killed.

1311
01:47:13,820 --> 01:47:16,020
我的侵入让她既愤怒又恐惧
She was so mad and so scared that I got in.

1312
01:47:16,940 --> 01:47:18,000
那是个新招数
That was a new trick.

1313
01:47:18,410 --> 01:47:19,730
我以前从来没那么做过
I've never done that before.

1314
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:21,930
我也没做过  那是什么感觉
Yeah, me neither. What was it like?

1315
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:23,880
像个图书馆
Like a library.

1316
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:26,580
我猜我们内心都是图书馆
I guess we're all libraries inside.

1317
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:28,630
你怎么做的
How'd you do it?

1318
01:47:29,290 --> 01:47:31,770
就像这样  轻轻一推
Like this. Just a little push.

1319
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:37,330
阿布拉
Abra!

1320
01:47:37,330 --> 01:47:39,220
对不起  对不起  对不起
Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry!

1321
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:46,920
-对不起  我不是故意的  -没事
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. - It's okay.

1322
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:49,770
那些盒子都是什么
What were all those boxes?

1323
01:47:50,190 --> 01:47:50,880
没什么
Nothing.

1324
01:47:51,290 --> 01:47:52,010
说谎
Liar.

1325
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:56,740
我小的时候
When I was a kid,

1326
01:47:57,940 --> 01:48:00,750
比你还小的时候  我遇到了类似这样的东西
younger than you, I bumped into something like these things

1327
01:48:00,750 --> 01:48:03,100
像他们一样吃人的东西
that ate like they do.

1328
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:06,070
只不过那不是人  是个地方
Only it wasn't a person, it was a place.

1329
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:11,030
后来他们封锁了那里  荒废了
They closed it down after and let it rot.

1330
01:48:12,550 --> 01:48:14,150
但住在那里的东西  他们...
But the things that lived there, they...

1331
01:48:16,940 --> 01:48:18,490
别再去那里乱转了
Don't go poking around in there again.

1332
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:21,380
好  我不去了  我保证
Okay, I won't. I promise.

1333
01:48:34,980 --> 01:48:37,070
我们快准备好了  正在装车
We're almost ready. We're just loading up.

1334
01:48:37,070 --> 01:48:37,800
好
Good.

1335
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:39,710
开车上路
Get the caravan on the road

1336
01:48:39,710 --> 01:48:41,510
我们一两天内就能抓到她
and we'll have her in a day or two.

1337
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:43,140
我觉得你不该去  萝西
I don't think you should come, Rosie.

1338
01:48:45,170 --> 01:48:46,720
你他妈说什么
The fuck did you just say?

1339
01:48:46,850 --> 01:48:47,870
她瞄上了你
She tagged you.

1340
01:48:48,340 --> 01:48:49,500
她进入过你的脑子
She got in your head.

1341
01:48:49,660 --> 01:48:50,640
对  那不会再发生了
Yeah, it won't happen again.

1342
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:53,470
谁知道你把她赶出去前她摸清了多少
And who knows how much she got to before you kicked her out.

1343
01:48:53,470 --> 01:48:54,670
她是我的  乌鸦
She's mine, Crow.

1344
01:48:54,670 --> 01:48:55,940
现在  据我们所知
Right now, as far as we know,

1345
01:48:55,940 --> 01:48:58,500
你是我们中她唯一可以追踪的人
you are the only one of us she could track.

1346
01:48:58,870 --> 01:49:00,370
如果她看到你要去了
Now, if she sees you coming,

1347
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:01,580
她可能会逃跑
she could run

1348
01:49:02,110 --> 01:49:03,420
或者再设一个陷阱
or set another trap.

1349
01:49:05,470 --> 01:49:06,900
我会弄晕她
I will knock her out cold.

1350
01:49:08,060 --> 01:49:10,910
我们在国家安全局的人给我弄了好货
One of our assets from the NSA gave me the good stuff.

1351
01:49:11,150 --> 01:49:13,850
能放倒她  不会有药物过量的风险
Put her out without chance of an overdose.

1352
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,750
我往南去  兜一圈
I'll head south. I'll circle around.

1353
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:19,010
从另一个方向袭击她
I'll come at her from a different direction.

1354
01:49:19,180 --> 01:49:19,980
我应该去的
I should be there.

1355
01:49:20,390 --> 01:49:22,070
你知道我说得对
You know I'm right about this.

1356
01:49:26,620 --> 01:49:27,310
行
Okay.

1357
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:31,240
你想要的话  我可以让安蒂留下陪你
I'll leave Andi here with you, if you want.

1358
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:34,040
不  你们需要全部的战力
No, no, you'll need your strength, all of you.

1359
01:49:34,420 --> 01:49:36,020
如果她对你们耍花招
If she pulls a trick on you,

1360
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:37,460
待在一起
stay together.

1361
01:49:38,590 --> 01:49:39,270
好吗
Yeah?

1362
01:49:40,990 --> 01:49:42,490
但我也有自己的招数
But I got some tricks of my own.

1363
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:49,970
我想我们到了
Hey, I think we're here.

1364
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:53,920
好
Okay.

1365
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:56,900
看看能不能联系上她
I'll see if I can get her.

1366
01:49:58,770 --> 01:49:59,540
阿布拉
Abra?

1367
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:03,220
{\an8}拉美克工业
乙醇工厂
东北入口
关停待通知

1368
01:50:01,430 --> 01:50:03,880
就是那个标牌  绕去后面
That's the sign. Pull around back.

1369
01:50:04,370 --> 01:50:05,840
她说绕去后面
She says to pull around back.

1370
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:06,930
我会告诉你在哪停
And I'll tell you when to stop.

1371
01:50:06,930 --> 01:50:08,310
她会告诉我们在哪停
She'll tell us when to stop.

1372
01:50:15,190 --> 01:50:16,070
老实说  丹
I gotta tell you, Danno,

1373
01:50:16,070 --> 01:50:19,640
我不知道我希望你是对的还是错的
I don't know whether I hope you're right or wrong about this.

1374
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:23,520
如果你是错的  那我朋友疯了
I mean, if you're wrong, my friend is crazy.

1375
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:27,220
彻头彻尾地疯了
I mean, full-blown, mental breakdown,

1376
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:30,810
幻想的怪物杀害幻想的小孩
imaginary-monsters- killing-imaginary-kids

1377
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:32,230
疯了
bonkers.

1378
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:35,320
不过...这我可以接受
But, you know, I... I can work with that.

1379
01:50:36,490 --> 01:50:37,700
但如果你是对的...
If you're right, though...

1380
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:38,630
我知道
I know.

1381
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:40,550
那就更糟了
It's much worse.

1382
01:50:55,480 --> 01:50:56,600
你应该回家去
You should go home.

1383
01:50:56,820 --> 01:50:57,530
什么
What?

1384
01:50:58,600 --> 01:50:59,550
不  不是说你
No, not you.

1385
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:01,870
我能应付
I can handle it.

1386
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:04,900
不  接下来就交给我们
No. We'll take it from here.

1387
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:09,370
好  只有我们了
Okay, it's just us.

1388
01:51:26,850 --> 01:51:27,730
你闻到了吗
You smell that?

1389
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:33,390
我以前打过猎  跟你说过吗
Used to hunt. I ever tell you that?

1390
01:51:33,390 --> 01:51:34,070
没有
No.

1391
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:35,450
猎鹿
Deer.

1392
01:51:36,370 --> 01:51:37,310
有个夏天
This one summer,

1393
01:51:38,950 --> 01:51:40,070
我打伤了一头公鹿
I clipped this buck.

1394
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:42,580
我追了它两天
I was tracking it for two days.

1395
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:45,770
射中了  打伤了它
I got the shot, clipped him.

1396
01:51:46,550 --> 01:51:48,120
它跑了  我去追
He ran off, I went after.

1397
01:51:48,890 --> 01:51:51,570
以为它不会坚持多久
Figured he wasn't gonna last long.

1398
01:51:54,190 --> 01:51:55,160
然后它消失了
Then he vanished.

1399
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:58,050
就那么失去踪影
Just up and evaporated.

1400
01:51:58,860 --> 01:52:01,310
毫无痕迹  真的莫名其妙
Not a trace. Truly baffling.

1401
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:05,260
五天后
Five days later,

1402
01:52:05,660 --> 01:52:08,230
我在另一个地方打猎  隔了好几公里
I'm trying a different spot, miles away.

1403
01:52:08,660 --> 01:52:11,680
我在那里找掩蔽的地方
I come around looking for a spot for a blind...

1404
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:14,870
然后我闻到了它
then I smelled him.

1405
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:17,570
闻到了它
Smelled him.

1406
01:52:19,140 --> 01:52:20,040
找到了那头公鹿
Found that buck

1407
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:22,830
躲在一个中空的树干里
holed up to a hollow trunk,

1408
01:52:24,290 --> 01:52:25,450
死了好几天
dead for days.

1409
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:27,950
那气味...
The smell...

1410
01:52:29,930 --> 01:52:31,370
从那以后我再不打猎
Never hunted a day since.

1411
01:52:35,450 --> 01:52:36,930
这是同样的气味
This is the same smell.

1412
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:53,980
比利
Billy.

1413
01:53:14,180 --> 01:53:15,060
老天
Oh, my God!

1414
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:25,700
操
Fuck.

1415
01:53:48,480 --> 01:53:49,200
操
Fuck.

1416
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:51,940
操  丹  什么鬼
Fuck, Danno. What the fuck?

1417
01:53:52,150 --> 01:53:54,660
他们甚至没有好好埋葬他  埋得很浅
They didn't even bury him deep. They buried him shallow.

1418
01:53:54,660 --> 01:53:55,450
抱歉  比利
I'm sorry, Billy.

1419
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:58,660
你把我们卷入什么事里了
What did you get us into?

{\an8}{\pos(192.6,161.6)}小戏法

1422
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:08,630
杀害他的那些人
The people who did that...

1423
01:54:09,170 --> 01:54:10,090
他们不是人
They're not people.

1424
01:54:11,690 --> 01:54:13,400
不  他们不是
No. No, they ain't.

1425
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:16,130
会这样伤害一个小男孩的人
Anyone do that to a little boy,

1426
01:54:17,530 --> 01:54:18,360
都不是人
they ain't people.

1427
01:54:19,690 --> 01:54:20,530
你们找到了吗
Did you get it?

1428
01:54:21,050 --> 01:54:22,010
找到了
Yeah, we got it.

1429
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:23,000
她回来了吗
Is she back?

1430
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
我们正在往你那里赶  早上就到
We're heading back to you. We'll be back in the morning.

1431
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,260
我们中途要停一下
We got a stop to make.

1432
01:54:29,550 --> 01:54:31,800
我需要你给你父母看看发生的事
I need you to show your parents what's happening.

1433
01:54:32,630 --> 01:54:33,340
不要
No.

1434
01:54:33,430 --> 01:54:36,310
-要的  -不  他们几乎以为我正常了
- Yeah. - No. They almost think I'm normal.

1435
01:54:36,670 --> 01:54:37,920
如果我告诉他们  他们会...
If I tell them, they'll...

1436
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,670
萝西会通过他们对付你
Rose'll go through them to get to you.

1437
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:40,920
你知道的  不是吗
You know that, don't you?

1438
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,160
她会毫不迟疑杀死他们
She'll cut them down without a second thought.

1439
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:44,640
而她要来了  阿布拉
And she's coming, Abra.

1440
01:54:45,550 --> 01:54:46,670
他们需要知道
They need to know.

1441
01:54:52,050 --> 01:54:53,450
我们要在哪里停一下
So, what's this stop we gotta make?

1442
01:54:54,340 --> 01:54:56,180
你还留着猎鹿的步枪吗
You still got those old deer rifles?

1443
01:55:14,060 --> 01:55:14,890
你是丹叔叔吗
You're Uncle Dan?

1444
01:55:15,810 --> 01:55:17,320
-你以为你是谁  -先生
- The fuck you think you are? - Sir...

1445
01:55:18,050 --> 01:55:19,110
她才十三岁
She is 13 years old!

1446
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:20,450
阿布拉  我告诉过你要给他看看
Abra, I told you to show him.

1447
01:55:20,450 --> 01:55:21,870
-我告诉他了  -那不一样
- I told him. - Well, that's not the same.

1448
01:55:21,870 --> 01:55:23,600
我要痛揍你一顿  然后报警
I'm gonna kick your ass before I call the police, huh?

1449
01:55:23,980 --> 01:55:24,870
不不不  阿布拉
No, no, no. Abra.

1450
01:55:24,870 --> 01:55:26,010
别叫她的名字
Now, don't you say her name.

1451
01:55:26,010 --> 01:55:26,760
阿布拉
Abra...

1452
01:55:42,130 --> 01:55:44,670
对不起  斯通先生  我是你们的朋友
I'm sorry, Mr. Stone. I am a friend.

1453
01:55:45,590 --> 01:55:47,120
她告诉你的事都是真的
Everything she told you is true.

1454
01:55:50,790 --> 01:55:51,750
到底发生了什么
What the hell is happening?

1455
01:55:52,610 --> 01:55:53,370
对不起
I'm sorry.

1456
01:55:54,220 --> 01:55:55,660
阿布拉需要给你看点东西
Abra needs to show you something.

1457
01:55:56,710 --> 01:55:57,620
我看到了那个男孩
I saw the boy.

1458
01:55:57,990 --> 01:55:59,160
我看到了他的尸体
I saw his body.

1459
01:55:59,780 --> 01:56:00,700
都是真的
It's all true.

1460
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:02,870
很可能是你这个朋友把他埋在那里的
Probably, your friend here put him there.

1461
01:56:04,140 --> 01:56:05,030
你想过吗
You think about that?

1462
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:06,870
没想太久
Not for long, I didn't.

1463
01:56:07,110 --> 01:56:09,250
斯通先生  你的女儿很特别
Mr. Stone, your daughter is special.

1464
01:56:09,650 --> 01:56:10,490
不准谈论她
Don't talk about her.

1465
01:56:10,490 --> 01:56:12,710
我想你内心深处知道
I think you know that. Deep down.

1466
01:56:14,610 --> 01:56:16,570
她知道那个小男孩出了什么事
She knows what happened to that little boy,

1467
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:18,440
她还知道是谁干的
and she knows who did it.

1468
01:56:20,090 --> 01:56:20,830
给他看看
Show him.

1469
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:26,510
对不起  爸爸
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1470
01:56:27,110 --> 01:56:28,470
我真的不想
I really didn't want to.

1471
01:56:29,390 --> 01:56:30,440
不想做什么
Didn't want to what?

1472
01:56:49,120 --> 01:56:49,970
不用  谢谢
No, thanks.

1473
01:56:50,050 --> 01:56:50,770
不用
No.

1474
01:57:00,510 --> 01:57:01,320
那些人
Those people...

1475
01:57:03,460 --> 01:57:04,640
他们知道我女儿的能力吗
they know about my daughter?

1476
01:57:05,380 --> 01:57:06,080
知道
They do.

1477
01:57:07,060 --> 01:57:08,980
而且他们迟早会来
And sooner or later, they're coming.

1478
01:57:09,870 --> 01:57:10,770
我们必须做点什么
We gotta do something.

1479
01:57:11,170 --> 01:57:13,040
我们报警  找联调局
All right, we're calling the police, the FBI...

1480
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:15,410
那些人已经活了很久很久  先生
These people have been around a long, long time, sir.

1481
01:57:15,910 --> 01:57:17,470
他们有钱  有关系
They're rich, connected.

1482
01:57:17,470 --> 01:57:19,450
我觉得他们根本不怕警察
I don't think they're worried about the police.

1483
01:57:19,980 --> 01:57:20,920
但他们在哪
But where are they?

1484
01:57:21,650 --> 01:57:23,760
他们什么时候来  我们能去哪
When are they coming? Where can we go?

1485
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:25,280
阿布拉能回答这些
Abra can answer that...

1486
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:26,920
只要她准备好了
if she's ready.

1487
01:57:28,670 --> 01:57:29,430
我准备好了
I'm ready.

1488
01:57:39,730 --> 01:57:40,890
你确定想这么做吗
You sure you wanna do this?

1489
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:42,530
我必须做
I have to.

1490
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:26,240
I95公路
I-95.

1491
01:58:27,030 --> 01:58:29,380
巴里  乌鸦  蛇  还有别的几个
Barry, the Crow, the Snake, and a few others.

1492
01:58:29,860 --> 01:58:31,300
树木看起来没什么不同
The trees haven't changed that much,

1493
01:58:31,300 --> 01:58:33,000
所以或许在马萨诸塞
so maybe Massachusetts,

1494
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,700
-不过他们很近了  -萝西呢
- but they're close. - Rose?

1495
01:58:35,910 --> 01:58:36,730
没看到她
Didn't see her.

1496
01:58:37,730 --> 01:58:38,590
但他们要来了
But they're coming.

1497
01:58:43,070 --> 01:58:44,570
这是她唯一看到的房间吗
This is the only room she saw?

1498
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:46,460
是的
That's right.

1499
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:49,500
我做了些改变  藏了几样东西
And I made a few changes. Hid a few things.

1500
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:50,990
好的
All right.

1501
01:58:52,310 --> 01:58:53,820
他们会试图追踪你
Well, they'll be trying to track you,

1502
01:58:54,640 --> 01:58:55,780
试图搞明白
trying to catch on.

1503
01:58:58,210 --> 01:58:59,300
而你要让他们得逞
And you're gonna let them.

1504
01:59:00,970 --> 01:59:02,350
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

1505
01:59:02,370 --> 01:59:04,050
可能吧  但你要让他们得逞
Possibly, but you're gonna let them.

1506
01:59:04,730 --> 01:59:06,910
然后我需要你变个戏法
And then I need you to try and do a little trick.

1507
01:59:08,130 --> 01:59:09,120
变魔法吗
A magic trick?

1508
01:59:17,610 --> 01:59:18,460
他们在跟踪我们
They're following us.

1509
01:59:19,450 --> 01:59:21,810
集中注意  你得坚持到他们到达
Concentrate. You gotta keep it up until they land.

1510
01:59:22,340 --> 01:59:23,080
我知道
I know.

1511
01:59:55,100 --> 01:59:56,050
这里应该可以
This should work.

1512
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:58,880
那边和那边都有遮蔽
Good blinds over there, and there.

1513
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:03,440
他们还在附近吗
They still close?

1514
02:00:03,570 --> 02:00:04,740
应该越来越近了
Getting closer, I think.

1515
02:00:05,590 --> 02:00:06,470
很难坚持
This is tough.

1516
02:00:06,680 --> 02:00:08,940
我知道  不用多久了
I know. I know. Not much longer.

1517
02:00:12,970 --> 02:00:14,180
好了  乌鸦老爹
Okay, Crow Daddy,

1518
02:00:15,470 --> 02:00:16,500
去抓她吧
go get her.

1519
02:01:03,820 --> 02:01:05,390
你看起来挺放松
You look relaxed.

1520
02:01:06,430 --> 02:01:08,750
你感觉放松  是吧  阿布拉
You feel relaxed, don't you, Abra?

1521
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:10,930
可能吧
I guess.

1522
02:01:11,250 --> 02:01:12,080
你应该这样
You should.

1523
02:01:13,150 --> 02:01:14,480
放松
Just relax.

1524
02:01:15,010 --> 02:01:16,100
我们是朋友
We're friends.

1525
02:01:16,690 --> 02:01:17,780
你们是朋友
You're friends.

1526
02:01:18,330 --> 02:01:19,190
没错
That's right.

1527
02:01:20,510 --> 02:01:21,790
只是朋友
Just friends.

1528
02:01:22,640 --> 02:01:25,720
我们想带你见更多朋友
And we want to take you to meet more friends.

1529
02:01:27,380 --> 02:01:28,590
好朋友
Good friends.

1530
02:01:33,060 --> 02:01:34,070
靠
Well, shit.

1531
02:01:34,590 --> 02:01:35,410
他们把你说得那么厉害
The way they talked you up,

1532
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:37,750
我还以为不会这么轻易抓到你呢
I was thinking it'd be a little harder than that.

1533
02:01:42,780 --> 02:01:43,690
搞什么
The fuck?

1534
02:01:44,620 --> 02:01:47,540
小戏法  只是该死的小戏法
Parlor tricks. Just fuckin' parlor tricks.

1535
02:01:51,430 --> 02:01:52,920
不  离开那里
No! Get out of there!

1536
02:01:53,270 --> 02:01:54,110
离开那里
Get out of there!

1537
02:02:01,030 --> 02:02:02,730
不

1538
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:17,000
不
No!

1539
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:27,910
你们活该
You deserve it.

1540
02:02:28,120 --> 02:02:30,290
你们所有人都活该
You deserve it. All of you.

1541
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:36,500
不
No!

1542
02:03:32,510 --> 02:03:33,200

停下
Stop.

1544

我只有一个问题问你  亲爱的

1545
02:03:45,650 --> 02:03:46,790
你不想睡吗

1552
02:04:09,930 --> 02:04:10,970

1555
02:04:36,090 --> 02:04:37,420
自杀吧
Kill yourself.

1556
02:04:40,220 --> 02:04:40,940
不
No!

1557
02:04:41,380 --> 02:04:42,090
比利
Billy!

1558
02:04:59,330 --> 02:05:00,340
少了一个
There is one missing.

1559
02:05:01,610 --> 02:05:04,340
我没看到乌鸦  乌鸦在哪
I didn't see the Crow. Where is the Crow?

1560
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:07,390
你好  阿布拉
Hello, Abra.

1561
02:05:13,960 --> 02:05:14,950
阿布拉

1562
02:05:19,250 --> 02:05:20,210
离她远点
Get away from her.

1563
02:05:24,220 --> 02:05:25,020
退后
Step back.

1564
02:05:28,140 --> 02:05:29,120
没问题  爸爸
Sure thing, Dad.

1565
02:05:31,490 --> 02:05:33,400
我很高兴能见到你
You know, I'm glad I got to meet you.

1566
02:05:33,400 --> 02:05:36,210
我要杀了你  退后
I'll fucking kill you. Step back.

1567
02:05:36,210 --> 02:05:37,270
真敢说
Some brave words.

1568
02:05:38,010 --> 02:05:41,150
看你们这些凡人威胁神总让我发笑
Always tickles me, watching you rubes threaten a god.

1569
02:05:42,750 --> 02:05:43,960
知道吗  你的女儿
You know, your little girl,

1570
02:05:44,860 --> 02:05:47,060
或许会成为我们吃过最好的食物
she's maybe the best food we'll ever have.

1571
02:05:48,510 --> 02:05:51,620
很高兴能有机会向大厨致意
I'm so glad I had a chance to compliment the chef.

1572
02:06:30,110 --> 02:06:31,290
很好  你醒了
Good, you're awake.

1573
02:06:42,310 --> 02:06:43,010
丹
Dan...

1574
02:06:43,370 --> 02:06:44,350
别费劲了
Don't bother.

1575
02:06:51,890 --> 02:06:53,190
我是怎么了
What's wrong with me?

1576
02:06:53,850 --> 02:06:55,300
你被下药了  小姐
You've been dosed, missy.

1577
02:06:56,130 --> 02:06:57,790
我从没用过这么大的剂量
More than I've ever used before.

1578
02:06:58,680 --> 02:07:00,120
你可能时不时会醒过来
Might let you wake up here and there,

1579
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:03,320
但你的灵气睡得很沉
but that steam of yours is fast asleep.

1580
02:07:06,780 --> 02:07:07,680
我爸爸
My dad...

1581
02:07:09,280 --> 02:07:10,510
我爸爸怎么了
What happened to my dad?

1582
02:07:11,190 --> 02:07:12,690
今天很多好人被杀了
Lot of good people killed today.

1583
02:07:13,890 --> 02:07:15,070
很多好人
Lot of good people.

1584
02:07:16,920 --> 02:07:18,690
我也想告诉你会有人付出代价
I'd love to tell you someone will pay,

1585
02:07:19,400 --> 02:07:22,760
会有某种正义降临为今天的悲剧做主
some kind of justice raining down on the sad events today,

1586
02:07:22,770 --> 02:07:25,580
但事实并非如此
but it don't work like that.

1587
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:28,270
我们总是会抓到你的
We were always gonna have you.

1588
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:31,070
我们一些人死了
Some of my people are dead.

1589
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:33,550
你们一些人死了
Some of yours are dead.

1590
02:07:34,890 --> 02:07:36,770
不过结果没变
Outcome didn't change, though.

1591
02:07:38,110 --> 02:07:39,390
想一下
Think on that a minute.

1592
02:07:40,290 --> 02:07:41,810
结果没变
The outcome didn't change.

1593
02:07:42,770 --> 02:07:43,930
所以他们的死
So, their deaths,

1594
02:07:45,030 --> 02:07:45,960
他们所有人
all of them,

1595
02:07:47,030 --> 02:07:48,080
都是白死
just a waste.

1596
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:51,960
都是因为你的所作所为  小姑娘
A waste you brought on to us all, young lady.

1597
02:07:52,850 --> 02:07:53,570
为了什么
For what?

1598
02:07:55,820 --> 02:07:57,370
请听到我的声音
Please hear me...

1599
02:07:57,680 --> 02:07:58,990
不会有人听到
Ain't nobody hearing you.

1600
02:08:00,430 --> 02:08:02,720
不如冷静下来  享受旅行
Might as well calm down and enjoy the ride.

1601
02:08:04,110 --> 02:08:05,010
就像我说的
Like I said,

1602
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:08,010
结果没变
outcome hasn't changed.

1603
02:08:28,840 --> 02:08:29,600
不
No.

1604
02:08:31,790 --> 02:08:32,520
拜托
Please.

1605
02:08:33,530 --> 02:08:35,110
拜托  拜托  拜托
Oh, please, please, please.

1606
02:08:36,940 --> 02:08:37,650
拜托
Please.

1607
02:08:41,550 --> 02:08:42,350
阿布拉
Abra!

1608
02:08:46,310 --> 02:08:47,050
阿布拉
Abra.

1609
02:08:54,570 --> 02:08:55,280
托尼
Tony?

1610
02:08:57,910 --> 02:08:59,300
求你帮帮我  托尼
Help me, please, Tony.

1611
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:06,330
天啊
God.

1612
02:09:17,140 --> 02:09:20,480
好  好  好
Okay. Okay. Okay, okay.

1613
02:09:20,810 --> 02:09:22,070
好了  你总是说
Okay, you always said...

1614
02:09:23,390 --> 02:09:24,690
你的大脑就像无线电
your brain was like a radio.

1615
02:09:25,150 --> 02:09:27,340
呼叫的时候没人回应  就不要呼叫了
No one's answering when you call, so stop calling.

1616
02:09:28,060 --> 02:09:29,220
听就可以
And just listen.

1617
02:09:47,100 --> 02:09:49,380
丹  丹
Dan. Dan.

1618
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:50,610
救我
Help.

1619
02:09:52,070 --> 02:09:53,950
{\an8}谋杀
谁
棒球男孩

1620
02:09:52,070 --> 02:09:53,950
{\an8}{\pos(269.4,2.4)}希望你没事
你的朋友  丹

1621
02:10:06,290 --> 02:10:06,990
丹
Dan.

1622
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:11,400
他给你下药了吗
Did he drug you?

1623
02:10:13,170 --> 02:10:14,070
抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1624
02:10:15,930 --> 02:10:17,570
我试试别的办法  好吗
I'm gonna try something, okay?

1625
02:10:18,020 --> 02:10:18,880
但你很虚弱
But you're weak.

1626
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:20,280
他在阻隔你
He's blocking you.

1627
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:21,960
我几乎听不见你说话
I could barely hear you.

1628
02:10:23,130 --> 02:10:24,510
你得相信我  好吗
You gotta trust me, okay?

1629
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:27,160
好吗
Okay?

1630
02:10:41,810 --> 02:10:42,630
又醒了吗
Awake again, huh?

1631
02:10:45,050 --> 02:10:47,210
可能得在下个休息区给你下药
Might have to dose you at the next rest stop.

1632
02:10:49,540 --> 02:10:50,490
我们要去哪里
Where are we going?

1633
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:52,800
你心里很清楚
You know where.

1634
02:10:54,350 --> 02:10:56,180
操  我感觉就像宿醉
Fuck, I feel hungover.

1635
02:10:59,210 --> 02:11:00,660
我告诉过你那是好货
I told you it's good shit.

1636
02:11:01,790 --> 02:11:04,970
好几年没宿醉了  我并不想念这种感觉
Haven't felt hungover in years. And, you know, I don't miss it.

1637
02:11:04,970 --> 02:11:05,870
一点都不
Not even a little.

1638
02:11:08,470 --> 02:11:09,240
往西走吗
West, huh?

1639
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:13,230
远离主路  很明智
Stayin' off the major roads. Smart.

1640
02:11:15,470 --> 02:11:17,990
克朗威尔  纽约
Crownville. New York.

1641
02:11:20,950 --> 02:11:21,780
你是谁
Who are you?

1642
02:11:23,300 --> 02:11:24,980
我就是杀了你朋友的人
I'm the guy that killed your friends.

1643
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:32,340
很高兴认识你
It's nice to meet you.

1644
02:11:34,370 --> 02:11:35,340
戏法不错
Neat trick.

1645
02:11:35,990 --> 02:11:37,540
之间没见过这样的
Haven't seen this one before.

1646
02:11:38,110 --> 02:11:39,250
想再看一个吗
Wanna see one more?

1647
02:11:42,900 --> 02:11:46,120
你要是对我开枪  萝西应该不会开心
Don't imagine Rose'll be too happy if you shoot the prize.

1648
02:11:49,140 --> 02:11:51,890
出这些事萝西应该一点都不开心
I don't suppose Rose will be happy about any of this.

1649
02:11:52,750 --> 02:11:54,420
那个女人要是生气了
And when that woman gets mad...

1650
02:11:55,420 --> 02:11:57,900
我觉得你知道得够多了
Well, it seems to me you know enough

1651
02:11:57,900 --> 02:11:59,880
清楚你就不该管这事
to know you might wanna sit this one out.

1652
02:12:00,940 --> 02:12:02,230
你应该知足
Count your blessings.

1653
02:12:02,430 --> 02:12:03,420
过你自己的生活
Go on your way.

1654
02:12:06,440 --> 02:12:07,800
什么事这么好笑
What's so funny, friend?

1655
02:12:08,020 --> 02:12:11,680
就是傲慢  真的就是傲慢
Well, it's just arrogance. It's arrogance, really.

1656
02:12:12,030 --> 02:12:14,820
不过如果觉得自己可以永生  倒也说得通
But it makes sense, if you think you're gonna live forever.

1657
02:12:15,560 --> 02:12:19,730
所以很显然  你不会想着系安全带
Stands to reason, of course you wouldn't wear your seatbelt.

1658
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:33,060
不
No!

1659
02:12:43,120 --> 02:12:43,870
丹
Dan?

1660
02:12:45,900 --> 02:12:46,630
丹
Dan?

1661
02:13:18,590 --> 02:13:19,780
但愿你感到很痛
I hope that hurts.

1662
02:13:20,750 --> 02:13:21,590
萝西
Rosie...

1663
02:13:22,970 --> 02:13:23,820
非常痛
A lot.

1664
02:14:12,070 --> 02:14:14,510
你个小婊子
You little bitch.

1665
02:14:16,190 --> 02:14:17,240
你都干了什么
What have you done?

1666
02:14:29,670 --> 02:14:31,480
好啊  小婊子
All right, bitch child.

1667
02:14:32,650 --> 02:14:33,420
好啊
All right.

1668
02:15:41,860 --> 02:15:42,620
抱歉
Sorry.

1669
02:15:43,210 --> 02:15:44,050
睡过去了
Dozed off.

1670
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:45,680
没事  你该睡会儿
No, you earned it.

1671
02:15:49,500 --> 02:15:50,370
我们在哪里
Where are we?

1672
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:51,660
俄亥俄
Ohio.

1673
02:15:52,760 --> 02:15:53,600
我们要去哪里
Where are we going?

1674
02:15:53,810 --> 02:15:54,610
科罗拉多
Colorado.

1675
02:15:56,480 --> 02:15:57,810
为什么是科罗拉多
Why Colorado?

1676
02:16:00,710 --> 02:16:01,840
她还会来的
She's gonna keep coming.

1677
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:04,830
-我知道  -不会停下
- I know. - Always.

1678
02:16:06,330 --> 02:16:07,620
只有解决了她才会结束
This only ends if we end it,

1679
02:16:07,620 --> 02:16:09,720
但我觉得我们打不过她
and I don't think we can beat her.

1680
02:16:10,180 --> 02:16:11,370
光靠我们两个不行
Not by ourselves.

1681
02:16:14,070 --> 02:16:15,090
有一个地方
There's a place.

1682
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:17,590
一个对我们这样的人来说很危险的地方
A place that's dangerous for people like us.

1683
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:21,420
就是你说过的那个饥饿的地方吗
The place you told me about? The hungry place?

1684
02:16:21,420 --> 02:16:22,320
对  没错
Yeah, that's right.

1685
02:16:22,660 --> 02:16:25,470
如果那么危险  我们为什么还要去
If it's so dangerous, why would we go there?

1686
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:28,230
如果对我们来说很危险
Well, if it's dangerous for people like us,

1687
02:16:28,520 --> 02:16:30,760
我想对她来说也会很危险
I expect it's dangerous for people like her.

1688
02:16:31,550 --> 02:16:32,650
可能对她更危险
Maybe even more so.

1689
02:16:34,230 --> 02:16:34,930
好
Good.

1690
02:16:36,370 --> 02:16:38,050
她在跟踪我们
She's following us, you know.

1691
02:16:39,250 --> 02:16:40,820
很好  让她跟着吧
Yeah, good. Let her.

1692
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:50,170
你爸爸的事我很遗憾
I'm sorry about your father.

1693
02:16:53,150 --> 02:16:54,380
你朋友的事我也很遗憾
Sorry about your friend.

1694
02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:19,000
是我妈妈
It's my mom.

1695
02:17:19,930 --> 02:17:20,820
我要怎么跟她说
What do I say to her?

1696
02:17:26,070 --> 02:17:26,830
妈妈
Hi, Mom.

1697
02:17:27,360 --> 02:17:28,100
谢天谢地
Thank God!

1698
02:17:28,410 --> 02:17:29,150
阿布拉
Abra...

1699
02:17:29,560 --> 02:17:30,970
你还好吗  你在哪里
Are you okay? Where are you?

1700
02:17:32,210 --> 02:17:32,930
我爱你
I love you.

1701
02:17:36,440 --> 02:17:38,800
等我们安全了  你会告诉她去哪找我们吧
When we're safe, you'll call her and tell her where to find us?

1702
02:17:38,840 --> 02:17:39,560
我会的
I will.

1703
02:17:40,070 --> 02:17:40,770
好
Okay.

1704
02:18:15,050 --> 02:18:17,400
没有多远了  就在山上
Not too much further. Up the mountain.

02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:54,140
我们这么办
Here's what we're gonna do.

1708
02:19:54,410 --> 02:19:57,210
你待在车里  一直开着暖气
You're gonna stay in the car, keep the heater running.

1709
02:19:57,620 --> 02:19:58,820
除非万不得已
I don't want you spending a minute

1710
02:19:58,820 --> 02:20:00,610
我不想让你在里面待哪怕一分钟
inside there if you don't have to.

1711
02:20:00,810 --> 02:20:02,160
她只能从这里过来
She can only come from here.

1712
02:20:02,680 --> 02:20:04,050
隔着一公里多你就能看见她
You can see her a mile out, easy.

1713
02:20:04,050 --> 02:20:06,500
你要是看见那边山上有灯光
You see lights on the mountain over there,

1714
02:20:06,510 --> 02:20:08,000
就告诉我  好吗
you blast me, okay?

1715
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,450
我不想让你进去  除非她来了
But I don't want you going in. Not until she's here.

1716
02:20:11,390 --> 02:20:13,650
你不和我一起等吗
You aren't waiting with me?

1717
02:20:13,950 --> 02:20:14,900
不行
I can't.

1718
02:20:14,910 --> 02:20:15,960
为什么
Why not?

1719
02:20:16,860 --> 02:20:18,410
我得把它弄醒
I have to wake it up.

1720
02:21:20,340 --> 02:21:21,940
醒醒
Wakey-wakey.

1721
02:21:40,430 --> 02:21:55,150
{\an8}危险  高压电

1722
02:24:03,660 --> 02:24:07,950
{\an8}红朗姆

1723
02:26:01,230 --> 02:26:03,280
今晚有些无聊  托伦斯先生
Slow night, Mr. Torrance.

1724
02:26:03,290 --> 02:26:05,190
很快就不会无聊了
Not for long, I imagine.

1725
02:26:06,810 --> 02:26:08,740
你喜欢威士忌  对吧
You're a whiskey man, are you not?

1726
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:11,090
以前大多数时候都喜欢
I was, most of the time.

1727
02:26:18,620 --> 02:26:20,140
免费赠送
On the house.

1728
02:26:23,850 --> 02:26:25,520
这是你喜欢的牌子
This was your brand.

1729
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:27,430
杰克·丹尼尔
Jack Daniel's.

1730
02:26:27,790 --> 02:26:30,090
我以前在家里看过这酒瓶
I used to see the bottles in our home.

1731
02:26:30,270 --> 02:26:32,230
我们在此之前真正的家
Our real home, before all this.

1732
02:26:33,740 --> 02:26:36,680
有次我闻了一下  感觉像是什么烧着了
I smelled one once. It smelled like something on fire,

1733
02:26:36,680 --> 02:26:39,660
我想我的感觉没错
which I suppose it was.

1734
02:26:40,750 --> 02:26:43,430
恐怕你是把我跟别人搞混了
I'm afraid you've confused me with someone else.

1735
02:26:43,430 --> 02:26:44,800
我叫劳伊德
It's Lloyd.

1736
02:26:45,540 --> 02:26:46,570
劳伊德
Lloyd.

1737
02:26:48,110 --> 02:26:50,280
抱歉  托伦斯先生
I apologize, Mr. Torrance.

1738
02:26:50,280 --> 02:26:53,990
我不知道大家都去哪里了  但是会热闹起来的
I don't know where everyone is, but it'll pick up.

1739
02:26:54,270 --> 02:26:55,890
我知道他们在哪里
Oh, I know where they are.

1740
02:26:56,210 --> 02:26:57,430
你说得没错
And you're right...

1741
02:26:58,120 --> 02:26:59,460
会热闹起来的
it'll pick up.

1742
02:27:01,480 --> 02:27:04,630
希望你不介意  托伦斯先生  你似乎
If you don't mind my saying, Mr. Torrance, you seem...

1743
02:27:05,790 --> 02:27:07,130
被利用了
put upon.

1744
02:27:07,960 --> 02:27:09,290
被利用了
Put upon?

1745
02:27:09,810 --> 02:27:11,370
不是这样吗
Ain't that the way.

1746
02:27:12,100 --> 02:27:14,120
男人过着自己的生活
Man just living his life,

1747
02:27:14,120 --> 02:27:16,100
努力做好自己的工作
trying to do his work.

1748
02:27:16,260 --> 02:27:18,040
结果被利用了
He gets put upon.

1749
02:27:18,310 --> 02:27:20,160
牵扯进别人的麻烦
Pulled into other people's problems.

1750
02:27:20,160 --> 02:27:23,210
我见得太多了  请别介意我这么说
I see it all the time, if you don't mind my saying.

1751
02:27:25,850 --> 02:27:27,910
后来我们住在佛罗里达
So we lived in Florida.

1752
02:27:28,850 --> 02:27:29,910
你说什么
I'm sorry?

1753
02:27:29,910 --> 02:27:31,150
我和妈妈
Mom and I.

1754
02:27:31,990 --> 02:27:34,220
恐怕我不知道你说的是谁
I'm afraid I don't know who you mean.

1755
02:27:36,780 --> 02:27:39,060
我们再也不想看见雪
We never wanted to see snow again,

1756
02:27:39,900 --> 02:27:41,670
所以我们住在佛罗里达
so we lived in Florida.

1757
02:27:41,950 --> 02:27:45,020
房子很小  但很舒适  我们很幸福
Tiny place, but it was comfortable, and we were happy.

1758
02:27:45,380 --> 02:27:47,050
我们也很悲伤
I mean, we were grieving.

1759
02:27:49,950 --> 02:27:51,690
我们受到了精神创伤
We were traumatized,

1760
02:27:51,880 --> 02:27:53,650
但同时也有快乐幸福
but there was happiness too.

1761
02:27:56,970 --> 02:27:57,900
她
She...

1762
02:27:59,540 --> 02:28:01,000
她会移开目光
She would look away.

1763
02:28:01,600 --> 02:28:02,220
她看着我
She'd look at me,

1764
02:28:02,220 --> 02:28:05,060
但一两秒后总会移开目光
but she'd always look away after a second or two.

1765
02:28:06,390 --> 02:28:07,570
过了段时间我才注意到
It took me a while to notice it.

1766
02:28:07,580 --> 02:28:10,560
但在眺望酒店之后  她不会直视我的眼睛
But after the Overlook, she wouldn't look me in the eyes,

1767
02:28:10,570 --> 02:28:11,790
不会一直看着
not for long.

1768
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:14,100
我一直不理解
Couldn't figure it out.

1769
02:28:16,640 --> 02:28:18,020
但其实
But it...

1770
02:28:21,410 --> 02:28:22,700
其实是你
It was you.

1771
02:28:25,090 --> 02:28:29,040
她在我眼中看见你  就不得不移开目光
She saw your eyes in me, and she'd have to look away.

1772
02:28:30,170 --> 02:28:31,890
这让她备受折磨
It tortured her to have to do that.

1773
02:28:31,890 --> 02:28:33,380
所以我治好了
So, I fixed it.

1774
02:28:33,600 --> 02:28:36,830
我帮她治好了  那是我最后一次用它
I fixed it for her, and it was the last time I ever used it.

1775
02:28:36,900 --> 02:28:40,270
这样她就不会再在我眼中看到你
So that she wouldn't see you anymore when she looked at me.

1776
02:28:43,020 --> 02:28:44,870
她去世的时候我二十岁
I was 20 when she died.

1777
02:28:45,450 --> 02:28:49,170
那时候我能看出来有人要死了
And back then, I saw when someone was gonna die.

1778
02:28:49,170 --> 02:28:51,490
我能看见苍蝇  黑苍蝇
I saw flies. Black flies.

1779
02:28:51,490 --> 02:28:55,070
我称之为"死蝇"  它们会绕着人脸飞
"Death flies," I called them, circling people's faces.

1780
02:28:55,360 --> 02:28:58,130
最后那几周  她满脸...
And in those last weeks, she was covered...

1781
02:28:58,130 --> 02:28:59,710
满脸都是苍蝇
Her whole face.

1782
02:28:59,950 --> 02:29:02,140
我几乎看不见她的眼睛
I could barely see her eyes.

1783
02:29:03,290 --> 02:29:07,860
我试着安慰她  但是我几乎没法直视她
And I... I tried to comfort her, but I could hardly look at her.

1784
02:29:08,140 --> 02:29:09,880
她看出来了
And she saw that.

1785
02:29:12,290 --> 02:29:14,240
她就躺在那里奄奄一息
She just lay there dying,

1786
02:29:14,520 --> 02:29:16,560
而她的儿子都没法直视她
with her son who couldn't look at her.

1787
02:29:22,470 --> 02:29:26,030
或许喝点烈的来忘掉那种不快
Maybe something warm to push away such unpleasantries.

1788
02:29:26,030 --> 02:29:29,220
你不想听听吗  她是你妻子
Don't you wanna hear about it? She was your wife.

1789
02:29:29,220 --> 02:29:32,220
我觉得你可能把我当成了别人
I think you've mistaken me for someone else.

1790
02:29:32,340 --> 02:29:34,490
-我只是个酒保  -是吗
- I'm just a bartender. - Oh, yeah?

1791
02:29:35,660 --> 02:29:38,840
只是酒保劳伊德  在眺望酒店倒倒酒
Just Lloyd the bartender, pouring joy at the Overlook Hotel.

1792
02:29:38,840 --> 02:29:41,630
你想喝什么我都给你  托伦斯先生
I'll pour whatever you like, Mr. Torrance.

1793
02:29:43,050 --> 02:29:44,510
爸
Oh, Dad.

1794
02:29:46,080 --> 02:29:48,450
这杯酒代价必然不菲
This drink will cost an awful lot.

1795
02:29:48,450 --> 02:29:50,290
你的钱在这里没用
Your money is no good here.

1796
02:29:50,470 --> 02:29:52,150
免费赠送
Orders from the house.

1797
02:29:52,150 --> 02:29:53,940
它的代价不在于金钱
It'll cost more than money.

1798
02:29:54,240 --> 02:29:56,160
它会毁掉我的八年努力
It'll cost me eight years.

1799
02:29:56,710 --> 02:29:59,250
过去的八年  谁知道我未来还有几年
Eight behind me, and who knows how many in front of me.

1800
02:29:59,250 --> 02:30:01,950
你的信用没问题  托伦斯先生
Your credit is fine, Mr. Torrance.

1801
02:30:08,940 --> 02:30:10,570
君唤一壶酒
Man takes a drink,

1802
02:30:11,930 --> 02:30:13,580
千杯入愁肠
the drink takes a drink,

1803
02:30:14,520 --> 02:30:16,560
酒销人已亡
and then the drink takes a man.

1804
02:30:17,470 --> 02:30:19,010
不是这样吗  爸
Ain't it so, Dad?

1805
02:30:23,310 --> 02:30:24,480
药
Medicine.

1806
02:30:26,220 --> 02:30:28,330
它就是药
Medicine is what it is.

1807
02:30:29,110 --> 02:30:31,220
真正的灵丹妙药
Bona fide cure-all.

1808
02:30:31,250 --> 02:30:36,520
抑郁  压力  悔恨  失败  一扫而光
Depression, stress, remorse, failure, wipes it all away.

1809
02:30:37,850 --> 02:30:40,090
思想就是一块黑板
The mind is a blackboard.

1810
02:30:40,590 --> 02:30:41,920
而这个
And this

1811
02:30:42,540 --> 02:30:44,110
就是黑板擦
is the eraser.

1812
02:30:49,210 --> 02:30:50,940
男人努力工作
A man tries.

1813
02:30:51,540 --> 02:30:53,210
养家糊口
He provides.

1814
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:56,170
但他周围都是张大的嘴
But he's surrounded by mouths.

1815
02:30:56,170 --> 02:30:58,940
吃饭  尖叫  哭喊  唠叨
that eat, and scream, and cry, and nag.

1816
02:30:59,370 --> 02:31:02,630
所以他只为自己求一样东西
So, he asks for one thing, just one thing for him.

1817
02:31:02,930 --> 02:31:04,460
暖暖身子
To warm him up...

1818
02:31:04,690 --> 02:31:07,590
逃离被那些嘴支配的痛苦
to take the sting out of those days of the mouths,

1819
02:31:07,590 --> 02:31:10,390
它们不停地吃  吃掉他制造的一切
eating, and eating, and eating everything he makes,

1820
02:31:10,390 --> 02:31:12,290
他拥有的一切
everything he has.

1821
02:31:12,750 --> 02:31:14,510
还有家庭
And a family.

1822
02:31:14,570 --> 02:31:16,850
妻子和孩子
A wife, a kid.

1823
02:31:18,050 --> 02:31:19,930
那些嘴吃掉时间
Those mouths eat time.

1824
02:31:20,560 --> 02:31:22,730
吃掉你在人间的时日
They eat your days on Earth.

1825
02:31:23,460 --> 02:31:25,170
它们狼吞虎咽
They just gobble them up.

1826
02:31:26,640 --> 02:31:29,060
足以让一个男人崩溃
It's enough to make a man sick.

1827
02:31:30,230 --> 02:31:31,510
而这个
And this...

1828
02:31:32,350 --> 02:31:33,870
就是良药
is the medicine.

1829
02:31:36,410 --> 02:31:38,280
告诉我  小子
So, tell me, pup,

1830
02:31:39,410 --> 02:31:42,130
你要吃药吗
are you gonna take your medicine?

1831
02:31:44,890 --> 02:31:46,060
我不要
I'm not.

1832
02:31:49,940 --> 02:31:51,320
真不好意思  我很抱歉
Look at that. I'm sorry.

1833
02:31:51,320 --> 02:31:54,710
我这老家伙笨手笨脚的  请原谅  托伦斯先生
Clumsy old me, Mr. Torrance. Forgive me.

1834
02:31:55,900 --> 02:31:57,660
让我帮你擦干净吧
Let's get you cleaned up.

1835
02:32:15,730 --> 02:32:17,890
上头很担心
Management is concerned.

1836
02:32:17,890 --> 02:32:19,160
担心
Concerned?

1837
02:32:21,400 --> 02:32:23,570
她对你做的事太糟糕了
It's horrible what she's done to you.

1838
02:32:23,980 --> 02:32:25,950
把你卷进她的麻烦
Pulled you into her mess.

1839
02:32:28,080 --> 02:32:29,490
聪明人会怎么做呢
A smart man?

1840
02:32:30,760 --> 02:32:32,800
会让她自己解决
He'd let her handle it.

1841
02:32:33,620 --> 02:32:36,200
让事情按本该的样子发展
Let things unfold as they're meant to.

1842
02:32:37,070 --> 02:32:39,620
凭什么要你为他买单呢  医生
Why should you pay her tab, Doc?

1843
02:32:41,240 --> 02:32:42,580
为了什么呢
And for what?

1844
02:32:43,160 --> 02:32:47,110
就为了这个惹来所有麻烦的小姑娘吗
For this little girl who started all this trouble?

1845
02:32:47,210 --> 02:32:49,760
那上头想让我怎么做
What would management have me do about that?

1846
02:32:50,320 --> 02:32:51,360
什么都不做
Nothing.

1847
02:32:52,590 --> 02:32:55,080
这是世间最容易的事情  孩子
Easiest thing in the world to do, son.

1848
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:57,510
把她带进来
Just bring her inside.

1849
02:32:57,730 --> 02:32:59,460
然后
And then, well,

1850
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:03,550
接受自己无法改变的事情
you accept the things you cannot change.

1851
02:33:04,480 --> 02:33:05,400
丹
Dan!

1852
02:33:05,630 --> 02:33:06,640
她来了
She's here.

1853
02:33:24,770 --> 02:33:25,700
好
Okay.

1854
02:33:40,670 --> 02:33:42,380
这地方病了
This place is sick.

1855
02:33:43,240 --> 02:33:45,360
就像我奶奶一样
Sick like my momo was sick.

1856
02:33:45,780 --> 02:33:47,080
她得了癌症
It's cancer,

1857
02:33:47,510 --> 02:33:48,810
但这地方比那还糟
only worse.

1858
02:33:57,030 --> 02:33:58,330
我们现在做什么
What do we do now?

1859
02:33:58,370 --> 02:34:00,490
我们进去  她会来找我们
We head inside. She'll find us.

1860
02:35:50,490 --> 02:35:53,440
快瞧瞧
Well, well, well.

1861
02:35:54,690 --> 02:35:55,760
你们好啊
Hi there.

1862
02:35:56,430 --> 02:35:59,120
一旦开始  你就赶快跑
When this starts, run.

1863
02:35:59,650 --> 02:36:01,860
没错  你跑吧  亲爱的
Yes, you run, dear.

1864
02:36:02,500 --> 02:36:04,760
然后我会找到你
And then I will find you

1865
02:36:04,910 --> 02:36:09,270
我会让你尖叫许多年再死去
and you will scream for years until you die.

1866
02:36:10,950 --> 02:36:12,960
倒要瞧瞧谁是尖叫的那一个
We'll see who does the screaming.

1867
02:36:13,500 --> 02:36:15,190
没错  我们走着瞧
Oh, we'll see indeed.

1868
02:36:15,230 --> 02:36:16,640
她说的没错
She's right, you know.

1869
02:36:17,270 --> 02:36:18,920
你应该感到害怕
You should be afraid.

1870
02:36:20,080 --> 02:36:21,490
为什么
Why is that?

1871
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:24,410
因为你不知道你身处何处
Because you don't know where you're standing.

1872
02:36:25,160 --> 02:36:26,990
抱歉  帅哥  你是哪位
I'm sorry, who are you, handsome?

1873
02:36:31,560 --> 02:36:34,740
就是你是杀了我的乌鸦  对吧
You're the one who killed my Crow, aren't you?

1874
02:36:36,340 --> 02:36:37,210
开始
Go.

1875
02:37:38,580 --> 02:37:40,130
真聪明
Clever.

1876
02:37:40,940 --> 02:37:43,230
你做了不少改进是吧
You've made some improvements, haven't you?

1877
02:37:44,280 --> 02:37:46,940
自从我上次侵入你的脑子之后
Since the last time I was in your mind.

1878
02:37:46,960 --> 02:37:48,970
你怎知道不是我们侵入了你的脑子
How do you know we're not in yours?

1879
02:38:03,320 --> 02:38:05,080
你在哪呢  小家伙
Where are you, pup?

1880
02:38:25,490 --> 02:38:27,090
你将死在这里
You're gonna die here.

1881
02:38:28,900 --> 02:38:30,520
真敢说  亲爱的
Brave words, dear.

1882
02:38:31,290 --> 02:38:33,440
你真的是那么想的吗
Is that what you really think?

1883
02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:36,260
你能伤到我
You're gonna hurt me?

1884
02:38:36,260 --> 02:38:37,170
没错
Yes.

1885
02:38:44,080 --> 02:38:47,370
你让我想起了我自己
You know, you remind me of myself.

1886
02:38:48,770 --> 02:38:50,400
我现在看明白了
I can really see it now.

1887
02:38:51,240 --> 02:38:53,440
你内心深藏着黑暗  亲爱的
You've got a darkness in you, dear.

1888
02:38:53,810 --> 02:38:57,850
我想你我之间唯一的区别  就是时间
I think the only difference between you and me is time.

1889
02:39:06,820 --> 02:39:08,270
你还不知道
You don't know yet...

1890
02:39:09,150 --> 02:39:10,470
为了拥有更多的时间
what you'd do...

1891
02:39:11,320 --> 02:39:12,660
人都会做些什么
for more time.

1892
02:39:14,210 --> 02:39:18,350
不过我跟你保证  亲爱的  你会感到惊讶的
But I promise you, dear, oh, you'd be surprised.

1893
02:39:23,100 --> 02:39:25,230
疼痛净化灵气
Pain purifies steam.

1894
02:39:26,130 --> 02:39:30,020
恐惧亦然  请你理解
Fear, too, so, you understand.

1895
02:39:49,630 --> 02:39:52,360
我年轻时和你一模一样
I was just like you when I was younger.

1896
02:39:52,480 --> 02:39:54,500
我非常特别
I was special

1897
02:39:54,980 --> 02:39:56,460
也孤身一人
and alone.

1898
02:39:56,460 --> 02:39:59,550
但我遇到了给予我归属和使命的人
But I met someone who gave me the gift of purpose, of community.

1899
02:39:59,550 --> 02:40:01,660
如果事情不是发展至此
And I might have given you such a gift

1900
02:40:01,660 --> 02:40:04,810
我本来也可能给予你同样的馈赠
if things would have gone differently.

1901
02:40:07,330 --> 02:40:08,250
不要吗
No?

1902
02:40:09,530 --> 02:40:11,600
你很目中无人  是吧
Defiant, aren't you?

1903
02:40:12,540 --> 02:40:14,090
和我真像
So much like me.

1904
02:40:14,090 --> 02:40:17,360
你的脑子如此...
Your mind is so...

1905
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:22,010
这不是你的脑子  对吗
This isn't your mind, is it?

1906
02:40:24,270 --> 02:40:26,100
这根本不是你
This isn't you at all.

1907
02:40:28,180 --> 02:40:30,930
你只是个诱饵
You're just the bait.

1908
02:40:34,090 --> 02:40:35,290
够了
Enough!

1909
02:40:38,370 --> 02:40:39,260
快跑
Run.

1910
02:40:41,910 --> 02:40:44,500
我们怎么会没发现你
How the hell did we miss you?

1911
02:40:47,390 --> 02:40:50,240
你我本该多年前就相识
You and I should have met years ago.

1912
02:40:53,420 --> 02:40:54,460
丹尼
Danny.

1913
02:40:55,560 --> 02:40:58,490
那是你的名字  对吧
That's your name, isn't it?

1914
02:40:59,500 --> 02:41:02,840
当凡人变老  灵气会发生一些变化
Well, something happens to the steam when you rubes get older.

1915
02:41:03,130 --> 02:41:05,120
会被污染
It gets polluted.

1916
02:41:05,310 --> 02:41:06,420
变得肮脏
Dirty.

1917
02:41:06,930 --> 02:41:08,230
你知道的
You know that.

1918
02:41:09,270 --> 02:41:11,790
我能看见你浑身的污秽
I see the grease all over you.

1919
02:41:12,270 --> 02:41:14,800
你的闪灵和以前不太一样了
You don't shine quite the same.

1920
02:41:15,070 --> 02:41:18,190
成长糟蹋了你的闪灵
Growing up spoils that, I guess.

1921
02:41:19,720 --> 02:41:21,500
说真的  帅哥
Seriously, handsome,

1922
02:41:22,040 --> 02:41:24,650
你这么多年都躲在哪里
where have you been hiding?

1923
02:41:27,410 --> 02:41:29,360
我给你开个条件
I can make you an offer.

1924
02:41:30,810 --> 02:41:32,550
一个我绝少开的条件
An offer I rarely make.

1925
02:41:32,550 --> 02:41:35,090
是吗  我真期待呢
Oh, yeah? I can't wait.

1926
02:41:35,090 --> 02:41:37,010
如此天赋异禀的男孩
Such a gifted boy

1927
02:41:37,110 --> 02:41:39,950
长久以来深藏不露
hiding his light under a bushel for so long.

1928
02:41:40,940 --> 02:41:44,320
你可以活得很久  也可以活得很好
You could live a long, long time. Live well, too.

1929
02:41:45,470 --> 02:41:49,550
尽情放纵  无需承担后果
Indulge yourself, no consequences,

1930
02:41:49,860 --> 02:41:51,610
也不会宿醉
no hangovers.

1931
02:41:53,150 --> 02:41:55,900
吃得好  长生不老
Eat well, live long.

1932
02:41:55,900 --> 02:41:58,850
只剩你一个了  你肯定很孤单
You must be lonely, being the last one.

1933
02:41:58,850 --> 02:42:00,970
全世界只剩你一个
I mean, the last one in the world.

1934
02:42:01,080 --> 02:42:03,530
亲爱的  我可不是最后一个  差得远呢
Sweetie, I'm not the last. Far from it.

1935
02:42:04,840 --> 02:42:06,640
我只不过是最漂亮的一个
I'm just the prettiest.

1936
02:42:06,650 --> 02:42:08,760
想必你已经知道我的答复了
I assume you know my answer.

1937
02:42:10,340 --> 02:42:11,390
太可惜了
Pity.

1938
02:42:11,590 --> 02:42:13,410
那我们还打不打了
So, are we doing this or not?

1939
02:42:33,780 --> 02:42:35,500
亲爱的
Oh, sweetie.

1940
02:42:36,860 --> 02:42:38,550
瞧瞧
Look at that, huh?

1941
02:42:39,860 --> 02:42:43,500
我似乎伤到了你的股动脉
I seem to have nicked your femoral artery there.

1942
02:42:44,120 --> 02:42:46,090
你会失血过多而死  是吗
Why, you're gonna bleed to death, huh?

1943
02:42:52,420 --> 02:42:54,770
老天  你脾气还真是倔
My, my, what a temper you have.

1944
02:42:54,770 --> 02:42:56,480
火气不小
So much fire.

1945
02:42:56,490 --> 02:42:58,210
真是浪费
Such a waste!

1946
02:42:58,270 --> 02:42:59,770
也许不是浪费
Or maybe not.

1947
02:43:06,810 --> 02:43:08,440
见鬼
Oh, damn.

1948
02:43:09,160 --> 02:43:11,100
即便在你这个岁数
Even at your age...

1949
02:43:11,630 --> 02:43:13,720
还是如此美味
it's so good.

1950
02:43:18,490 --> 02:43:20,800
你尝起来就像威士忌
You taste like whiskey.

1951
02:43:25,740 --> 02:43:26,860
丹尼
Danny!

1952
02:43:27,980 --> 02:43:29,490
小丹尼
Danny boy!

1953
02:43:29,420 --> 02:43:30,340
{\an8}红朗姆

1954
02:43:31,150 --> 02:43:32,950
如此深重的恐惧
Oh, so much terror.

1955
02:43:33,100 --> 02:43:34,970
你的一生都如此吗
All your life, huh?

1956
02:43:37,180 --> 02:43:39,230
太美味了
Delicious.

1957
02:43:45,710 --> 02:43:47,190
别伤害我
Don't hurt me!

1958
02:43:48,750 --> 02:43:50,440
见鬼
Oh, damn.

1959
02:43:54,500 --> 02:43:56,200
什么...不只有你一个
What are... You're not alone in there.

1960
02:43:58,140 --> 02:43:59,760
你还藏了什么
What are you hiding, huh?

1961
02:44:01,790 --> 02:44:03,350
那些是什么
What's in those?

1962
02:44:03,500 --> 02:44:05,160
特别的东西  是吧
Something special, huh?

1963
02:44:05,880 --> 02:44:09,220
他们才不特别  他们饿坏了
They're not special. They're starving.

1964
02:44:17,360 --> 02:44:17,870
不
No.

1965
02:44:17,870 --> 02:44:18,740
不
No.

1966
02:44:18,960 --> 02:44:19,920
不
No!

1967
02:44:57,860 --> 02:45:00,020
你好啊  丹尼
Hello, Danny.

1968
02:45:01,690 --> 02:45:03,810
来和我们一起玩
Come and play with us...

1969
02:45:05,280 --> 02:45:06,970
永远
forever...

1970
02:45:07,960 --> 02:45:09,680
永远
and ever...

1971
02:45:10,810 --> 02:45:12,640
永永远远
and ever.

1972
02:45:46,830 --> 02:45:47,910
丹叔叔
Uncle Dan.

1973
02:45:49,180 --> 02:45:51,270
丹叔叔  搞定了吗
Uncle Dan, is it done?

1974
02:45:51,890 --> 02:45:53,070
她死了吗
Is she dead?

1975
02:46:15,250 --> 02:46:17,260
派对很棒吧
Great party, isn't it?

1976
02:46:17,560 --> 02:46:18,840
阿布拉
Abra!

1977
02:46:22,730 --> 02:46:24,200
阿布拉
Abra!

1978
02:46:40,290 --> 02:46:41,930
阿布拉
Abra!

1979
02:46:48,150 --> 02:46:49,770
阿布拉
Abra!

1980
02:47:08,200 --> 02:47:09,290
来啊
Try it.

1981
02:47:12,780 --> 02:47:14,090
你在这呢
There you are.

1982
02:47:14,220 --> 02:47:15,300
阿布拉
Abra.

1983
02:47:16,480 --> 02:47:18,770
你很不乖哦
You've been very, very bad.

1984
02:47:19,100 --> 02:47:20,590
你不是丹叔叔
You're not Uncle Dan.

1985
02:47:21,390 --> 02:47:24,550
你只是一个面具  一张假的面孔
You're a mask. A false face.

1986
02:47:25,680 --> 02:47:27,110
那我能是谁
Who else would I be?

1987
02:47:27,180 --> 02:47:28,450
你是这家酒店
You're the hotel.

1988
02:47:28,780 --> 02:47:30,300
但他仍然存在
But he's still in there.

1989
02:47:30,300 --> 02:47:31,810
那就摘掉面具吧
Mask is off, then.

1990
02:47:36,630 --> 02:47:38,420
你为什么笑
Why are you smiling?

1991
02:47:38,690 --> 02:47:40,870
因为你不知道你身处何处
Because you don't know where you're standing.

1992
02:47:42,200 --> 02:47:44,830
我对这些走廊了如指掌  孩子
I know these halls like my own face, child.

1993
02:47:44,830 --> 02:47:46,890
我是说你身处的这具躯体
I mean the body you're standing in.

1994
02:47:47,020 --> 02:47:48,630
你戴起的这幅面孔
The face you're wearing.

1995
02:47:48,970 --> 02:47:50,970
这是丹·托伦斯  而你并不了解他
That's Dan Torrance, and you don't know him.

1996
02:47:50,970 --> 02:47:52,820
丹·托伦斯
Dan Torrance.

1997
02:47:52,830 --> 02:47:56,630
丹·托伦斯来到这里做的第一件事
Dan Torrance made one stop as soon as he got here.

1998
02:47:57,410 --> 02:47:58,770
就是去了锅炉房
To the boiler room.

1999
02:48:24,680 --> 02:48:26,040
你回来了
There you are.

2000
02:48:27,370 --> 02:48:28,910
不是让你跑吗
You were supposed to run.

2001
02:48:29,110 --> 02:48:30,700
我不想扔下你
I didn't wanna leave you.

2002
02:48:33,700 --> 02:48:35,720
我就在我本该在的地方
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

2003
02:48:37,450 --> 02:48:40,200
我无法抵抗他们太久  阿布拉  你得赶快离开
I can't hold it off for much longer. Abra, you need to run.

2004
02:48:40,200 --> 02:48:41,060
不
No.

2005
02:48:41,230 --> 02:48:43,100
没有你我哪也不去
I'm not going anywhere without you.

2006
02:48:43,260 --> 02:48:45,570
我得把我们身后的门关上  不是吗
I have to close the door behind us, right?

2007
02:48:46,510 --> 02:48:48,000
跑  快跑
Run! Run!

2008
02:51:02,450 --> 02:51:03,810
快点  丹叔叔
Come on, Uncle Dan.

2009
02:51:04,200 --> 02:51:05,500
快出来
Get out of there.

2010
02:51:06,830 --> 02:51:07,820
快点
Come on.

2011
02:51:19,660 --> 02:51:21,430
火势扩散地很快
The fire spread fast,

2012
02:51:22,120 --> 02:51:23,630
毁掉了酒店
destroying the hotel.

2013
02:51:24,040 --> 02:51:25,400
净化了它
Purifying it.

2014
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:28,500
我几乎能听到它的...
I could almost hear it...

2015
02:51:29,100 --> 02:51:30,380
尖叫
screaming.

2016
02:51:31,410 --> 02:51:33,070
我能听到它在死去
I could hear it dying.

2017
02:51:34,140 --> 02:51:37,080
而内心深处  我知道...
And deep inside, I knew...

2018
02:51:39,660 --> 02:51:41,240
我知道你没事
I knew you were okay.

2019
02:51:42,950 --> 02:51:45,080
抱歉我让你身处险境
I'm sorry I put you in danger.

2020
02:51:45,920 --> 02:51:47,300
那是唯一的办法
It was the only way.

2021
02:51:48,300 --> 02:51:49,230
我知道
I know.

2022
02:51:50,700 --> 02:51:53,560
你认为她说的是真的吗
Do you think she was right

2023
02:51:53,950 --> 02:51:56,120
她不是最后一个
when she said she wasn't the last one?

2024
02:51:57,230 --> 02:51:58,940
这是个饥肠辘辘的世界
The world's a hungry place.

2025
02:51:59,510 --> 02:52:00,960
非常黑暗
A dark place.

2026
02:52:02,190 --> 02:52:03,340
也许像他们那样的人还有更多
Maybe there's more of them

2027
02:52:03,340 --> 02:52:04,420
或是比他们更可怕的东西
or things like them or worse,

2028
02:52:04,420 --> 02:52:07,980
但也有更多像你一样的人
but there are more people like you, too.

2029
02:52:08,430 --> 02:52:10,020
挺身而出的人
People who stand.

2030
02:52:13,740 --> 02:52:15,390
我第一次见到你时
I told you when I first met you,

2031
02:52:15,390 --> 02:52:18,430
就告诉你应该藏起来
I told you that you should hide.

2032
02:52:19,730 --> 02:52:21,710
应该低调行事
That you should keep your head down.

2033
02:52:22,880 --> 02:52:24,620
掩藏你的闪灵能力
Keep your shine out of sight.

2034
02:52:26,750 --> 02:52:28,180
但我错了
But I was wrong.

2035
02:52:31,440 --> 02:52:33,290
展现你的闪灵吧  阿布拉·斯通
Shine on, Abra Stone.

2036
02:52:36,210 --> 02:52:37,590
尽情展现
You shine on.

2037
02:52:41,140 --> 02:52:42,420
晚饭好了
Dinner's ready.

2038
02:52:45,450 --> 02:52:46,940
你和谁说话呢
Who are you talking to?

2039
02:52:49,300 --> 02:52:50,370
没谁
No one.

2040
02:52:58,550 --> 02:52:59,850
我说谎了
That's not true.

2041
02:53:04,030 --> 02:53:05,560
我在和丹说话
I was talking to Dan.

2042
02:53:13,300 --> 02:53:15,810
我们死后仍然存在
We go on after.

2043
02:53:16,280 --> 02:53:17,370
仍然存在
We go on.

2044
02:53:18,210 --> 02:53:19,480
他没事
And he's okay.

2045
02:53:20,530 --> 02:53:21,780
爸爸也是
So is Daddy.

2046
02:53:23,100 --> 02:53:24,360
他真的没事
He really is.

2047
02:53:28,460 --> 02:53:29,490
那就好
Good.

2048
02:53:41,260 --> 02:53:42,560
来吃饭吗  宝贝
You coming, sweetheart?

2049
02:53:45,290 --> 02:53:46,410
