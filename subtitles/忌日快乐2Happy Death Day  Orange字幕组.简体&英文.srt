Yeah, but, Ryan, we have no idea what set the device off.

62
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,480
实验室是锁着的
Lab was locked.

63

Love the tie. Are those cats?

70
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,250
是土耳其安哥拉猫 别转移话题
Turkish angora. Don't change the subject.

71

- 什么话题 - 那个

fried electrical circuits, broken bulbs all over campus.

74
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,240
这都多亏了你的破科学项目
And it's all because of your little science project.

75
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,080
- 这是我的论文设计项目 - 这是个彻头彻尾的失败
- It's my thesis project. - It's an abject failure.

76
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,410
我们大学的科学系
This university's science department prides itself

77
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,170
以其开拓性的前瞻思维及成果而自豪
on pioneering forward-thinking ideas that yield results.

78
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,620
这些成果能转而申请专利 你明白其中的道理吗
Results that lead to patents. Do you see how it works?

79
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,330
- 所以 这只是为了钱吗 - 是的 潘先生
- So, it's just about money? - Yes, Mr. Phan.

80
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,240
我并不想打破你的幻想
I hate to shatter your illusions,

81
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,470
但是总得有人把话跟你讲明白
but somebody has to keep the lights on around here,

82
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,190
那就是 你的科学项目必须停止
something you seem hell-bent on stopping, literally.

83
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,450
就当这可笑的项目被推迟了吧 命令立即生效
Consider this joke of a project suspended, effective immediately.

84
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,630
- 什么 - 你没听错
- What? - That's right.

85
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,180
我已经给博纳教授打过电话了
I've already called Professor Boner.

86
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,880
是邦纳
It's pronounced "Bonner."

87
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,440
他完全同意我的要求
And he's in total agreement with my request.

88
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,580
我让保安
I'm sending security to

89
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,560
在今天6点前收走这耗能的破玩意儿
come and collect this energy-sucking doohickey by 6:00 today.

90
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,210
- 你不能就这样把它收走 - 听我说
- You can't just take her. - Watch me.

91
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,450
我建议你把你放这儿的
I suggest you wrap up

92
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,400
所有东西打包带走 听清楚了吗
whatever business you have left here, capisce?

93
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,960
有人吗
Hello?

94
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,050
什么鬼
What the hell?

95
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,710
嘿 屎包 在你玩
Hey, shit bags! While you were

96
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,090
这无聊小游戏的时候 我们的项目被下令停止了
off playing games, our project got shut down.

97
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,870
我祝你玩得开心
I hope you're happy!

98
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,100
- 你有什么毛病 - 你鬼鬼祟祟跟着我干嘛
- What is wrong with you? - Why are you sneaking up on me?

99
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
我给你带了个
I was bringing you a...

100
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,510
好了 这下它沾满细菌了
Well, now it's covered in bacteria.

101
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,990
两美元浪费掉了
So, that's two dollars wasted.

102
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,280
太不领情了
So ungrateful.

103
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,980
好小子
Good boy.

104
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,690
弗兰克 别这样
Frank, no!

105
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,040
跟你说了别那么做
Told you not to do that.

106
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,620
哎哟
Ouch!

107
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,670
- 哥们 你有病啊 - 对不起 伙计
- Dude, what's your problem? - I'm so sorry, man.

108
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,500
实在对不起
So sorry.

109
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,210

111
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,900
别吵了
Shut up!

112
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,750
我做噩梦了
I'm having bad dreams

113
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,870
我躺着睡不着

114
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,670
噢 你会永远这样的
Oh, you're taking forever!

115
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440

117
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,280
伙计
Dude...

118
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,210
我现在应该是产生幻觉了
I am tripping right now.

119
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,650
没错 别废话了
Yeah, no shit.

120
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,480
不 不 不 我是说真的 我有正事
No. No, no, seriously. I'm having that thing.

121
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,190
你知道吗 怎么说呢
You know? What's it called?

122
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,260
就是你觉得你已经经历过现在发生的一切
When you feel like you've already lived through something before.

123
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,400
- 记忆幻觉 - 是的 就是那样
- Deja vu? - Yes, that.

124
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,210
我感觉我已经完全经历过这一天了
I feel like I've totally lived through this day already.

125
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,410
噢 我的老天 回答我 瑞恩
Oh, my God. Answer me, Ryan.

126
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,900
瑞恩 伙计 噢 我的老天 快点过来 兄弟
Ryan, dude. Oh, my God. Get over here right now, man.

127
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,960
这太疯狂了 噢 我的老天
This is crazy. Oh, my God.

128
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,370
我一会再打给你
I gotta call you back.

129
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,210
好了 深呼吸 深呼吸
Okay. Just breathe. Just breathe.

130
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,220
听我说
Listen to me.

131
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,720
你死的这一天重新开始了 对吗
The day reset when you died, right?

132
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,770
是的 有个戴着婴儿面具的神经病袭击了我
Yeah. Some psycho dude in a baby mask attacked me.

133
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,720
但这只是个梦吧 对吗
But it was just a dream, right?

134
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,430
- 图姆斯已经死了 - 洛丽也是
- Tombs is dead. - So is Lori.

135
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,140
所以这次的凶手是谁
Then who's the killer this time?

136
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,230
呃 打断一下 有人能跟我解释下这他妈到底是怎么回事吗
Uh, hello? Will someone please explain what the hell is going on?

137
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,860
好的 简单来说
Okay. Recap.

138
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,350
我得一直重新经历同一天 也就是星期一 18号
So, I was stuck reliving the same day, Monday, the 18th,

139
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,240
一遍又一遍地重来
over and over and over again

140
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,620
直到一个戴着贝菲尔德婴儿面具的人
until someone wearing a Bayfield Baby mask murdered me

141
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,120
在我生日当晚把我杀了
on the night of my birthday.

142
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,130
我不知道是谁要杀我 因为我是那么一个疯婊子
I had no idea who it was because I was such a crazy bitch

143
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,780
很多人都对我恨之入骨
and so many people hated my guts.

144
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,760
所以 我听了卡特的建议 列了个嫌疑人名单
So, at Carter's suggestion, I made a list of suspects.

145
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,590
最后结果证明凶手是我的室友 洛丽
Turns out it was my roommate, Lori,

146
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,100
她一直在帮一个连环杀人犯从医院出逃
who kept on helping a serial killer escape from the hospital,

147
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,790
希望这样看起来就像是他杀了我
hoping it would look like he murdered me when,

148
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,830
但是事实上 一直都是她
in fact, it was her all along.

149
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,000
就因为她嫉妒我和
And all because she was jealous of an affair I was having

150
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,980
我已婚的大学教授格雷戈里有一腿
with my college professor, Gregory, who's married.

151
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,020
对 我知道 这样确实挺婊的 但是不管怎么说
Yeah, I know. Pretty shitty. But anyways...

152
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,360
我最后踹了洛丽的屁股 把她踢出窗外 杀死了她
I finally kicked Lori's crazy ass out a window and killed her,

153
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,060
打破了循环 我以前是这么以为的
which broke the loop, or so I thought.

154
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,100
但是现在看起来我好像把这个循环传给了你
But now it only looks like I passed the loop on to you.

155
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,760
而你得不断地重过这一天
And you're gonna be stuck reliving this day

156
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,700
知道我们想出办法把它停下
until we figure out how to stop it.

157
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,500
明白了
Of course.

158
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,210
我还在做梦
I'm still dreaming.

159
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,090
- 等下 你明白什么了 - 这就像盗梦空间
- Wait. What? - It's like Inception.

160
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,880
这是一个梦中梦
It's a dream within a dream.

161
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,850
兄弟 你没在做梦
Bro, you're not dreaming.

162
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,720
瑞恩 我们
Ryan, we...

163
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,140
嘘 我在试着让自己醒来
Shh. I'm trying to wake myself up.

164
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,690
- 好了 明白没 你没在做梦 - 你为什么要打我蛋蛋
- There. See? You're not dreaming. - Why'd you hit my penis?

165
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,170
你反应这么大干嘛
Why are you acting like this?

166
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,900
你打了我的蛋蛋 这太粗鲁了
You smacked my dick. That's rude.

167
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,050
我根本没怎么碰到你
I barely touched you.

168
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,070
好了
Okay.

169
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,070
带我去你死的地方
Show me where you died.

170
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,960
在那后面 储藏室那边
Back there. Storage closet.

171
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,880
嘿 把那个给我
Hey. Give me that.

172
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,340
我自己可以对付
I can handle myself.

173
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,680
你死的已经够多了 不是吗
You've died enough, haven't you?

174
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,220
嗯
Mmm.

175
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,600
打爆他的头
Bash his head in.

176
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,770
萨马 你个混蛋
Samar, you asshole!

177
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,110
- 你打我干嘛 - 你鬼鬼祟祟跟着我干嘛
- Why'd you hit me? - Why do you keep sneaking up on me?

178
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,900
啊 我感觉我的颧骨断了
Ah, I think my cheekbone's broken.

179
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,610
- 这儿发生什么了 - 瑞恩打断了我的颧骨
- What is happening in here? - Ryan broke my cheekbone!

180
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,570
- 是他吗 - 不是
- Was it him? - No.

181
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,960
我之前死的时候他就在这
He was here when I died before.

182
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,000
- 什么 - 你从哪弄来的这个面具
- What? - Where'd you get that mask?

183
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,380
它就在走廊里 一定是有人掉那儿的
It was just laying in the hallway. Somebody must've dropped it.

184
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,920
就这样吧 我受够了
That's it! I've had it!

185
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,830
等等 等等 你们去哪
Wait, wait. Where you going?

186
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,450
- 呃 今天食堂有油炸饼 - 吃饭去咯
- Uh, churro day at the cafeteria. - Nom, nom.

187
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,830
我们已经停电了四次 满校园都是炸坏的电路
We've had four rolling blackouts, fried electrical circuits,

188
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,550
坏掉的灯泡
broken bulbs all over campus.

189
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,620
这都多亏了你的破科学项目
And it's all because of your little science project.

190
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
等等
Wait.

191
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,890
什么科学项目
What science project?

192
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,270
西西弗斯量子冷却反应堆
The Sisyphus Quantum Cooling Reactor.

193
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,140
我们简称它为西西
We call it Sisy for short.

194
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,190
看到这些了吗
You see all these?

195
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,320
它们是质子激光器 当它们启动时
They're proton lasers. And when they fire,

196
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,650
它们会使离心机冷却
they cool the centrifuge

197
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,740
热量几乎低于1微开尔文
right here to almost below one nanokelvin.

198
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,230
所以 基本上说 我们试图证明
So, basically, we're trying to prove

199
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,620
时间可以在分子级别上减慢
that time can be slowed down on a molecular level.

200
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,870
我们还没有成功 但确实发现了一些数据可以证明这一点
It hasn't worked yet, but we did find some promising data

201
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,000
就在一天夜里 这个设备启动的时候
after the device fired the other night.

202
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,170
具体什么时候
When?

203
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,460
昨天凌晨1点
1 a.M. Yesterday.

204
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,250
星期一 18号
Monday, the 18th.

205
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,710
嗯哼
Mmm-hmm.

206
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,720
怎么了
What?

207
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,640
是你造成了时间循坏 蠢货
You created the time loop, dummy.

208
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,980
不可能 这不是我们设计西西的初衷
That's impossible. That's not what Sisy was designed to do.

209
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,400
我不知道怎么跟你说
I don't know what to tell you.

210
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,490
也许我们刚好发现了它真正能做的事
Well, maybe we're just discovering what it actually does.

211
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,480
一个意料之外的结果
An unintended reaction.

212
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,350
也许我们以为我们能使时间变慢
Maybe we thought we were slowing time,

213
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,640
但我们使它循环了
but what if we looped it instead?

214
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,120
现在你被困在这一天了
Now you're stuck in this day.

215
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,150
恭喜
Congrats.

216
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,700
噢 顺便提醒你 你会死
Oh, and by the way, you're gonna die,

217
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,330
一遍 一遍 又一遍地死去
again and again and again.

218
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,070
卡特 让你女朋友别吓我了
Carter, tell your girlfriend to stop trying to scare me.

219
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,420
噢 她不是我的女朋友
Oh, she's not my girlfriend.

220
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,170
- 噢 等等 你是我的女朋友吗 - 算是吧
- Oh, wait. Are you my girlfriend? - Kinda.

221
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,200
伙计们 你们聊完你们的感情状况了没
Guys, are you done talking about your relationship status?

222
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,280
因为她刚刚说我会死
Because she just said I'm gonna die.

223
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,990
你得想办法在凶手再一次找到你之前
And you need to figure out how to close the loop

224
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,510
停止这个循环
before the killer finds you again.

225
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,220
但是我不知道这一切怎么发生的
But I don't know how it happened.

226
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,470
它就是自己启动了
It just fired on its own.

227
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,270
噢 老天
Oh, God.

228
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,100
丹妮尔 嗨
Danielle, hi.

229
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,810
- 你去哪了 - 什么意思
- Where were you? - What do you mean?

230
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,060
- 你没来参加我们的宿舍会议 - 会议取消了
- You ditched our house meeting. - It was canceled.

231
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
什么时候的事
When?

232
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,150
唔 在我把我的杀人犯室友踢出窗外以后
Um, after I kicked my murdering roommate out of a window.

233
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,820
说的没错 那是谁向卡帕祈祷 说我们中了死亡诅咒
Exactly. Who's gonna pledge Kappa now that we have a death curse?

234
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,910
还说我们处于危机之中 翠儿
We're in crisis mode, Tree.

235
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,540
噢
Ew.

236
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,160
这些人是谁
Who are these people?

237
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,830
嗨 啊 我是萨马
Hi. Uh, I'm Samar.

238
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,340
嘿 咖喱角 我的头在这
Hey, samosa, my head's the middle one.

239
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,540
不管怎样 你这鬼鬼祟祟的会议一结束
Anyhoo, call me as soon as you're

240
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,010
就给我打电话
done with your creepy little Comic-Con meeting.

241
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,590
- 她刚刚叫我咖喱角吗 - 你没听错
- Did she just call me "Samosa"? - Yep.

242
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,120
- 你觉得她喜欢咖喱角吗 - 不喜欢
- You think she likes samosas? - No.

243
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,560
伙计们 听着 我不想死
Guys, focus. I don't wanna die.

244
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,940
从好的方面想 你会重生的 我一共死了11次
On the bright side, you'll come back. I died 11 times.

245
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,770
11次 我嘞个天 那得多疼
Eleven? Hell no. That shit hurts.

246
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,700
等等 伙计们 我有个主意
Wait a minute. Guys, I have an idea.

247
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,370
我们只需要找个
We just need to find the

248
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,200
最安全的地方 然后在那儿等着凶手
safest possible place and wait it out there.

249
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,070
哪儿
Where?

250
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,390
怎么了
What?

251
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,260
这人多 很安全
There's safety in numbers.

252
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,360
更像是躲在光天化日之下
More like hiding in plain sight.

253
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,190
不管怎么说 是哪个家伙选了一个恐怖的婴儿头来作吉祥物
Who picks a creepy baby for a mascot, anyway?

254
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,610
我就知道我该去麻省理工
I knew I should have gone to MIT.

255
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,790
他走步犯规了
He traveled!

256
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,090
空炮
Airball!

257
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,840
这是你和你妈妈吗
Is that you and your mom?

258
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,550
真可爱
That's cute.

259
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,800
我在想
I was thinking.

260
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,760
这太讽刺了
It's ironic.

261
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,460
我原本以为 我被困在
Here I thought I was stuck

262
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,690
同一天是因为一些重大的宇宙原因
in the same day for some big cosmic reason.

263
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,520
眼睁睁看着我妈妈死去
Facing my mom's death.

264
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,650
我却什么都做不了
It had nothing to do with her.

265
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,120
结果却发现这只是个科学的意外
Turns out it was just some big scientific fluke.

266
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,870
但这并没有使它失去原有的意义 不是吗
That doesn't make it mean any less, does it?

267
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,750
是吧
I guess not.

268
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,590
你这里沾了个小东西 好了 啊哈
You got a little something right here. Yep. Uh-huh.

269
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,590
对不起
Sorry.

270
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,010
你可真老套
You're such a grandpa.

271
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,520
是啊 但你还是被我骗了 所以
Yeah, well, you fell for it, so...

272
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,440
请有序地从最近的出口离开
Please make your way to the nearest exit in an orderly fashion.

273
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,240
这不是演习
This is not a drill.

274
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,330
请有序地从最近的出口离开
Please make your way to the nearest exit in an orderly fashion.

275
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,660
再说一遍 这不是演习
Again, this is not a drill.

276
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,930
嘿 长点眼
Hey, watch it!

277
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,150
伙计们 等等我
Guys! Wait up!

278
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,230
别推我
Don't push me!

279
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,910
嘿 我找不到我的手机了
Hey, I can't find my phone.

280
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,830
救命 救命 救救我
Help! Help! Please!

281
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
救命
Help!

282
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,260
救命
Help!

283
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,530
怎么了
What was that?

284
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,070
下来
Down here.

285
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,400
卧了个槽
Holy shit.

286
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,690
- 你没事吧 - 我想应该没事
- Are you okay? - Yeah, I think so.

287
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,410
- 噢 该死 干得好 - 这事我经验可不少
- Well, damn. Good job. - I've had a little practice.

288
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,640
你在搞什么鬼 我以为你是凶手
What the hell? I thought you were the killer.

289
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,110
- 你该说句话的 - 但我在找你
- You should have said something. - But I was looking for you.

290
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,050
这是谁
Well, who is it?

291
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,420
要弄清楚只有一个方法了
Only one way to find out.

292
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,760
搞什么
What the...

293
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,370
你确定你没有孪生兄弟吗
Are you sure you don't have a twin brother?

294
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,060
- 也许你们出生不久后就被分开了 - 我当然确定啊
- Maybe you were separated at birth. - Of course, I'm sure.

295
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:36,870
完了
Oh, shit.

296
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,360
你确实完了 快报上名来
"Oh, shit" Is right. Who are you?

297
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,600
我还能是谁啊 动动脑子好吗
- Who do you think I am, dummy?

298
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,910
- 是你 - 不然呢
- It's you. - Duh.

299
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,710
这里到底发生了什么事
What the hell is going on here?

300
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,240
我当时想关上这个循环
Look, I was trying to close the loop.

301
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,340
但是不知道怎么的 就被带进了这个平行世界
But, somehow, I got knocked into a parallel time loop.

302
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,260
我们现在都非常危险
We're all in serious danger.

303
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,580
我们在同一个维度共存的时间越长
The longer we exist in the same dimension,

304
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,970
后果就会越严重
the worse things will get.

305
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,430
这是蝴蝶效应 你要杀了他才行
It's a butterfly effect. You have to kill him!

306
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
我
Me?

307
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,310
你要是不阻止他 他还会闯更大的祸
He's going to create bigger problems if you do not stop him.

308
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,760
杀了他 快啊
Kill him, now!

309
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,020
管他呢 快杀他呀
No, screw that. Kill him.

310
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,440
别浪费时间了 快动手
You're wasting your time. Do it!

311
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,020
兄弟 我才是你朋友 不是他
Dude, I'm your friend. Not him.

312
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,940
去他奶奶的 我还是自己来吧
You know what? Screw this. I'll just take care of it myself.

313
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,780
拦住他
Stop him!

314
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,490
等等 瑞恩 要不你先等一会儿
Wait, Ryan. Maybe you should stop.

315
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,820
你看看他 他疯了
Look at him, he's crazy.

316
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,190
这东西是我设计的 我知道我在干什么
I'm the one who designed this. I know what I'm doing.

317
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,920
- 你现在太不理智了 - 闭嘴吧你 假货
- You don't understand what you're doing! - Shut up, fake Ryan!

318
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,630
瑞恩 这不太对劲儿
Ryan, this doesn't feel right.

319
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,420
瑞恩 住手
Ryan, stop!

320
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,680
秒差距是长度单位 不是时间单位
But a parsec is a measure of distance, not time.

321
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,680
那你言下之意就是说韩苏罗是骗子囖
Okay, so now you're gonna call Han Solo a liar?

322
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,120
不 我是说如果一个普通的科舍尔航道是
No, I'm saying if a normal Kessel Run is...

323
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,300
德瑞 快救我
Dre, help me!

324
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
快点儿
Come on!

325
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,930
哇
Whoa.

326
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,980
伙计 你又给我的饮料下药了吗
Dude, did you dose my Yoo-hoo again?

327
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,020
我不是警告你别再用这机器了吗
What did I tell you about turning that thing on?

328
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,120
快把它关了
Turn it off now.

329
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,620
快关上 抓住他 抓住他 快
Turn it off now! Just get him. Get the man. Get him!

330
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,870
退后 退后
Back off! Back off!

331
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,420
- 瑞恩 你就把机器关了吧 - 瑞恩 你在干什么
- Ryan, just turn it off, man. - Ryan, what are you doing?

332
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,410
你们把他的扳手抢过来啊 他不过就是个大学生
Guys, take the wrench from him. He's a college student.

333
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,920
不就是一个扳手吗 别怕他
It's just a wrench. Don't be scared of him.

334
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,130
好了 那拔掉电源吧 给我把电源给拔了
Okay, all right. Just unplug it. Unplug the machine. Unplug it!

335
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,010
哇
Whoa!

336
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,520
不
No!

337
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,660
闭嘴
Shut up!

338
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,800
你醒啦
Oh, hey, you're up.

339
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,120
我不知道你想不想睡这儿
Yeah, I wasn't sure if you wanted to sleep in or not.

340
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,630
没错 今天是我的生日 我不会
Yeah, it's my birthday And I ain't gotta...

341
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:49,770
翠儿
Tree?

342
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,980
不是吧
No fucking way.

343
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,200
我帮你把衣服叠好了
Hey, I folded your clothes for you.

344
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,660
瑞恩 快给我滚进来
Ryan! Get in here right now!

345
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,030
等等 你们俩认识吗
Wait a minute, you two know each other?

346
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,090
- 没错 - 不认识啊
- Yes! - No.

347
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,550
瑞恩 你蠢到家了
Ryan, you dumb-ass!

348
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,100
你竟然又把我送了回来
You sent me back!

349
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,300
- 你说什么 - 今天是星期一 18号
- What? - It's Monday, the 18th!

350
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,270
这一定不是真的
I don't believe this.

351
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,890
我好不容易逃出来 你怎么可以这样对我
I just got out. How could you do this to me?

352
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,730
这个疯女人是谁啊
Uh, who's this crazy white girl?

353
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,530
你是不是做噩梦了
Maybe it was a bad dream or something.

354
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,610
你说的没错 的确是个噩梦
You're right. It is a bad dream.

355
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,280
超级大噩梦
It's a nightmare!

356
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,110
我太衰了
This sucks!

357
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,790
全世界都找不到
It sucks the biggest mega

358
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,570
第二个像我这么倒霉的了
balls in the history of shitty ball-suckery.

359
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,260
我没事
I'm okay.

360
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,930
- 你确定吗 - 没错
- You sure? - Yes.

361
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,390
他要把这事给我搞定 就现在
He just needs to fix this. Now.

362
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,900
你们在耍我 对吧
This is a joke, right?

363
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,900
我也希望是这样
I wish.

364
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,530
听着
Look.

365
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,820
瑞恩 我们现在去你的实验室 打开西西
Ryan, we need to go to your lab, turn on Sisy,

366
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,490
找到让我回去的方法
and figure out how to send me back.

367
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,660
你怎么知道西西的啊
How do you know about Sisy?

368
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,620
我的妈呀  真的是
Oh, my God. Just...

369
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,210
赶紧走
Let's go.

370
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,500
都给我麻溜点儿
andale, people.

371
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,010
缓解全球暖化了解一下
Hey. Stop global warming?

372
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,390
说声不用了谢谢会死啊
A simple "No, thanks" Would do!

373
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,850
对不起嘛
Sorry!

374
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,980
又是同一天 同一天 同一天 同一天
This is the same day. Same day, same day, same day!

375
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,810
你说啥呢 我听不见
I can't hear you!

376
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,220
拿下来之后一个一个传下去
You take one down, pass it around

377
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,080
继续
Keep going.

378
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,870
- 喂 你没回我的 - 你是弯的
- Hey, you haven't returned any... - You are gay.

379
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,610
等等 你去哪儿啊 实验室在那边
Wait, where are you going? The lab's back that way.

380
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,720
我有点事要先处理一下
I have some business to take care of first.

381
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,730
你个小贱人
You sneaky little biatch.

382
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,570
奇怪
That's weird.

383
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,860
- 怎么了 - 她应该在这才对啊
- What? - She was supposed to be here.

384
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:54,710
谁啊
Who?

385
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,090
算了 没事
Never mind.

386
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,960
某人终于回来啦
She finally rolls in.

387
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,210
- 你放哪儿了 - 什么东西放哪儿了
- Where is it? - Where's what?

388
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,430
- 你好 卡特 -你好
- Oh, hey, Carter. - Hey.

389
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,550
- 那个纸杯蛋糕在哪儿 - 什么纸杯蛋糕
- Where's the cupcake? - What cupcake?

390
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,310
你给我生日准备的 下了毒的那个
The one you made for my birthday. The one you poisoned.

391
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,520
噢
Oh.

392
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:17,810
那个纸杯蛋糕啊
That cupcake.

393
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,530
- 我没跟你开玩笑 - 我跟你说
- I'm serious. - Look.

394
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,770
我不知道丹妮尔跟你开了什么破烂玩笑
I don't know what stupid joke Danielle put you up to,

395
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,270
但是我没给你准备纸杯蛋糕
but there's no cupcake.

396
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,980
不好意思
Sorry.

397
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,160
好了 我要走了 我要给简替班呢
All right, I gotta go. I'm pulling a double for Jen.

398
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,530
她得流感了
She's got the flu.

399
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,580
生日快乐哦
Happy birthday, though.

400
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,450
拜啦
Toodles.

401
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,500
有点不对劲儿
Something's wrong.

402
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,200
- 哪里不对 - 我说不清楚
- What? - I don't know.

403
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,840
就是变了
It's different.

404
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,010
有两个我
There were two of me?

405
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,550
对 这就是整件事的经过
Yes. That is how this whole thing happened.

406
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,550
这让我想起回到未来第二部
You know, this kinda reminds me of Back to the Future II.

407
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,100
- 我也是 - 对吧
- Totally. - Right?

408
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,310
就是马蒂麦克弗莱演的那个
You know, with Marty McFly?

409
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,730
博士啊
Doc?

410
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,940
- 时光机呢 - 我不懂
- The DeLorean? - Sorry.

411
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,510
不是吧 你从来没看过回到未来吗
Are you serious? You've never seen Back to the Future?

412
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,860
没有 我
No, I...

413
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,860
- 你怎么 - 等等
- How do you... - Wait.

414
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,900
天啊 这是不是意味着
Oh, my God. Does this mean that...

415
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,870
是不是意味着这里有两个我
Does this mean that there are two of me?

416
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,540
不可能啦
I highly doubt it.

417
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,250
要创造出一个全息宇宙基本是不可能的
It's almost impossible to create a holographic universe.

418
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,380
你很可能只是困在一个量子循环维度里面
You're probably stuck in a quantum cyclic dimension.

419
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,000
这里只有一个你
There's only one of you here

420
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,840
因为另外一个你被带进平行维度里了
because the other you got knocked into a parallel dimension

421
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,140
多重宇宙里其中一个
somewhere in the multiverse.

422
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,180
非常好 瑞恩
Okay, Ryan.

423
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,640
谢谢你清晰的讲解 我真是受益匪浅
Thanks for clearing that up. That was super helpful.

424
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,620
你从来没听说过多重宇宙理论吗
You never heard of the multiverse theory?

425
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:43,140
我看起来像是会知道这个的人吗
Do I look like someone who knows what a multiverse is?

426
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:47,190
行行行 这是我们的宇宙 好吧 你看哈
Okay, look. This is our universe. Okay? Now, look.

427
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,990
理论上 宇宙有六个维度
In theory, the universe has six dimensions.

428
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,700
现在 如果你说的话是真的
Now, if what you're saying is true,

429
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,700
那么也许你每次醒来 虽然是同一天
then maybe you woke up on the same day...

430
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,620
但不是在同一维度里
But not in the same dimension.

431
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,450
这就可以解释你的情况
That would explain the anomalies.

432
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,960
你说的不同是有多不同呢
So, how different are we talking here?

433
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,290
这个不一定
Well, it depends.

434
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,380
完了 我忘记参加姐妹会的会议了
Oh, shit. I forgot our house meeting.

435
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,590
- 丹妮尔 对不起 我 - 亲爱的
- Danielle, I'm sorry, I just... - Hey, babe.

436
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,720
你们都还好吧
You doing all right?

437
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,360
你好 瑞恩
Hi, Ry.

438
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,390
你好 丹妮尔
Hey, Danielle.

439
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,040
我表演得自然吗
Did that look real?

440
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:44,460
我要去今年奇迹工人的表演试镜
I'm auditioning for this year's production of The Miracle Worker.

441
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,670
你知道安妮弗兰克竟然又瞎又聋吗
Did you know Anne Frank was blind and deaf?

442
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,090
- 那是海伦凯勒 - 你说什么
- Helen Keller. - Excuse me?

443
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,470
安娜弗兰克是住阁楼里那个
Anne Frank was in the attic.

444
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,050
是嘛
Oh.

445
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,350
随便啦
Whatever.

446
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,620
我只知道装瞎
All I know is acting blind

447
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,770
真是比真瞎难多了
is probably harder than actually being blind.

448
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,110
就是它所需的技巧呀
I mean, the skill set it takes.

449
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,930
梅丽尔斯特里普为了代入角色
Meryl Streep taped her

450
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:10,360
还把自己的眼皮粘起来了呢 厉害吧
eyelids shut just to prepare for a role. Uh-huh.

451
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,200
好
Well...

452
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,780
某人今天错过了姐妹会会议呢
Somebody missed our house meeting today.

453
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:20,120
- 对不起 我忘 - 跟你开玩笑呢
- I'm sorry, I didn't... - Totes kidding.

454
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,660
寿星可以不参加
Birthday girls get a free pass.

455
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,410
今年的慈善项目由我们来选
Anyhoo, we picked this year's charity.

456
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,420
你们准备好了吗
Are you ready for it?

457
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,340
我们打算再做一次残疾人艺术集市
We're doing the special needs art fair again.

458
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,460
- 太棒了 - 你真有爱心 丹妮尔
- Nice. - You do so much good, Danielle.

459
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,010
我真的很佩服你
I really admire that.

460
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,300
看你夸的
Oh, please.

461
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,260
看到那些小脸蛋儿 我心里就热乎乎的
It just warms my heart seeing all those little faces.

462
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,090
你们别误会噢
I mean, don't get me wrong.

463
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,320
虽说有时候他们抱你抱太久
Sometimes they try to hug you too long,

464
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,230
还是会有一丢丢不舒服
and it gets a little uncomfortable.

465
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,150
但是你们会习惯的
But you just get used to it.

466
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,690
活动结束的时候 孩子们给你的爱
And at the end of the day, there is no greater gift in life

467
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,150
就是世上最好的礼物
than the love of a child.

468
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,690
谢谢
Thank you.

469
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,780
翠儿 你没事吧
Tree? You okay?

470
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,670
没事 我
Yeah, I...

471
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,440
没错 今天是我生日
Yeah, it's my birthday

472
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,610
快接电话吧
And now you gotta pick up the phone

473
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,630
不好意思
Sorry.

474
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,000
喂 爸爸
Hey, Dad. Um...

475
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,960
对 对 不好意思 我已经在路上了
Uh, yeah, yeah. Sorry, I'm on my way.

476
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,680
我很快就到
I'll be there in a little bit.

477
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,010
我要走了
I have to go. Um...

478
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,760
- 等下 什么 你要走了 - 对
- Wait, what? You're leaving? - Uh, yeah.

479
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,810
我要跟我爸爸吃午饭
I have to meet up with my dad for lunch.

480
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,690
生日嘛
It's a birthday thing.

481
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,410
3点在实验室等我
Meet me in the lab at 3:00.

482
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,690
在情况恶化之前赶紧想办法搞定这件事
We're figuring this out before it gets any worse.

483
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,040
- 嘿 爸爸 - 来啦
- Hey, Dad. - Hey.

484
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,660
- 不好意思来晚了 - 没事 宝贝儿
- Sorry I'm late. - It's okay, sweetie.

485
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,990
今天不太顺
It's just been a weird day.

486
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,670
没事吗
Everything okay?

487
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:51,790
没事 小事而已 你懂的
Uh, yeah. It's just stuff. You know.

488
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,750
- 在学校还好吗- 挺好 爸爸
- How's school? - Um, it's fine, Dad.

489
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,830
你们准备好点菜了吗
Are you ready to order?

490
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,530
没呢 我们还要等一个人
Not yet. We're still waiting on one more.

491
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,470
还有一个
One more?

492
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,390
行 我等会儿再来
Okay, I'll be right back.

493
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,160
妈妈
Mom.

494
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,070
妈妈
Mom!

495
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,160
哇
Whoa!

496
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,450
你好啊
Hi.

497
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,090
你在这儿
You're here.

498
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,330
你真的在这儿
Oh, you're really here.

499
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,340
我当然在这儿啊 今天是我们的节日
Well, of course I'm here. It's our day.

500
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,480
你没事吧
Are you okay?

501
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,100
没事
Yeah.

502
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
没事
Yeah.

503
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,600
天啊 我没事 只是
Oh, God. I'm fine, I'm just...

504
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,280
见到你真好
It's good to see you.

505
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,790
好了
Okay.

506
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,080
现在试试
Try it now.

507
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,540
20秒
Twenty seconds.

508
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,880
喂 这正常吗
Yo, is this normal?

509
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,290
别担心 不会爆第二次的
Don't worry. It's not gonna blow up again.

510
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:32,230
- 第二次 - 10 9
- Again? - Ten, nine,

511
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,430
eight,

512
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,480
seven, six, five,

513
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,860
four, three, two...

514
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,060
住手
Stop!

515
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,780
别管了
Leave it.

516
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,900
- 你不是让我 - 我知道 我改主意了
- You told me to... - No, I know. I changed my mind.

517
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,990
这肯定就是那个疯狂白人女孩了
This must be the crazy white girl.

518
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,420
翠儿 等等
Hey! Tree! Wait up.

519
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,290
喂
Hey.

520
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,210
为什么改主意了
Hey. Why the change of heart?

521
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,040
- 一切都变了 - 怎么变了
- Everything's different. - Different how?

522
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,130
- 等等 你打算什么时候告诉我
Wait, when were you gonna tell me?

523
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:03,090
- 告诉你什么 - 丹妮尔啊
- Tell you what? - About Danielle.

524
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,260
丹妮尔怎么了
Yeah, what about Danielle?

525
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,180
你们明显是在约会啊
Apparently you guys are dating.

526
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,160
我还以为你知道呢
Wait, I thought you knew that.

527
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,800
你们不是住在一个姐妹会的房子里吗
I mean, you guys live in the same house.

528
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:12,480
不 我一点都不知道
Uh, no. I definitely didn't know.

529
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,770
最大的问题是 她知道吗
But the bigger question is, does she know?

530
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,400
她知道什么
Does she know what?

531
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,940
她一个好朋友今天早上在你床上醒来
One of her closest friends woke up in your bed this morning.

532
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,650
你不觉得应该告诉她妈
You don't think that that's newsworthy?

533
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,900
什么都没发生啊 我昨晚睡在瑞安床上
Nothing happened. I slept in Ryan's bed last night.

534
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:24,990
那你为什么带我回宿舍
So, why take me home?

535
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,720
因为你 你当时喝得不省人事啦
- Because you were... You were wasted.

536
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,410
我怕你摔倒了或者被自己的呕吐物呛死了
I was afraid you were gonna fall or choke on your own vomit

537
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,910
就像贾妮思乔普林那样
like Janis Joplin. Ugh!

538
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,210
行 没事 没事 没事
Okay. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

539
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,370
没事了 就这样吧
It's fine. This is how it's supposed to be.

540
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,670
我妈妈没事了 洛丽也没打算杀我
My mom's okay. Lori isn't trying to kill me.

541
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,570
也就是说 我的生活变好了
I mean, this is the better version of my life, right?

542
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,630
你在说
What are you...

543
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,630
她是姐妹联谊会的一员 格雷戈里
She's in a sorority, Gregory.

544
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,000
等等 在这个
Wait a minute. In this...

545
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,820
- 在另一个维度里 我们是不是 - 我
- In this other dimension, were we... - I...

546
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,640
我没时间跟你解释了
I can't do this right now.

547
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,890
别走啊 翠儿
No... Tree!

548
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,170
- 你准备好了吗 -我
- Are you ready for this? - I...

549
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,810
- 拿着 - 不 好吧
- Hold this. - No. Okay.

550
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,320
还有
And...

551
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,410
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

552
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,240
真是太奇怪了
It's so weird.

553
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,720
我的天 太好吃了
Oh, my... This is amazing.

554
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,220
我觉得你不用再买一个了
But I don't think you have to get another one.

555
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,250
这个就是最好的
This is the best...

556
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,490
这些记忆都不是我的
None of these memories are mine.

557
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,510
我知道 我只是为了今晚借穿一下
I know. I'm just borrowing it for tonight.

558
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,690
- 你准备什么时候去聚会 - 呃
- What time you going to the party? - Um...

559
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,220
我 我去不了了 出了点事
I, uh... I can't make it. Something came up.

560
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,430
什么
What?

561
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,680
我是说 我们计划这事好几周了 翠儿
I mean, we've been planning this for weeks, Tree.

562
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,810
是 我知道
No, I know.

563
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,270
我知道这是个惊喜派对 我很抱歉 只是
And I know it's a surprise party. I'm sorry. It's just...

564
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,190
我父母来看我了 我得
My parents are in town, and I need to...

565
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,650
我们这学费交的真有用
Ugh. Our tuition dollars at work.

566
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,320
话说回来 谁告诉你这个惊喜的
Anyhoo, who told you about the surprise?

567
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
是不是洛丽
Was it Lori?

568
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,480
我得说 那姑娘真得学学如何保守秘密
I swear, that girl really needs to learn how to keep a secret.

569
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,600
我不知道你怎么了
I don't know what's going on with you...

570
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,730
知道吗 翠儿 我只是想说出来
You know what, Tree, I'm just gonna come out and say it.

571
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,750
我一直觉得自己不招你待见
I have been feeling so extremely unappreciated by you...

572
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,840
- 导致一名警官死亡 - 嘿
- ...that left one officer dead. - Hello?

573
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,590
图姆斯是一项全国搜捕行动的目标
Tombs was the subject of a nationwide manhunt

574
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,010
该行动历时5个月 跨越4个州
that ended after a five-month pursuit across four state lines

575
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,340
- 并涉及6名女性受害者 - 老天啊
- that left six female victims. - Oh, my God.

576
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,380
他还在这儿
He's still here.

577
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,640
- 他要逃了 快叫警察 - 谁
- He's going to escape! Call the police! - Who?

578
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,060
- 约翰 图姆斯 叫警察啊 - 什么
- John Tombs. Just call the police. - What?

579
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,560
等等 别进去
Wait! Don't go in there!

580
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,690
见鬼
Shit.

581
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,990
打扰了 你在做什么
Excuse me. What are you doing?

582
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,860
- 哇哦 把斧头放下 - 等等 我能解释
- Whoa. Drop the ax. - Wait. I can explain.

583
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,620
立刻放下
Drop it now!

584
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,600
他逃跑了 他会杀人的
He's escaped. He's gonna kill someone.

585
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,440
背过身去面朝墙
Face up against the wall.

586
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,290
不 你不懂
No, you don't understand.

587
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,850
- 洛丽 把他 - 我不会说第二遍的
- Lori let him... - I'm not asking again.

588
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,360
求你了 听我说
Please, listen to me.

589
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,880
我的室友在这里工作
My roommate works here.

590
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,130
她把图姆斯放了因为她想嫁祸给他
She set Tombs free because she's trying to blame him,

591
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,580
但她会杀了我的
but she's gonna kill me!

592
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,990
我不知道你在搞什么鬼 女士
I don't know the hell kind of shit you're on, lady,

593
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,720
但图姆斯现在就在手术室里
but Tombs is down in the OR right now.

594
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:40,940
- 有个护士刚把他带走了 - 那护士是不是高个子 黑头发 扎着马尾辫
- Nurse just took him. - Was she tall, dark hair and a ponytail?

595
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,390
- 我们走 - 嗷
- Let's go. - Ow!

596
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,850
我知道你觉得我疯了 但你要相信我
I know you think I'm crazy, but you gotta believe me!

597
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,900
调度 我是康洛警官
Dispatch, this is Officer Conrow.

598
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:50,320
我们在医院被跟踪了 需要立即支援
Have an 11-55 at the hospital. Need immediate assistance.

599
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,290
快点啊
Come on.

600
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,250
我知道是你 洛丽
I know it's you, Lori!

601
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,420
什么 我
What? Oh, my...

602
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,900
哦 天啊 我还以为你
Oh, my God. I thought you were...

603
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,730
你还好吗 这到底怎么回事 那是谁
Are you okay? What the hell is going on? Who was that?

604
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,290
图姆斯逃走了 他想杀了我
Tombs escaped. He's trying to kill me.

605
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,800
不 翠儿 这不可能 我刚把他送到手术室了
No, Tree, that's not possible. I just took him down to the OR.

606
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:29,990
发生了什么
What's happening?

607
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,070
我 我不知道
I... I don't know.

608
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,860
天呐 他切断了电源
Oh, my God, he cut the power.

609
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,650
保持冷静
Just stay calm.

610
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,120
保持冷静
Just stay calm.

611
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
见鬼
Shit!

612
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,740
好了 来吧
Okay, come on.

613
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,220
来吧
Come on.

614
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,590
该死的我们到底在哪里
Where the hell are we?

615
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:05,150
这一定是正在施工的楼层之一
This must be one of the floors under construction.

616
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,140
来吧 另一头有一个紧急出口
Come on. There's an emergency exit on the other end.

617
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,070
等等
Wait.

618
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,780
拿着那个
Grab that.

619
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,920
好
Okay.

620
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,590
来吧
Come on.

621
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,210
什么
What?

622
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,750
你有听到什么吗
Did you hear something?

623
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,390
好吧 混蛋 让我看看你有什么本事
All right, asshole, let's see what you got.

624
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,580
哈
Ha!

625
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,580
见鬼
Shit!

626
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,300
该死的
Shit!

627
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,050
闭嘴
Shut up!

628
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,470
太菜了 翠儿
Rookie move, Tree.

629
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,940
哦 嗨 你醒了
Oh, hey. You're up.

630
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,820
- 我在哪个维度 - 啥
- What dimension am I in? - Huh?

631
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:20,030
丹妮尔
Danielle.

632
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,780
我女朋友
My girlfriend?

633
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:22,870
就是她
Same one.

634
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,220
耶 今天是我的生日
Yeah, it's my birthday

635
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,250
好吧
Okay.

636
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,640
现在你该接电话了
And now you gotta pick up the phone

637
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:29,830
你还好吗
Are you okay?

638
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,040
是的 再好不过了
Yeah. Never better.

639
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,710
嘿 我帮你把衣服叠好了
Hey, I folded your clothes for you.

640
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,920
听着 无意冒犯 但你怎么会和她在一起了
Look, no offense, but how could you possibly end up with her?

641
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,590
- 和谁 - 丹妮尔
- With who? - Danielle.

642
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,800
她人挺好的
Uh, she's nice.

643
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,550
哦 人好
Oh, "Nice."

644
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:48,730
等等 她不是你最好的朋友吗
Wait a minute. Isn't she, like, your best friend?

645
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,730
伙计 你成功全垒打了没
Dude, you hit that fine vagine or what?

646
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,940
- 哈 有意思 - 不 我没想做任何
- Huh, interesting. - No, I wasn't trying to do any...

647
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,980
- 你不像你看上去那么无辜哦 - 但是
- Not as innocent as you look. - But...

648
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,480
什么 不 我
What? No. I...

649
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:03,490
你 一个小时后在你的实验室见我
You. Meet me in your lab in an hour.

650
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,580
哈
Huh?

651
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,780
我要换掉这些恶心的衣服
I've got to get out of these disgusting clothes.

652
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,700
仔细听我说
Listen to me carefully.

653
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:16,080
我需要在这个维度上停留 好吗
I need to stay here in this dimension, okay?

654
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,750
所以 把循环停了
So, just close the loop.

655
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,330
听着 我们甚至不知道这事怎么开始的
Look, we have no idea how this even happened in the first place.

656
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:23,890
拜托 你们都是脑瓜好使的科学家 对吧
Well, you're all brainy science people, right?

657
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:25,130
所以 你们会搞清楚的
So, you'll figure it out.

658
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,820
你知道我们在乱搞
You realize we're messing

659
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,930
我们不该碰的东西 对吧
with things we have no business touching, right?

660
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,370
好吧 也许你们在造那个鬼东西前
Well, maybe you should've thought

661
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,180
就该意识到了
of that before you built the big dumb thing.

662
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,820
就
Just...

663
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:43,280
就帮我个忙试着搞清楚这件事 好吗
Just please do me a favor and try to figure this out, okay?

664
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:45,070
求你们了
Please.

665
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:48,400
听着 这将是一个试错的情况
Look, this is gonna be a trial-and-error situation.

666
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,200
我们必须排除每一个变量
We have to rule out every variable

667
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:51,540
以明确
in order to narrow down the

668
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,530
正确的关闭循环的算法
correct algorithm that will close the loop.

669
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:54,660
好吧
Okay...

670
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,920
这工作要好几天 甚至好几周
It's days, maybe weeks of work.

671
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,460
而且如果你说的是真的
And if what you're saying is true,

672
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:01,190
我们没办法记录研究进展
there's no way to keep a record of our progress.

673
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,920
我没听懂
I'm not following.

674
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,590
好吧 嗯
Okay. Um...

675
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,260
假设我们测试了
Say we test, like...

676
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:13,220
几十个变量
Dozens of variables.

677
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:15,550
到这一天结束 循环会重置 对吗
By the end of the day, the loop will reset, right?

678
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:18,640
所以 我们了解到的一切都会被
So, everything we learned gets...

679
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,280
清除
Erased.

680
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,650
我们没办法记录我们的进展
There's no way for us to track our progress

681
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,110
因为我们不会记得任何事 就这么简单
simply because we just don't remember anything we learned.

682
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,440
然后我们就又回到起点了
And we'll be back to square one.

683
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,160
棒极了
Great.

684
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,080
我完蛋了
I'm screwed.

685
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,460
等等 不 我知道了
Wait, no, I got it.

686
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,240
好吧 你说一切除了你的记忆都会重置 对吧
Okay, you said everything resets but your memory, right?

687
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,260
没错
Yeah?

688
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,210
好的 那么
All right, well, then

689
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:49,050
你必须得成为一个活体记录
you're just gonna have to be a living record.

690
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,810
等等 你是说我得记住一切
Wait, you mean memorize everything?

691
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,520
是的
Yeah.

692
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,440
这主意太天才了
That's genius.

693
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,440
- 是啊 - 不不不 这主意糟透了
- Yeah. - No, no, no. That's not genius.

694
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:02,020
我不是一个科学家
I'm not a scientist.

695
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,730
而且 各位
And, hello?

696
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,110
我是说 你们还记得有人要杀我 是吧
I mean, you do realize there's a killer after me, right?

697
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,320
这意味着我将一遍遍地死去
That means I'm gonna have to die over and over again

698
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:10,570
直到你们弄清楚如何关闭循环
until you guys figure out how to close the loop.

699
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,910
我想 我觉得你可以自杀
I mean, I guess you could just kill yourself...

700
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:17,370
在他们找到你之前
Before they find you.

701
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,450
哇哦 又一个天才的点子
Wow. Another genius idea.

702
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:23,130
总比被某些戴着婴儿面具的疯子追杀好
Better than being chased by some crazy guy in a baby mask.

703
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,340
我说 难道你有更好的方法
I mean, do you have a better idea?

704
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:35,010
我就知道你会这么问
I knew you were gonna say that.

705
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:47,700
我只是想要 平静地醒来
All that I want is to wake up fine

706
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:51,320
告诉我 我没事 我不会就这么死掉
Tell me that I'm all right That I ain't gonna die

707
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:55,030
我只是想要 在地上砸出一个洞
All that I want is a hole in the ground

708
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:57,740
当一切过去 你可以告诉我 没事了
You can tell me when it's all right

709
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,320
我不必再躲躲藏藏
For me to come out

710
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:02,920
艰难岁月 总是让你自我怀疑
Hard times Gonna make you wonder

711
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,460
为何还要拼死一搏
Why you even try

712
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:07,040
低潮时刻 总是让你心情低落
Hard times Gonna take you down

713
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,570
在你伤心落泪时还要嘲弄你
And laugh when you cry

714
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,750
这些时日
These lives

715
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:12,630
我仍不知道我是怎么挺过来的
And I still don't know how I even survive

716
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,930
艰难岁月 低潮时刻
Hard times, hard times

717
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:19,010
我快触到最低点了
And I gotta get to rock bottom

718
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,900
四处徘徊
Walking around

719
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:31,730
我的一朵小乌云
My little rain cloud

720
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,740
还挂在头顶上
Hanging over my head

721
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,870
怎么也甩不开
And it ain't coming down

722
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,160
我该何去何从
Where do I go?

723
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:39,240
给我一些指示
Give me some sort of sign

724
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,540
用闪电将我击中
You hit me with lightning

725
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,160
也许我会起死回生
Maybe I'll come alive

726
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:46,050
艰难岁月
Hard times

727

我快触到最低点了
And I gotta hit rock bottom

730
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:01,430
告诉我的朋友们 我快要崩溃了
Tell my friends I'm coming down

731
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,440
当我触到谷底 我们会触底反弹
We'll kick it when I hit the ground

732
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:09,570
告诉我的朋友们 我快要崩溃了
Tell my friends I'm coming down

733
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,940

738
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:26,800

"I wasn't sure if you wanted to sleep in or not.

758

我帮你叠了昨晚的衣服

不确定这种材料会不会皱
"Wasn't sure if that material gets wrinkled."

760
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:53,130
不管了 话说你老是在桌子下面找什么
Anyway, what the hell are you always looking for under that desk?

790

So, I guess now you know why I wasn't in your class today.

798
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:47,280
- 什么 - 高级生物学

800
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:53,160
我对你没什么印象
You don't look familiar.

801
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,960
抱歉 我搞错了
I'm sorry. My mistake.

802

我好不容易才找到你的病历
I've been having a hard time pulling up your medical records.

806
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:11,260
我知道 我应该死了的
I know. I should be dead.

807
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:14,150
我的检查结果很不合理 是吧
My results, they don't make sense. Right?

808
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,110
是的 说实话 它们非常吓人
Yes. They're highly alarming, to be honest.

809
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,440
等等 现在几点了
Wait. What time is it?

813
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,160
你得阻止她进入手术室
You need to stop her from going down to the OR.

814
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,480
抱歉 我不知道你在说什么
I'm sorry. I don't know who you're talking about.

815
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,790

821
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,540
好吧
Fine.

822
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:22,040
要死一起死
I go, you go!

823
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:30,930
你醒来了
Oh, hey, you're up.

824
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:32,410
不知道你想不想多睡会儿
I wasn't sure if you wanted to sleep in or not.

825
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:33,720
闭嘴
Shut up!

826
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:37,050
真的受够了
I am so done with this shit.

827
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,310
然后用欧几里得向量
Then you multiply the Euclidean vector

828
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,560
乘以π的平方到17次方
by the square root of pi to the 17th power,

829
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:47,270
然后得到公理点0.004
which then gives us an axiom point of.004,

830
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:52,320
接着得到长8.2的线性平面向量
which then gives us a linear plane vector of 8.2.

831
00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:57,700
完事
Boom.

832
00:54:57,790 --> 00:54:58,790
天啊
Damn.

833
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:09,630
如果这些算法是错的
Well, if these are all the failed algorithms...

834
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,210
那就只剩下一种可能性了
Then there's only one possibility left.

835
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:28,980
天哪 你是对的
Holy shit balls. You did it!

836
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:30,280
- 是对的吗 - 是的
- It worked? - Yes!

837
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,570
真的吗 天啊 天啊
It worked? Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

838
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,620
我们做到了 为什么感觉这么激动 简直不敢相信
We did it! Why are we so excited? We barely know her!

839
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,720
说实话 我不知道刚刚发生了什么
Honestly, I don't know what just happened.

840
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:40,870
但你真的很棒
But that was impressive.

841
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,700
谢谢
Thanks.

842
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:45,910
庆祝起来
Let's do this.

843
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,670
让我们搞清楚
Just so we're totally clear,

844
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,620
有个变数关闭了这个空间的循环
one variant closes the loop in this dimension

845
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:52,110
而另一个把你送回了
and the other one sends you back

846
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,130
最初的空间 并且关闭了循环
to your original dimension and closes that loop.

847
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,350
要做决定了
It's final decision time.

848
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:58,140
留下还是回去
Stay here or go back.

849
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:10,360
我要留下 决定了
I'm staying here. Final decision.

850
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:12,990
好的 那开始吧
Okay. Here we go, then.

851
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:15,030
退后站
Stand back.

852
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,420
等等
Huh? Wait.

853
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:32,510
怎么了
What happened?

854
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:33,880
呃
Uh, uh...

855
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,090
- 路径关闭了 - 但你说那是对的
- Oh, the vector's off. - But you said this was the right one.

856
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,140
计算上没问题 有其它故障
No, the math was right. Something else is off.

857
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:41,020
伙计们 记住你们这些鬼东西
Guys, I have literally been

858
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,970
真的要逼疯我了
killing myself to memorize this shit for you.

859
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:44,390
绝不能失败
Failure's not an option.

860
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:49,560
- 怎么了 - 硬盘不对劲
- What? - There's something in hard drive.

861
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:51,230
一定是病毒
It must be a virus.

862
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,480
兄弟 你又看色情网站了吗
Dude, did you open spam porn again on the computer?

863
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,360
没有
No.

864
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,530
很好 我需要把代码再输入一遍
Great. I have to manually reenter all this code.

865
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:01,620
好吧 要多久
Okay, how long?

866
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,870
六 七个小时
Six, seven hours.

867
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:05,620
瑞恩 看着我
Ryan, look at me.

868
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,080
时间珍贵 你明白吗
I am on borrowed time here. Understand?

869
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:10,410
搞定它
Get it done.

870
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,380
好的 正在努力
Uh, yeah. I'm on it.

871
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,220
翠儿 等等
Tree, wait up.

872
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:22,180
嘿 你确定吗
Hey. Are you sure about this?

873
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:23,470
当然 我很确定
Of course, I'm sure.

874
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,730
好吧 那杀手呢
Okay, what about the killer?

875
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:26,640
我是说 你说过今晚有人会死
I mean, you said people are gonna die tonight.

876
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:27,790
如果你关闭了循环 我们就帮不上忙
If you close the loop and we don't help,

877
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:29,000
他们就会死 不是吗
then they're dead for good, aren't they?

878
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,640
我必须活着
I have to stay alive.

879
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:33,070
我不能再回医院了 那太冒险了
I can't go back to that hospital. It's way too risky.

880
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:35,090
难道就这样了吗 你就这样
So that's it? You're just gonna walk away

881
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:36,550
眼睁睁看着无辜的人死去
and let a bunch of innocent people die?

882
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:38,170
卡特 每天都会死人
People die every day, Carter.

883
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:40,490
我不可能对每个人负责 不是吗
I can't be responsible for everyone, okay?

884
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,260
我知道这听起来很自私 但这是真的
I know how selfish that sounds, but it's true.

885
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:45,250
确实非常自私 你是认真的吗
Yeah, no. That sounds incredibly selfish. Are you serious?

886
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,290
这不公平
That's not fair.

887
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:50,840
你不知道这对我来说有多难
You have no idea how hard this is for me.

888
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,810
我不想
I don't wanna have to

889
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:53,710
在你和我妈妈之间做选择 但我不得不这么做
choose between you and my mom, but I have to.

890
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,920
你说的 选择 是什么意思
What do you mean, "Choose"?

891
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:01,140
卡特 我们在另一个空间是一对恋人
Carter, we're together in the other dimension.

892
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,720
我每天早晨都在你的床上醒来 就像今早一样
I woke up in your bed every morning, just like this morning.

893
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,390
我一次一次的这样醒来
I did it over and over and

894
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:14,280
直到我爱上了你
over again until I fell in love with you.

895
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:18,990
但现在我们回到了这里 我妈妈在这里还活着
But that version of us is back there, and my mom is alive here.

896
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,120
所以我已经决定了
So I've made my decision.

897
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:24,900
如果你错了呢
What if you're wrong?

898
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,460
如果你错了呢
Huh? What if you're wrong?

899
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,190
如果事情根本不是你想象的那样呢
What if this isn't the life that you're supposed to have?

900
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,580
那又怎样 难道我
So, what? I'm just supposed

901
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:34,080
要回到我妈妈去世了的那个空间里吗
to go back to some dimension where my mom's dead?

902
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:39,180
我不能 我不能再次失去她
I can't. I can't lose her again.

903
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:41,170
你已经失去了
You already did.

904
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,970
如果不是这样 这一切就都是假象
And none of this is real if it erases that.

905
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,540
你一直活在
You're just living someone

906
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,770
其他人的生活里 而不是你自己的
else's life that doesn't belong to you.

907
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:51,260
你的悲伤 你的痛苦
Your pain, that loss...

908
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:53,640
这些
That's...

909
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,190
这些成就了真实的你
That's what makes you you.

910
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,890
但你有机会
But you have the chance

911
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:00,740
去做别人做梦都想做的事
to do something other people only dream of.

912
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:02,410
什么
What?

913
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:04,990
你可以好好道别
You can say goodbye.

914
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:15,500
你女朋友在叫你 我该走了
Your girlfriend's calling you. Better go.

915
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:22,220
出什么事了 她刚刚取消了我们的姐妹聚会
What's her problem? She just ditched our house meeting.

916
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:27,970
在听吗 你们在聊什么
Hello? What were you guys talking about?

917
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:30,720
没什么 就是聊了些学校的事
Nothing. We were just... We were going over school stuff.

918
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:34,560
宝贝 别忘了 我的美国文学论文还需要你帮忙
Babe, don't forget, I still need help with my American lit paper.

919
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,400
但...我现在真的很忙
I'm... I'm really busy right now.

920
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:41,450
卡特 你答应过我的
Carter, you promised.

921
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,440
没有你 我这门课就通不过了
I won't pass the class without your help.

922
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,820
好吧 好吧
All right. Yeah, yeah. That's fine.

923
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,200
你最好了
You're the best.

924
00:59:58,090 --> 00:59:59,800
又来一个寿星
There's the other birthday girl.

925
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:04,420
- 宝贝 怎么了 - 我还好 我...
- Sweetie, what's wrong? - I'm okay, I...

926
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,510
看着可并不好
You don't look okay.

927
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,260
我很好 妈妈
I'm okay... Mom!

928
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:11,510
你像冰块一样冷 我们该去医院看看
You're cold as ice. Maybe we should go to the hospital.

929
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:12,600
不
No!

930
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:15,770
不 不能去
No, we can't go there.

931
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:17,940
听着 我不想吓着你们
Look, I don't want to freak you guys out.

932
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:20,150
但我需要离开学校 越远越好
But I need to get as far away from campus as possible.

933
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,560
- 特蕾莎 到底怎么了 - 爸爸 求你了
- Theresa, what is going on? - Dad, please.

934
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,480
我保证后面会把一切都解释清楚
I promise to explain everything later,

935
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,770
但现在我需要你相信我
but I need you to trust me.

936
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,160
好吧
Okay.

937
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:31,570
我们走 现在就走
We'll go. Let's go.

938
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:34,080
- 走吧 - 好
- Come on. - Yeah.

939
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,340
终于
Done!

940
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:47,890
弄好了
Finally.

941
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:50,100
你们准备好了吗
You guys ready?

942
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,180
万事俱备 让我们把这个循环彻底关闭
Okay. Let's close this loop once and for all.

943
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:24,670
嘿 知道我想要什么吗
Hey, you know what I'm craving right now?

944
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,260
什么
What?

945
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,300
莫罗湾面包店里的大肉桂卷
One of those giant cinnamon rolls from that bakery in Morro Bay.

946
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:35,640
去年这个时候
From our birthday last year.

947
01:01:36,310 --> 01:01:38,600
你还记得吗 你吃了整整两个
You don't remember? You ate two of them.

948
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:43,650
那并不是我
That wasn't me.

949
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,070
你说什么 宝贝
What, sweetie?

950
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:47,460
嘿 女孩儿们 天色很晚了
Hey, girls. It's getting kinda late.

951
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:50,280
我们找个地方过夜怎么样
What do you say we find someplace, turn in for the night?

952
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,870
挺好的 我想大家也都累了
Okay, sounds good. I think we're all pretty pooped.

953
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:12,300
洛丽
Lori!

954
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:18,900
糟糕
Shit.

955
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:35,850
他抓住她了
He got her, he got her!

956
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:37,200
不要开枪
No, don't shoot! Don't shoot!

957
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,340
我去拿些冰 很快就回来
Hey, girls, I'm gonna go get some ice. I'll be right back.

958
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:49,420
帮我下
Give me a hand.

959
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,890
嘿
Okay.

960
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:56,390
跟我说说吧
Just tell me one thing.

961
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:58,350
你是怀孕了吗
Are you pregnant?

962
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:01,190
什么 没有 妈妈 我...
What? No. Mom. I...

963
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,560
- 好吧 抱歉 我只是问问 - 并不是吧
- Okay, sorry. I just had to ask. - It's not like that.

964
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:07,150
- 那就是跟男孩子有关的事 - 不是的
- But it's a boy, isn't it? - No.

965
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,240
是的
Yes.

966
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:12,990
我也不知道 太复杂了
I don't know. It's complicated.

967
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:15,740
相信我
Trust me.

968
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:18,000
复杂的我也应付得来
I can do complicated.

969
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,120
怎么了
What is it?

970
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,410
你有没有想过如果你的生活里
Have you ever wondered what your life would have been like

971
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:30,340
没有爸爸会怎样
if you couldn't be with Dad?

972
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:31,670
什么 不会的
What? No.

973
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,250
但如果你必须要选择呢
But what if you had to choose?

974
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,090
你懂得 如果...如果跟他在一起
You know, what if... What if being with him

975
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,450
意味着你会失去非常亲密的人
meant that you would lose someone that you were really close to,

976
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,520
意味着你再也见不到那个人
that you would never get to see that person ever again?

977
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:41,480
你会怎么办
What would you do?

978
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:46,910
我们都在面临艰难选择 翠儿 这就是生活
Well, we all have to make hard choices, Tree. That's life.

979
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:51,290
过去发生的事会推着我们朝某个方向前行
And sometimes the past is pulling us in one direction

980
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:54,070
而未来会呼唤我们到新的境界
and the future is calling us somewhere new.

981
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:57,450
但当然 如果非要我选 我会选你爸爸
But, of course, if I had to choose, I'd pick Daddy.

982
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,370
没有他 我就不会有你 不是吗
Without him I wouldn't have you, right?

983
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:06,630
但你怎么能确定他就是你的真爱
But how did you know that he was the one?

984
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,040
我不确定
I didn't.

985
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,760
我要遵从自己的内心做选择
I took a chance. I followed my heart.

986
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,170
这就是爱 翠儿
That's kinda how love works, Tree.

987
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:18,640
大可放手一搏
It's a leap of faith.

988
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:28,680
贝菲尔德大学医院
...Bayfield University Hospital,

989
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:31,520
恐怖事件仍在上演
where a terrible tragedy continues to unfold.

990
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:33,200
事故细节还在调查中
Details are still coming in.

991
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,890
目前 已确认3名受害者
But so far, we can confirm three victims.

992
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:37,740
一名护士 一名警官
A nurse and a police officer.

993
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:39,160
和一名学生
The third victim, a student,

994
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,530
在制服嫌疑犯时被杀害
was killed while attempting to subdue the suspect.

995
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:43,990
镜头给你 丹
Back to you, Dan.

996
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:45,500
不
No.

997
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,030
怎么了
What's wrong?

998
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,250
快啊 瑞恩 接电话
Come on, Ryan. Come on.

999
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:55,920
萨马 你能检查下那边是22-97-39吗
Hey, Samar, can you check 22-97-39 right there?

1000
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:57,300
- 是的 - 还有那边
- Yeah. - Over there.

1001
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:00,640
矢量需要调整
No. The vector needs to be adjusted.

1002
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,760
- 嘿 我是莱恩 请在哔声后留言
Yo, it's Ryan. Leave a message at the beep.

1003
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,980
莱恩 不能关掉循环 你不能
Ryan, don't close the loop, you can't...

1004
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:09,040
- 抱歉 留音信箱... - 去你的
- I'm sorry. This voice mailbox is... - Shit!

1005
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:11,940
- 翠儿 你在干嘛 - 我不能让他关掉
- Tree, what is going on? - I can't let him close it.

1006
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:15,570
我不确定这个冰好不好 闻起来像尿一样
I'm not sure about this ice. It kinda smells like pee.

1007
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:18,570
翠儿 翠儿 你去哪儿
Tree! Tree! Where are you going?

1008
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:19,740
翠儿
Tree!

1009
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:29,790
快啊快啊 快接电话
Come on. Come on, come on. Pick up your phone!

1010
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,590
- 嘿 我是莱恩... - 去你的
- Yo, it's Ryan. Leave a... - Shit!

1011
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:34,250
成功了
Here we go!

1012
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,880
还有多远 快点 快点 快点 求你了
Where is it? Come on, come on. Come on. Please!

1013
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,640
- 嘿 你醒来了 - 闭嘴
- Oh, hey, you're up. - Shut up!

1014
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:31,130
不知道你想不想多睡会儿
I wasn't sure if you wanted to sleep in or not.

1015
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:33,390
这是我最后一次为你死了
That is the last time I'm dying for you.

1016
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:35,190
什么
What?

1017
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,030
还有多久才行
How much longer is it gonna take?

1018
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,740
有你惊人的记忆力 不会很久的
Thanks to your crazy memory, it shouldn't take long at all.

1019
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:48,790
几分钟后 我就能搞定系统
I can have Sisy ready to go in just a few minutes.

1020
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:56,620
还需要点时间 我还有事没做
I need a little more time. There's something I need to do.

1021
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:00,640
翠儿
Tree.

1022
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:03,800
你确定你想回去吗
You sure you wanna go back?

1023
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,550
我不能总活在过去
Can't spend my life living in the past.

1024
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:11,600
放手一搏吧
Gotta take a leap of faith.

1025
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:21,650
她总算回来了
She finally rolls in.

1026
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,650
洛丽 嗨
Uh, Lori. Hi.

1027
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,250
- 精彩一夜吗 - 可以这么说
- Big night? - You could say that.

1028
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,040
听着 洛丽 我...
Look, Lori, I...

1029
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:37,920
见到你真好
It's good to see you.

1030
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:42,210
我也是 翠儿
It's good to see you too, Tree.

1031
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:52,680
他不值得
He's not worth it.

1032
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:58,110
我是说 我曾经跟一个已婚男人好过
I mean, trust me. I've been involved with a married guy.

1033
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,900
我知道偷偷摸摸过日子的感受
I know what's it's like living a double life.

1034
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:02,700
总觉得自己很垃圾
Always feeling like shit about yourself.

1035
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,900
但改变永远都不晚
But it's never too late to change.

1036
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,230
有个人曾经这么跟我说
Someone once told me that

1037
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:15,210
每天都是一个可以变得更好的机会
every day is a chance to be someone better.

1038
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:18,590
或许今天就是你的机会
Maybe this is your day.

1039
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:22,930
知道了
Okay.

1040
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:25,180
谢谢
Thank you.

1041
01:08:35,230 --> 01:08:36,520
照顾好自己
Take care of yourself.

1042
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:58,250
翠儿
Tree.

1043
01:08:58,550 --> 01:08:59,630
嘿
Hey.

1044
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:02,540
丹妮尔
Look, Danielle,

1045
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:04,880
我很糟糕
I feel really bad.

1046
01:09:04,970 --> 01:09:07,760
之前错怪了你 这全怪我
I've totally been misjudging you, and it's completely on me.

1047
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:09,880
我很抱歉 我...
I am so sorry that I've, like, made this...

1048
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:11,180
真好
Nice.

1049
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:13,180
双飞
Three-way.

1050
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,480
他在开玩笑
He's kidding.

1051
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:17,230
没啊 我没开玩笑
No, I'm... I'm not.

1052
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:22,190
尼克的浴室坏了 我让他用我的
Nick's, um, shower was broken, so I said he could use mine.

1053
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:24,240
是吗 尼克
Right, Nick?

1054
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,020
我的浴室好好的
My shower's fine.

1055
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:29,620
这样啊
Right. Um...

1056
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:31,780
你知道吗 没关系的
You know what? Never mind.

1057
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:33,160
抱歉 打扰了
Sorry for interrupting.

1058
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:35,540
拜拜
Bye.

1059
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:36,630
拜
Bye.

1060
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,580
- 到底怎么了 - 你笨的跟石头一样 这就是原因
- What was that for? - For being dumb as a rock, that's what.

1061
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:46,420
真的吗 石头怎么会笨 它根本没脑子
Oh, really? How can a rock be dumb? They don't even have brains.

1062
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,650
又来一个寿星
There's the other birthday girl.

1063
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:08,360
- 嗨 宝贝 - 嘿 爸爸
- Hi, sweetie. - Hey, Dad.

1064
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,320
你介意我和妈妈单独聊会儿吗
Um, do you mind if I talk to Mom alone for a minute?

1065
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:13,780
女孩间的聊天
Just some girl talk.

1066
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:17,490
当然 我去回几个工作电话
Oh, well, sure. I can go run some work calls.

1067
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:18,740
好的 谢谢
Okay, thanks.

1068
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,420
你还好吗
Is everything okay?

1069
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:27,050
是的 很好 都很好
Yeah. It's fine. Everything's fine.

1070
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:32,970
天哪 我怎么能这么做
Oh, shit, how do I do this?

1071
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:35,640
做什么 宝贝 怎么了
Do what, sweetie? What's wrong?

1072
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:37,730
妈妈
Mom...

1073
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:46,070
我想让你知道我有多么爱你
I really want you to know how much I love you.

1074
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:49,060
我也爱你 宝贝
I love you too, sweetie.

1075
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,400
不 妈妈 我是认真的
No, Mom, I'm serious.

1076
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:59,160
人们常常说我爱你 但是
You know, people say "I love you" All the time, but...

1077
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:03,240
只有再也不能当面说这句话时
It's not until you can't say it to that person's face anymore

1078
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:05,370
才能意识到爱的有多深
that you really realize how much you mean it.

1079
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:13,550
你是那么美丽
You are so beautiful

1080
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:15,890
那么动人
and so amazing.

1081
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,740
我希望我有朝一日
And I just hope I can

1082
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:22,140
能做到像你一半这么好
become half of the woman that you are one day.

1083
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:25,860
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding?

1084
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:30,940
有了你我才能如此完美
I'm the woman I am because I had you.

1085
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:36,240
我之前从没跟人说过这个
You know, I never really told anyone this before,

1086
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:38,620
当我怀上你的时候 我要担心死了
but when I was pregnant with you, I was scared shitless.

1087
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:40,790
不是吧
No.

1088
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,040
但是 当我抱起你的那一刻
But then, the moment I held you,

1089
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:46,420
我的内心有什么改变了
something inside of me changed...

1090
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:48,580
瞬间就变了
Instantly.

1091
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:50,760
这是最好的爱才有的力量
The best kind of love does that.

1092
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,840
它会改变你 让你变成一个更好的人
It changes you. It makes you a better person.

1093
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,970
天啊 我真蠢
God, I'm so stupid.

1094
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:04,730
我真的以为我能全都拥有 但是我不能
I really thought I could have it all, but I can't.

1095
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:06,970
喔 亲爱的 没人能
Oh, honey, nobody can.

1096
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,980
但你猜怎么着 没关系的
But guess what? That's okay.

1097
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:11,280
你会得到你需要的
You'll get what you need.

1098
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,810
希望如此
I hope so.

1099
01:12:15,950 --> 01:12:17,820
过来
Aw. Come here.

1100
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,200
我是不是压着你了
Am I crushing you?

1101
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:32,250
不 你永远都是我的小女孩
Nope. You're always gonna be my little girl.

1102
01:12:33,970 --> 01:12:38,180
祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to you

1103
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:42,310
祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to you

1104
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:46,600
生日快乐 翠儿和妈妈
Happy birthday, Tree and mom

1105
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:52,020
祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to you

1106
01:12:58,620 --> 01:12:59,620
许个愿吧
Make a wish.

1107
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:24,730
准备好了吗
You ready?

1108
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,350
等等
Wait.

1109
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:30,900
呃
Um...

1110
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:32,610
听着
Look.

1111
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,900
我知道这可能很让人困惑
I know this is probably pretty confusing.

1112
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:40,330
我的意思是 你们才刚认识我几个小时
I mean, you guys have only known me for a couple hours,

1113
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,070
但我已经认识你们几个星期了
but I've known you for weeks.

1114
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:48,080
你们为了送我回家真的非常非常努力
You've all worked really, really hard to try to send me home.

1115
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,710
所以 谢谢你们
So, thank you.

1116
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,760
我们还不知道你是不是完全是个疯子 但是 呃
Well, jury's still out on whether you're totally nuts, but, uh...

1117
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,590
很高兴我们能帮上忙
Glad we could help.

1118
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:02,380
好了 瑞安 把她打开吧
Okay, Ryan. Light her up.

1119
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:13,690
所以 在那另一个维度里 我们
So, in this other dimension, do we...

1120
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:15,560
我们认识彼此吗
Do we know each other?

1121
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:18,450
可以这么说
You could say that.

1122
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:21,320
17秒倒计时
Seventeen seconds!

1123
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:23,320
Sixteen. Fifteen.

1124
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:27,870
我不是不让你们把那玩意打开吗
What did I tell you about turning that thing on?

1125
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,330
- 糟了 - 等等
- Uh-oh. - Wait.

1126
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:31,030
不应该是这个时候发生的
This isn't supposed to happen yet.

1127
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:32,770
你们应该明天才会来的
You're not supposed to come until tomorrow!

1128
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,000
现在把那玩意关掉
Turn that thing off now.

1129
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:35,130
不 不要
No, don't!

1130
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:37,750
- 不 不 不 不 - 不 不
- No, no, no, no! - No, no!

1131
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,460
不 等等 拜托 你不能这么做
No, wait, please. You can't do this.

1132
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:43,590
你是谁
And who are you?

1133
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,470
我是这里的学生
I am a student here.

1134
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,960
喔 继续保持你的态度 然后你马上就不再是这里的学生了
Oh, well, keep this little attitude up, and we'll change that.

1135
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:50,100
把这东西带出去
Get that thing outta here.

1136
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:51,190
不 求你不要
No, please don't.

1137
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:52,750
嘿 小心点 肌肉男 我们在这东西上花了18个月
Hey, watch it, beefcake. We spent 18 months on that thing.

1138
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,310
求你不要 拜托
Please don't! Please.

1139
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:57,810
别对她这么粗暴 小心
Don't manhandle her. Take...

1140
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:01,150
你们要把她带去哪
Where are you taking her?

1141
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:04,910
我的办公室 我会把它锁在那里的
My office, where it will remain under lock and key.

1142
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:16,670
好吧 这是个挫折 我明白
Look, okay, it's a setback. I get it.

1143
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,320
但是我们可以重置这一天然后再试一次
Right, but we just reset the day and try again.

1144
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:19,550
不
No.

1145
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:21,590
你不明白
You don't understand.

1146
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,890
每次我回来 我都会变得更虚弱
I keep getting weaker every time I come back.

1147
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:27,140
我不知道我还剩下多少次机会
I don't know how many chances I have left.

1148
01:15:27,230 --> 01:15:28,720
就我所知 这可能就是最后一次了
For all I know, this could be it.

1149
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:30,300
如果我再死 可能就真的死了
If I die again, I could stay dead.

1150
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,260
- 那就难办了 - 该死
- Hmm, that's a problem. - No shit.

1151
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,480
除非
Unless...

1152
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,740
除非我们把它偷回来
Unless we steal it back.

1153
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:42,110
偷回来
Steal it?

1154
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:44,820
我的意思是 你想 在严格意义上
I mean, you know, it's not even

1155
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:46,740
这甚至不能算偷 不是吗 这本来就是你们的财产
technically stealing, is it? It's your property.

1156
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:48,950
哇 伙计们 这可说不好
Whoa, whoa. Guys, I don't know about this.

1157
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,620
如果我们被抓住然后我被开除了
If we get caught and I get expelled,

1158
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:53,420
我的父母会用我的蛋蛋勒死我的
my parents are gonna hang me by the nut sack.

1159
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:56,170
我也一样 除了不是用蛋蛋 很显然
I'm with him. Except for the nut sack part, obviously.

1160
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:57,340
你们开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

1161
01:15:58,380 --> 01:15:59,430
不 我很抱歉把
No. I'm sorry to throw a

1162
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:01,220
这件烂事怪在你们头上
bag of dog shit on your front porch here,

1163
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,090
但是一切都怪你们
but this is all on you guys.

1164
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:06,340
是你们惹出了麻烦 所以你们有义务帮她解决这件事
You created this mess, so you're obligated to help her out of it.

1165
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:07,800
再说了 如果她今晚又死了
Besides, if she dies again tonight,

1166
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:09,260
你们也相当于杀人凶手
that's blood on your hands.

1167
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:10,840
这有点太夸张了吧
That's a little dramatic.

1168
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:12,850
他是对的
He's right.

1169
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:16,190
这是我们的错
This is our fault.

1170
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:20,610
所以 我们要解决它
So, we fix it.

1171
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:23,910
这就是科学家做的事
That's what scientists do.

1172
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,820
我们解决问题
We solve the problem.

1173
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:32,120
所以 布朗森院长的办公室就在这栋楼里
So, Dean Bronson's office is in this building here,

1174
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:34,870
回到实验室最短的路径是这条路
and the fastest route back to the lab is this path here.

1175
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:35,960
看看这个 伙计们
And check this out, guys.

1176
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:36,900
布朗森院长每个晚上
Dean Bronson spends every

1177
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:38,570
都在这里的职工休息室里织东西
evening knitting in the faculty lounge over here.

1178
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:40,210
等等 什么 他还织东西
Wait, what? He knits?

1179
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:43,210
他好像之前是抽烟 然后他妻子让他戒掉了
I think he used to smoke and then his wife made him quit.

1180
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,010
还有 喔 对了 他妻子超级性感的
And, oh, by the way, shockingly hot.

1181
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:47,680
- 萨马 - 怎么
- Samar? - Hmm?

1182
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:51,060
我们能赶紧说正事吗
Could we do the thing we're... We're doing, right now?

1183
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:52,880
好的 抱歉 呃 对
Right, sorry. Um, okay.

1184
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,640
所以 我们需要拿到他办公室的钥匙
So, we need to get the keys to his office,

1185
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:55,620
偷偷溜到招生办
sneak over to admissions,

1186
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:57,560
闯入他的办公室 带上西西
break into the dean's office, grab Sisy,

1187
01:16:57,650 --> 01:17:00,130
避开所有的保安 把她推回实验室
wheel her back to the lab without anyone from security seeing us,

1188
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:01,060
在布朗森院长还没发现钥匙不见了的情况下
get Dean Bronson's keys back

1189
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:02,590
把他的钥匙还回去
to him without him ever knowing they were gone,

1190
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:04,150
给西西接上电 进行检测
power up Sisy, run diagnostics,

1191
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,860
打开开关 然后完成任务
flip the switch and bam.

1192
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:08,360
小翠就能回到她原来不知道是什么鬼的维度
Tree's back in whatever whack-ass dimension she came from,

1193
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:09,450
而我们
and we, well...

1194
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,700
我们就拯救了这该死的一天
We just saved the damn day.

1195
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:15,290
好的 听起来不错
Okay. Sounds awesome.

1196
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:17,960
- 所以我们要怎么做 - 我不知道
- How do we do that? - I don't know.

1197
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:19,670
当然
Of course.

1198
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,090
我们显然需要一个幌子
Okay, well. We obviously need a diversion.

1199
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:24,290
所以 我们只需要找到一个可以分散布朗森院长的注意力的法子
So, we just gotta find a way to distract Dean Bronson.

1200
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,380
你很美丽
You're beautiful

1201
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,050
你很美丽
You're beautiful

1202
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:34,060
她选的铃声 好吗
She picked the ringtone. All right?

1203
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:35,500
嘿 宝贝
Hey, babe.

1204
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,260
你还好吗
Yeah, you okay?

1205
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,540
- 我有个主意了 - 好的
- I have an idea. - Okay.

1206
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:39,920
我们可以穿过
What if we actually go through...

1207
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:40,940
我跟瑞安还有
With Ryan and them and...

1208
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:42,640
丹尼尔 嗨
Danielle, hi.

1209
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:46,400
我们想让你帮个小忙
So, we have a little favor to ask.

1210
01:17:46,990 --> 01:17:48,860
我非常怀疑
I feel suspect at best.

1211
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:50,070
让我们来试试吧
Let's just put our face in.

1212
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,160
嘿 宝贝
Hey, baby.

1213
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:52,280
喔
Oh.

1214
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:53,660
好吧 抱歉
Okay, sorry.

1215
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:55,830
很明显 她有点紧张
Clearly, she's a little on edge.

1216
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:58,290
- 没错 - 给她留点喘息的空间
- Mmm-hmm. That's right. - Give her some room to breathe...

1217
01:17:58,380 --> 01:17:59,410
瞎讲
Preach.

1218
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,050
有什么事吗
Can I help you?

1219
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:09,670
喔 抱歉 我好像迷路了
Oh, pardon, I appear to be very lost.

1220
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:16,390
罗杰 布朗森 我是学校的院长
Roger Bronson, I'm the dean of the school.

1221
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,770

1223
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,040

1225
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:29,740
先生 我能感受一下你的脸吗
Monsieur, may I know your face?

1226
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:30,860
什么
I'm sorry?

1227
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:32,440

01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:39,540
谢谢
Thank you.

1231
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:42,240
你一定是法国人 你手上一股奶酪味
You must be French. Your hand smells like cheese.

1232
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,240
我不吃奶酪
I don't eat cheese.

1233
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,580

1236

1237
01:18:58,690 --> 01:18:59,930
呃 咖啡厅
Uh, le cafe.

I don't think the cane is a good idea for you.

Tree, will you please tell me what's going on?

1312
01:23:46,850 --> 01:23:48,330
一开始 我以为他是要杀我
At first, I thought he was trying to kill me,

1313
01:23:48,330 --> 01:23:49,120
但其实他的目标是你
but it's you he's after.

1314

他的妻子发现你们的事了
His wife found out about your affair.

1318
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:10,870
所以他玩了你之前的把戏
So he stole a page from your old playbook.

1319
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:15,960
他放走了图姆斯
He set Tombs free,

1320
01:24:15,970 --> 01:24:19,040
他知道所有人都会认为是他杀了你
knowing that everyone would think that he killed you.

1321
01:24:19,130 --> 01:24:22,090
你就会带着你们的秘密一起死去
And the secret of your affair would die with you.

1322

很好 好吧 确实是这样
Bravo. Well done, indeed.

你真的认为我会让
You really think I was gonna

1338

我不介意
Don't mind if I do.

1342
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:50,970
喔 等等 我差点忘了

我想要离婚
I want a divorce.

1344
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,350
