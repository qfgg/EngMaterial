1
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,066
第一次谋杀是在我出生以前发生的
The first murder happened before I was born.

2
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,618
凶手以他最喜欢的一种结的名字
The killer called himself Clovehitch

3
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,328
自称为双套节
after his favorite type of knot.

4
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,662
我们的小镇一直笼罩在恐惧之中
Our town lived in fear.

5
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:49,293
之后 十年前 他停手了
And then, 10 years ago, he stopped.

6
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,211
每年 我们社区都会为受害者的亲人朋友们
Every year, our community had a memorial

7
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,339
举办一个纪念仪式
for friends and family of the victims.

8
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,680
那时 我并没有想太多
At the time, I didn't think about it much.

9
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:03,932
双套节杀手
那时 我并没有想太多
At the time, I didn't think about it much.

10
00:01:03,932 --> 00:01:07,100
双套节杀手

11
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,861
总要有个人来领导小队
Someone has to be leading the detail.

12
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,286
为什么 有人知道吗
Why?

13
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:19,996
Anyone?

14
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,078
为了让所有人不掉队 这是第一点
To keep everyone in step, that's number one.

15
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,451
第二点 起立 过来
Number two, here, stand up, come here.

16
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,498
我们那时候 是这么做的
In my day, what we did was,

17
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,210
旗要立起来 肩膀向后收
flag up, shoulders back.

18
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,673
把你们的肩膀往后收
Put your shoulders back.

19
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,087
这就对了
There you go.

20
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,552
如果刮大风的话
Now, if it's windy on that day,

21
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,012
他的另一只胳膊该怎么做
what's his other arm gonna do?

22
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,594
- 稳住旗 - 没错
- Steady the flag. - Right.

23
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,593
那么那时.. 你们两个 过来
Then on the day, you two, come up here.

24
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:45,396
一边站一个
Side to side.

25
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,104
你们的任务就是.. 你们要挤
Your job is you're gonna, you're gonna push.

26
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,019
像这样 明白吗 肩并肩
Here, right?

27
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,521
你们要为旗手稳住阵型
Shoulder to shoulder.

28
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,023
You're gonna keep that formation solid for the flag bearer

29
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,198
因为旗手既要承受旗子的重量 还要抗着风
who's got the weight of the flag plus wind.

30
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:07,958
非常好 做的不错 回去吧
Very, very nice.

31
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,327
Okay, great job, have a seat.

32
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:15,793
给他们来个画圈鼓掌怎么样
How about giving them a round of applause?

33
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,894
嘿 Bud 我一直想找你谈谈
Hey, bud, I, uh, I've been meaning to talk to you.

34
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,239
我的工作进展有点慢..
Work's been slow and, uh,

35
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,779
还有 你叔叔Rudy的保险在涨价..所以..
Uncle Rudy's insurance is going up, so I can't,

36
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,527
我现在还不能让你去领袖训练营
I can't send you to leadership camp.

37
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,450
但我需要它来凸显我的申请表
Yeah, but I, I need it to stand out on my application.

38
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,951
招募者是这么说的
That's what the recruiter said.

39
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,458
没错 只是..呃
Yeah, it's just, um, you know, we're gonna,

40
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,001
我们会把这个问题解决了的
we're gonna work on your rank together.

41
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,965
只是在你在上面以音速飞来飞去之前
It's just gonna take a bit longer

42
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,925
再需要等一些时间
before you're flyin' around at Mach one.

43
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,432
噢
Oh.

44
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,261
- 我来搬吧 - 没事 我能行
- Let me get that. - No, I got it.

45
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,763
我来吧 我来吧
Yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it.

46
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,859
噢不 我们逮住他了
Oh, no!

47
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,605
Oh-ho, we got him.

48
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,904
你也许是长高了 但我还是能踢到你的屁股
You may be getting taller, but I can still kick your butt.

49
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,867
- 放开 - 说
- Quit. - Say it.

50
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,077
- 不 - 说啊
- No! - Say it.

51
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,202
- 说 - 叔叔
Say it. - Uncle.

52
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,416
这就对了
There you go.

53
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,772
? Another day without the truth ?

54
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:05,823
? It was long ago I'll face tomorrow ?

55
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,071
? Whoa ?

56
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,243
? Whoa oh ?

57
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,211
? Whoa-oh whoa oh oh whoa ?

58
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:20,004
? You don't have to read girl between the lines ?

59
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,048
? To find it ?

60
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,890
<i>准备好了</i>

61
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,853
嘿 我喜欢你的卡车
Hey, I like your truck.

62
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,192
我爸说 在我十八岁之前是不会让我开车的
Yeah, my dad said I can't get a car until I'm 18.

63
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,152
- 真的? - 没错 因为你知道...
- Oh, really? - Yeah, 'cause you know,

64
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,488
青少年司机是最可怕的
teenage drivers are the most deadly.

65
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:28,110
噢 是啊...
Yeah, oh, yeah, that...

66
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,119
有道理
That makes sense.

67
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
嗯
Mmm.

68
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,293

73
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,198

- Oh, uh, there's a lever. - Okay.

74
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,201
对 就在那
Down there, yeah.

75
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,546
这是什么
Whoa, what is this?

76
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,550
你从哪找到的?
- Um, where'd you get that? - Right there.

77
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,925
就在那
你从哪找到的?
- Um, where'd you get that? - Right there.

78
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:25,462
你从哪找到的?
- Um, where'd you get that? - Right there.

79
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,763
什么
What?

80
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,558
我的天

81
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,473
你喜欢那种东西吗
Is that what you're into?

82
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,473
不 我...
No, no, I...

83
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,395
我都不知道这是从哪来的
I don't even know where this came from.

84
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,227
好吧 这可是你的卡车
Okay, well, it's your truck.

85
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,570
没错 但是这不是我的
Yeah, but this isn't mine.

86
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,071
真的 这不是我的...这很恶心
Really, no, this, this isn't mine.

87
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,077

It's gross. - Okay.

88
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:58,908

90
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,721
是啊
Yeah.

91
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,516
你看到你长得多高了吗
You see how tall you're getting?

92
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,106
宝贝 她比当时的Tyler还高啊
Honey, she's taller than Tyler was at the same age.

93
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,190
可能是我一直在往面糊里加生长素吧
It's all the growth hormones

94
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,685
Tyler 快点
I've been adding to the batter.

95
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:30,027
抱歉 妈妈
- Tyler, hurry up! - Sorry, mom.

96
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,820
再给我自己来一个
- Woo-oop! - One more for me.

97
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,453
好了

98
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,788

吃吧
Let's eat.

101
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,371
你还有时间去接Rudy叔叔吗
Are you gonna have time to pick up Uncle Rudy?

102
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,838
我们得开两辆车了
We gotta take separate cars.

103
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,956
我找不到我的钥匙了
I can't find my keys.

104
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,208
Tyler 你看见我的钥匙了吗
Tyler, have you seen my keys?

105
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,926
我们得走了 快吃
- Mm-mm. - We gotta go, eat.

106
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,171
快往嘴里塞东西
Stuff your faces. - Mmm.

107
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,013
- 噢 - 真好吃
- Oh! - This is good.

108
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,053
是不是很美味啊
Is that, is that delicious or what?

109
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,518
你开心就好
If you say so yourself.

110
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:00,728
嘿 Rudy 快点 bud
What?

111
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,730
Hey, Rudy?

112
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,143
如果我们迟到了 你妈就要出洋相了
Hurry up, bud.

113
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,312
好了
If we're late, your mom's gonna lay an egg.

114
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,319
There we go.

115
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,199
? Well I finally got a friend ?

116
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:25,749
? You might just even know him when ?

117
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,123
? Sure help a friend within ?

118
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:32,753
? Whose grown to like the hearts of men ?

119
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:37,177
? Are you saying it's the doubting ones ?

120
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,893
? Who sit away on the throne on high ?

121
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:45,765
? Who heard the sounds and it's a lie ?

122
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,775
你看见她了吗
Did you see her?

123
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:48,901
- Amy? - 不是
- Amy? - No.

124
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,232
她 她又来了
Her.

125
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,239
She's here again.

126
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,029
谁在乎啊
Who cares?

127
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,572
她在干什么啊
Just what is she doing?

128
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:58,615
策划个教堂枪击案吗还是什么的
Planning a church shooting or something?

129
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,284
她才没有在策划教堂枪击案
She's not planning a church shooting.

130
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,623
她不是基督教徒 她有问题
She's not Christian.

131
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,625
我在学校里认识她
She's sick.

132
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,289
她每年都要做相同的关于谋杀的报道
I know her from school.

133
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,457
She always does the same report

134
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,921
about the killings every year.

135
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,591
你是对她有感觉吗还是什么
What, do you have a crush on her or something?

136
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,302
真恶心
That's disgusting.

137
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,512
你不知道吗 她好像
Don't you know she did it with, like,

138
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,846
和五个橄榄球队员都上过床
five different football players

139
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,808
因为她妈抛下他们一家 去当脱衣舞女郎了
because her mom left the family to be a stripper?

140
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,891
我们应该为她祈祷
We should pray for her.

141
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,470
或者叫警察来
Or maybe call the cops.

142
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,017
Tyler 你可以晚点再和Billy聊天 我们还是事要做
Tyler, you can speak with Billy later.

143
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,515
- 回见 - 回见
We have rounds to do.

144
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,016
- I'll see you later. - See ya.

145
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,234
And remember,

146
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,531
Daniel is showing us not only faith,

147
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,120
but he's showing us the kind of faith

148
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,911
that can cope with Babylonian captivity.

149
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,534
You see, in order

150
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,957
to live in Babylon, Daniel lived his whole life.

151
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,374
<i>是真的吗?</i>
He was like a layman, he wasn't like a...

152
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,748
请把那玩意拿开 <i>是真的吗?</i>
- Put that away, please. - Like Jeremiah.

153
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,500
<i>是真的吗?</i>
He was a layman.

154
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:58,255
He lived his whole life in the arena of Babylonian politics.

155
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,096
It was just as hostile a world

156
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,216
为什么爸不过来帮忙弄优惠券?
as you could possibly live in.

157
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,639
How come dad doesn't have to help with couponing?

158
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,682
因为你爸爸有他自己的爱好
Because your father has his own hobbies.

159
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,602
你觉得今天的布道怎么样?
What did you think of the sermon today?

160
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,856
<i>所有人都在议论你 变态</i>
Without reservation

161
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,855
he believed in the power of God.

162
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,198
That's why he made that appointment with Nebuchadnezzar.

163
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,032
你对这东西上瘾了 我不喜欢这样
He said...

164
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,446
You're addicted to this thing.

165
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,662
我得看一下那个
I don't like it. - I need to see that.

166
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:26,915
我只是要看一下是谁发的短信
I just need to see

167
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:27,829
到底有什么东西这么重要?
who's texting. - He believed

168
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,704
in the power of God. - What's so important?

169
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,921
Daniel believed

170
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,290
没什么 没事了
in the power of prayer

171
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,131
absolutely. - Nothing.

172
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,003
Never mind. - The last of those miracles...

173
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:41,221
? I am a child ?

174
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:44,843
? Who is full of light ?

175
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:48,472
? And a father who reigns ?

176
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,598
? On high ?

177
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:55,482
变态
Perv. ? And through his son ?

178
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:59,573
? I have been transformed ?

179
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,865
? Lovingly torn ?

180
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:06,035
? For him ?

181
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,408
? And your child will not lie ?

182
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,583
? In the ground to die ?

183
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,916
- 嘿 发生什么事了? - 我的天 别跟着我
- Hey, what's goin' on? - Oh my God.

184
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:17,882
这怎么回事? 是因为那张照片吗?
Don't follow me. - What is this?

185
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,468
不 我只发短信跟一个人说了 我以为她会守住嘴的
Is this about the photo?

186
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,427
No, I texted like one person who I thought

187
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,467
我都根本不知道那是什么
would never tell. - What?

188
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,715
那不是我的 好吗 它是在我爸的卡车里的
I don't even know what that was.

189
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,058
It wasn't mine, okay?

190
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,094
你知道别人都在我的档案里怎么写的吗?
It was in my dad's truck.

191
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,391
然后你还在这么多人的地方 这样在我面前出现?
Do you even know what people are writing on my profile?

192
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,185
我对天发誓 那不是我的
And then you show up at this and parade around

193
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,182
in front of everybody? - I swear to God,

194
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,980
你得相信我 你要告诉所有人真相
it's not mine.

195
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:35,942
You have to believe me.

196
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,561
You gotta tell everyone the truth.

197
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:43,151
你会告诉他们的 对吧?
You'll tell 'em, right?

198
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,661
你都做了些什么啊 都把你那些小伙伴惹毛了?
What'd you do to piss off all your little pals?

199
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,578
有人在散布我的谣言 那是假的
Someone's been spreading a rumor about me.

200
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,450
青少年那点事儿 一定挺难受吧
It's not true.

201
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,202
Teenage drama.

202
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,213
Must be hard.

203
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,040
你知道吗 我听说过你
You know, I've heard about you.

204
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:58,882
你做那些事 很恶心
You're into this stuff.

205
00:11:58,885 --> 00:11:59,885
我也听说过你
It's sick.

206
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,503
Yeah, I heard about you too.

207
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
变态
Perv.

208
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,476
Give it back!

209
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,559
No, it doesn't!

210
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,813
嘿 这什么情况
Hey, what's going on here, huh?

211
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,574
你以为这是什么啊
What do you think this is, hmm?

212
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,785
你把这儿当成什么了
What do you think this is, huh?

213
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:27,778
你不可以这么做 想跳舞吗
You can't do all this.

214
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,405
想和我跳个舞吗
You wanna dance, huh?

215
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,775
Wanna dance, dance, dance with me?

216
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,376
噢 去吧
Oh, go on.

217
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:35,961
抓住她们..
Go get 'em!

218
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,413
Happy birthday, Susie.

219
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,040
<i>Nora -- Lucky的最爱</i>

Oh, I was just

00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,180
我非常失望
I am very disappointed.

228
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,930
- 妈.. - 回去睡觉
- Um, mom... - Go to bed.

229
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:48,817
妈..
Mom.

回床上去 Tyler
Go to bed, Tyler.

好的 妈妈
Yes, ma'am.

232
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,442
你妈说 我们必须来个小小的谈话
Mom says we have to have a little talk.

233
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,454
坐
Have a seat.

234
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,713
我们的秘密
Our secret.

235
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,716
只有我们男人们
Just the men folk.

236
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,888
其实我还帮你藏着你的另一个秘密
I've been keeping another secret for you, bud.

237
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,069
我知道你那晚上把卡车开走了
I know you took my truck the other night.

238
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,488
因为Rudy叔叔的事故 妈妈很担心你开车
Mom worries about you driving, 'cause of Uncle Rudy,

239
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,736
但我觉得吧 你年纪也不小了 晚上溜出去一两次也没什么
but I figure you're old enough

240
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:24,953
但是现在我们得把一些事情捋一捋
to sneak out once or twice.

241
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,821
那些可能会让你疑惑的事情
But now we have to straighten a few things out

242
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,368
that might be confusing you.

243
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,411
比如你在电脑上看的那些...
Like what you're looking at on the computer at...

244
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,957
我什么都没看
I wasn't looking at anything.

245
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,594
好吧
Okay.

246
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:44,641
性
Sex.

247
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,229
没错 我说出来了
There, I said it.

248
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,561
你知道 我们是按上帝的模样做出来的
You know we're made in God's image.

249
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,032
这就意味着我们的身体
That means your body is a holy thing

250
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,784
是一个神圣的东西
这就意味着我们的身体
That means your body is a holy thing

251
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:02,866
这就意味着我们的身体
That means your body is a holy thing

252
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,945
是不能被亵渎的
not to be desecrated.

253
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,162
你知道这是什么意思吗?
You know what that means?

254
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,491
但是 想你我这样的人
But, men like you and me,

255
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,209
我们会有想法的
we got thoughts.

256
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,330
那些想法会..
We got thoughts that start to ,

257
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,215
开始往我们的脑袋里蹦
start to pop into our heads.

258
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,631
你有没有过这些想法bud?
You ever get those thoughts, bud?

259
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,128
关于女孩的想法?
Thoughts about girls?

260
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,013
我懂的
I get it.

261
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:29,134
信不信由你 我也可是十六岁过的人
I mean, believe it or not, I was 16 once.

262
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,812
我们陷入了个小麻烦里 是吧?
We're in a bit of a pickle, aren't we?

263
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,898
这边我们有着上帝
We got God over here on this side

264
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,317
这边我们有着疯狂的性淘气包
and we got a sex-crazed monkey over here on this side.

265
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,740
你能听懂我说什么吗 bud?
You with me so far, bud?

266
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,077
并没有
Not really.

267
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,916
是这样的
Here's the thing.

268
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,543
有想法是没有错的
It's okay to have thoughts.

269
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,837
那只是幻想
That's just a fantasy.

270
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,005
上帝不会管这个的 他忙着呢
God will look the other way.

271
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,719
但是不能看图片
He's a busy man.

272
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,055
But no pictures.

273
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,018
懂了吗?
Got it?

274
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:17,812
幻想是可以的 它并不是真实的 它只是..
A fantasy's okay, it's not real, it's just...

275
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,605
只是个淘气鬼还是什么的
It's just monkey stuff.

276
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:23,356
蹦到你脑子里的东西 是控制不了的 对吧?
You can't control what pops into your head, right?

277
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,276
我是说 如果现在有个不好的想法?
I mean, what if a thought popped

278
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,819
比如说 我也不知道..
into your head right now, a bad thought?

279
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,694
Something like, I don't know...

280
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,320
比如拿起一个这个工具 然后
You know, grabbing one of these,

281
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,243
these tools in here and wham!

282
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,326
你是永远不会在现实生活里这么做 对吧?
You'd never do it in real life, right?

283
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,828
永远也不会
Never.

284
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,251
就是一些小淘气鬼 对吧?
It's just, just monkey stuff, right?

285
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,341
是 淘气鬼
Yeah, monkey stuff.

286
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,472
噢..
Oh, there.

287
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:47,557
看吧
噢..
Oh, there.

288
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:48,172
噢..
Oh, there.

289
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,017
我们做到了
We did it.

290
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,433
与老爸的尴尬谈话结束了
Awkward talk with Dad over.

291
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,854
洗车
- Car wash! - Car wash.

292
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,531
我能和你谈一谈吗
Can I talk to you about something?

293
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,655
我说过了 我忙着呢
I told you, I'm busy.

294
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:13,906
拜托 就一分钟
Come on, one minute.

295
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,337
Amy看见的我的那个东西 并不是你想象的那样
The reason I had that thing that Amy saw

296
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,800
我正试着不去想那个
wasn't what you think.

297
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:28,045
我一点也不喜欢那个
I'm trying not to think about it.

298
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,843
I don't like that stuff at all.

299
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,388
但它说明了一些不好的东西
It's shown me something, something bad.

300
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,135
一些我脑海里挥之不去的东西
Something that I, I can't get out of my head.

301
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,431
我..我知道可能那不是真的
I, I know it's probably not true,

302
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,428
但我觉得我必须和人谈谈这个 因为...
but I think I just need

303
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,805
我得打住你了
to talk to somebody about it because...

304
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,853
我知道你要说些什么
I'm gonna stop you right there.

305
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,691
我不会和你谈论这个的
I know where you're going with this

306
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,310
- 什么?  这是罪恶
and I'm not going to discuss it.

307
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,982
并且你有选择
- What? - It's a sin.

308
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,730
- Billy 拜托 - 这是一个选择
And you have a choice.

309
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,153
我不会犹豫的
- Billy, come on. - It's a choice.

310
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,366
I'm not even gonna.

311
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,158
你他妈跟着我干什么?
The fuck you following me for?

312
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,102
你还记得我 对吧?
You remember me, right?

313
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:01,562
变态Tyler
Tyler the perv.

314
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,900
变态变的怎么样了?
How's the perving?

315
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:06,859
为什么你总在我们的教堂边上看报纸?
Why are you always reading

316
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,478
the newspaper outside of our church?

317
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,406
我喜欢不好的新闻
I like bad news.

318
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,276
- 好吧 - 我想坐哪里都行
Okay.

319
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,824
And I can sit wherever I want.

320
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,287
我以为你们基督教徒都是很友好的
I thought you people were supposed to be all friendly

321
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,952
什么给予还有其他什么鬼的?
and giving and shit?

322
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,200
不..
No, of...

323
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,826
不 完全没有问题
No, yeah, no, it's totally fine.

324
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:25,505
好极了
Great.

325
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,879
嘿 呃 你知道那个双套节那些东西吧?
Hey, um, you know about that Clovehitch stuff, right?

326
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,217
我想也许我可以问你一些问题
'Cause I was thinking maybe

327
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,427
因为我在网上看到了些不好的东西...
I could ask you a few questions,

328
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,170
噢 我懂的
'cause I was on some bad website and...

329
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,843
Oh, I get it.

330
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,136
你听说了那个谣言
You heard that rumor

331
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,762
我和五个橄榄球运动员都上过床
about me and the five guys on the football team.

332
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:42,603
- 然后你觉得如果你... - 不不 不
And you thought that if you

333
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,938
没关系的 我是个婊子 你是个变态
came out here... - No, no no no.

334
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,352
It's okay.

335
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,817
我们天生就是一对
I'm a slut, you're a perv.

336
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,152
好了 够了
We were made for each other.

337
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,063
挺严肃的呢 没有人会知道的
- Okay, cut it out. - So serious.

338
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,823
这儿只有你和我两个人
No one will know.

339
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,158
It's just you and me down here.

340
00:24:58,706 --> 00:24:59,706
脱吧
Whip it out.

341
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,206
看看这儿有什么
Let's see what we're dealing with.

342
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,287
我特么在逗你玩呢
I'm fucking with you!

343
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,755
- 不 我知道 我真的.. - 你知道?
- No, I know, I really... - Do you?

344
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,499
等等 不 我真的.. 我只是..
Wait, no, no, I really, I just,

345
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,842
我想知道关于双套节的事 没别的 真的
I wanna know about Clovehitch.

346
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,052
比如说那些嫌疑人... 还有怎样可以...
That's all, really.

347
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,170
排除特定的嫌疑人
Just like the suspects, and,

348
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,887
为什么?
and how you could eliminate

349
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,051
你为什么突然间开始关心这些事了?
certain suspects. - Why?

350
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:22,302
Why do you all of a sudden care about this stuff?

351
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,053
你是想让我信教吗?
Are you trying to convert me?

352
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,397
- 还是你可以得个什么奖赏鼓励之类的? - 不是!
Or is this for a merit badge? - No!

353
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,642
不 我..
No, I, I don't know.

354
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,063
我不知道 它就是在我脑子里挥之不去
It's just stuck in my head.

355
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,363
我之前刚刚去过追悼会
I just went to the memorial the other day

356
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,733
我不认识他们中任何一个人 尽管如此...
and I didn't know any of them, but, still.

357
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,326
我以为和你谈谈这件事可能会有帮助..
I thought maybe talking to you about it

358
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,944
还是什么的
could help or something.

359
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:42,910
但是我不知道 可能只是什么蠢事罢了
But I don't know, it's probably just stupid.

360
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:43,952
这不蠢
It's not stupid.

361
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:50,293
三点之后来这里
Come here after 3:00.

362
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,299
我会帮你的
I'll help you.

363
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,262
记得带饼干来
Bring cookies.

364
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,573
我能帮你什么吗?
Can I help you?

365
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,273
呃 抱歉女士 我找Kassi
Uh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

366
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,365
I'm looking for Kassi.

367
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,413
我带了饼干
I brought cookies.

368
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,576
Kassi 你的小朋友来了
Kassi, your little friend is here.

369
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,832
我以为你不会来了
Didn't think you'd show.

370
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,925
你奶奶挺有意思的
Your grandma's interesting.

371
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,635
她不是我奶奶
She's not my grandma.

372
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,803
蠢蛋
Dumbass.

373
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,764
她之前为警察工作
She used to work for the cops.

374
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:45,681
她把警察们的所有档案拷贝了一份 然后写出了这本书
She made a copy of all their files and wrote this book.

375
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,730
坐
Sit.

376
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:58,945
这里有他的十个"官方"受害者的所有资料
And here's everything on his 10 official victims.

377
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,282
这是受害者八号 Erica Lytle
This is victim number eight, Erica Lytle.

378
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,499
她是一名五年级教师
She was a fifth grade teacher.

379
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,459
双套节知道 她什么时候会只有自己一个人
Clovehitch knew when she would be alone.

380
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,046
抱歉 它非常的具体
Sorry, it's pretty graphic.

381
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,041
他们有没有照过宝丽来相机的照片?
Did they take any Polaroid pictures?

382
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,759
没有 都是数码的 为什么这么问?
No, it's all digital, why?

383
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,387
所以 所有证据都在这儿了?
So this is all the evidence?

384
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:23,927
没有很多
There's not much.

385
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:27,098
没有指纹 没有血迹 没有精液 只有绳子
No fingerprints, no blood, no semen, just the rope.

386
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,720
好吧 是绳子纤维 还有这个
Well, rope fibers.

387
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,891
这是受害者四号的 Sasha Peterson
And this.

388
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,231
在第一浸信会外面找到的
Belonged to victim four, Sasha Peterson.

389
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,692
Found outside First Baptist.

390
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:37,062
她从来没有去过那里 我查过了
She never went there, I checked.

391
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,940
所以你之前在我们教堂外面蹲点是为了..
So you were staking out our church to...

392
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,535
缩小范围?
What, narrow it down, whoever was going back there?

393
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:42,658
看看有没有谁会回到那里?
缩小范围?
What, narrow it down, whoever was going back there?

394
00:27:42,658 --> 00:27:42,660
看看有没有谁会回到那里?

395
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,115
不 那事警察已经做过了
No, the cops already did that.

396
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,748
我在用FBI的策略
I'm using the FBI playbook.

397
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,662
我要通过他的弱点来抓住他
I'm gonna catch him using his weakness.

398
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,080
是什么?
And what's that?

399
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,919
他是个疯子
He's insane.

400
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,380
每个杀人犯都会因为他的心理特征 有一些特定的习惯
Every killer has an MO tied to his psychology.

401
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,124
就像指纹一样 看
It's like a fingerprint.

402
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:58,966
一样的进入点 尸体上精心编过的绳子也是一样的
Look.

403
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:02,679
Same entry points, same elaborate ropes on the bodies

404
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,220
每一个受害者的家里都系了双套节 这是他的标志
the clove hitch tied to every victim's house, his signature.

405
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:09,560
他在戏弄警察 用受害者作为战利品
He's taunting the cops, using the victims as trophies.

406
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,225
这些都是精心策划过的
It's meticulous and planned.

407
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,267
我会用这种"指纹" 把他和新的案件联系起来
I'm gonna use that fingerprint to connect him to new cases.

408
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,648
我并不认为他停止杀人了
I don't think he's stopped killing.

409
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,193
我觉得不止有十个受害者
I think there's more than 10 victims.

410
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
但是他的确停手了
But he has stopped.

411
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,364
连环杀手是停不下来的
Serial killers can't stop.

412
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,870
这张 还是这张?
This one, or this one?

413
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,335
这张 好了
This one, okay.

414
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,754
那个 我在想要不要去当志愿者
You know, I was thinkin' of volunteering.

415
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:43,346
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

416
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,305
也许去帮着课后辅导什么的
Maybe, uh, doing some tutoring

417
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,051
下午的时候
during the afternoons.

418
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,891
在哪?
Where would that be?

419
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,184
噢 在圣约瑟夫那边
Oh, over at St. Joseph's.

420
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,312
我和Billy的朋友Martin聊过了
I was talkin' to Billy's friend Martin.

421
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,560
他就去那边
He goes there.

422
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,861
我觉得你几年前见过他
I think you met him a couple years ago.

423
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:01,980
他人挺好的
He's a really nice guy.

424
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,947
我们好像给他们的募捐捐过吃的
We donated to their food drive, I think.

425
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,615
你真的很仁慈了 Tyler
Well, that's very generous of you, Tyler,

426
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,079
但是只能在下午 晚上是和家人的时间
but, keep it to afternoons.

427
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,948
好的 妈妈
Evenings is family time.

428
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:12,959
Yes, ma'am.

429
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,299
- 不! - 金
- No! - Gin.

430
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,008
- 不! - 不!
- No! - No!

431
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,847
- 作弊! - 怎么样?
- Cheating! - How about that?

432
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:24,923
别因为我长得帅而讨厌我
- 作弊! - 怎么样?
- Cheating! - How about that?

433
00:29:24,923 --> 00:29:24,930
别因为我长得帅而讨厌我

434
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,592
又来?
- Again? - Don't hate me
别因为我长得帅而讨厌我

435
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,099
'cause I'm beautiful.
别因为我长得帅而讨厌我

436
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:30,467
'cause I'm beautiful.

437
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,912
你可以骗过你妈 但骗不了我
You can pull the wool over your mother's eyes,

438
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:33,914
but not mine.

439
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,413
你在你应该去辅导的时候
Who was it you were visiting

440
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,036
去见谁了?
when you're supposed to be tutoring?

441
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,716
我儿子找了一个女朋友
My boy's got himself a girlfriend.

442
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:53,893
噢
Oh.

443
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,686
被你知道了?
You know about that?

444
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,848
问题是 你对你妈妈说了谎
Problem is, you lied to your mother.

445
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,894
噢 我们...
Oh, we...

446
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,527
我们只是在学习 没别的了
We really just study, that's all.

447
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,276
还记得我们之前谈过的吗?
Remember what we talked about before?

448
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,493
不 她的奶奶也在那 不是你想的那样
No, her grandma's there.

449
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:15,785
好吧 我知道 要不这样
It's, it's not like that. - I know, I know.

450
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:16,791
你妈妈可以不必知道你撒了谎
Tell you what.

451
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,120
但她必须要见见这个姑娘
Mom doesn't have to know you're lying,

452
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,834
明晚请她到家里来吃饭
but she needs to meet this girl.

453
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,705
Invite her over for dinner tomorrow night.

454
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,297
我不知道这是不是个好主意
I don't know if that's a good idea.

455
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,132
我会让你妈妈给她做炖菜
I'll have her make her a casserole.

456
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,214
好吧 好的
Okay, yes, sir.

457
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,071
嘿 你想不想...
Hey, would you wanna go to dinner tonight at my house?

458
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,698
今晚来我们家吃饭?
嘿 你想不想...
Hey, would you wanna go to dinner tonight at my house?

459
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:48,738
嘿 你想不想...
Hey, would you wanna go to dinner tonight at my house?

460
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,782
不想
No.

461
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,401
我的父母想见见你
My parents wanna meet you.

462
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:58,163
- 为什么? - 呃..
- Why? - Um...

463
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,542
他们觉得我们在约会..
They think we're going out and, uh...

464
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:02,752
- 啥? - 啊?
Whoa.

465
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,711
你知道我们不是在约会 对吧?
What? - Hm?

466
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,081
知道 当然知道
You know we're not going out, right?

467
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,092
Yeah, no.

468
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,168
不不不 这很明显的 我只是觉得..
No, of course.

469
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,794
No, no, no, duh, obviously.

470
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,717
你知道 他们..
I just thought...

471
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,839
我们知道了我们两个在一起 所以..
You know, they just,

472
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,557
他们不会试图说服我去信上帝吧?
they know we're hanging out, and so...

473
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,676
唯一不能提的就是双套节的事
They're not gonna try to convert me

474
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,018
to the ways of Jesus, are they?

475
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,057
因为他们不知道那些事 但是..
The only thing would be don't talk about Clovehitch,

476
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,306
'cause they don't know about anything like that, but,

477
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,108
我是说 什么都别讲
I mean, don't talk about anything.

478
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,444
好的 我一定会去的
Great, I'm definitely coming.

479
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,450
罗非鱼真好吃 宝贝
Mmm, great tilapia, hon.

480
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,745
Kassi 你去哪里的教堂?
So, Kassi, where do you go to church?

481
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,989
噢 我不去教堂
Oh, I don't go to church.

482
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,708
呃 我爸通常在周日喝个烂醉
Um, my dad's usually hungover on Sundays

483
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,202
我妈妈在我很小的时候就离开了
and my mom left when I was little.

484
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,796
所以 我基本上是个无神论者
So, um, I'm basically an atheist,

485
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,711
但我正在考虑要不要信威卡教
but I'm considering getting into Wicca.

486
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,261
威卡教? 那是.. 我听说过那个
Wicca, wha, no, I've heard of that.

487
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:57,974
那不是什么黑魔法 它是 呃...
It, it's not black magic, it's um,

488
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,218
- 一个以大自然为本的 神灵的... - 噢 妈妈
a nature-based spiritual... - Oh, mom.

489
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,094
- 她只是开个玩笑 - 噢 天啊
She's, she's just joking. - Oh, geez.

490
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,181
这个家里可没有你那种幽默感
This family doesn't have your sense of humor.

491
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:07,809
她去小镇另一边的一个教堂
Um, she goes to a church across town.

492
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,904
Kassi 我听说 你在拜访一个 年老的女士?
Kassi, I hear that, um, you visit an elderly lady?

493
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:14,194
呃 对 她退休了 她以前...
Um, yeah, she is a retired.

494
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,442
那是她的奶奶 Mavis 对的
She used to... - That's her grandma.

495
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:16,442
她是个已经退休的银行秘书
Mavis, yeah.

496
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,445
Tyler 让她自己回答问题
She's a retired secretary at the bank.

497
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:21,163
Tyler, let her answer for herself.

498
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,576
她约你出去的时候也是这么紧张吗 Kassi?
Was he this nervous when he asked you out, Kassi?

499
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:25,918
噢 没有 一点也没有
Oh, no.

500
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:26,707
他说的 特别花言巧语
Not at all.

501
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,713
非常棒的 非常的精巧 我都没有意识到他在约我出去
He was real smooth.

502
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,131
Incredible.

503
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:33,251
So smooth, I didn't realize that he had asked.

504
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,423
我完全理解你的意思
Oh, I think I know exactly what you mean.

505
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,092
这位也一样
This one over here's the same way.

506
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,300
基本上可以说是我亲自向他求的婚了
I practically proposed to him myself.

507
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,266
拜托
Oh, come on.

508
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,511
那戒指 那段演说我都有的
I had that whole ring and speech

509
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:44,763
我还单膝跪地了
and I did the one knee.

510
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,810
- 你太夸张了 - 噢 你做的很棒
You exaggerate. - Oh, you did great.

511
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,557
- 拜托 - 你做的很好
- Come on. - You did great.

512
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,358
所以 Burnside先生 呃..
So, Mr. Burnside, um,

513
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,697
你是教Tyler和其他人 怎么露营 削木头什么的..
you teach Tyler and everybody

514
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,032
about camping and whittling...

515
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,578
打结?
Tying knots?

516
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,623
其实 Kassi 已经不再是仅仅做好户外技能了
Well, Kassi, it's not just

517
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,663
他们会通过 呃..
about outdoor preparedness anymore.

518
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:10,505
You know, they got, they got badges now for, um,

519
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,177
电脑编程 还有...
computer programming and, and photography.

520
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:14,000
摄影什么的 来得到徽章
电脑编程 还有...
computer programming and, and photography.

521
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,010
摄影什么的 来得到徽章

522
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:14,302
但是 没错 我喜欢削木头和打结
All kinds of things.
摄影什么的 来得到徽章

523
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,126
但是 没错 我喜欢削木头和打结
All kinds of things.

524
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,879
But, yeah, I love whittling and knots.

525
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,096
说的没错
You got me.

526
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,638
你知道多少种结?
How many knots do you know?

527
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,227
我们能不能聊点别的?
Why don't we talk about something else?

528
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,265
这...这些很无聊
This, this is pretty boring.

529
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:30,276
反正 她问了
Well, she asked.

530
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,405
我对我之前那个不好的玩笑感到抱歉
I'm sorry about the bad joke earlier.

531
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,821
我真的很喜欢和Tyler待在一起
I really like spending time with Tyler.

532
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,074
我不想留下一个不好的第一印象
I wouldn't wanna give the wrong first impression.

533
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,168
我只是太紧张了 会说错话
I just get really nervous and say the wrong thing.

534
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,082
- 对不起 - 噢..
I'm sorry. - Oh.

535
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,047
完全没关系 甜心 没关系
Not at all, sweetheart, not at all.

536
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,212
并且你不需要紧张的
And you don't need to be nervous.

537
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,633
你是他带回家来见我们中
You are the best young lady

538
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,596
最好的姑娘了
that he has brought home to meet us.

539
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,888
- 并且也是唯一一个 - Don
- Also the only one. - Don.

540
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,226
关于那些鱼 我很抱歉
Sorry about the whole fish thing.

541
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:16,354
我不知道 他们到底知不知道素食是什么意思
I, I don't even think they know what vegan is.

542
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,364
停车
Pull over.

543
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,548
所以..
So...

544
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,763
你觉得你爸爸是双套节杀手?
You think your dad is Clovehitch?

545
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,100
你应该看看你自己的表情
You should see your face!

546
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,270
肯定不是你那爸爸了
It's not your fucking dad.

547
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,648
就你爸爸?
Your dad?

548
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:01,991
他有那些照片
He has pictures.

549
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:05,319
- Tyler... - 那些捆绑的色情的东西
- Tyler... - Like bondage porno stuff.

550
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,535
这就是为什么所有人都认为我是变态
That's why everyone thinks I'm a perv.

551
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,584
我去了他不让任何人进的修理棚 那里面还有更多东西
I went in his shed where no one is allowed,

552
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,748
甚至有一张上面写着"Nora"
and there was more.

553
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,963
There was even one that said Nora on it, and,

554
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,791
我觉得那是Nora Devlin
I think that was for Nora Devlin.

555
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,344
就在那旁边还写着 "Lucky的最爱"
Right next to it, it says, Lucky's favorite on it.

556
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,759
- 我是认真的 - Lucky?
I'm serious.

557
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,177
没错
- Lucky? - Yeah.

558
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,854
你爸爸根本不可能是他妈的双套节杀手
There's no way in hell your dad is Clovehitch

559
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,472
就因为他喜欢一些奇怪的色情图片
just because he likes weird porn.

560
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,392
他只是个性变态
He's just kinky.

561
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:39,697
我的天
Oh my gosh.

562
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,613
好了 我们走吧
Come on, let's go.

563
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,407
什么 你还觉得我们会亲热一下吗?
What, did you think we were gonna make out?

564
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:48,414
- 开车 - 哦
Drive. - Oh.

565
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:59,377
?我一整天都在?
? I've been doing all the dishes ?

566
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:03,344
? 洗这些盘子?
? All day long ?

567
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,393
? 尽管一毛钱都没有给我?
? Though I never get a nickel ?

568
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:08,387
? ...还有家里其他奇怪的活 ?
? 尽管一毛钱都没有给我?
? Though I never get a nickel ?

569
00:37:08,387 --> 00:37:08,393
? ...还有家里其他奇怪的活 ?

570
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,309
噢 看看这是谁!
? All the odd jobs around this house ?
? ...还有家里其他奇怪的活 ?

571
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:10,259
噢 看看这是谁!
? All the odd jobs around this house ?

572
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:13,229
Oh, look who it is!

573
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,099
? 浪漫先生归来啦 ??
? Mr. Romance has returned ?

574
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:18,226
来吧 跟我跳起来
Come on, dance with me.

575
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,523
我今晚可见到了
I, I've seen moves on you tonight

576
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:24,023
我之前从来没有见过的事呀 小先生
that I've never seen in my entire life, mister.

577
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,181
什么鬼? 你在这儿干什么?
What the heck?

578
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,301
我一直在想Lucky 我不能...
What are you doing here?

579
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,348
- 嘘! - 我睡不着
Lucky got stuck in my head.

580
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,185
所以我又看了一遍所有的文件 我回到Barbara那里
I couldn't... - Shh!

581
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,145
I couldn't sleep.

582
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,185
她对此可不怎么高兴
So I went through everything, and I went back to Barbara's,

583
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,558
但是我找到了
which she was not happy about,

584
00:37:58,568 --> 00:37:59,729
受害者五号 在她被杀的一周前
but I found it.

585
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:02,069
Victim number five, she got a note in her mailbox

586
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,108
她的邮箱里有一个便条
a week before she was killed.

587
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,481
猜猜上面写了什么?
Guess what it said?

588
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:25,585
不见了
It's gone.

589
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:26,595
我们走吧
Let's go.

590
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:30,974
让我看看
Let me see.

591
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,560
你确定上面写着"Lucky"吗
Are you sure it said Lucky?

592
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:37,263
- 我不知道 - 我摸到了什么东西
- I don't know. - I feel something.

593
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,441
Oh, hey.

594
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,985
- 见鬼 - 那是什么?
Shit. - What is that?

595
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,413
这是你父亲的笔迹吗 Tyler?
Does that look like your father's handwriting, Tyler?

596
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,134
我不知道
I don't know.

597
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,012
这是哪?
Where is this?

598
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,600
我爸爸快起床了
My dad will be up soon.

599
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,390
尽快到Barbara的房子来
Come to Barbara's as soon as you can.

600
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,059
不要让他知道你已经知道了 知道吧?
Don't let him know you know, okay?

601
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,650
你还好吗?
You okay?

602
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:24,903
你还好吗?
You okay?

603
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,780
还好
Yeah.

604
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,537
Tyler?
Tyler?

605
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:12,622
早啊 小太阳
Morning, sunshine.

606
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:14,633
噢 嘿 爸爸 现在几点了
Oh, hey, Dad.

607
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,506
快七点了 我以为我们要早点开始呢
What time is it? - Almost 7:00.

608
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,049
Thought we'd get an early start.

609
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:22,672
什么?
What?

610
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,096
你知道我们很长时间没有一起做什么了吗?
You know what we haven't done in a while?

611
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,390
野营 就你和我
Camping, just you and me.

612
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,606
- 呃 好吧 今天吗? - 对
- Um, yeah, today? - Yeah.

613
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,567
我觉得我们可以一起去找点乐子
Thought we'd go have some fun.

614
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,277
情系父子
Father-son bonding.

615
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,816
带上
Lock up that rifle badge.

616
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,111
好啊 一定会很好玩
Yeah, no, that'd be great.

617
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,404
但我感觉有点不舒服
I just feel kinda sick, though.

618
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,696
啊 来吧 我来给你做点麦片
Ah, come on.

619
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,410
穿衣服
I'll make you some cereal.

620
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,413
Get dressed.

621
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:30,829
我们去哪儿?
Where are we going?

622
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,121
快到了 bud
We're almost there, bud.

623
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,572
你和别人说了吗?
Did you tell anyone?

624
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,251
你和别人说了吗?
Did you tell anyone?

625
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,008
- 你在说什么? - Tyler
- What are you talking about? - Tyler.

626
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:31,434
我知道你去过修理棚和地板间里了
I know you've been in the shed and in the crawlspace.

627
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,523
你无权侵犯我的隐私
You had no business invading my privacy.

628
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:41,320
缺失尊重是很无理的 Tyler
The lack of respect is really disturbing, Tyler.

629
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:42,563
你知道的吧
You know better than that.

630
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,651
我给那门上锁是有原因的
There's a lock on that door for a reason.

631
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:57,085
你找到的那个盒子不是我的
What you found in that box wasn't mine.

632
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,467
那是谁的?
Whose is it?

633
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,476
Rudy的
Rudy's.

634
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,147
Rudy叔叔?
Uncle Rudy?

635
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,813
事实上 说这个是很耻辱的..
The truth is, I'm ashamed to say,

636
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:29,281
很多年前 你在卡车里找到的图片
I had an interest in those kinds of photos

637
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,995
我对那种图片有兴趣
that you found in the truck a long time ago, years ago.

638
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:37,501
Rudy也是一样 但是他更严重
Rudy was the same way, only much, much worse.

639
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,121
我们小时候就这样了 尽管如此
I knew that from when we were kids, but still.

640
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:44,758
当我在他的拖车里找到那些东西的时候
When I found that stuff in his trailer,

641
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,296
我找到他 和他说
I went to him and I said,

642
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:49,263
"Rudy 你得去自首"
"Rudy, you gotta turn yourself in."

643
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:57,900
但是之后...他试着...
But then, then he tried to you know...

644
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:57,979
...你知道的..
但是之后...他试着...
But then, then he tried to you know...

645
00:46:57,979 --> 00:46:58,984
...你知道的..

646
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:08,069
我以为那只是一场车祸
I thought it was a car crash.

647
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,075
没错
It was.

648
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,197
他开下马路了
He drove off the road.

649
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:22,629
那 你为什么会有那些东西?
Well, why do you have that stuff?

650
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:23,667
我本来想烧掉他们
I was gonna burn it.

651
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,085
我对上帝发誓 我是想烧掉他们的
I swear to God, I was gonna burn it.

652
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,188
但是那些受害者的亲人..
But the victims' families, they have a right to know.

653
00:47:35,188 --> 00:47:36,481
...他们有权了解真相
但是那些受害者的亲人..
But the victims' families, they have a right to know.

654
00:47:36,481 --> 00:47:37,095
但是那些受害者的亲人..
But the victims' families, they have a right to know.

655
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:43,062
但是我永远也找不到合适的时机 你知道吗?
Look, then it was never the right time, you know?

656
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:46,312
然后Susie出生了 还有其他的一些事..
Susie being born, or some darn thing and...

657
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:47,779
之后我必须为家里着想
Then I had to think about our family.

658
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,114
那对你们这些孩子来说肯定是难以接受的
It'd be rough on you kids.

659
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,699
还要让你妈妈承受这个?
And to put your mom through that?

660
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,121
为了什么?
For what?

661
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,040
这么做也不能让死者复生
Not gonna bring anybody back.

662
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,294
但看起来 那就是你
But it looks like it's you.

663
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,132
Bud
Bud.

664
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,924
Bud 我不知道 我不知道我还能说什么
Bud, I don't know, I don't know what else to tell you,

665
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,900
我知道你相信 ..
other than I know that you know it isn't me.

666
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,027
...那不是我
我知道你相信 ..
other than I know that you know it isn't me.

667
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:22,352
我知道你相信 ..
other than I know that you know it isn't me.

668
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:26,861
真的不是我
It's not me.

669
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,200
我只是特别的..
I'm just so...

670
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,324
我只是对要让你承受那些东西
I'm just so damned sorry to,

671
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,697
感到特别的抱歉
to put you through all that.

672
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:42,961
我搞砸了
I messed up.

673
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,421
我只是试图在保护我的兄弟
I was trying to protect my brother.

674
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,553
我们得把它交给警察
We have to take it to the police,

675
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,892
或者毁掉
or destroy it,

676
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,010
但是必须做出决定
but you have to decide.

677
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,701
系结能说明一个中队
Knot tying exemplifies the skills

678
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:02,288
或者一个家庭的实力
and the strength of a troop or a family.

679
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,908
绳子把纤维们编在一起
The rope weaves the fibers together

680
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:09,004
而结把他们曲向共同的目标
and the knot bends them to a common purpose.

681
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:12,875
在急救中使用的方结
The square knot used in first aid is a symbol

682
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:14,342
是一个为他人服务的标志
of service to others.

683
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,426
- 你去露营了? - 你不能.. 什么?
- You went camping? - You can't be, what?

684
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,140
我等了你好久 又去了你家 你妈妈和我说你去野营了
I waited and waited and I go by your house

685
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:21,974
嘘! 你去找过我妈了?
and your mom tells me you went camping.

686
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,718
我以为他盯上我们了
Shh, you talked to my mom?

687
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:24,560
不! 小点声 没有
I thought he was onto us.

688
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,976
他只是想带我去野营 知道吗?
No, keep your voice down, no.

689
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,098
很好 我已经弄明白了 是你家的房子
He just wanted to take me camping, okay?

690
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:29,440
- 什么? - 你家房子下面有个大坑
Good, because I figured it out.

691
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,274
It's your house. - What?

692
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,358
- 你进到我家房子下面了? - 我等不及了
Duh, there's a pit under there.

693
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,069
如果他带你去野营是为了除掉你 该怎么办?
- You went under my house? - I couldn't wait.

694
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:34,153
你在那下面找到什么了吗?
What if he took you camping

695
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,237
- 没有 他还没有完工 - Kassi 因为那不是他
to get rid of you? - Did you find

696
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:36,197
anything under there?

697
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,031
关于照片还有别的那些事我已经问他了
- No, he never finished it. - Kassi!

698
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,570
That's 'cause it's not him.

699
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,944
他跟我解释了
I asked him about the pictures and everything

700
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:41,786
什么? 他是怎么解释那个蓝图的?
and he explained it to me.

701
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:43,701
What, how did he explain the blueprints?

702
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:47,041
那只是幻想 不是真的
It's a fantasy, it's not real.

703
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:47,755
那Lucky呢?
- What about Lucky? - I gotta go back inside.

704
00:50:47,755 --> 00:50:49,463
我得回去了
那Lucky呢?
- What about Lucky? - I gotta go back inside.

705
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,503
那Lucky呢?
- What about Lucky? - I gotta go back inside.

706
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,088
相信我 那不是他
Just believe me that it's not.

707
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:53,457
- 那是谁? - 我不知道 我晚点打给你
- Well, then who is it? - I don't know.

708
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,298
我知道你不愿意相信 但是面对现实吧
I'll call you later. - I know you

709
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,384
看看这些 这些可是真实发生过的啊
don't wanna believe it, but just face it.

710
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:57,798
不 我现在不想弄这些

01:13:35,457 --> 01:13:35,533
你不应该看见这些的
You shouldn't see this. - Dad!

1002
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:40,740
我怎么教你的?
What did I teach you?

1003
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:43,756
除非你真的要扣下扳机
You don't aim a weapon unless you intend to use it.

1004
01:13:43,756 --> 01:13:46,340
否则不要用枪瞄准
除非你真的要扣下扳机
You don't aim a weapon unless you intend to use it.

1005
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:46,913
除非你真的要扣下扳机
You don't aim a weapon unless you intend to use it.

1006
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,894
你要开枪打我吗 bud?
Are you gonna shoot me, bud?

1007
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,352
你不能就那样给我留个字条
You can't just leave notes out for me like that.

1008
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:10,853
我父母会发现的
My parents are gonna find them.

1009
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,238
我喜欢你的黑眼圈 挺帅的
I like the black eye.

1010
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:15,448
It's a good look for you.

1011
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:18,573
你应该把那些照片带走的
You should've just taken the pictures, though.

1012
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:19,569
我以为你停手了?
I thought you were gonna stop?

1013
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:22,197
没错 上来
I am, come up.

1014
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:25,500
这是Nora Devlin的房子
This is Nora Devlin's house.

1015
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:27,586
我只知道这些双套结犯案的地方 抱歉
The only places I know are Clovehitch places.

1016
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:28,588
I'm sorry.

1017
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:33,671
听着 我想和你一起玩
Look, I wanna hang out with you,

1018
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:37,630
但是不能聊双套结的事
but it can't be about this Clovehitch stuff,

1019
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,131
尤其不能聊关于我爸的
especially not about my dad.

1020
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,724
行 我知道了
Okay, I get it.

1021
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:50,351
你到底相不相信我?
But do you even believe me?

1022
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:53,315
你真的相信我吗?
Do you really believe me?

1023
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:56,572
有时候我能感觉到她
I feel her sometimes.

1024
01:14:58,077 --> 01:14:59,077
什么?
What?

1025
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:02,038
我们进去吧
Let's go in.

1026
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,541
- 不 - 来吧
- No. - Come on.

1027
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:07,544
不要!
No!

1028
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:21,975
走啊
Let's go!

1029
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:03,139
他 呃 从地下室进来
He, um, came in through the basement.

1030
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:06,815
然后把她绑起来..
And then tied her up and tortured her here.

1031
01:16:06,815 --> 01:16:09,179
...然后就在这里虐待她
然后把她绑起来..
And then tied her up and tortured her here.

1032
01:16:09,179 --> 01:16:09,318
...然后就在这里虐待她

1033
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:12,150
接着就把她杀了
Then he killed her.

1034
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,318
他们就在这里找到的尸体
This is where they found the body.

1035
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:17,688
你为什么要告诉我这个?
Why are you doing this?

1036
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:19,064
你爸爸怎么和你说的?
What did your dad tell you?

1037
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:24,370
Tyler
Tyler.

1038
01:16:32,463 --> 01:16:33,795
我并没有在指控你爸爸
I'm not accusing your dad.

1039
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:37,124
我只想知道到底发生了什么
I just wanna know what happened.

1040
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,102
是Rudy叔叔
It was Uncle Rudy.

1041
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:53,015
坐轮椅的那个?
In the wheelchair?

1042
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:58,440
他那个样子多久了?
How long has he been like that?

1043
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:00,949
十年
10 years.

1044
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:04,283
这就是他停手的原因
That's why he stopped.

1045
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:10,880
他告诉我那是一场车祸
He told me it was a car accident but it was suicide.

1046
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,967
但...其实是自杀
他告诉我那是一场车祸
He told me it was a car accident but it was suicide.

1047
01:17:13,967 --> 01:17:14,294
他告诉我那是一场车祸
He told me it was a car accident but it was suicide.

1048
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:18,547
自杀未遂
Attempted suicide.

1049
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:26,757
我在你家下面的隔间里找到了点东西
I found something in the pit under your house.

1050
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:33,267
你之前说那下面什么都没有
Y-, you said there was nothing under there.

1051
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:37,567
绳子纤维
There were rope fibers.

1052
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,604
- 绳子纤维? - 没错
- Rope fibers? - Yeah.

1053
01:17:45,703 --> 01:17:47,194
这不是《犯罪现场调查》
This isn't CSI.

1054
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:53,165
听着 我知道你很迷这个双套节杀手的事情
Look, I know that you love being obsessed with Clovehitch

1055
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:55,627
这样就会显得你很阴暗 很有趣
because it makes you all dark and interesting,

1056
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:59,794
但是 说真的 这是关于我的家庭
but, but really, this is my family.

1057
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,132
他杀了我妈妈
He killed my mom.

1058
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:04,095
什么?
What?

1059
01:18:06,724 --> 01:18:09,967
双套节杀手... 杀了我妈妈
Clovehitch killed my mom.

1060
01:18:12,897 --> 01:18:14,354
我以为..
I thought, um,

1061
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,722
你妈妈不是逃走了吗
I thought your mom ran away.

1062
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:20,820
是啊
Yeah.

1063
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:26,946
我五岁的时候, 我爸和她大吵了一架
When I was five, my dad came home

1064
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,568
之后当我爸回家之后
after a big fight with her.

1065
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,077
她就不见了 她的东西也都不见了
And she was gone and so was her stuff.

1066
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:37,206
然后我们就再也没有她的消息了
And we never heard from her again.

1067
01:18:38,339 --> 01:18:41,173
我爸爸说她抛弃了我们
My dad says that she abandoned us.

1068
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:46,465
可我记忆里并不是这样
That's not what I remember.

1069
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:51,933
我记得一个男人进来 然后把她弄哭了
I remember a man coming in and making her cry.

1070
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:59,683
然后把她绑了起来 又把我关在卫生间里
And tying her up, and putting me in the bathroom.

1071
01:19:02,029 --> 01:19:03,440
她的尖叫声
And her screams.

1072
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:10,236
为了让自己听不到那声音 我把水龙头打开了
I turned on the water so I didn't have to hear.

1073
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:16,078
在那几年之后 我听说了双套节杀手..
And it was years later that I heard about Clovehitch

1074
01:19:18,545 --> 01:19:19,545
...然后我就明白了
and I knew.

1075
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:25,709
但我爸爸不听我说 没人听我说
But my dad wouldn't listen, no one would listen.

1076
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:30,214
我不想是他杀了我妈妈 所以没人相信我
I didn't want it to be him, so, no one's believed me.

1077
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:36,769
她叫什么名字?
What was her name?

1078
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:39,899
Crystal
Crystal.

1079
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:43,611
Crystal Harper?
Crystal Harper?

1080
01:19:49,827 --> 01:19:54,162
你怎么知道的?
How do you know that?

1081
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:59,208
房子下面..
Under the house,

1082
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:04,547
...有个盒子 里面有一些照片 珠宝..
there was a box, and it had photos, and jewelry,

1083
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:09,256
...和驾照
and driver's licenses.

1084
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:13,089
一共有十三个
There were 13 of them.

1085
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:21,816
十三个?
13?

1086
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:25,022
它们在哪?
Where are they?

1087
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:33,534
你这样做并不会让她们起死回生的
It wasn't gonna bring 'em back.

1088
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,156
并且他已经消失了
And he's gone.

1089
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:42,544
我们必须保护家人
We had to protect our family.

1090
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:47,541
- 所以它们在哪? - 所以我们把它们烧了
- So where are they? - So we burned them.

1091
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:48,551
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1092
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:53,220
你相信他吗?
Do you believe him?

1093
01:20:55,017 --> 01:20:57,009
你就没有一点怀疑吗?
Is there any doubt in your mind?

1094
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:01,481
拜托了
Please.

1095
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:12,698
玩的愉快
Have a good time.

1096
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:14,738
再次谢谢你 爸爸 为我凑够了钱
Thanks again, Dad, for coming through with the money.

1097
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:17,283
我觉得我能教你的差不多都教给你了
Eh, I figured you learned all you can from me.

1098
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:18,450
- 玩的愉快 - 我会的
Have fun. - I will.

1099
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:46,308
你爸爸是个杂物工 对吧?
Your dad was a handyman, right?

1100
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:47,934
所以呢?
So?

1101
01:21:47,945 --> 01:21:50,733
这就解释了 为什么受害者的房子里
Well, it'd explain why there's no forced entry.

1102
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,355
全都没有破门而入的痕迹
Case his victims' houses.

1103
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:55,700
Rudy叔叔也是一个杂物工
Uncle Rudy was a handyman too.

1104
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:13,593
你期望能看见什么?
What are you expecting to see?

1105
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:16,846
什么都行
Anything.

1106
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:18,215
他绝对不可能那么变态
There's no way he could be that sick

1107
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:19,807
而不留下点迹象
and not give any hint.

1108
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:21,301
我都和他生活了一辈子了
I've lived with him my whole life.

1109
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:22,311
根本没有迹象
There's no hint.

1110
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:25,680
也许你并不知道 一个正常的爸爸是什么样子的
Maybe you don't know what a normal dad is like.

1111
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,608
对 呃 我觉得学到了很多东西
No, yeah, no, I feel like I'm learning a lot.

1112
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:32,775
并且辅导员们非常乐于帮忙
And the, the counselors have been really helpful

1113
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:35,524
到目前为止一切都棒极了
and everything's been amazing so far.

1114
01:22:35,534 --> 01:22:37,571
好 好的 我得挂了 妈妈
Yeah, alright, alright.

1115
01:22:37,578 --> 01:22:38,578
我也爱你 回聊
I gotta go, Mom.

1116
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:40,119
No, I love you too.

1117
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:41,122
他在跟踪那个女的
I'll talk to you later.

1118
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:44,912
什么女的?
- He's following that woman. - What woman?

1119
01:22:44,918 --> 01:22:46,750
穿蓝色裤子的那个女的
The woman in the blue pants.

1120
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:49,916
他在盯着她看
He's staring at her.

1121
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:05,933
不 不行 他会看见你的
No, no, he'll see you, he'll see you.

1122
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:11,104
这行不通的
This isn't gonna work.

1123
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:15,192
他用的哪种手机?
What kind of phone does he have?

1124
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,737
? Whoa ?

1125
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:25,115
? Whoa-oh ?

1126
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:30,041
? Whoa-whoa-oh-oh whoa ?

1127
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:34,837
? Well last night baby was our last ?

1128
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:39,759
? Though we did spend it out ?

1129
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:41,427
? 'Cause it's black and white ?

1130
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:44,801
? That our future is passed ?

1131
01:23:44,811 --> 01:23:48,680
<i>定位追踪器</i>
? There's no shadow of a doubt ?

1132
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:51,182
? Our love is yesterday's news ?

1133
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:53,480
? And now it's time to turn the page ?

1134
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:55,854
? I need the writing on the wall ?

1135
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:58,106
? I mean it's time for a change ?

1136
01:23:58,116 --> 01:24:00,654
? Our love is yesterday's news ?

1137
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:03,074
? Another day without the truth ?

1138
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:08,041
? Till it was long ago I'll face tomorrow ?

1139
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:10,786
? Whoa ?

1140
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:12,879

我没伤害过任何人

唯一的后果就是会伤害到你妈和Susie
