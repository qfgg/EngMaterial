Put that hand on me again, you won't get it back.

42
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,290

我感觉不到我的手了 我的手

00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,150
我们会帮你找到书的
And we'll get you your book.

141
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,740
对此我毫不怀疑
Of that I have no doubt.

142
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,320
你派出去找书的人连大字都不识一个
You're sending guys out who can't even read to look for one book.

143
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,080
难怪他们什么都找不到
Well, no wonder they never find anything.

144
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,090
是啊 我就用手边的工具
Yeah, I use the tools I have at hand.

145
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,560
除非你愿意和他们一块儿去？
Unless you'd like to go with them?

146
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,260
这些怎么办？
What about these?

147
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,730
烧了吧
Burn them.

148
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,860
街对面的这家 他们有水吗？
This place across the street, they got any water?

149
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,280
有啊 要是你付钱的话
Yeah, if you can pay for it.

150
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,040
给
Here.

151
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,420
问问这个
Smell this.

152
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,660
一支路上小分队弄来的
One of the road crews found it.

153
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,860
谁知道呢？
Who knows?

154
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,700
这可能是地球上最后的香波了
It may be the last shampoo on the planet.

155
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,540
而它是属于你的
And it's yours.

156
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,360
他们找到你要的书了吗？
Did they find your book?

157
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,180
没有
No.

158
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,330
外地人？
Outlander?

159
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,070
让我想想
Let me see.

160
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,170
- 好吧 你要什么？ - 水
-All right, what'll it be? -Water.

161
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,750
那可是好东西
That's the good stuff.

162
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,800
我得从自己的配额里拿出来卖给你 所以不便宜
I've gotta eat into my own ration to sell it, so it don't come cheap.

163
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,710
好
Right.

164
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,140
再加一倍就给你
Get you maybe halfway.

165
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,580
索拉拉！
Solara!

166
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,170
拿着这个把它装满水
Take this and get it filled.

167
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,420
等等 你需要这个
Wait. You need this.

168
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,450
能请你让一下吗？
Can you please move?

169
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,420
谢谢
Thank you.

170
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,160
那是我的猫
That was my cat.

171
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,830
品种很不错
Fine specimen.

172
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,980
我看到你把它推到吧台下面去了
I saw you knock him off the bar.

173
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,840
不 我只是吓吓它 我没真的推它
No. I kind of shooed him, I didn't really knock him.

174
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,320
你朝他抬手了
You raised your hand at him.

175
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,350
不会再这样了 我向你保证
Won't happen again, I promise you.

176
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,110
嘿 马兹 再来一杯怎样？
Hey, Martz, how about another drink?

177
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,290
那猫上这儿来已经两年了
That cat's been coming in here for two years.

178
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,390
它比你更有权力呆在这儿
It's got more right to be here than you.

179
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,220
我不想惹麻烦
I don't want any trouble.

180
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,860
那就太糟了 你已经
Well, that's too bad, 'cause you got...

181
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,480
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

182
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,970
你杀害了路边无辜的行人
Murderer of innocent travelers on the road.

183
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:03,380
你会为此付出代价的 明白吗？
You are gonna be held to account for the things you've done, do you know that?

184
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,400
你明白吗？
Do you?

185
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,220
没事了
It's okay.

186
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,370
我会拿着我的东西离开这儿
I'm gonna grab my things and I'm gonna walk out of here.

187
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,840
- 好吧 - 好了 兄弟？
-All right. -All right, brother?

188
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,240
是
Yeah.

189
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,270
是

190
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,340
大地因你而受诅
"Cursed be the ground for our sake.

191
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:13,490
荆棘与疾黍将在我们面前出现
"Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for us.

192
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,640
我们从地中来 我们从尘土中来
"For out of the ground, we were taken. For the dust, we are.

193
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,660
“也必将归于尘土”
"And to the dust, we shall return."

194
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,930
住手！
Stop!

195
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,760
求你了
Please.

196
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,540
瑞德利治
Redridge!

197
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,570
瑞德利治
Redridge.

198
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,400
你是谁？
And who are you?

199
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,670
无名鼠辈
Nobody.

200
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,420
我不信
I doubt that.

201
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,470
在我的酒吧里被杀的那些人 他们才是无名鼠辈
The men you killed in my bar, now, they were nobody.

202
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,150
- 但是你 - 他的手没有抖
-But you, now. -He ain't got the shakes.

203
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,680
- 他不是他们一伙的 - 很好
-He ain't one of them. -Good.

204
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,270
这是一个文明的城市 我们不吃人
This is a civilized town. We don't eat humans.

205
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:55,280
我们这儿不常见到很多从前的人 现在不常见了
We don't see too many people from before. Not anymore.

206
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,990
- 你看书吗？ - 每天
-Do you read? -Every day.

207
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,620
好 这对你很好 我也每天看
All right. Well, good for you. Me, too.

208
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:05,900
你知道吗 真有趣
You know, it's funny.

209
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,790
虽然我们都老了 你我这样的人 我们却是未来
As old as we are, people like you and me, we're the future.

210
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,960
你想怎样？
What do you want with me?

211
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,440
直奔主题！
Straight to the point!

212
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,260
我喜欢这样！
I like that!

213
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,680
你不仅是受过教育
You're not just educated.

214
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,650
我从没见过谁有这么好的身手
I never saw anyone handle themselves the way you did.

215
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:35,400
我不知道你从哪儿学来的那些 但是我肯定我用得上你
I don't know where you learned it, but I sure as hell could use it.

216
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:39,400
这个小城只是一个开始
This little town, just the beginning.

217
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,570
我打算对外扩建
I'm about to expand.

218
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,970
我需要专业人士的帮助 我可以任用你这样的人
I need expert help. I could use someone like you.

219
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,540
谢谢 但我真的不感兴趣
Thank you, but I'm really not interested.

220
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,960
替我干活的人 过得比任何行者做梦梦到的都好
Well, the people who work for me live better than any walker ever dreamed.

221
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,670
问问瑞德利治 问问兄弟们 随便问谁
Ask Redridge here. Ask the boys, anyone.

222
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,800
真正的床 热乎的饭菜 还有女人
Real beds, hot food, women.

223
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,510
干净的水
Clean water.

224
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,730
你去别的地方可能会差很多 伙计
You could do a lot worse, my friend.

225
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,600
谢谢你
Thank you,

226
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,770
但我必须去一个地方
but I got somewhere I need to be.

227
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,140
去哪儿？
Where?

228
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,440
西方
West.

229
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,780
西方什么都没有
There is nothing west.

230
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,810
别人告诉我的和你说的不一样
I've been told different.

231
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,200
谁告诉你的？
By who?

232
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,020
告诉你吧
Tell you what.

233
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:33,040
在这儿住一晚 感受一下当地的热情好客 看看自己是否喜欢
Stay the night. Try a little local hospitality, see how you like it.

234
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,540
咱们明早再谈
We'll talk again in the morning.

235
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,150
给你个忠告 行者 这不是选择
Word of advice, Walker. It's not a choice.

236
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,470
永远都是选择
It's always a choice.

237
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,640
整晚都会有人在你的房间外
There'll be someone outside your room all night

238
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,370
要是你有任何需要的话
if you need anything.

239
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,060
我什么都不需要
I don't need anything.

240
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,270
那可说不准
You never know.

241
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:51,870
这是给你的 一些洗漱用的水和食物
This is for you. It's some water for washing and some food.

242
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,880
还有些许特殊藏品 代表房主的问候
Little special reserve, too, compliments of the house.

243
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,010
你得把这个接过去 或者说句话 这样我才能知道你在哪
I need you to take this or say something so I can find you.

244
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,360
- 谢谢 - 不客气
-Thank you. -You're welcome.

245
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:22,230
- 你还需要我帮你拿些什么吗？ - 不 不用了 谢谢
-Can I get you anything else? -No, I'm fine. Thank you.

246
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,320
你失明是因为战争 还是因为战后的阳光？
Did you get blinded in the war or by the sun after?

247
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,570
我生来如此
I was born this way.

248
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,540
我想或许我是幸运的 因为当一切发生时
I think probably I'm lucky, because I was already used to being like this

249
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,640
我就已经习惯这样了
by the time it happened.

250
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,910
好吧 那么 谢谢你给我送吃的来
Right, well, thank you for the food.

251
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,050
不客气
You're welcome.

252
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:44,980
我喜欢你的香水
I like your perfume.

253
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,430
只是香波而已
It's just shampoo,

254
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,180
但是谢谢你
but thank you.

255
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,170
晚安
Good night.

256
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:25,630
我不认为他明早会改变主意
I don't think he's gonna change his mind by the morning.

257
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,510
他不会留下的
He's not gonna stay.

258
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:35,060
他和其他人不同
He's different than the others.

259
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,100
你没法让他听命于你的
You're not gonna be able to make him do what you want him to do.

260
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,110
谁说是听命于我？
Who said anything about me?

261
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,490
我会派索拉拉去
I'll send Solara.

262
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,490
你不能那么做
You can't do that.

263
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,690
是时候让她派上更大用场了
It's about time I got better use out of her.

264
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,160
不要那么做
Don't.

265
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,420
求你
Please.

266
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,570
求你了 不要 求你 求你
Please, don't. Please. Please.

267
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,930
求求你！
Please!

268
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,520
我能进来吗？
Can I come in?

269
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,720
等一分钟
Give me a minute.

270
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,670
已经有人送过食物和水了
Somebody already came with food and water.

271
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,100
需要的我都有了
I got everything I need.

272
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,470
你确定吗？
Are you sure about that?

273
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:58,390
这儿还真是明亮
It's really bright in here.

274
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,230
我叫索拉拉
I'm Solara.

275
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:05,060
是 你在楼下给我装的水
Right. You filled my canteen downstairs.

276
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,970
是呀 你是那个行者 不是吗？
Yeah. You're the walker, right?

277
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,240
是
Right.

278
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,380
你要是担心钱的问题 都算在房主账上了
If you're worried about paying, it's on the house.

279
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,070
什么钱？
Paying for what?

280
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,140
你干嘛不坐下来？
Why don't you take a seat?

281
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,250
不
No.

282
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:41,180
不 我不能走 我不能 我要是走了 他会伤害我妈妈的
No, I can't go. I can't. If I do, he'll hurt my mom.

283
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,190
- 谁？ - 卡耐基
-Who? -Carnegie.

284
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,400
他是你父亲？
He's your father?

285
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:51,170
不 不是 但我们照样都属于他
No. No, but we belong to him just the same.

286
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,530
听着 我可以睡地板
Look, I'll sleep on the floor.

287
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,240
明天你可以告诉他你过得很愉快
Tomorrow you can tell him you had a good time.

288
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,080
我保证我不会惹麻烦
I promise you I will be no trouble.

289
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,210
求你了？
Please?

290
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:14,760
骑士到象四
Knight to bishop four.

291
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,310
该你了
Your move.

292
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,950
那 你多大了？
So, how old are you?

293
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,320
什么？
Excuse me?

294
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:41,220
因为我很少看到你这个年纪的人上这儿来
It's just that I haven't really seen too many people your age come through here before.

295
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,540
自从文明毁灭
Well, it's been

296
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:50,210
已经过了３０个冬天了
30 winters since the flash.

297
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,300
我真的不记得了
I really don't remember.

298
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,840
你还记得一切是什么样子的吗？ 我是说 从前的世界
Do you remember what it was like? I mean, in the world before.

299
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,180
我知道
Yeah.

300
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,770
那 从前是什么样子的？
Well, what was it like?

301
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,320
人们拥有的比需要的多
People had more than they needed.

302
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:20,600
我们不知道何为珍贵
We had no idea what was precious, what wasn't.

303
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:29,340
我们丢弃了很多东西 而现在的人却为了那些东西自相残杀
We threw away things people kill each other for now.

304
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,440
- 真的？ - 真的
-Really? -Yeah.

305
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,080
你有一本书
You have a book.

306
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,300
- 我能看看吗？ - 不能
-Can I see it? -No, you cannot.

307
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,600
- 我只是 只是想看看 - 不行 我说了不行
-I just, I just wanna look at it. -No. I said no.

308
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,310
听着 我根本不识字！ 来吧 求你了 我只是想看看
Listen, I can't even read! Come on, please, let me just see it.

309
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,060
你到底怎么了？不过是本书罢了！
What is with you? lt is just a book!

310
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,890
这不只是一本书
It's not just a book.

311
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,070
- 什么意思？什么叫不只是一本书？ - 听着
-What do you mean, it's not just a book? -Look.

312
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:57,630
不许再问书的事情了 明白吗？ 不要再问了 好不好？
No more questions about the book, all right? No more questions. All right?

313
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,100
既然你在这儿 我想问你个问题
I got a question for you, since you're here.

314
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,930
我可能回答也可能不回答
Well, maybe I'll answer it and maybe I won't.

315
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,730
你从哪儿弄到的水？
Where do you get your water?

316
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,070
不能告诉你
Can't tell you that.

317
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:37,270
- 是你不能说还是你不知道？ - 哦 我知道的
-You can't tell me or you don't know? -Oh, I know.

318
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:43,140
但要是你不告诉我书的事情 我就不告诉你水的事情
But if you're not talking about the book, I'm not talking about the water.

319
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,830
知道吗 你这人真滑稽
You're something else, you know.

320
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:51,620
好吧 我还有个问题
All right, I got another question for you.

321
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:53,320
说吧
Right.

322
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,630
你饿吗？
You hungry?

323
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,690
这儿有很多吃的
There's a lot of food there,

324
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,840
我一个人吃不掉
more than I can eat.

325
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,380
告诉你吧
Tell you what.

326
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:06,890
我们可以分享 你知道 就像曾经老人们那样
We can share it, you know, like old people used to.

327
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:11,020
好吧
Okay.

328
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,230
好？
Okay?

329
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:19,550
等一分钟 等一分钟 等等 坐下
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait. Sit.

330
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:22,980
坐下
Sit.

331
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,910
这是给你的
This'll be for you.

332
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,080
把手给我
Give me your hands.

333
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,560
你干什么？
What are you doing?

334
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,890
相信我 把手给我
Trust me. Give me your hands.

335
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,920
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

336
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:45,840
亲爱的主 我们感谢您赐予我们面前的食物
Dear Lord, we thank you for this meal.

337
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:49,370
感谢您赐予我们温暖的床
We thank you for a warm bed

338
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:53,350
感谢您赐予我们头顶的屋檐 使我们不致受冻
and a roof over our head on cold nights such as this.

339
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,150
太长了
It's been too long.

340
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,070
是你从那本书里看到的？
Is this from your book?

341
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:01,750
别插嘴 闭上眼睛
Don't interrupt. Close your eyes.

342
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:08,030
感谢您在这样的艰苦岁月中
We thank you for the gift of companionship

343
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,430
给予我们陪伴
in hard times like these.

344
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:12,700
阿门
Amen.

345
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,840
现在可以吃了？
Now we eat?

346
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,600
可以吃了
Now we eat.

347
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,140
早上好 索拉拉
Good morning, Solara.

348
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:58,670
昨晚过得怎样？睡得好吗？
How was your night? Did you sleep well?

349
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,420
我照你说的做了
I did like you said.

350
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:02,920
你当然要按我说的做
Of course you did what I said.

351
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:07,320
但是有用吗？他会留下来吗？
But did it work? Is he staying?

352
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,350
我们没怎么说话
We didn't do much talking.

353
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,520
索拉拉 亲爱的 吃点东西
Solara, honey, eat something.

354
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,020
妈妈 把手给我
Mom, give me your hand.

355
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:23,340
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

356
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,500
妈妈 相信我
Mom, trust me.

357
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,450
亲爱的主
Dear Lord.

358
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:37,450
我们感谢您赐予我们食物
We thank you for our food.

359
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,750
感谢您赐予我母亲
Thank you for my mother.

360
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:46,430
感谢您赐予我们头顶的屋檐 和新的朋友
Thank you for the roof over our heads and our new friends.

361
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,460
还有
And...

362
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:58,870
嗯 我想就这么多
Well, I guess that's all for now.

363
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,880
阿门
Amen.

364
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,780
这是你要说的词 阿门
That's the word you're looking for. Amen.

365
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:13,950
是结束语
That's how you stop.

366
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,160
你还说你们没怎么说话
You said you didn't talk much.

367
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,470
那他看书了吗？
But did he do any reading?

368
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:32,400
- 我再问你问题 - 比尔 别
-I asked you a question. -Bill, don't.

369
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:35,100
你 给我闭嘴
You. Shut your mouth.

370
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,030
住手！
Stop!

371
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:49,760
你在伤害你的母亲 索拉拉
You're hurting your mother, Solara.

372
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,900
他说过他每天都看书的 不是吗？
He said he read every day. Did he?

373
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:56,370
住手！
Stop it!

374
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:59,360
你妈妈想让你告诉我
Your mother would like you to tell me.

375
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,930
我不知道！
I don't know!

376
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,530
我不知道！

377
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,940
好吧是的！是的！他看书了！
Yes, okay! Yes, yes, he was reading.

378
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,880
- 什么样的书？ - 我不知道！
-What kind of book was he reading? -I don't know!

379
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:17,290
- 我不知道！皮革封面的旧书！ - 还有呢？
-I don't know! An old leather one! -And?

380
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:23,400
我不知道 封面上画了什么东西！
I don't know, it had some kind of thing on the front of it!

381
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,730
- 画给我看！ - 你先放了她！
-Show me. -I need you to let her go!

382
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,270
画给我看！
Show me!

383
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,040
瑞德利治
Redridge!

384
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:57,180
妈的！他一整晚都在这儿
Shit! He was here the whole night.

385
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,680
他在哪儿？
Where is he?

386
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,660
我不知道 我不
I don't... I don't...

387
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,400
- 我只想确保你知道 - 我懂
-I just wanna make sure that you know that... -I understand.

388
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:10,100
那里没有酸性 只是沼泽水
...there's no acid in there. That's swamp water.

389
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,110
没关系 只要拿掉就行了 拿掉
It doesn't matter. Just take these off. Take them off.

390
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,610
- 好吧 让我来 好吧 只要 - 把他们拿掉
-All right. Well, let me, all right, just... -Take them off.

391
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,270
- 嘿！ - 好吧 你赢了 拿掉
-Hey! -All right. You got it, coming off.

392
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:18,410
- 谢谢 - 拿掉了
-Thank you. -Coming off.

393
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,280
你可以告诉他们是我逼你做的 明白吗？
You can tell them I made you do it, all right?

394
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:21,340
好的
All right.

395
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:23,540
- 说一遍 - 你逼我做的
-Say it. -You made me do it.

396
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:52,780
装子弹了吗？我觉得没有
Is that thing loaded? I don't think it's loaded.

397
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:54,940
有一个方法可以检验
One way to find out.

398
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,820
听着 我需要那本书
Look, I need that book.

399
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:02,580
我是说 我要那本书和你
I mean, I want the book and you,

400
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:06,920
但你若要我选择 我会杀了你 然后拿那本书
but if you make me choose, I'll kill you, I'll take the book.

401
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,830
为什么？你为什么想要它？
Why? Why do you want it?

402
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,010
它伴我长大
I grew up with it.

403
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,410
我知道它的力量
I know its power.

404
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,600
如果你读它 你就有力量
And if you read it, then so do you.

405
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:24,410
这就是为什么战后它们都被焚毁了
That's why they burned them all after the war.

406
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,020
活着就是一种信仰
Just staying alive is an act of faith.

407
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,390
建造这座城镇更是一种信仰
Building this town is an even bigger act of faith,

408
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,730
但他们不明白这点
but they don't understand that,

409
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:35,920
他们一个都不明白
none of them.

410
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,930
我没有适当的词句去帮助他们 可这本书有
And I don't have the right words to help them, but the book does.

411
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,330
我承认
Now, I admit

412
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:48,000
为了建造此地 我曾被迫去做一些事情
that I've had to do things,

413
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:51,670
我做了很多我所不愿做的事 这点我承认
many, many things, that I hate, to build this. I confess that.

414
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:55,710
但如果我们有了那本书
But if we have that book,

415
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,550
我就不必再这样了
I wouldn't have to.

416
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:01,550
想象一下吧
Now imagine.

417
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,220
想想这个小小的世界 可以变得多么不同 多么正义
Imagine how different, how righteous this little world could be

418
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:08,620
如果我们能用正确的词句表达信仰
if we had the right words for our faith.

419
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:11,400
人们会真正明白 自己为何而生 正在做什么
The people would truly understand why they're here and what they're doing

420
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:14,460
他们不再需要任何卑劣的动机
and they wouldn't need any of the uglier motivations.

421
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:21,870
把那本书藏起来是不对的 它就是为了分享而存在的
It's not right to keep that book hidden away. It's meant to be shared with others.

422
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,970
它注定要被广为流传
It's meant to be spread.

423
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,380
这不就是你所想要的嘛？
lsn't that what you want?

424
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,500
我一直
With all of my heart and soul.

425
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,470
全心全意地相信
I always believed that

426
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:37,670
我会找到这本书的归属 找到需要它的地方
I'd find a place where this book belonged, where it was needed.

427
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,430
但我至今还未找到那个地方
But I haven't found it yet.

428
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:57,480
我喜欢这家伙
我喜欢这家伙
I love this guy.

429
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,370
杀了他 拜托
Shoot him, please.

430
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,700
你们还站着干什么？
What are you standing around for?

431
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,730
干掉他！见鬼！干掉他！
Take him out, God damn it! Take him out!

432
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,300
我不喜欢被跟踪
I don't like being followed.

433
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,770
我想和你一起走！
I wanna come with you!

434
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,470
不行
No, you don't.

435
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,530
我讨厌这里
I hate it here.

436
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,270
- 那就改变它 - 我妈妈觉得我和你一起会比较安全
-Then change it. -My mother thinks I'll be safer with you.

437
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:57,580
我会带你去我们打水的地方
I'll take you to where we get our water.

438
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,250
你能带多少就可以带多少
You can have all that you can carry.

439
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:11,680
我是说 我们能带多少就带多少
I mean, all that we can carry.

440
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,270
卡耐基知道 北边还有两处泉水
Carnegie knows about two more springs up north.

441
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,810
他说他还要建更多的城镇
He says he's gonna build more towns.

442
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,310
他是怎么知道这处泉水的？
How'd he know about this one?

443
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:29,550
他年轻的时候在这儿待过
He'd been here when he was young.

444
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,490
在从前的世界
In the world before.

445
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:37,040
我猜 其他知道这地方的人都已经死了
I guess everyone else who knew about it died.

446
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:41,560
咱们真的最好快点
We really better hurry.

447
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:49,910
我想我把眼镜忘在里面了 去帮我看一下 我在这儿放哨
I think I left my glasses inside. Just take a look for me. I'll look out here.

448
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:51,010
好
Okay.

449
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,380
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

450
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,090
你这个大骗子！
You are such a liar!

451
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:09,090
我没骗你
I'm not a liar.

452
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:11,990
你说要是找到水 我就可以跟你一起走！
You said I could come with you if you got your water!

453
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,500
我可没说 是你说的
I didn't say that. You said that.

454
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:17,490
再说了 大路也不适合你
Besides, the road's no place for you.

455
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,240
那比你想象得糟多了
It's much worse than you think.

456
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:23,700
再见了 索拉拉 认识你真好 我说真的
Goodbye, Solara. It's nice knowing you, I mean that.

457
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,940
- 嘿 - 什么？
-Hey. -Yeah?

458
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:28,050
去你妈的！
Fuck you!

459
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,560
你洗过你他妈的脏手了吗？
Have you washed your filthy fucking hands?

460
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:48,360
洗了两次 用你的肥皂
Twice. With your soap.

461
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:54,900
集结一队人 我们要跟踪他
Put a crew together. We're going after him.

462
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:56,440
就为了本破书
For a fucking book.

463
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:59,040
那不是本破书！
It's not a fucking book!

464
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,640
是武器！
It's a weapon!

465
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:07,790
可以击溃 脆弱与绝望之人的理智与情感的武器！
A weapon aimed right at the hearts and minds of the weak and the desperate!

466
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:10,210
它能让我们控制他们！
It will give us control of them!

467
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:17,180
如果我们不想偏安一隅 就要得到它！
If we wanna rule more than one small fucking town, we have to have it!

468
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:21,420
人们会从四面八方赶来 对我唯命是从
People will come from all over, they'll do exactly what I tell them

469
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,990
只要我的话是从那本书里找到的
if the words are from the book.

470
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:33,500
这事情从前就发生过 并且将再次发生
It's happened before, and it'll happen again.

471
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:35,490
那本书就是我们需要的全部
All we need is that book.

472
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,920
那我要索拉拉
Then I want Solara.

473
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,160
你是在跟我讨价还价吗？
Are you bargaining with me?

474
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:03,270
我们是在做交易吗？
Is this a deal we're making here?

475
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,400
我们失掉了很多人
We lost a lot of men.

476
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:10,060
你比以往更需要我
You need me more than ever.

477
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:15,210
现在 你说那本书值得大费周章 那我相信你
Now, you say that book's worth the trouble. Well, I believe you,

478
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,660
但是作为交换 我要索拉拉
but I want Solara for it.

479
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,300
为何不？为何不？
Why not? Why not?

480
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:39,070
咱们从这破地方出去吧
Let's get the fuck out of here.

481
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:46,920
待在路上 这与你无关
Stay on the path. It's not your concern. Stay on the path. It's not your concern.

482
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:15,080
我们要去哪儿？
Which way are we headed?

483
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:16,840
西方
West.

484
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,480
喂？
Hello?

485
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,680
有人能帮我吗？
Can anyone help me?

486
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:04,460
喂？有人在吗？
Hello? Is anybody there?

487
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:15,610
你还好吧？
Are you okay?

488
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,610
是的 我很好 你去吧 我会没事的
Yes. I'm fine. You go along. I'll be okay.

489
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:26,950
- 不 不 来吧 我来帮你 - 不了 真的不用 拜托了 我没事
-No, no, here, let me just help you. -No, really, please. I'm fine. Really.

490
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:31,370
我需要男人来帮我 不是你 你走吧
I need a man to help, not you. You just go along.

491
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,480
- 没关系的 一分钟就好 - 不要！没事的 拜托了
-It's okay, it'll just take a minute. -No! It's fine. Please.

492
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:03,360
救命！救命！
Help! Help!

493
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,000
放开我！
Get off me!

494
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:01,090
谢谢！
Thank you!

495
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:21,670
在那儿
Over there.

496
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:31,640
怎么了？
What's wrong?

497
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,180
你听到了吗？
You hear that?

498
01:03:35,470 --> 01:03:36,810
听到什么？
Hear what?

499
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:43,360
别动 别动
Don't move. Don't move.

500
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:01,290
来 把弓弦解下来
Here. Take the wire off of that.

501
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,420
绕起来
Spool it up.

502
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,920
- 这是干什么？ - 晚餐
-What is that? -Dinner.

503
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:29,280
就好像他是被什么保护着
It's like he's protected somehow,

504
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,110
就好像没有什么能触碰到他
like there's nothing that can touch him.

505
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:37,030
他妈的他只是个凡人罢了
He's just a fucking man.

506
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:42,370
你给他一枪 他会像其他人一样倒下
You put a bullet in him, he'll go down like any other.

507
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,960
还是温的
Still warm.

508
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:54,720
死了才不过几小时
No more than a few hours dead.

509
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:00,020
他走不远
He can't be far.

510
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,110
狗娘养的！
Son of a bitch!

511
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:13,740
索拉拉
Solara.

512
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,580
你确定还想要她吗？
Are you sure you still want her?

513
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:26,710
天快黑了 咱们不能晚上跟踪他们 会被发现的
It's gonna be dark soon. We can't track them at night, they'll see us coming.

514
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:30,090
我们可能会超过他们而自己还不知道
We could drive right past them and never know it.

515
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,260
他是对的
He's right.

516
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:35,590
他们靠步行 会累的 他们需要睡眠
They're on foot, tired. They'll have to sleep.

517
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:42,850
咱们明天把路程补回来 中午前就能赶上他们
We'll make up the ground tomorrow. We'll have them before morning's out.

518
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:46,440
最好是这样
That better be a guarantee.

519
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:06,670
你真的每天都读同一本书吗？
Do you really read the same book every day?

520
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:08,210
从不间断
Without fail.

521
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:14,090
你能读点给我听吗？
Will you read some to me?

522
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,010
求你了
Please?

523
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,560
主是我的牧人
"The Lord is my shepherd.

524
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,230
我不可失去他
"I shall not want.

525
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:34,320
他让我躺在绿色的草地上
"He makes me to lie down in green pastures.

526
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,240
将我引到安静的水源边
"Leads me beside the still waters.

527
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:41,030
他拯救我的灵魂
"He restores my soul.

528
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:47,370
他以自己的名义 引我走上正义之路
"He leadeth me in the path of righteousness, for his name's sake.

529
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:54,920
是的 即使我走过死亡的阴影与深谷
"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death

530
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:59,180
“我不惧怕邪恶 因你与我同在”
"I will fear no evil, for thou art with me."

531
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,100
- 真美 - 你喜欢？
-That's beautiful. -You like that?

532
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:06,230
- 你写的？ - 是啊 我写的
-Did you write that? -Yes, I did.

533
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:08,270
真的
Really?

534
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:10,980
不 不 不是
No, no. No.

535
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:16,360
不 在你我之前很久它就存在了 这点是肯定的
No, that was around a long time before you and I got here, that's for sure.

536
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:25,490
你说它不是普通的书 这是什么意思？
What did you mean when you said it's not just any book?

537
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,260
它是唯一的一本
It's the only one.

538
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:40,800
真的？
Really?

539
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,350
战争之后 未在战火中被毁的
After the war, people made it their business

540
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:47,220
也被人们找到并被销毁
to find and destroy any that the fires didn't get already.

541
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:51,480
有人说战争本就是因此而起
Some people said this was the reason for the war in the first place.

542
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,650
不管怎么说 这是唯一幸存的一本了
Anyway, it's the only one that survived.

543
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,820
你又是怎么得到它的？
How'd you get it?

544
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:08,370
据说
They said that the war

545
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:12,290
战争在天上扯开一个洞 你可能听过这类故事
tore a hole in the sky, you've probably heard the stories.

546
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,500
是的
Yeah.

547
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:17,050
天被扯出了一个洞 太阳就下来了
Tore a hole in the sky, sun came down

548
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:20,090
烧毁了一切
and burned everything.

549
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:22,550
一切物 一切人
Everything and everybody.

550
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:27,560
你很幸运 躲在了这种地方 或是地下
You were lucky to hole up and hide in a place like this or underground.

551
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:32,310
但大多数人并不幸运
Most people weren't lucky.

552
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,820
于是 一年之后 我们开始从躲藏的地方出来
So, a year later, we started coming out,

553
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:40,570
人们四处游荡
and people wandered around.

554
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:46,530
我不知道自己要做什么 我想找个方法活下去
I, not knowing what I was gonna do, trying to find a place to survive.

555
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:50,540
一天 我听见一个声音
One day, I heard a voice.

556
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:54,790
很难解释 但那就好像
It's hard to explain, but it was like it...

557
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:57,750
就好像是从我内心发出的声音
Like it was coming from inside of me.

558
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:02,880
但我能清楚地听到它 和我现在听你说话一样清楚
But I could hear it as clear as I can hear you talking to me now.

559
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:05,390
那个声音怎么说？
What did this voice say?

560
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:07,260
它指引我去了一个地方
It led me

561
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:10,720
在那里我找到了这本书
to a place where I found the book

562
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,270
它被埋在瓦砾之下
buried under some rubble.

563
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:21,030
那个声音告诉我 把书带到西方去
The voice told me to carry the book out west.

564
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:26,160
它告诉我 前方的路会成为我的指引
Told me that a path would be laid out for me,

565
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:30,830
我会被指引到一个地方 使这本书安全的地方
that I'd be led to a place where the book was safe.

566
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:36,750
它告诉我 我会被护佑
Told me that I'd be protected

567
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:41,340
任何人任何事 都无法挡住我的去路
against anyone or anything that stood in my path.

568
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:46,930
自那以后我就一直沿着指引前进
I've been walking ever since.

569
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:52,270
你这么做 就因为脑袋里有一个声音让你这样？
And you did all that because a voice in your head told you to?

570
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:54,430
是的
Yes, I did.

571
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:57,060
我清楚当时我听到了什么
I know what I heard.

572
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,230
我也清楚现在我所听到的
I know what I hear.

573
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:01,570
我知道自己没疯
I know I'm not crazy.

574
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:05,450
我也知道 没有它的护佑 我永远不会成功
And I know I would've never made it without help.

575
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:09,320
- 那是什么？ - 这个问题不能回答
-What's that? -One question too many.

576
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:12,910
睡觉吧 明天一早就要出发
Go to bed, we got an early start in the morning.

577
01:10:50,580 --> 01:11:04,800
嘿
嘿
Hey.

578
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:16,930
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

579
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:19,810
- 对不起 我以为你睡着了 - 我没睡着
-I'm sorry, I thought you were sleeping. -I wasn't sleeping.

580
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:21,650
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

581
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:23,820
我只想看一眼那本书
I just wanted to see the book.

582
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:26,860
除了我没人能碰它 你明白吗？
Nobody touches it but me, you understand me?

583
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:29,070
你懂我的意思吗？
Do you understand me?

584
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,870
- 是的 我明白了 - 那就好 睡觉去
-Yes, I understand. -Good. Go to sleep.

585
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:44,750
反正你也说了自己不识字 你看了也没用
You said you don't know how to read anyway. It's no use to you.

586
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:45,920
是啊
Yeah.

587
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,380
所以你教我看
So teach me.

588
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:10,780
等等 等等 停下！
Hold up. Hold up! Stop!

589
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:18,950
你说你已经走了３０年 对吧？
You know, you say you've been walking for 30 years, right?

590
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:20,250
对
Right.

591
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:22,370
你有没有想过自己可能是迷路了？
Have you ever thought that maybe you were lost?

592
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:23,580
没有
Nope.

593
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,000
可你怎么知道自己的方向是对的？
Well, how do you know that you're walking in the right direction?

594
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:28,550
“我们靠信念走 不是视力”
"We walk by faith, not by sight."

595
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:30,800
这是什么意思？
What does that mean?

596
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,510
意思是你知道它是正确的 尽管还没有被证明
It means that you know something, even if you don't know something.

597
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,680
这话根本说不通
That doesn't make any sense.

598
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,720
不需要说通 这是信仰
Doesn't have to make sense, it's faith. It's faith.

599
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:40,810
是黑暗平原上的光明之花
It's the flower of light in the field of darkness

600
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:43,350
它给我前行的力量 你明白吗？
that's giving me the strength to carry on. You understand?

601
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,690
那是你从书上看来的吗？
Is that from your book?

602
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:48,730
不是 是约翰尼・卡什在福尔松监狱的演唱会
No, it's Johnny Cash live at Folsom Prison.

603
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,530
什么？
What?

604
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:16,510
- 你觉得那儿有人住吗？ - 不知道
-Do you think anyone lives there? -I don't know.

605
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:19,970
或许会有水
Maybe there's water.

606
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:31,400
呆在我身后 （标牌：禁止擅闯）
Stay behind me.

607
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,120
这儿真奇怪
This is weird.

608
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,690
你们是谁？
Who are you?

609
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:21,200
我们只是旅者 我们无意伤人
We're travelers, that's all. Don't mean any harm.

610
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,120
不得擅闯！你们没看到牌子吗？
No trespassing! Haven't you read the sign?

611
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,460
我们很抱歉 我没看到牌子
We're very sorry. I didn't see it.

612
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,130
你想干什么？
What's your business?

613
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:30,290
- 我们只是 - 不想干什么！
-We were just... -No business!

614
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:34,800
只是 我们很抱歉 如果您允许 我们这就离开
Just... We're very sorry, and if you let us, we'll be on our way.

615
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:38,890
乔治 看看他们 其中一个只是个姑娘
George, look at them. One of them is just a girl.

616
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:42,890
是啊 老生常谈 我听过不下百遍
Yeah. It's an old story, I've heard it a hundred times before.

617
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:47,390
如今很少有人来拜访我们了 乔治对每个人都很多疑
We get so few visitors these days. George is suspicious of everybody.

618
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:51,400
我叫玛莎 想喝点茶吗？
I'm Martha. Would you care for some tea?

619
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:05,040
听听音乐？能让人放松的
How about some music? It's so soothing.

620
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:06,960
乔治！
George!

621
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:30,440
觉得怎样？很好听吧 请喝
How do you like it? It's nice. Please.

622
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:45,120
- 好喝吗？ - 好喝 好喝 真是 味道很浓
-Is that good? -Good, good. That's... Taste is rich.

623
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:53,540
你们单靠自己能活到现在真是不易
It's amazing that you two have survived out here all by yourselves.

624
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:56,880
是这样的 乔治是个能工巧匠
Well, now, George is something of a handyman.

625
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:02,550
他在这地方设了很多机关 好让这里更安全
He did a lot of work on this place, making it safe.

626
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:05,260
我们可能老了 但很顽强
We may be old, but we're resilient.

627
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:08,930
我们知道好些想霸占这里的人
We've known more than a few who've tried to take this place from us.

628
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:11,190
- 是吧 乔治？ - 是啊
-Haven't we, George? -Yes, we have.

629
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:13,900
- 是啊 - 我给你们看点东西 来吧
-Right. -I wanna show you something. Come on.

630
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:16,230
乔治 不！不是现在！
George, no! Not now!

631
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:18,490
来吧！
Come on!

632
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,370
- 这些是 - 坟墓？当然
-Are these... -Graves? Sure.

633
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:25,830
不把他们埋起来是很不文明的
Be uncivilized not to bury them.

634
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:28,330
再说了 埋起来对土质也好
Besides, it's good for the soil.

635
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:32,790
回到屋里来吧 我想我可以给你们做点三明治
Come on back inside. I think I might be able to rustle you up some sandwiches.

636
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,170
好 谢谢 非常感谢
Well, thank you, thank you very much.

637
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:36,800
- 我们该走了 - 他们杀了那些人
-We gotta go now. -They killed all these people.

638
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,460
不只是杀了 他们吃了那些人
They didn't just kill them, they ate them.

639
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:41,470
- 她的手 她的手在抖 - 人肉吃太多了 咱们走
-Her hands... Her hands were shaking. -Too much human meat. Let's go.

640
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:44,840
我找到了些肉 我想你们应该饿了
I found some meat. I hope you're hungry.

641
01:16:45,010 --> 01:16:46,550
不 不 谢谢
Nope. No, thank you.

642
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:49,430
那个 我们 我们该走了
Well, we... We gotta be going.

643
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,730
- 这么快？ - 是啊 恐怕是的
-So soon? -Yeah, I'm afraid so.

644
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:54,440
- 你确定你们不留下来吗？ - 我确定 非常确定
-Are you sure you won't stay? -I'm sure, I'm very sure.

645
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,310
把枪放下
Put the gun down.

646
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,280
索拉拉 你拿着这个 替我们开下门 谢谢
Solara, you take this. Open the door for us, please.

647
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,490
- 索拉拉 说谢谢你们的茶 - 谢谢你们的茶
-Solara, say thank you for the tea. -Thank you for the tea.

648
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:01,780
很谢谢你们的茶
Thank you so much for the tea.

649
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:11,290
回屋里去
Go back inside.

650
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:16,290
乔治 出什么事了？
George, what's wrong?

651
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:18,800
一大帮全副武装的恶徒 就是这么回事！
Whole company of armed degenerates, that's what's wrong!

652
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,420
是他们把那帮人引来的
And they led them straight to us.

653
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:23,840
- 我刚摆出些好瓷器 - 去你的瓷器吧！
-I just set out the good china. -Fuck the china!

654
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:25,140
你还有其他武器吗？
Have you got any more weapons?

655
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:27,930
武器？我给你看看武器
Weapons? I'll show you some weapons.

656
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:33,690
- 你会开枪吗？ - 当然
-Can you shoot a gun? -Of course.

657
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:36,860
快来！快！
Come on, come on!

658
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:39,150
我们知道你们在里面
We know you're in there!

659
01:17:40,230 --> 01:17:42,860
到外面来 没有人会受伤
Come on out and nobody needs to get hurt!

660
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:49,490
我会放你一马
I'll make it easy!

661
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:52,580
把索拉拉和书交出来！
Send out Solara with the book!

662
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,580
- 我们怎么办？ - 我知道自己在干什么！
-What are we gonna do? -I know what the fuck I'm doing!

663
01:17:55,670 --> 01:18:00,460
- 等等 - 我只要书和姑娘
-Wait, wait, wait. -That's all I want, the book and the girl!

664
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,130
他们不打算出来
They ain't coming out.

665
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:33,620
妈的！趴下！所有人都趴下！
Shit! Get down! Everybody, get down!

666
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:54,770
嘿！那个你听到的声音
Hey! You know that voice you heard?

667
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,810
有说过这件事情吗？
Did it say anything about this?

668
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:59,310
我们会活着出去的 你我都是！
We'll get out alive, both of us!

669
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:00,980
那我们呢？
What about us?

670
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:03,530
没提到你们
Didn't mention you!

671
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:16,200
停火！
停火！
Cease fire!

672
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,880
玛莎？玛莎？
Martha? Martha?

673
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:32,010
玛莎！玛莎！
Martha! Martha!

674
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:38,270
- 玛莎 - 从侧面进去！
-Martha. -Go in on the side! Over on the side!

675
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:39,810
你们这帮畜生！
You bastards!

676
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,610
- 房子侧面！ - 你们这群畜生！
-The side of the house! -You fucking bastards!

677
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:52,370
- 停火！ - 他们在干什么？
-Hold your fire! Hold your fire! -What are they doing?

678
01:19:52,450 --> 01:19:54,120
肯定不是什么好事
Nothing good.

679
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:09,690

- 都是我的错 - 不 不是你的错
-This. This is all my fault. -No, it's not.

719

No, it is. If I didn't come with you, none of this would've happened.

720
01:31:31,650 --> 01:31:33,400
不是你的错
It's not your fault.

721
01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:37,820
我做了自己必须做的
I did what I had to do.

722
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:41,370
我认为 任何事情都不能让你放弃那本书
I didn't think anything could make you give up that book.

723

All the years I've been carrying it and reading it every day.

725

我太着眼于保护它的安全
I got so caught up with keeping it safe,

726
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:59,720
却忘记了按照从中学到的去生活
I forgot to live by what I learned from it.

727
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:02,760
好吧 那是什么呢？
Yeah, and what's that?

728
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:04,930
只是
Just...

729
01:32:08,270 --> 01:32:11,400
奉献他人 多过关照自己
Do for others more than you do for yourself.

730
01:32:13,690 --> 01:32:16,320
不管怎么说 这就是我从中学到的
That's what I got from it, anyway.

731
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:04,450
你闻到什么了没有？

738
01:36:29,530 --> 01:36:31,610
你们来这儿干什么？
What's your business here?

739
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:34,660
我的名字叫艾利

我有一本英王钦定本圣经

别试图有什么动作 否则就开枪！
Don't attempt to make any sudden moves, or you will be fired upon!

743
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:04,440
小心点 小心
Be careful with it. Be careful.

744
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:12,860
小心点
Careful with it.

745
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:24,460
他们没有武器
They're clean.

746
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:28,590
我们做这件事已经很久了
We've been doing this for a long time now.

747
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:34,090
- 感觉像是博物馆 - 不 可不只是博物馆
-Feels like a museum. -No, it's much more than that.

这是我们将重新开始的地方

我们有一台印刷机 很快就可以投入使用
We've got a printing press. It'll be operational quite soon.

750
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:45,350

We're going to teach people about the world they lost.

751
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,650
帮助他们开始重建
Help them start to rebuild it.

752
01:37:47,730 --> 01:37:52,150
我是说 看吧 莎士比亚 大英百科全书 只差几卷不全
I mean, look. Shakespeare. Britannica, missing only a few volumes.

依旧完好如初
in still very pristine condition.

755
01:37:58,580 --> 01:38:01,290
但从来没有圣经 至少目前为止没有
But never a Bible. Well, not until now.

756
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:05,120
那么 我能问问它是什么样子吗？
Well, may I ask what condition it's in?

757
01:38:06,830 --> 01:38:08,290
很旧了
It's beat up,

758
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:11,130
不过还可以用
but it will do the job.

759
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:14,880
- 你觉得我能看看它吗？ - 是的 可以

你有什么东西可以写字吗？

767

不可能！
It's impossible!

768
01:39:23,290 --> 01:39:24,700
不可能！
It can't be!

769
01:39:27,870 --> 01:39:31,380
集中精神 写下来
Pay close attention and write down

770
01:39:33,170 --> 01:39:34,880
我说的每一句话
everything I say

771
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:39,010
每一个字
exactly as I say it.

在外面
Out there.

她的选择

我想带她回来 她拒绝
I tried to bring her back. She refused.

794
01:41:41,670 --> 01:41:44,090
她拒绝后 你对她做了什么？
What did you do when she refused?

795
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:52,600
- 念出来 - 你对我女儿做了什么？

太久了 我不记得了
It's been so long, I don't remember.

800
01:42:38,730 --> 01:42:41,570
- 你必须记得 - 必须？真的？
-You have to. -I have to? Really?

801
01:42:41,690 --> 01:42:44,240
不 不 你必须记得 求你了
No, no, no, no. You have to. Please.

802
01:42:47,910 --> 01:42:49,160
你的腿
Your leg.

803
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:52,490
已经不疼了
It doesn't hurt anymore.

804
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:55,750
我能闻到
I can smell it.

805
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:13,010
你处心积虑要找那本书
You worked so hard for that book.

806
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:17,270
你付出了那么多 那么多人的生命
You sacrificed so much, so many men.

807
01:43:19,730 --> 01:43:21,770
比你能承受的还多
More than you could spare.

808
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:27,780
如今 那些从前连你的名字都不敢提的人
Now all those people who were too scared to even say your name,

809
01:43:27,950 --> 01:43:32,120
他们就在楼下 捣毁你的酒吧 你知道吗？
they're downstairs, tearing up the bar right now. Did you know that?

810
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:35,330
而且没有人站出来阻止他们
And there's no one there to stop them.

811
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:38,460
而你却如此狂热
And you're feverish.

812
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:44,880
无法想象那种感觉 想要的东西近在咫尺
I can't imagine what it must feel like to have what you want so close

813
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:48,630
- 却又似乎相隔天涯 - 住口！
-and it might as well be a million miles away. -Stop it!

814
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:53,930
你要离开我吗？
Are you leaving me?

815
01:43:56,640 --> 01:44:01,690
克劳迪娅？
克劳迪娅？
Claudia?

816
01:44:05,150 --> 01:44:06,530
