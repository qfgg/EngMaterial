我年轻的时候  以为刷房子真就是刷房子
When I was young, I thought house painters painted houses.

39
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,710
我懂什么
What did I know?

40
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,340
我当时是个工人
I was a working guy.

41
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,710
南费城的卡车司机107号地方工会的工会代表
A business agent for Teamster Local 107 out of South Philly.

42
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,500
千百个工人中的一员
One of a thousand working stiffs...

43
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,800
直到我不再是了
until I wasn't no more.

44
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,840
然后
And then...

45
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,000
我开始刷房子
I started painting houses...

46
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,880
亲自
myself.

47
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,810
{\an8}他们女儿的婚礼
格蕾丝·安妮·巴法利诺
嫁给
罗伯特·里特

48
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,480
在这件事情上
In this particular matter,

49
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,710
一切都是围绕着婚礼的
the whole thing was built around the wedding.

50
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,090
比尔·巴法利诺的女儿在底特律结婚
Bill Bufalino's daughter was getting married in Detroit.

51
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,810
比尔是卡车司机工会的律师  但更重要的是
Bill was a Teamster lawyer, but more important,

52
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,880
他是罗素·巴法利诺的表亲
he was Russell Bufalino's cousin.

53
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,520
罗素不想坐飞机
Now, Russell didn't want to fly,

54
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,500
所以我打算开车送他去参加婚礼
so I was gonna drive him to the wedding.

55
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,730
他想顺路处理一些生意上的事情
He wanted to take care of some business along the way,

56
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,750
对罗素而言  这就意味着一件事
which in Russell's case meant only one thing:

57
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,310
钱  收钱
Money... collecting it.

58
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,750
所以我们开车去的
So we'd drive.

59
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,060
他和他老婆凯丽  以及我和我老婆艾琳
Him and his wife Carrie and me and my wife Irene.

60
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,130
我喊她琳妮
Or I call her Reenie.

61
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,750
我想着我们走费城外的476号公路
I figured we would take 476 out of Philly,

62
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,600
然后我们到匹兹顿接上罗素
and then we go up to Pittston and pick up Russ,

63
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,230
我们一般都是这么走的
which is usually how we did it,

64
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,350
然后沿80号州际公路西段开过宾州
and then Interstate 80 West through the rest of Pennsylvania,

65
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,340
然后我们横穿俄亥俄州到托莱多
and then we'd go across Ohio, all the way to Toledo,

66
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,800
接着我们沿着75号公路北上底特律
and then we would go 75 North to Detroit.

67
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,350
总共要花三天
It was gonna take about three days

68
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,690
算上所有谈生意以及抽烟的时间
with all the business breaks and cigarette stops,

69
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,630
因为罗素不允许任何人在车里面抽烟
since Russell didn't allow nobody to smoke in the car.

70
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,890
他说蓝眼睛吉米和迈尔·兰斯基
He says Jimmy Blue Eyes and Meyer Lansky

71
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,500
说服他戒了烟
convinced him to stop smoking

72
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,020
当时他们从自己在古巴的赌场里被赶了出去
when they were getting kicked out of their casinos in Cuba

73
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,920
还被卡斯特罗开枪打了
and getting shot at by Castro.

74
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,190
我也说不清楚  也许是那种
I don't know. It might have been one of those,

75
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,980
"上帝啊如果我活着度过这一劫
"Please-God-if-I-ever-get-out- of-this-fucking-thing-alive-

76
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,440
我就再也不抽烟了"的情况
I'll-never-smoke-again things too."

77
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,810
但我知道从卡斯特罗那件事开始
But I do know that from Castro on,

78
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,350
罗素就再也不许别人在车里抽烟了
Russ wouldn't allow nobody to smoke in his car,

79
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,670
就连凯丽也不行
not even Carrie.

80
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,850
{\an8}听说

81
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,300
{\an8}你

82
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,480
{\an8}刷房子

83
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,880
能尽快停车吗
Can we stop soon?

84
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,630
我们刚上车两分钟  亲爱的
We're only in the car two minutes, honey.

85
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,770
甚至还没上公路呢
We're not even near the highway.

86
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,750
我知道  罗素  但你不喜欢在公路上停车
I know, Russell. But you don't like to stop on the highway.

87
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,440
也不能这么说
Well, it's not that so much.

88
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,130
是他们不允许你在公路上停车
They don't let you stop on the highway.

89
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,420
好吧  那我们就在车里抽吧
Okay, so then we'll smoke in the car.

90
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,460
我的白内障怎么办
And what about my cataracts?

91
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,550
我会开窗的
I'll crack the window.

92
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,550
凯丽  我发过誓的  记得吗
Carrie, I made a vow. Remember?

93
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,250
记得我发过誓吗  凯丽
Remember I made a vow, Carrie?

94
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,170
好吧  这下我不能在...
Yeah, now I can't smoke on...

95
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,750
行吧  这下我不能抽烟了
All right, and now I can't smoke.

96
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,000
看见我们到哪了吗
See where we are?

97
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,090
那是...
Is... Is that...

98
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,000
太巧了吧
What are those odds?

99
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,350
{\an8}德士古石油

100
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,250
出什么问题了  小子
What's the problem, kid?

101
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,390
我不知道  感觉车坏了
I don't... I don't know. It sounds funny.

102
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,500
车停了  再启动  就没动力了
It stops, it starts, it loses power.

103
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,090
我看看能不能给你搭把手
Let me see if I can give you a hand.

104
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,710
我看看  检查一下这些塞子
Let me see. Check all these plugs.

105
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,090
火花塞没问题
Spark plugs are okay.

106
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,800
分电盘盖也没问题
The distributor cap's okay.

107
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:53,590
很好
Good.

108
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,710
一定是这个...出问题了
It's gotta be something with... with this.

109
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,960
定时链
Timing chain.

110
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,840
就是这么回事  这上面有个塞子
This is what this is. There's a cap on it.

111
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,000
这个塞子松了  不应该松的
This cap is loose. It ain't supposed to be loose.

112
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,640
所以这意味着它们已经老化了
So that means they're getting worn out.

113
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,670
你得...
You just gotta...

114
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,250
试试  拧紧它
Try that now. Tighten it up.

115
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,960
我会开车  但不会修车
I can drive 'em. I can't fix 'em.

116
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,050
你可以重新上路了  小子
You're back in business, kid.

117
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,420
谢了
Thanks.

118
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,390
-我怎么回报你呢  -不用
- I owe you anything? - No.

119
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,170
你不用回报我
No, you don't owe me anything.

120
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,600
谢了
Thanks.

121
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,880
-我叫弗兰克  -你好  弗兰克
- Frank. - Hey, Frank. How ya doing?

122
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,880
你叫什么
What's your name?

123
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,460
你是哪里人
Where you from?

124
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,520
-费城  -你是费城人啊
- Philly. - Oh, you're from Philly.

125
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,300
是的
Yeah.

126
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,750
在费城你一般去哪玩
Where you hang out there?

127
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,960
卡拉汉
Callahan's.

128
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,640
滚球俱乐部
Bocce Club.

129
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,670
但那是个酒吧  不是玩滚球的俱乐部
But it's a bar, it's not a bocce club.

130
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,020
是嘛  你玩滚球吗
Oh, yeah. You play bocce?

131
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,800
不玩
Nah.

132
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,190
好了  弗兰克  把那玩意修好
All right, Frankie... get that fixed.

133
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,020
因为它肯定还会掉链子的  我告诉你
Because it'll go again on you, I'm telling you.

134
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,690
-谢谢  -好了
- Thank you. - All right.

135
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:04,720
我会去修的  再次感谢
I will. Thanks again.

136
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,750
祝你好运  小兄弟
Good luck, buddy.

137
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,130
我以为他是加油站老板
I mean, I thought maybe he owned the gas station.

138
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,300
因为他一定是个老板  看得出来
'Cause he owned something, you could tell.

139
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,800
结果发现整条路都是他的
Yeah, it turns out he owned the whole road.

我是说...
I mean...

车不是我装的
I don't load the truck.

210

是装车的人装的车
The loaders are supposed to load the truck.

211
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,640
也许他们没干好自己的活儿  我不知道
Maybe they didn't do their work. I don't know.

212
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,140
你没意识到车变轻了吗
You didn't realize you were driving a light horse?

213
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,090
没有  我只是...
No. I just...

214
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,230
没意识到  感觉挺正常的
Nothing. It felt fine.

215

Oh, come on, Frank. Come on.

我说的是真的  我...
I'm telling you. I...

217
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,480
千真万确  我真不知道是怎么回事
God's truth. I just don't know what happened.

218
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,880
我不知道  也许是...
I don't know. Maybe some...

219
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,880
-车是空的  -我知道
- It's empty. - I know it is.

What am I gonna tell the boss?

224
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,350
我说了我真不知道是怎么回事
Well, I'm telling you that I don't know what's going on.

225
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,190
别问我  因为我...
Just don't look at me 'cause I, you know...

226
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,480
那我还能去问谁
Well, who else can I look at?

227
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,100
这件事可不能怪在我头上  弗兰克
This is not gonna be on me, Frank.

228
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,230
-我都说了  -也怪不到我头上
- I'm telling you right now. - Not gonna be on me,

229
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,640
我只是开车的  别的什么都没干
I just drive the truck. That's all I do.

230
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,440
好吧  弗兰克·希兰  是叫这个吗
Okay, Frank Sheeran. Am I saying that right?

Under the contract, thanks to Jimmy Hoffa...

234

管理层只能在有非常具体的指控时才能开除司机
management can only fire a driver on very specific charges.

235
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,880
-你上班迟到过吗  -没有
- So, you ever show up late? - No.

236
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,730
-有任何交通违规吗  -没有
- Do you have any moving violations? - No.

237
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,520
-你在工作期间喝酒吗  -不喝
- Do you drink on the job? - No.

238
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,750
你打过人吗
You ever hit anybody?

239
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,640
-在工作期间吗  -对

-那没有  -好的
- No. - Okay.

241
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,800
偷窃不算吗
What about stealing, that ain't grounds?

242
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,300
这个嘛
Well...

243
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,210
他们能证明吗
can they prove it?

244
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,350
应该不能
I don't think so.

245
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,340
那就没什么好担心的了
All right then, we don't have nothing to worry about.

246
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,670
如果他们能证明
If they can prove it,

247
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,670
他们也只是想让你供出其他同伙的名字
they're just gonna want names from you. Accomplices.

248
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,920
仅此而已  你交代几个名字就能回家了
That's all. You give them a couple of names, you go home.

249
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,500
还能保住你的工作
Keep your job.

250
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,600
你觉得怎么样
What do you think about that?

251
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,590
-你会交代名字吗  -不
- Would you give them names? - No.

252
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,090
没有名字
No names.

253
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,750
你知道吧  我并不...
You know, I don't, uh...

254
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,800
我并不关心你到底做没做
I don't care whether you did it or not.

255
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,600
对我来说没有区别
That makes no difference to me.

256
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,270
-我知道  -我是来帮你辩护的  对吧
- Yeah, I know. - I'm here to defend you. Right?

257
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,250
对
Right.

258
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,770
怎么  你想知道我到底做没做吗
What, you want to know if I did it or not?

259
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,550
这个嘛
Well...

260
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,350
不管怎样我都会替你辩护
I'm gonna defend you either way.

261
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,710
我知道  只是...
Yeah, all right, but...

262
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,670
我没偷他们东西时可是勤勤恳恳工作的
I, I work hard for them when I ain't stealing from 'em.

263
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,730
法官大人  如果这是是非对错的问题
Your Honor, if this was about right or wrong,

264
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,310
公司应该早就开除希兰先生了
the company would have sought Mr. Sheeran's dismissal.

265
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,500
可他们没有
They didn't.

266
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,310
他们指控希兰先生
They only accused Mr. Sheeran

267
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,810
只是因为公司希望他能指认同伙
because the company hoped he could name conspirators,

268
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,880
而他没法指认  因为并不存在什么同伙
which he couldn't do because they don't exist.

269
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,810
不存在同伙是因为他并没有偷东西
They don't exist because he didn't steal anything.

270
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,480
他没偷东西是因为他是个模范员工
He didn't steal anything because he's an exemplary employee,

271
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,050
工作八年都没请过一天病假
who in eight years has never taken a day of sick leave.

272
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,560
他唯一违反过的只有他自己工会的规矩
The only rule he ever broke is his own union's,

273
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,850
在冷死人的大冬天  帮其他人把半扇半扇的牛肉
by helping others carry sides of beef from his truck

274
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,920
从他的卡车上搬进他们的冷藏库里
to their refrigerators in the dead of winter.

275
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,500
全体起立
All rise.

276
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,840
现在开庭
Court is in session.

277
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,190
我要驳回此案并给予警告
I'm dismissing this case with a warning.

278
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,190
好的  法官大人
Yes, Your Honor.

279
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,960
不  不是警告你  希兰先生
No, no, not you, Mr. Sheeran.

280
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,640
你们下次要是再把工人告上法庭
You bring another working man before this court

281
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,350
没有证据而只有威胁
with threats instead of evidence,

282
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,020
相信我  你们会后悔的
believe me, you'll be sorry.

283
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,210
要是我持有这家公司的股份  我一定赶紧卖了
If I owned stock in this company, I would sell it.

284
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,140
我不知道他怎么做到的  我也不会问
I don't know how he did it, and I ain't gonna ask.

285
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,190
我只知道比尔·巴法利诺帮我摆脱了一件
All I know is that Bill Bufalino got me out of

286
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,140
我原本绝无可能脱身的案子
a case where I should never have gotten away with it.

287
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,340
{\an8}罗马别墅餐厅酒吧

288
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,640
我本该彻底败诉的
I should've been down for the count.

289
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,920
人们会感谢你今天的所作所为  弗兰克
People are gonna appreciate what you did today, Frank.

290
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,210
他们有家人  有孩子
You know, they got families, they got kids.

291
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,500
他们需要这些工作
They need those jobs.

292
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,270
然而  我们却在外庆祝
Instead, we went out celebrating...

293
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:37,980
罗素
Russell!

294
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,500
而我则就此走上了
...and I met what was gonna turn out to be

295
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,600
余生的道路
the rest of my life.

296
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,810
我就觉得刚进来的人是你
You know, I thought that was you walking in outside.

297
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,640
当然了  这可是我们的地盘
Yeah, yeah, you know, this is our place.

298
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,020
我给你介绍个叫弗兰克的新人吧
Can I introduce you to this new guy Frank?

299
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,380
当然  好的
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

300
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,980
弗兰克  来见见我的表兄罗素·巴法利诺
Frank, I want you to meet my cousin Russell Bufalino.

301
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,600
-你好啊  -你好  幸会
- How are ya? - Hi, nice to meet you.

302
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,850
几个月前你帮我修过我的卡车
You helped me with my truck a couple of months ago.

303
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,190
没错  想起来了  定时链坏了
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right. The timing chain.

304
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,690
-对  -你找人修了吗
- Yeah. - Did you get it fixed?

305
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,850
-我第二天就找人修了  -好样的
- I fixed it the next day, yeah. - Attaboy.

306
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,750
-再次感谢你  -不客气
- Thanks again. - Oh, you're welcome.

307
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,920
我的荣幸  你修好了就好
My pleasure. I'm glad you fixed it.

308
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,100
你最好注意点
You better watch.

309
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,550
这里有很多不好惹的家伙  他跟你说了吗
There's a lot of tough guys around here. Did he tell ya?

310
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,390
你并不怕不好惹的家伙  是吧
You're not afraid of tough guys, are ya?

311
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,130
对
No.

312
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,440
我想也是  回见
I didn't think so. I'll see you around.

313
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,050
-好的  -谢了  罗素
- Okay. - Thanks, Russell.

314
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,710
你表兄之前帮了我大忙
Your cousin saved my ass.

315
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,560
不然我可能会损失一整车的货
I could've lost the whole load.

316
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,310
是啊  他非常了解卡车
Yeah, yeah. Well, he knows everything about trucks, really.

317
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,140
他在汽水公司干过很长时间
Yeah, he worked at Canada Dry for a long time.

318
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,190
-维托  你好吗  -幸会
- Vito, how are you? - Pleasure.

319
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,230
我们去坐卡座吧
I think, uh... Let's take the booth.

320
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,640
来吧  你会喜欢这里的
Come on. You're gonna love this.

321
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:38,550
也许我当时还不知道罗素·巴法利诺是谁
Maybe I didn't know who Russell Bufalino was back then,

322
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,690
但我在报纸上看过无数照片和报道
but I'd seen enough pictures and stories in the newspapers

323
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,980
足以知道当时跟他一起吃饭的是安吉洛·布鲁诺
to know he was eatin' with Angelo Bruno.

324
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,480
布鲁诺当时刚成为
I mean, Bruno, he... he was just made

325
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,440
费城的新任老大
the new boss of Philadelphia.

326
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,560
从费城到大西洋城的一切都由他负责
He took care of everything from Philadelphia to Atlantic City.

327
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,590
这点我是知道的
That, I knew.

328
00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:00,180
{\an8}安吉洛·布鲁诺
1980年在自家门外的自家车里
头部中枪而亡

329
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,920
而我当时只需知道这些
And that was all I had to know

330
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,890
就能知道罗素·巴法利诺
to know that Russell Bufalino

331
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,710
绝不是汽水公司的卡车维修工
was no truck mechanic from Canada Dry.

332
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,420
这面包真棒
This bread is very good.

333
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,210
-好吃吧  -好吃
- Good, eh? - Yeah.

334
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,170
你这样的爱尔兰人是在哪学的意大利语
Where did an Irisher like you learn to speak Italian?

335
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,300
在意大利  二战的时候
In Italy - the war.

336
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,800
意大利哪里
Where?

337
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,630
萨莱诺
Salerno.

338
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,000
安齐奥
Anzio.

339
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,340
西西里岛
Sicily...

340
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,560
卡塔尼亚附近
around Catania.

341
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,500
卡塔尼亚  我就是卡塔尼亚人
Catania? I'm from Catania.

342
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,630
是吗  我就觉得你有点卡塔尼亚口音
Yeah? I thought you had an accent like Catania.

343
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,800
你参战了多久
How long were you in the war?

344
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,710
四年
Four years.

345
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,420
411天在战场上
411 days in combat...

346
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,000
122天在安齐奥
122 at Anzio.

347
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,090
45步兵团的
Forty-fifth Infantry.

348
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,800
我的天
Minchia.

349
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,620
-是啊  -天啊
- Yeah. - Minchia.

350
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,330
对的
Yeah.

351
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,170
你当时怕死吗
Were you afraid of dying?

352
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,170
一直很怕
Always afraid.

353
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,020
要是有人说他不怕可千万别信
And don't let anybody tell you that they weren't afraid.

354
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,310
-那纯属胡扯  知道吗  -是啊
- That's a lot of bullshit. You know? - Yeah.

355
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,670
人人都很害怕  而且会经常祈祷
Everybody's afraid. And you pray a lot.

356
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,460
我就经常祈祷
I prayed a lot.

357
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,440
我祈祷说  要是能活着离开
I prayed that I'd never sin again as long as I live

358
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,090
我这辈子一定再也不沾染罪恶
if I could just get out of here.

359
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,850
但紧接着战斗就开始了
But then the fighting starts

360
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,310
你就把一切都忘了
and then you forget about everything.

361
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,420
你只想活下来  保住小命
You're just trying to survive, stay alive.

362
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:36,250
当我明白自己撑过了战争时
Once I saw that I was getting through the war,

363
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,420
我看了看自己的周围  说...
I looked around me, I said...

364
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,800
我说  "从现在起  一切顺其自然"
I said, "From now on, whatever happens, happens."

365
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,880
听天由命  去他的
Che successe successe. Fuck it.

366
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,480
你懂的  你接到命令就得奉命行事
You know, you got orders, you follow them.

367
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,690
他们让你带几个俘虏去树林里
They tell you to bring some prisoners into... into the woods,

368
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,880
他们并不会告诉你该怎么做
you know, and they don't tell you what to do...

369
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,170
他们只说  "动作快点"
But they just say, you know, "Hurry up."

370
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,520
说来疯狂  但我一直不能理解
It's crazy, but I never understood

371
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,920
他们怎么会乖乖听话
how they would just keep digging

372
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,810
挖自己的坟墓
their own graves, you know. I mean...

373
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,800
停
Stop!

374
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,550
上来
Raus!

375
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,210
可能他们觉得如果干得好
Well, I mean, maybe they thought if they did a good job,

376
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,710
那个拿枪的人
the guy with the gun

377
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,550
就会改变主意
would change his mind.

378
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,670
罗素  他立刻就对我有了好感
Russell, he... he took a shine to me right away.

379
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,000
不久之后
After a while,

380
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,300
他就开始给我分派些小任务了
he started giving me little things to do.

381
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,520
不过那时候  安吉洛本人
But then Angelo himself,

382
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,130
也开始交给我一些小任务了
he started giving me little things to do too.

383
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,690
罗素的老婆  凯丽
Russ's wife, Carrie,

384
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,350
她的家族很久很久以前
her family goes all the way back, way, way back

385
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,210
在西西里岛跟巴法利诺家族是一个镇上的
to the same town in Sicily as the Bufalinos.

386
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,340
他们总会谈论这事
They talked about it all the time.

387
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,250
她来自黑帮中的皇室  可以这么说
She came from mob royalty, if you want to call it that.

388
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,940
{\an8}希安德拉家族

389
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,230
希安德拉家族  对他们来说  就好像他们是早期
The Sciandras. To them, it was like they came over on the...

390
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,840
乘坐意大利五月花号来到美国的
the Italian Mayflower.

391
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,870
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}五月花号是英国移民驶往北美的
一艘最为著名的船只

392
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,050
你上楼去吧  清洗一下
Why don't you go upstairs, wash up.

393
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,460
衣服给我  我去处理
Give me those clothes. I'll get rid of them.

394
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,130
别忘了脱鞋  罗素
Don't forget your shoes, Russell.

395
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,590
弗兰克
Hey, Frank,

396
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,750
能尽快停车吗
can we stop soon?

397
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,920
问问你老公吧  罗素
Yeah, yeah, well, ask your husband. Russell?

398
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,550
他都睡死了
He's out cold.

399
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,770
不用  我能行
No, no, I got it.

400
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,000
-能行吗  -行
- Sure? - Yeah.

401
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,300
我们到哪了
Where are we?

402
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,960
快到路易斯堡了
We're close to Lewisburg.

403
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,890
到了告诉我  提醒我一下
Let me know when we get there. Remind me.

404
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,210
-我有几个地方要去  -好的
- I got some stops to make. - Okay.

405
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,710
罗素的生意无所不包
Russell had a piece of everything.

406
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,140
他在皮茨顿有家店叫佩恩布帘店
He had this store in Pittston called Penn Drape & Curtains.

407
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,800
他在那里经营着一切生意
And he ran everything out of there.

408
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,550
谁知道都有些什么
Who knew what it all was?

409
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,520
他肯定有合伙人
I mean, I'm sure the man had partners.

410
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,050
这种人总是有合伙人的
They always have partners.

411
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,000
没人能独占所有钱财
Nobody keeps all the money.

412
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,130
但人人都听罗素的  这点我能确定
But everybody listened to Russ. That I can tell you.

413
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:19,960
你想贿赂一个法官  先问问罗素
You wanted to bribe a judge, you asked Russell.

414
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,310
你不知道该贿赂法官多少钱
You didn't know how much to bribe him,

415

罗素会告诉你

416
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,800
好  行  我马上就去
All right, all right. I'll be right there.

你想提拔一个手下

帮我个忙

422

在那边逗留一会
And just hang around for a while.

423
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,100
有几个家伙一直来找麻烦  摆平他们
These guys keep coming around, so straighten them out.

424
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,600

你想让某人消失

429
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,560
你得争得罗素的同意

430
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,170
没有第二条路
You know, no two ways about it.

而当你为罗素办事时
And when you did something for Russ,

437
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,000
你得亲力亲为
you did it yourself.

438
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,920
正如罗素常说的
Like Russ used to say...

439
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,480
我让人替我去处理事情的时候
When I ask somebody to take care of something for me,

440
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,890
我希望他们能亲自处理

441

安纳斯塔夏在理发店被杀时
When Anastasia got killed in the barbershop,

445
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,440
罗素被请出来安定人心
it was Russell they brought in to calm things down,

446
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,190
好让大家不要大开杀戒
so that everybody wasn't just going around killing everybody

447
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,920
并把事情摆平

我们知道出了什么事

光看外表你永远猜不到他的身份
You'd never know it by looking at this guy,

452
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,000

549
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,920
这个会赚钱的好悄悄话
The good one who knew how to make money.

550
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,420
我把借钱借给了一家店
I got this place I front money to.

551
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,840
这家店生意很好  真的很好
It's a good business. Really good business.

552
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,800
是一家洗衣店
It's a laundry.

553
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,310
他们的业务是从大西洋城的
What they do is, they collect the linen, towels,

554
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,410
各种大小酒店饭店
sheets and everything from

555
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,990
收布制品  毛巾床单之类的
all the hotels and restaurants in Atlantic City.

556
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,450
清洗并熨烫
They wash it, they iron it.

557
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:31,770
正常情况下  赚钱就跟印钞一样容易
Normally, it's like a license to print fucking money.

558
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,340
但最近情况有变
Until recently.

559
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,920
特拉华出现了一家公司
There's this other company that opened up down in Delaware.

560
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,930
他们想把我们挤走
They're trying to put us out of business.

561
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,150
{\an8}典范布品

562
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,630
他们降价  恐吓我们的司机
They're cutting their prices. They're scaring our drivers.

563
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,010
抢我们的客户
They're trying to take our customers from us.

564
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,530
说实话  我有点担忧
To tell you the truth, I'm a little concerned.

565
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,800
别人说他们有点担心
Whenever anybody says they're a little concerned,

566
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,300
说明他们特别担心
they're very concerned.

567
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,690
其实
As a matter of fact,

568
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,480
我担心得不止一点
I'm really more than a little concerned.

569
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,330
他们说自己不止是一点点担心
And when they say they're more than a little concerned,

570
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:01,980
说明他们已经绝望了
they're desperate.

571
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,180
我想把他们的公司炸了
I want this fucking place bombed,

572
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,740
烧了  焚了  你怎么整都行
burnt, torched, whatever the fuck you have to do.

573
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,850
你打过仗  你知道该怎么办
You were in the war. You know what to do.

574
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,630
你们怎么对柏林就怎么对那地方
Leave that fucking place like you left Berlin.

575
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,230
把那里夷为平地
Burnt to the fucking ground.

576
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,360
我要让他们倒闭
I want them out of fucking business.

577
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,760
他们是谁
Who... who are they?

578
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,140
特拉华的典范布品服务公司
It's the Cadillac Linen Service in Delaware.

579
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,650
一群犹太人开的
It's run by a bunch of Jews.

580
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,540
让他们拿他们的保险赔偿
Let them collect their insurance,

581
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,240
他们肯定投了不少保险
which I'm sure they have plenty,

582
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,520
然后滚出这里
and leave this fucking other place alone,

583
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,040
别碰我的地盘
the one I'm involved in.

584
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,560
-这可不是一万  -这里有两千
- This ain't ten grand. - It's two grand.

585
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,840
你让那些该死的犹太洗衣妇失业之后
When you put these Jew fucking washerwomen out of business,

586
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,480
我就把剩下的钱给你
then you get the rest of your money.

587
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,900
我之所以现在手头有点紧
The reason I'm a little short on the money right now,

588
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,060
是因为我不想找瘦子
I don't wanna go to Skinny,

589
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,640
我不想找那些放高利贷的
I don't wanna ask anybody when they're gonna charge me a vig,

590
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,490
因为那样我就得还一辈子债
and I'm gonna be paying them forever.

591
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,400
我要从别的地方弄钱
I'm getting the money somewhere else.

592
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,500
别人不必知道
And nobody has to know.

593
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,670
特别是瘦子
Especially not Skinny

594
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,730
因为我不找他借钱
because I'm not getting the money from him.

595
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,290
你看起来有点犹豫
And I see you look a little hesitant.

596
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,430
相信我  我知道你的能耐
Believe me, I know what you can do.

597
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,170
要是我少付了你的钱
If I stiff you on the money,

598
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,570
你肯定会让我没有好下场
you're gonna do something terrible to me.

599
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,090
我不想要那样
I do not want that.

600
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,670
我中彩票了
I hit the number.

601
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,590
奖金大概有一千五
It's about 1,500.

602
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,340
我几个小时后回来
I'll see you in a few hours.

603
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,970
{\an8}典范布品

604
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,690
{\an8}典范布品

605
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,200
{\an8}炸药

606
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,180
弗兰克
Frank.

607
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,090
安吉洛想见你
Angelo wants to see you.

608
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,190
-现在吗  -对  就现在
- Now? - Yeah, now is good.

609
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,030
什么事
What's it about?

610
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,730
我不知道  来吧  我开车送你
I don't know. Come on. I'll drive you.

611
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,500
{\an8}抱歉  打烊了

612
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,400
坐吧  弗兰克
Sit down, Frank.

613
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,360
你去特拉华做什么
What're you doing in Delaware?

614
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,840
炸一家洗衣店
Bombing out a laundry place.

615
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:26,150
我就是赚点外快
I was just doing a job to make some extra money.

616
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,790
让那家店没法经营
Putting this place out of action.

617
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:34,310
让那家店倒闭
Putting this... putting this place out of commission.

618
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,250
谁让你干的
For who?

619
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,430
现在可不是保持沉默的时候
Now is not the time to not say.

620
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,620
悄悄话
Whispers.

621
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,260
另一个悄悄话
The other Whispers.

622
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,090
你知道典范布品服务公司的老板是谁吗
You know who owns the Cadillac Linen Service?

623
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,220
做洗衣行业的犹太人
Some Jews in the laundry business.

624
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,030
-雇主是这么说的  -他们只占部分股份
- That's what they told me. - They own a part of it.

625
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,070
还有人是老板
Somebody else got an interest in that.

626
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,440
-你知道是谁吗  -不
- You know who? - No.

627
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,280
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}也可以理解为"是我"

628
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,280
我知道
I do.

629
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,730
-是谁  -不  是我
- Who? - No. I do.

630
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,320
其他的股份是我的
I own the other part.

631
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,770
而不是我认识持有剩余股份的人
Not I know somebody who owns the other part.

632
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,830
安吉洛  我不知道你有这家公司的股份
Angelo, I didn't know you had any part of it.

633
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,620
我要是知道的话
I would never have done what I did

634
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,490
是绝对不会那么做的  我不知道
if I knew you were involved. I didn't know.

635
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,500
我绝不会对你做这种事
I would never, never do that against you.

636
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,690
悄悄话没说老板是犹太黑帮吗
Whispers didn't tell you it was Jew mob?

637
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,260
没有  他说是犹太洗衣妇
No, he said Jew washerwomen.

638
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,880
犹太洗衣妇
Jew washerwomen.

639
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,690
他还说了什么
What else he say?

640
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,770
我猜他让你保密
I bet he said keep it to yourself.

641
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,660
别跟城里其他人透露一个字
Don't say nothing to nobody Downtown.

642
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,840
的确
He did.

643
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,970
我没核实
I didn't check.

644
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,090
对不起  我应该先核实一下的
I'm sorry. I should've checked.

645
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,580
-我能把钱退给他吗  -他用不着了
- Can I give him his money back? - He won't need it.

646
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:08,900
你留着吧
You can keep it.

647
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,600
我不想惹麻烦
I... I don't want no trouble.

648
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:12,800
我把钱退给他吧  我没关系
I'll just give it back to him and I'm okay.

649
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:14,770
他用不着了
He won't need it.

650
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,650
好吧  谢谢
Okay. Thanks.

651
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,080
谢罗素吧
Thank Russell.

652
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,020
我本来不想浪费时间
I wouldn't have wasted my time.

653
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,710
打算让犹太黑帮找你算账
I'd have let the Jew mob have you.

654
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,340
你这个朋友真没得说
You got a good friend here.

655
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,920
你不知道他多仗义
You don't know how good a friend you got.

656
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,060
-我知道  -不  你不知道
- I... I know. - No, you don't know.

657
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,320
去吧台那等着吧
Wait by the bar, would you?

658
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,550
像这种情况
In a case like this,

659
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,950
最好的办法就是用全新的家伙
the best thing to do is you use something brand new.

660
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,310
刚开箱的
Right out of the box.

661
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,470
否则  你不知道它在哪里被用过
Otherwise, you don't know where it's been.

662
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,250
或被谁用过
You don't know who's used it,

663
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,360
跟什么案子有关联
what crime it was connected to.

664
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,830
那无异于找死
That's suicide.

665
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,980
所以我推荐用全新的  刚开箱的
So I recommend something new, straight out of the... the box.

666
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,320
冰冷  干净
Stone cold. Clean.

667
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:22,860
你来了
There you are.

668
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,920
我不知道你会从哪边过来
I didn't know which way you were coming from.

669
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,220
我不知道你从哪边...
I didn't know which way you were...

670
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,990
当然  下一步就是
Naturally, the next thing you wanna do

671
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,600
把家伙扔掉  你得毁灭证据
is throw the thing away. You wanna get rid of it.

672
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:42,350
大家都扔在斯古吉尔河的一个地方
There's a spot in the Schuylkill River everybody uses.

673
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,180
如果派人潜到河底
If they ever send divers down there,

674
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,210
找到的武器够武装一个小国家了
they'd be able to arm a small country.

675
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,070
{\an8}一名男子在人行道上被枪杀

676
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:14,330
对我来说  杀死悄悄话后  一切都变了
For me, everything changed after Whispers.

677
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,330
这就像在军队
It was like the army.

678
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,300
你服从命令
You followed orders.

679
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,620
听吩咐做事
You did the right thing.

680
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,890
就会得到相应的奖赏
You got rewarded.

681
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,150
{\an8}罗马别墅餐厅酒吧

682
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,790
我替罗素做事
And when I handled things for Russell,

683
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,250
从来都不是为钱
it was never for money,

684
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,880
而是为了表达尊重
but as a show of respect.

685
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,950
你给他跑跑腿  帮帮忙
When you ran a little errand, you did a little favor,

686
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:42,270
当你需要帮忙的时候  他也还你人情

有时她也会怕我
She's afraid of me at times too.

756
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:26,040
她就是有点敏感
So, uh, it's just she's a sensitive kid,

00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,040
敏感而已
but that's all it is.

-真的吗  -是啊

Do you know why God made the sky so high?

774
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:05,970
不知道
No.

775
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:09,510

So that the little birdies don't bunk their head on it

776
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:10,970

when they're flying around.

777

No.

782
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:21,520
不  你们不想吃糖
No, you guys don't want any candy.

783
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:25,200
需要我为你做点什么吗
There's nothing I could do for you?

784
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,320
不用了
No.

785
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:28,500
需要的话你要告诉罗素伯伯
Well, if there is, you let Uncle Russell know.

786
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:29,790
好
Okay.

787
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:31,700
回去玩吧
Go back. Have some fun.

知道我什么意思了吗
You see what I mean?

789
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:37,490
明白我的感觉了吗
You see that feeling I get?

790
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,590
她就是  腼腆而已
She's just... She's shy, that's all.

791
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:41,350
她没有恶意
She... She don't mean nothing.

792
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,920
有时候  父母离婚了
Sometimes, when the parents get divorced,

793
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:47,030
孩子们就会迷茫  然后他们会充满恨意
the kids get all confused, and then they get resentful

794
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:48,820
不知道该向谁发泄
and they don't know who to take it out on,

795
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,580
或是站哪边
or, you know, which side, or...

796
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,620
不  你说得对
No, you're right.

797
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,660
但是这一点我很幸运
I'm lucky in that way because

798
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:56,850
因为琳妮和玛丽相处得很好
Reenie and Mary, they get along like gangbusters,

799
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,350
孩子们轮流在两家住  没什么问题
so the kids go back and forth with no problem.

800
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:01,610
要把家人留在身边  留意这一点
Keep your family close. Keep an eye on that.

801
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,400
我就是提醒你一下
Anyway, I'm just telling you, you know.

802
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,650
我想我就是运气好
I mean, I'm... I'm just lucky.

803
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,480
是啊
Yeah.

804
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,840
工会的工作怎么样
How's it going with the union?

805
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,130
工会是世界上最好的
The union's the best in the world.

806
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,980
-你喜欢  -是啊  只是...
- You like it, huh? - Yeah, well, it's just...

807
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,100
我想要找个稳定点的工作  不过
I mean, I wish I had something more steady, but...

808
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,080
就是有些
Yeah, it's...

809
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,750
-管理怎么样  -好啊
- How about organizing? - Yeah.

810
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,570
-我想干那个  可是  -怎么
- I would like to do that. But... - Yeah?

811
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:25,770
很多人都等着呢
there's a long line.

812
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,740
-换句话说  等候名单很长  -是
- A long waiting list, if you will. - Yeah.

813
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:32,630
我们的一个朋友遇到了一点麻烦
Well, a friend of ours is having a little trouble.

814
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,440
-高层的朋友  -谁啊
- Friend at the top. - Who's that?

815
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,140
高层
The top.

816
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,650

Hoffa?

817
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:39,960
嗯
Yeah.

818
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:41,780
之前我听说
I heard the other day

00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,440
有人要用水管揍他
that some guys tried to pipe him

820
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,640
-因为一个工人的赔偿问题  -是的
- because of a workman's comp case. - Yeah.

821
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,080
听说他把他们打得落花流水
Yeah, I heard he beat the shit out of them.

822
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:51,010
是  可他那样能撑多久呢
Yeah, but how long is he gonna keep doing that?

823
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,420
总有这事儿那事儿
Things are gonna keep happening.

824
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,520
他身边需要一个可靠的人
He needs somebody he can trust around him.

825

一个可以一直跟着他的人

826
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,560
是
Yeah.

我让他接电话  你跟他说  好吗

832
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:16,840
好的
All right.

你好  很高兴认识你
Yeah, yeah. Glad to meet you.

837
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:28,910
我也很高兴认识你  虽然是在电话上
Well, glad to meet you, too, even if it's over the phone.

838
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:32,350
听说你刷房子
I heard you paint houses.

839
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:35,710
是的  先生  是的
Yes. Yes, sir, I... I do. I do.

840
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:36,930
我还
And I, uh...

841
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:38,770
自己做木工
I also do my own carpentry.

842
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,820
很高兴你这么说
I'm glad to hear that.

843
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,520
听说你是工会的兄弟
I understand you're a brother of mine.

844
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,870
是的  先生  从1947年就在107号地方工会了
Yes, sir. Local 107. Since 1947.

845

是吧
Yeah! You know, uh,

846
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,540
我们的朋友对你评价非常高
our friend speaks very highly of you.

847
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:52,500
谢谢
Well, thank you.

848
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:56,350
-他这个人要求可不低  -我尽力而为
- He's not an easy man to please. - Well, I do my best.

849
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,060
有这么个情况
Well, you know, there's a situation...

850
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:02,180
如今  年轻人不知道吉米·霍法是谁
Nowadays, young people, they don't know who Jimmy Hoffa was.

851
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,690
他们完全没概念
They don't have a clue.

852
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:07,160
他们可能知道他消失了什么的
I mean, maybe they know that he disappeared or something,

853
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,510
但仅此而已
but that's about it.

854
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:12,300
可在当时  全国上下
But back then, there wasn't nobody in this country

855
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:10,870
{\an8}吉米·霍法

856
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,270
没人不知道吉米·霍法是谁
who didn't know who Jimmy Hoffa was.

857
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:15,780
上帝保佑  吉米
God bless, Jimmy.

858
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,800
你做的一切  你是个真正的绅士
Everything you've done, you're a real gentleman.

859
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,740
很好
That's good.

860
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:22,040
50年代的时候  他和猫王一样受欢迎
In the '50s, he was as big as Elvis.

861
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,280
60年代的时候  他和披头士一样受欢迎
In the '60s, he was like the Beatles.

862
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,250
除了总统以外
Next to the president,

863
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:29,230
他是国内最有权力的人  无人可及
he was like the most powerful man in the country. Bar none.

864
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,760
你如果买东西
If you got it,

865
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,810
卡车会把东西送过去
a truck brought it to you.

866
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:36,080
{\an8}卡车司机工会

867
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:38,220
如果你买食物  衣服
If you got your food, your clothing,

868
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,500
药物  家用燃料
your medicine, if you got fuel for your homes,

869
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,350
工业用燃料
fuel for your industries,

870
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,430
卡车会把东西送去给他们
a truck brought it to them!

871
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,290
我们卡车停下的那天
The day our trucks stop,

872
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:53,180
就是美国停下的那天
America stops!

873
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:58,320
现在出了点状况  弗兰克
Well, there's a situation going on now, Frank,

874
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,980
需要处理
that needs to be attended to.

875
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,440
他们想分裂工会
You know, they're trying to tear the union apart.

876
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:05,410
大公司和政府联手
Big business and the government working together,

877
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:05,950
想要拉我们下马
trying to pull us down.

878
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,650
大公司在进攻
Big business is on the attack!

879
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,790
他们来了  来势汹汹
They're coming! They're coming hard

880
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,250
长驱直入
and they're coming fast!

881
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,230
大公司和政府
Big business and the government

882
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:18,190
想要在我们的阶层里埋下异议的种子
are trying to sow the seeds of dissent among our ranks,

883
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,620
而此时我们正需要联合
at a time when we need unity!

884
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,390
我们需要团结
We need solidarity!

885
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:26,310
我想把这话写在空中
I want to write it in the sky.

886
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,480
团结
Solidarity!

887
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:31,380
团结
Solidarity!

888
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:34,130
团结
Solidarity!

889
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,360
你想加入这场战斗吗
You wanna be a part of this fight?

890
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,750
是的  先生
Yes, I do, sir.

891
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:40,400
你想成为这历史的一部分吗
Would you like to be a part of this history?

892
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,670
是的  我想
Yes, I would.

893
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,790
无论你需要我做什么  我都随叫随到
Whatever you need me to do, I'm available.

894
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,760
你明天能来芝加哥吗
Can you come to Chicago tomorrow?

895
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,020
可以  先生
Yes, I can, sir.

896
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,830
那好  到时见
All right, then. See you then.

897
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:56,880
-他喜欢说话  对吗  -是的
- He likes to talk, don't he? - Yeah.

898
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,300
还以为我是在跟巴顿将军说话
Thought I was talking to General Patton.

899
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,760
弗兰克  你过来的唯一原因是
You know, Frank, the only reason why you're here,

900
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,430
海员工会  他们想和我们一样
the Seafarers Union, they're signing up

901
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:18,500
{\an8}俄罗斯人和土耳其人浴室

902
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:16,310
签约非工会的
the same non-union cab drivers

903
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:17,820
出租车司机
as we want to do.

904
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:19,770
没人知道你是谁
Nobody knows who you are

905
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:23,300
没人知道你在这做什么  好吗
and nobody knows what the fuck you're doing here. Okay?

906
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,230
-嗯  -只有你我知道你为何来此
- Yeah. - You and I know why you're here.

907
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,750
我们得签约这些司机
We gotta be able to sign these drivers up

908
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:31,220
这样保罗·霍尔的工会就签约不了他们
so Paul Hall doesn't get 'em for his fucking union.

909
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,720
不知为何  女同性恋
For some reason, lesbians.

910
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,720
这些司机大多都是该死的女同性恋
Most of these drivers are fucking lesbians.

911
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,200
我不知道为什么
I have no reason why.

912
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:39,300
保罗·霍尔四处宣传
Paul Hall's running around

913
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,520
说他可以比我们的哥们吉米
saying that he's gonna get a better contract

914
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,270
提供一份更好的合同
than our boy fucking Jimmy.

915
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,740
他就是个狗杂种
He's a cocksucker. Yeah.

916
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:49,700
吉米收买了戴利市长
Jimmy has Mayor fucking Daley in his pocket.

917
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:52,250
我们做什么警察都不会管
The cops are okay with whatever the fuck we do.

918
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,580
他们不会帮我们把车推下水
They're not gonna help us push these cars in,

919
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,800
但他们也绝对不会让任何人阻止我们
but they certainly are not gonna let anybody fucking stop us.

920
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,500
懂吗
Okay?

921
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,050
用力  大伙儿用力
Come on! All of you guys. Come on!

922
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,930
把车子推下去  小心点
Let's get this fucking thing in there. Watch yourself!

923
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,760
太费劲了
This is a lot of work.

924
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,540
你有想过用糖果吗
Yeah, you ever think of using candy?

925
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,170
-什么  -糖果
- What? - Candy.

926
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:33,040
糖果是什么鬼
What the fuck is candy?

927
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,000
{\an8}炸药  轻拿轻放

928
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,110
卢  把门打开
Hey, Lou, open the fucking gate.

929
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,180
知道  知道
I got it. I got it.

930
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,910
来  你把汽油拿着
Here, you take the gas.

931
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,560
弗兰克  吉米有个特点
Frank, there's one thing about Jimmy.

932
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,410
他不喜欢等人
Don't ever make him wait.

933
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:07,000
如果你和他约好见面  你一定要准时到场
If you make a meeting with him, you get there on time.

934
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,410
最好是提前到
Better yet, get there early.

935
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,920
我必须强调这一点
I can't stress this enough.

936
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,280
他觉得时间很可贵
His problem is that time is of essence.

937
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,870
这是最重要的
And that's the important thing.

938
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:18,350
我还要跟你说件事  吉米不喝酒
I gotta tell you one more thing. Jimmy doesn't drink.

939
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,770
是的  世界上最大的货运工会的老大
Yeah. The head of the largest trucking union in the world,

940
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:21,670
他不喝酒
he don't drink.

941
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,140
这事最糟的地方在于
The worst part about it is,

942
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,560
他不允许别人在他身边喝酒
he doesn't allow anybody to drink around him.

943
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:32,150
还有件事
Another thing about him,

944
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:34,980
吉米讨厌西瓜
Jimmy hates fucking watermelon.

945
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:39,530
但我们喜欢西瓜
But we're gonna like watermelon.

946
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,930
吉米  你当时真该去看看
Jimmy, you shoulda seen it,

947
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:43,200
慢慢沉下水
sinking in the water.

948
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:47,790
一辆接一辆  我敢打赌  等他们隔天醒来
One by one. I bet you, when they woke up the next morning,

949
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,550
那些该死的出租车司机
those fucking cab drivers,

950
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,130
他们去找自己的出租车
they went to look for their cabs,

951
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:52,980
他们根本不知道发生了什么
they didn't know what the fuck hit 'em.

952
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,170
真是个好主意  乔伊
That's a great idea, Joey.

953
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,490
好主意
Great idea.

954
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,280
不是我想出来的
Well, it wasn't my idea.

955
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,530
我哥们弗兰克  是他的主意
My man Frank. It was his idea.

956
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,210
我跟你说
Let me tell you something.

957
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:06,180
弗兰克去了码头  他接管了码头
Frank hit that pier, he took over the pier.

958
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,280
不管他叫他们做什么  不管他说什么
Whatever he told them to do, whatever he said,

959
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,690
他们都照做
they did it, you know.

960
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:14,110
我从没见过任何人像他那样穿过人群
I never seen a guy walk through a crowd like he does.

961
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,500
他一个人都不碰
He doesn't touch a fucking person!

962
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,250
所有人都自觉让路
Everybody gets out of the way.

963
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,720
我没开玩笑  我发誓
I'm not kidding you. I swear.

964
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,040
那些人和他素不相识  就像
Guys he never met in his life. You know, it was like...

965
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,170
就像摩西  记得摩西吗
like Moses. Remember Moses?

966
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,220
他走进海洋还是大海
When he walked into the ocean, the sea,

967
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,590
不管是什么  水面就分开了
whatever the fuck it was, and it opened up!

968
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:30,690
就是他  相信我  吉米  他有那能力
That's him. I'm telling you. Jimmy, he's got it.

969
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:31,710
你觉得如何
So, what do you think?

970
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:33,970
你还需要他在这待几天吗
You need him a couple of days more?

971
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:36,590
是的  我们还有一些零碎的事要处理
Yeah, we gotta clear up a few dribs and drabs.

972
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,150
你们真喜欢西瓜啊
You guys sure like watermelon.

973
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:41,870
想吃一口吗
Want a bite?

974
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:43,290
决不
Not on your life.

975
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,860
你当时在场  你亲眼看到了
You were there. You saw it firsthand.

976
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:49,990
那些人不是工会
Those guys ain't union.

977
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:54,010
他们就像是纳粹同谋  在战场后方行动
They're like Nazi collaborators, operating behind the lines.

978
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:56,720
-你懂的  你打过仗  -没错
- You know. You were in the war. - I sure do.

979
00:52:57,330 --> 00:53:02,360
在战争期间  你从一个地方转移到另一个地方
In a war, you go from point A to point B.

980
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,090
有时候
Sometimes,

981
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:07,260
你会在路上洒一些啤酒
you spill a little beer along the way.

982
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:11,120
你觉得这哲学有道理吗
That philosophy make sense to you?

983
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:12,030
当然
Sure does.

984
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:13,980
很好
Good.

985
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:33,310
吉米  他不是因为喜欢我
Jimmy, he didn't make me stay in his suite

986
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:34,630
而让我住他的套房
because he liked me.

987
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:37,560
他让我跟他一起住是因为他不想让我
He made me stay with him because he didn't want me

988
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,880
用我的名字在酒店登记
registering in my name at the hotel.

989
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:44,100
这样  就没有证据证明我去过芝加哥
This way, there was no proof I was even in Chicago.

990
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:56,390
加油  吉米  你落后好多
Come on, Jimmy, you're way behind.

991
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,760
什么都阻止不了她
Nothing stops her.

992
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:00,510
芝加哥那事之后  我和吉米走得更近了
After Chicago, Jimmy and I got close.

993
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,030
老婆们也相处得很融洽
The wives hit it off.

994
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,040
因为吉米和约瑟芬的孩子
And with Jimmy and Josephine's kids

995
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,050
大多已成年  离开了家
mostly grown up and out of the house,

996
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:07,830
他们从我们孩子身上也获得不少乐趣
they got a kick out of our kids too.

997
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:09,980

00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,330
她和吉米  他们一下就喜欢上了对方
She and Jimmy, they fell for each other right away.

1002
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:19,960
你知道比起拍照我更喜欢什么吗
You know what I like even better than getting my picture took?

1003
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,710
什么
What?

1004
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,610

Sorry, everybody. This is just for Peggy and I.

1010
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:35,570
一方面  吉米没有绰号
For one thing, Jimmy didn't have a nickname

1011
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:37,500
比如"剃刀"或者"钟楼怪人"
like "The Razor," Or "The Hunchback,"

1012
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,100
或者"黄鼠狼"亦或者"悄悄话"
or "The Weasel," Or "Whispers."

1013
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,050
怎么不说谢谢
So what happened to "Thank you"?

1014
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:43,160
谢谢
Thank you!

1015
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:46,370

1019
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,110
这是霍法先生说的
This is what Mr. Hoffa says.

1020
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:02,330

我只想要一笔过渡性贷款  吉米
I mean, a bridge loan is really all I'm asking, Jimmy.

1032
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:25,630

I'm not gonna piss away my members' pension dough

1033
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:26,860
投资在风险过大的项目上
on something too risky.

1034
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,760
这没有风险  吉米
This is not a risk, Jimmy.

1035

1048
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,630
多亏了霍法先生
And, because of Mr. Hoffa,

1049
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:10,950
工人生病时有医疗保险
workers have medical insurance for when they get sick,

1050
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:14,540
他们知道退休后  不会挨饿
and know when they retire, they're not going to go hungry.

1051
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:18,230
当时有太多的文书工作
There was so much paperwork back then

1052
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:20,570
吉米只能用一个叫艾伦·多夫曼的年轻人开的
that Jimmy had to use an insurance company

1053
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:23,880
一家保险公司来处理贷款
that was run by this kid, Allen Dorfman, to work out the loans.

1054
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,330
不  一分钱都不借
No, no, nothing for nothing.

1055
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:27,850
下次  试试口气好一点
Next time, try asking a little bit fucking nicer.

1056
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:32,460
{\an8}艾伦·多夫曼  1979年
在芝加哥的一处停车场头中八枪身亡

1057
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:34,930
然后呢  进展如何
And? And? How'd it go?

1058
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:37,500
情况一度很危急
It was a little touch and go for a little bit.

1059
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,300
-但是最后还是顺利达成了  -很好
- But at the end, fine. - Good.

1060
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,440
是罗素让吉米
It was Russ who got Jimmy

1061
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,500
给戈特利布这样的人贷款
to give guys like Gottlieb the loans,

1062
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:44,950
他能分到一成
and, you know, he would get like 10% of that.

1063
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,690
我也不知道  也许更多
Or whatever, you know. Maybe more.

1064
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:51,060
听着  你告诉马尔特杜佐我很感激
Listen, you tell Marteduzzo from me that I appreciate it.

1065
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:52,780
人人都会感激
And everybody's gonna appreciate it.

1066
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,690
这是好事
It's a good thing.

1067
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,690
行  我会的
Okay. I'll do that.

1068
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:56,710
那时  你不能去普通银行
Back then, you couldn't go to regular banks

1069
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:58,510
因为钱是用来赌博的
because the money was for gambling.

1070
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:01,200
千真万确  就是这样  我没开玩笑  不能去
God's truth, that's what it was. I'm serious. You couldn't.

1071
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,010
所以黑手党  他们怎么办呢
So the Mob, what did they do?

1072
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:04,940
他们找卡车司机工会贷款
They went to the Teamsters for the money.

1073
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,770
是卡车司机工会介入其中
It was the Teamsters that stepped in

1074
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,060
他们借出的钱打造了拉斯维加斯
and lent the money that built Las Vegas.

1075
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,570
-这是红木  -别  比利
- This is the mahogany... - Don't, Billy.

1076
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:11,920
-别碰  -我不碰
- Don't touch the stuff. - I won't.

1077
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,200
-该上哪去上哪去  -好
- Just go where you gotta go. - Okay.

1078
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:16,280
当时的生意多得让人应接不暇
There was more business than anybody could handle.

1079
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:18,360
所以吉米把一些生意
So Jimmy had to shove some of the deals

1080
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,110
塞给了他老婆约
off on to his wife Jo,

1081
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:22,330
她完全不知道
who had no idea she had 22%

1082
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:23,330
她拥有一个叫"太阳谷"的
of a Florida land deal

1083
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:25,100
佛州土地交易公司22%的股份
called "Sun Valley,"

1084
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,820
几艘包租渔船
some charter fishing boats,

1085
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:28,950
以及一个带私家雪山的滑雪度假屋
and a ski lodge with its own mountain.

1086
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,810
吉米有个客户叫山姆·詹卡纳  绰号"莫莫"
One of Jimmy's clients was Sam "Momo" Giancana,

1087
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:39,460
他和肯尼迪家族是世交
who was friends with the Kennedys from back

1088
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:42,190
这两家自约翰·肯尼迪的父亲在禁酒令期间走私酒
when Jack's father made his fortune with the Italians

1089
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:44,250
和意大利人一起赚大钱时就认识了
as a bootlegger during Prohibition.

1090
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:46,570
{\an9}露希尔·亨特
刘易斯·康宁汉姆

00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:48,350
莫莫和辛纳屈跟肯尼迪家族混
Momo, Sinatra hung out together with the Kennedys.

1092
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:49,060
{\an8}艾米特·伍兹

1093

莫莫和肯尼迪
Momo and Kennedy,

1094
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,910
不管你信不信  甚至有同一个女友
believe it or not, even had the same girlfriend.

1095
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:55,950
在同一时期
Together. At the same time.

1096
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:57,500
真是太疯狂了
Talk about crazy.

1097
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:00,630
所以对黑手党来说  帮助乔·肯尼迪
So it was easy for the Mob to help Joe Kennedy

1098
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:03,310
让他儿子当选总统很容易  非常容易
get his son elected president. That was easy.

1099
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,730
他们操控了选票
They just punched up the vote a little

1100
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:08,090
确保他在伊利诺伊州胜出
to make sure that he won in Illinois.

1101
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,130
{\an8}雷蒙德·克拉克

1102
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:11,630
{\an8}艾米特·伍兹

1103
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,280
作为交换
In exchange for that,

1104
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:16,780
新上台的总统要把卡斯特罗从古巴赶下台
the new president was supposedly gonna get Castro out of Cuba

1105
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:19,550
这样我们的人就能拿回他们的赌场
so our guys could get their casinos back,

1106
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:21,630
赛马场  捕虾船
and race tracks, and shrimp boats,

1107
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:22,880
以及他们在哈瓦那
and everything else that they had,

1108
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,530
曾拥有的一切
and owned down there from Havana back.

1109
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,540
不过那事没成
But that... that didn't happen.

1110
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:34,960
{\an8}投民主党

1111
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:38,810
意大利人想让爱尔兰人肯尼迪当总统
The Italians wanted Kennedy the Irishman for president,

1112
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:40,600
他们如愿了
and that's what they got.

1113
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:45,570
习惯吧  因为以后我们每时每刻都得看到了
Get used to it, because we're gonna be seeing it 24/7.

1114
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:46,840
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

1115
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,140
该死的肯尼迪家族
Goddamn Kennedys.

1116
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,580
我在看该死的肯尼迪家族
I'm looking at the goddamn Kennedys.

1117
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,390
吉米  孩子们都在呢  注意言辞
Jimmy, the kids. Language.

1118
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,430
有什么差别
What difference does it make?

1119
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,240
他们迟早都要学会的
I mean, they gotta learn sooner or later.

1120
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:57,140
我们要和这些人开战
We're going to war with these people.

1121
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:58,320
开战
War!

1122
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:01,460
我已经说了无数次了
If I said it once, I said it a thousand times,

1123
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:02,980
我不在乎他们是不是爱尔兰人
I don't care they're Irish.

1124
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,250
我不在乎他们是不是天主教徒
I don't care they're Catholic.

1125
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,590
如果要说这辈子有谁你不能信
If there's one person you can't trust in this life,

1126
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,150
那就是百万富翁的孩子
it's millionaires' kids.

1127
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:11,300
你说得对  吉米
You're right, Jimmy.

1128
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:14,660
尤其是那个小杂种
Especially that little son of a bitch.

1129
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,520
你是说你不记得
Are you saying you don't remember

1130
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,650
你帮过约翰尼·迪奥吗
doing any favors for Johnny Dio,

1131
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:24,470
{\an8}罗伯特·肯尼迪

1132
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,580
还是说你不记得你们的对话
or you don't remember the conversation?

1133
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:27,340
我是说  我已经尽力回忆了
I'm saying, to the best of my recollection,

1134
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,870
根据我的回忆
I must recall on my memory,

1135
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:32,020
我想不起来了
I cannot remember.

1136
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,850
那这两万块是哪来的
Then where did this $20,000 come from?

1137
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,310
个人的
Individuals.

1138
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,380
哪些个人  霍法先生
Which individuals, Mr. Hoffa?

1139
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:50,200
未经核查的情况下  这笔我借的钱
Off hand, that particular amount of money I borrowed,

1140
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:52,810
我目前也想不起是找谁借的
I don't know at this particular moment.

1141
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:58,860
但是根据我取得的贷款记录
But the record of my loans, which I requested, I have,

1142
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:01,120
在这段时间内
and out of all the moneys I loaned

1143
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:05,510
我贷款的所有钱  都投资给了这些企业
during this period of time I went into these ventures.

1144
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,830
该死的肯尼迪家族
Those goddamn Kennedys,

1145
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:14,270
他们总是得偿所愿
they get what they want!

1146
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:15,170
吉米  吉米  孩子们在呢
Jimmy. Jimmy, the kids.

1147
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:17,030
他已经让我
Him and all the bullshit problems

1148
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,890
-处处受制  -吉米
- he put me through already. - Jimmy.

1149
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:21,010
我得走了  别指望我看这个
I gotta go. You don't expect me to look at this.

1150
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:22,250
我不指望
No, I don't.

1151
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:24,960
对罗素这样的人来说
For guys like Russ,

1152
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:26,670
那最好不过了
it couldn't have been better.

1153
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:27,540
{\an8}支持肯尼迪当总统

1154
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:27,990
我是说  罗素
I mean, Russ,

1155
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:28,490
{\an8}支持肯尼迪当总统

1156
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:31,050
肯尼迪当选他也有出力
oh, yeah, he did his part for getting Kennedy elected,

1157
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,400
{\an8}支持肯尼迪当总统

1158
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:32,100
这点毫无疑问
that's for sure.

1159
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:33,530
你在做什么  我叫你把它...
What are you doing? I told you to put it...

1160
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:35,330
我叫你贴到所有杆子上
I told you to put them on every pole.

1161
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:36,430
你还在这瞎转
You're still walking around.

1162
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:37,380
所以约翰·肯尼迪
So what's the first thing

1163
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:40,290
为了感谢芝加哥的帮助做的第一件事是什么
that Jack Kennedy does to thank Chicago for all their help?

1164
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:43,590
他让他的垃圾弟弟上位了
He puts his shitass brother in there,

1165
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:44,920
那个预科学校混蛋
that little prep school punk,

1166
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,290
他让他成了司法部长
and he winds up making him attorney general.

1167
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,300
鲍比上任后做的第一件事是什么
And what's the first thing Bobby does?

1168
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,270
他不仅对付吉米
He goes after not just Jimmy,

1169
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:57,040
从某种程度上讲  你也能理解
which in a way you could understand.

1170
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,630
吉米无比厌恶肯尼迪家族
I mean, Jimmy hated the Kennedys so much

1171
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:01,760
以至于他从工会拿了五十万给尼克松
he gave Nixon $500,000 in Teamster cash.

1172
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,440
但鲍比还去对付詹卡纳
But Bobby also goes after Giancana,

1173
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:07,800
马切洛  特拉菲坎特  以及其他所有
Marcello, Trafficante, and all the other guys

1174
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:10,770
当初帮他哥哥入住白宫的人
who put his brother in the White House in the first place.

1175
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:14,290
那是在干什么
What's that about?

1176
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,470
弗兰克
Frank.

1177
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,270
-谢谢  -圣诞快乐
- Thank you. - Merry Christmas.

1178
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:18,480
我是漏掉了什么吗
Am I missing something?

1179
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:20,550
谢谢你  凯丽
Thank you, Carrie.

1180
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:26,690
-太漂亮了  -真美
- That's gorgeous. - Beautiful.

1181
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:29,820
戴着它健健康康  我们爱你
Wear it in the best of health. We love you.

1182
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:33,330
这是给佩琪的
Okay, now this one is for Peggy

1183
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:36,280
罗素伯伯送的  圣诞快乐  亲爱的
from Uncle Russell. Merry Christmas, my love.

1184
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:38,990
看呀
Oh, look at those.

1185
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,250
太好了
So nice!

1186
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:44,220
我听说你喜欢滑冰
I heard you like to skate.

1187
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:46,670
你该说什么
What do you say?

1188
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:49,560
谢谢
Thank you.

1189
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:52,310
现在我和罗素伯伯可以带你去滑冰了
Now me and Uncle Russell could take you ice skating.

1190
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:53,810
我想圣诞老人
I think Santa Claus left you

1191
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:56,060
在里面还给你留了点东西
a little something extra in there too.

1192
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:02,860
你该对罗素伯伯说什么
What do you say to Uncle Russell?

1193
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:05,960
你该说什么
What do you say?

1194
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:09,820
弗兰克  没关系
Frank, it's all right.

1195
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:13,300
她已经说了一次谢谢了  这就够了
She said thank you once. That's enough.

1196
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,610
因为鲍比是司法部长  他们把我们盯得很紧
With Bobby as attorney general, I mean, they were all over us.

1197
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,260
我们不能在电话里说事
I mean, we couldn't talk on the phone

1198
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:23,260
因为我们知道有人窃听
because we knew it was being bugged.

1199
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:25,250
你什么都不能做  哪也不能去
You couldn't do nothing. You couldn't go nowhere.

1200
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,580
什么都做不了
You couldn't do anything.

1201
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,570
总之情况特别糟糕
It was a bad, bad, bad situation.

1202
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:31,040
然后吉米  算了
And then Jimmy... Forget it.

1203
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,690
鲍比  现在作为司法部长  他有权力
Bobby, now as attorney general, he has the power

1204
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:36,020
送任何人进监狱  毋庸置疑
to send anybody to jail, and no question about it.

1205
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:38,490
吉米在鲍比的打击对象名单上名列前茅
And Jimmy was at the top of Bobby's hit list.

1206
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:41,110
他甚至组建了一只专门的"抓捕霍法小队"
He even set up a special "Get Hoffa Squad,"

1207
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:42,910
他找来了联调局
where he had his own guys from the FBI,

1208
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:44,830
还有国税局的人夜以继日地工作
the IRS working 'round the clock.

1209
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:48,030
他们唯一的工作就是送吉米·霍法进监狱
Their only job was to put Jimmy Hoffa in jail.

1210
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,550
我是认真的  他们只干了这事
I'm serious. That's all they did.

1211
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:56,850
这房间里全是该死的蠢货
I am sitting in a room full of fuckin' idiots.

1212
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:00,510
一群傻逼
You dumb motherfuckers!

1213
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:01,660
你们知道你们做了什么吗
You know what you did?

1214
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,390
你们找来约翰尼·奥鲁克的孩子
You take Johnny O'Rourke's kid

1215
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:06,660
你们让他
and you put him on

1216
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:09,280
成为总组织者
as general organizer,

1217
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:12,930
支付了他3.6万
pay him 36 fucking grand,

1218
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:14,850
与此同时
at the same time,

1219
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:19,650
你们让他卖保险给他爸爸的...
you let him sell insurance to his fucking father's...

1220
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:30,850
他爸爸的...
to his fucking father's...

1221
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:35,100
卖给他爸爸的地方工会
to his fucking father's locals!

1222
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,110
该死
Damn it!

1223
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,220
怎么能犯这种错
How do you do that?

1224
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:43,170
你们是有多蠢
How stupid can you be?

1225
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,120
那该死的狗杂种肯尼迪
That fucking cocksucker Kennedy

1226
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:51,530
我去哪他都盯着我
has got his nose up my ass everywhere I go!

1227
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:53,540
你们不知道他对我紧追不舍吗
You don't know that they're hounding me?

1228
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:55,150
他们监视我做的每件事
They're looking at everything I do.

1229
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:57,840
你们却让这发生在大庭广众之下
And you let this happen in public!

1230
01:03:58,530 --> 01:03:59,880
你们成全了他
You're giving it to him!

1231
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,300
我要去坐牢了  懂吗
I'm going to jail. You understand?

1232
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:05,130
拜你们所赐  我要去坐牢了
I'm going to prison because of you,

1233
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,410
一群蠢货
you dumb motherfuckers.

1234
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:09,680
这是你们想要的  你们想让我进监狱
This is what you wanted. You wanted to put me in jail.

1235
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,420
告诉我  好让我就地杀了你们
Tell me now so I can kill you right here.

1236
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:13,430
就地
Right here!

1237
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,470
你去哪
Where're you going?

1238
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:20,220
什么叫"我去哪"
What do you mean, where am I going?

1239
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:22,100
我他妈不干了  这就是我要去的地方
I fucking quit, that's where I'm going.

1240
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:23,000
你为什么不干了
What are you quitting for?

1241
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,350
你叫我蠢货
You gonna call me a motherfucker?

1242
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:26,870
你可以这么跟他们说话  但跟我不行
You can talk to them like that, you can't talk to me like that.

1243
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:29,810
弗兰克  不  我没说你  你...
Frank. No! That didn't apply to you. What are you...

1244
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:30,320
-没说我  -是的
- Didn't apply? - No!

1245
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,080
那你要告诉我你没在说我
Then you gotta let me know it didn't apply to me.

1246
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,660
我就站在那
I'm standing right there.

1247
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,290
我根本没看到你站在那
I didn't even see you standing there!

1248
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:36,750
我就站在那  吉米
I was standing right there, Jimmy.

1249
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:37,740
你胡扯什么呢
What are you talking about?

1250
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:40,360
但我没在说你  我还能说什么
But it didn't apply to you! What else can I say?

1251
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,470
你有问题的话  就先把我拉到一边
You got a problem, you pull me aside.

1252
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:46,790
你不能辱骂了我然后又说你没在说我
You don't insult me and then you say it didn't apply to me.

1253
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:49,340
我要怎么把你拉到一边  我根本没看到你
How am I gonna put you aside? I didn't even see you there.

1254
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:51,960
拜托  弗兰克  你知道我不是那样的人
Oh, come on, Frank, you know me better than that.

1255
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,880
你知道我不是那样的人
You just know me better than that.

1256
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:54,870
拜托
Please.

1257
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,490
来吧  不会有事的

1258
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,180
不会有事的  来
It's gonna be all right. Come on.

1259
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,420
来  我为什么要对你说那样的话
Come on, why would I ever say anything like that to you?

1260
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:02,210
你得控制这些人
You gotta control these people.

1261
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:04,410
一切都在掌控之中  别担心
I'm controlling everything. Don't worry about it.

1262
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:07,310
但是当然  当然  我...你懂的
But certainly, certainly, I... you know.

1263
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:10,120
来  各位  出去
Come on. Okay, guys, get out of here now.

1264
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,960
我不知道吉米是怎么管理工会的
I mean, I don't know how Jimmy is running the fucking union.

1265
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,570
鲍比和联调局总是盯着他
Between Bobby and the FBI up his ass all the time,

1266
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:18,070
他都快疯了
he's going fucking crazy.

1267
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:21,320
告诉吉米  我为他的麻烦感到遗憾
Tell Jimmy I'm sorry for his troubles.

1268
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,850
老一辈认识老肯尼迪  他们会去和他谈
The old-timers know the Old Man. They'll talk to him.

1269
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:26,120
他们会跟他讲清楚的
At some point, they'll straighten it out for him.

1270
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,300
但他无法理解
Yeah, but he can't understand,

1271
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:29,780
我和你说实话  我也无法理解
and I gotta be honest with you, I don't understand either,

1272
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:31,920
你们最初怎么就让混蛋肯尼迪兄弟
how youse could help get those two fucking Kennedy pricks

1273
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:33,030
当选了
elected in the first place.

1274
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:34,980
他肯定没法理解
It don't make no sense to him, that's for sure.

1275
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:37,220
他不必事事都理解
He doesn't have to understand everything.

1276
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:39,620
你明白我的意思  有时这样更好
You know what I'm talking about. Sometimes it's better.

1277
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:40,600
这个...
Well...

1278
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:42,910
只是我看到他那样  我没法
It's when I see him like that, I don't, you know,

1279
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:44,810
我想...我感觉不好受
I... I'm tryin' to... I feel bad.

1280
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:46,910
我想怎么也得帮帮他
I wanna help him in some way.

1281
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,430
听我说  他太情绪化了
Listen, he's too emotional.

1282
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:51,150
就像是个到处折腾来
Like some guy who's always rushing,

1283
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:54,160
折腾去  却看不清大局的人
rushing all over the place and they miss the big picture.

1284
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:56,390
比如古巴
Like Cuba.

1285
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,970
让我们重新开赌场
Getting us back into casinos.

1286

让我们重回哈瓦那
Getting us back into Havana.

1287
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:07,040
比如除掉那个混球卡斯特罗
Like getting rid of that fucking Castro prick.

1288
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:12,630
老一辈和老肯尼迪谈过了
The old-timers spoke to the Old Man.

1289
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:15,970
老肯尼迪跟他儿子约翰谈过了  告诉了他
The Old Man talked to his son Jack, and he told him,

1290
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:18,870
别忘了是谁帮他上位的
"Don't forget who the fuck he owes."

1291
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:23,130
他知道他欠了谁的人情
He knows who the fuck he owes.

1292

整条街上只有它  不会找不到的
It's the only one on the street. You can't miss it.

1300
01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:57,690

你在看我的耳朵吗
You looking at my ears?

1314
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:17,380

Sorry?

1315
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:18,900
我的耳朵

-你在看我的耳朵吗  -你的耳朵
- Are you looking at my ears? - Your ears?

1317
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,060

...在猪湾空降

1324
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:00,970
行动极不顺利
Nothing went as planned.

1325
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,210
伞兵们无法
Paratroopers were unable

1326
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:04,800
炸毁通往海岸地区的道路
to blow up roadways leading to the beach area.

1327
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,600
卡斯特罗的军队奔赴前线
Castro raced toward the scene.

1328
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:07,530
地下潜伏人员本能够
The underground might

1329
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:09,390
将路炸毁  但他们一无所知
have blown up the roads but it knew nothing.

1330
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,090
很快  卡斯特罗的军队就将炮火对准了滩头阵地
Soon, Castro had artillery firing on the beachhead.

1331
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:13,880
他的飞机摧毁了入侵舰队
His planes destroyed invading ships

1332
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,390
其中包含一个旅的兵力和重要军火

1333
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:18,230
滩头阵地无法扩大
The beachhead could not be enlarged

1334
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:20,640
伞兵们很快便试图杀回
and paratroopers were soon trying to fight their way back

1335
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,140
岸边的小块区域
to the small section of the shore

1336
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:23,810
这里的入侵者已经被压制
where the invaders were pinned down.

1337
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:26,850
1500人被留在岸边  没有空中掩护
1,500 men had been dumped on a shore without air cover

1338
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:28,640
也没有舰炮掩护
or protective fire from ships.

1339
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:31,240
卡斯特罗只需等到他们弹尽粮绝
Castro had to wait only until they ran out of ammunition

1340
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,810
就可将他们一举歼灭
before mopping them up.

1341
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:36,120
稍后  卡斯特罗在入侵区域高调面对记者
Later, Castro was to strut around the invasion area with newsmen,

1342
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,500
并阐述了犯下的错误
and expound on the errors that had been made.

1343
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,190
他的资料充足
He had ample material.

1344
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:43,050
已经备受侮辱的美国

1345
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:46,060
仍然受到世界大多数国家的谴责
stood condemned by most of the countries of the world.

1346
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:47,130
见鬼
Shit!

1347
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:50,060
不出我所料  他们搞完了古巴
Just as I predicted. They fuck up Cuba,

1348
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:53,150
这个呆子就要冲我和工会来了
Boobie starts coming after me and the union.

1349
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,940
他在寻求廉价的宣传手段
He's looking for some cheap publicity.

1350
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:57,710
就是这样  他就是这么做的
That's all it is. That's what he's doing.

1351
01:09:57,710 --> 01:09:59,320
好吧  都会平息的  吉米
Okay. Well, it's all gonna blow over, Jimmy.

1352
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,910
不  不会平息的  怎么平息
No, it's not gonna blow over. How's it gonna blow over?

1353
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,930
他们永远都不会忘记
They're never gonna forget

1354
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:07,280
-我资助过尼克松  -冷静点  吉米  拜托
- that I gave money to Nixon! - Calm down. Jimmy, please.

1355
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:08,480
我们会处理好的
We're gonna handle this.

1356
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,380
老一辈的
Couple of the old-timers,

1357
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:11,660
他们会去找老肯尼迪
they're gonna get to Old Man Kennedy now.

1358
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,450

Okay? They're gonna get to him. He's a little sick, but...

1359
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:14,590
-病了  -是  但是...
- Sick? - Yeah. But...

1360
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:17,270
他那是中风了  不是病了
He had a fucking stroke. That's not sick.

1361
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:19,900
那是...那是将死之人了  好吧
That's you're... you're close to the grave, is what.

1362
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,690
他马上就毫无价值了
He's turning into a fucking eggplant.

1363
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,900
好吧  这也不能怪谁啊  这...
Okay. Well, you can't blame anybody for that. That's...

1364
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:25,380
我又没打算怪谁
I'm not looking to blame anybody.

1365
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:27,940
但真要怪谁的话  得怪肯尼迪小子们
But if there's any blame going around, it's the Kennedys.

1366
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:29,830
我可以告诉你  是他的儿子害死了他
His kids killed him. Let me tell you that.

1367
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:32,470
他还没死  但他快死了  快死了
He's not dead, but he's going. He's going.

1368
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:35,350
他们害死了他  他们能让任何人犯心脏病
They killed him. They'd give anybody a heart attack.

1369
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:45,580
{\an8}久病后于1969年去世
老约瑟夫·P·肯尼迪

1370
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,730
你要去哪
Where are you going?

1371
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,500
我去工作
I'm going to work.

1372
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:15,880
回去睡觉吧
Go back to sleep.

1373
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:51,040
{\an8}杜维尔

1374
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:08,210
我能说的是  我们不会罢休
All I can say is that, we will not stop.

1375
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:11,460
因为我们已经坚持了五十年
Because we've been doing that for 50 years!

1376
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:13,660
有什么好处
What good does it do?

1377
01:12:14,110 --> 01:12:16,890
让律师去开开卡车
Let the lawyers... Let the lawyers drive a truck.

1378
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:20,530
他们需要纸笔  需要印台
They need their pencils and papers and their ink pads.

1379
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,920
那完全是另一回事了
That's... That's a whole other story.

1380
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,110
但我们会挺过去的
But we're gonna get through this.

1381
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:29,360
他们用什么法律狗屁打压我们
We're gonna get through this legal bullshit

1382
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,560
我们会挺过去的
and garbage they're throwing at us.

1383
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,520
我们会挺过去的
We're gonna get through it because

1384
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,900
{\an8}新泽西卡车司机

1385
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,810
因为呆子肯尼迪想要什么  并不意味着
"Boobie" Kennedy wants something, that doesn't mean

1386
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:38,720
这个纨绔子弟就能得手
the rich boy is gonna get it.

1387
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:40,150
你们明白我的意思吧
You understand what I'm saying?

1388
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:43,270
我不在乎他要什么  反正他得不到
I don't care what he wants. He's not gonna get it!

1389
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:48,800
他得不到  因为
He's not gonna get it because

1390
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,760
我们是这个国家
we are the biggest and best,

1391
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:55,240
最庞大  最优秀
and most honest union

1392
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,500
最诚实的工会
in this country!

1393
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,380
对  没错
Yeah, that's right.

1394
01:12:58,380 --> 01:12:59,550
我就等着这个
I waited for that!

1395
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:07,710
你们知道我今天要讲的关键词是什么
And you know the operative word I'm talking about here.

1396
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:09,990
-团结  -对
- Solidarity. - Yeah!

1397
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:12,260
团结有效  对我们所有人都有效
And it works. It works for all of us.

1398
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:16,830
对我们的朋友弗兰克·菲茨西蒙斯有效
And it works for our friend here, Frank Fitzsimmons!

1399
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,130
这位是弗兰克·菲茨西蒙斯
Frank Fitzsimmons here,

1400
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,080
我的执行副主席
my executive vice president.

1401
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,430
如果有谁能胜任这份工作  那就是他
If there's anyone that can do this job, it's this man here.

1402
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,910
有他为我保驾护航
And with him at my back,

1403
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:30,470
我们一定会蒸蒸日上
where are we gonna go but up!

1404
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,690
对吗  菲茨
Is that right, Fitz?

1405
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:34,970
完全正确  吉米
All the way, Jimmy!

1406
01:13:34,970 --> 01:13:49,970
霍法  霍法  霍法
Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

1407
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:52,200
一个工会人
A union man!

1408
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:56,100
我觉得他们喜欢菲茨
You know, I felt they liked Fitz.

1409
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,160
毋庸置疑
No two ways about it.

1410
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,670
是  你提拔了菲茨
Yeah, you gave Fitz some buildup.

1411
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:01,300
希望他不会辜负你
I mean, I hope he deserves it.

1412
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,790
怎么说  菲茨有什么不妥吗
Why? What's wrong with Fitz?

1413
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:08,660
我说不好  我不想批评他
I don't know. I don't want to knock the guy,

1414
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:09,820
但我也说不好
but I... I don't know.

1415
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:12,300
你不用批评他  告诉我
Well, you're not knocking him. Just tell me...

1416
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:13,750
告诉我你的感受
Tell me what you feel.

1417
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,690
他很忠诚  这我可以确定
I mean, he's a loyal guy, I'm sure.

1418
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:18,400
他是个好人
He's a nice guy,

1419
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,010
但他不够敏锐  不够聪明
but he ain't that sharp. He ain't that smart.

1420
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:22,270
他还...
And he's also like a...

1421
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:24,520
他总打高尔夫球
He plays a lot of fucking golf, you know.

1422
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:25,590
他打高尔夫球
He plays golf?

1423
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:28,760
那又如何  二把手就需要这样的
So what? That's what you want from a number two.

1424
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,870
不需要太聪明的人
You don't want somebody too smart.

1425
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,670
需要一个好人  大家喜欢他
You want a nice guy. People like him, you know.

1426
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,480
不傻  但是个
Not dumb, but somebody,

1427
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:37,030
可以放心让他走在身后
you know you can have walking behind you

1428
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:39,060
而不怕被捅刀子的人
without getting knifed.

1429
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,330
-希望你是对的  -我总是对的
- Well, I hope you're right. - I'm always right.

1430
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:44,760
我可以对菲茨可以放一百个心
I can sleep like a babe with Fitz.

1431
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,420
我担心的是矮子
It's the Little Guy I have to worry about.

1432
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:49,990
你知道我说的是谁
You know what I'm saying.

1433
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:51,430
-是  -是
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1434
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:52,310
矮子
The Little Guy.

1435
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,130
-我担心的是他  -嗯
- That's my worry. - Yeah.

1436
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:56,720
那个王八蛋
That son of a bitch.

1437
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,540
怎么了
What's the matter?

1438
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:01,640
没事  没事  你是对的
Nothing. Nothing. You're right.

1439
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:03,640
我是对的  是的
I'm right. Yeah.

1440
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:06,110
-你不会觉得困惑吧  -完全不会
- You're not perplexed, are you? - Not at all. Not at all.

1441
01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:09,650
我和你说了我对菲茨的感受  至于普罗  你懂的
I mean, I told you how I felt about Fitz. Pro. You know.

1442
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:11,570
好  那就好  因为有时我觉得
Yeah. Good, because sometimes I feel

1443
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:14,770
只有我一个人看穿了那个狗杂种
I'm the only one who sees right through that cocksucker.

Tony Pro was so fucking worried

01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:27,320
这家伙会击败他
that this guy was gonna beat him out

1478
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,020
以至于在让小虫萨利勒死他之后
that after he had Sally Bugs strangle the guy,

1479
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:32,720
还让萨利把他塞进了碎树机
he had Sally stick him in a fucking tree shredder.

1480

这样就再也没有竞争了
That way there'd be no competition,

1481

毕竟他已经粉身碎骨了
not even from the grave.

1482
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:37,180
他已经失控了
He's out of control.

1483
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,810
拿这种人该怎么办
What are you gonna do with a person like this?

1484
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:42,470
他想从每个人那都分杯羹

四处威胁人
Threatening people.

1488
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:49,570
偶尔威胁威胁人
I mean, you know, threatening people once in a while,

1489
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:51,070
没问题  我能理解
okay, I understand.

1490
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:52,060
但一直威胁人呢
But all the time?

1491
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:55,720
会让人注意到我们  你明白吗
It's drawing attention to us, you understand?

1492
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:59,100
那样的家伙会毁了工会的声誉
Guys like that give the unions a bad name.

1493
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:01,720
得做点什么了
Something's got to be done.

1494
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:04,720
我说真的  得做点什么了
I mean it. Something's gotta be done.

1495
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:07,970
托尼毕竟是托尼...
Tony being Tony, uh...

1496
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:10,930
不好...不好弄  我们不能...
that ain't... that ain't easy. We can't...

1497
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:12,350
我不是那个意思  我不是
I don't mean that. I don't...

1498
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:13,930
不是那个意思
Not... Not that.

1499
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:14,930
我只是
Yeah, I'm just...

1500
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,530
我只是想让劳工阶层
I'm just saying get working guys

1501
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:20,150
那些熟悉工会的  卡车司机工会的正式成员
who know the unions, card-carrying Teamsters,

1502
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:21,060
就像你我这样的
like you and me.

1503
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:23,100
开始竞选
Start running,

1504
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,020
接管几个地方工会
take over some of the locals.

1505
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:26,470
你觉得呢
What do you think?

1506
01:18:27,450 --> 01:18:29,070
-他不会喜欢的  -谁
- He ain't gonna like that. - Who?

1507
01:18:29,070 --> 01:18:31,020
去他的  他算什么东西
Fuck him. Who the fuck is he?

1508
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:32,140
地痞流氓罢了
He's a gangster.

1509
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:34,350
我领导着工会  我是主席
I run the union, I'm the president.

1510
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:35,680
我的意思是
So, I mean...

1511
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:39,720
我所需要的是一些懂事的家伙
All I need is some guys who know their ways around.

1512
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:42,180
知道怎么把控自己
Know how to handle themselves, you know.

1513
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:42,970
仅此而已
That's all.

1514
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:45,890
所以我想让你去竞选
That's why I want you to run for president

1515
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:48,310
326号地方工会的主席
of Local 326.

1516
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:53,020
你就是我的家人  弗兰克
You're like family to me, Frank. You know.

1517
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:54,970
你  艾琳
You, Irene,

1518
01:18:55,610 --> 01:18:56,470
孩子们
the girls.

1519
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:57,890
可爱的佩琪
The lovely Peggy.

1520
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:00,560
但这并不是我这么做的原因
But that's not why I'm doing this.

1521
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:03,680
我给你的一切都是你自己赢得的
I'm not giving you anything you didn't earn,

1522
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,350
都是你应得的
you didn't deserve.

1523
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:07,770
你觉得呢
What do you think?

1524
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:12,810
我不知道该说什么了  吉米
I...I don't know what to say, Jimmy.

1525
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:15,100
-我是说...  -只管说你愿意就好
- I mean, um... - Well, just say you'll do it.

1526
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:17,310
你只需要说愿意
That's all you got to say.

1527
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:20,060
而且  我能保证你会赢
Plus, I can guarantee you're gonna win.

1528
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:22,890
你只要竞选326号地方工会的主席
Ha! When you run for president

1529
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:26,560
你就一定会赢
of 326, you're gonna win.

1530
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:29,100
我保证
I guarantee it.

1531
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:32,100
好  没问题  我愿意
Yeah, okay, I'll do it. Yeah.

1532
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:34,810
认真的吗
You mean it, huh?

1533
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,970
当然  我很荣幸
Yeah, yeah. I'm... I'm honored.

1534
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,240
我爱你  我真的爱你  抱一个
I love you. I just love you, you know. Come here.

1535
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,680
我爱你  伙计
I love you, man.

1536
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,060
爱到难以言表
I can't tell ya.

1537
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:44,280
天
Oh, gee.

1538
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,140
太好了
This is so good, you know.

1539
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:48,060
我终于能喘口气了
I feel like I can breathe again.

1540
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,470
太有意思了
It's so funny. I...

1541
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:50,890
不知怎么地  我...
Somehow I...

1542
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:54,890
我也不知道  我以为你会拒绝
I don't know. I thought you would've said no.

1543
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,930
我很高兴你答应了
I'm glad you said yes.

1544
01:19:58,700 --> 01:19:59,470
我想说
I mean...

1545
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:01,310
弗兰克
Frank...

1546
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:06,270
你从来不显露情绪  很难判断
You never reveal how you feel, you know. It's hard to tell.

1547
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:08,600
我很荣幸  吉米  我不知道
I'm honored, Jimmy. I don't know...

1548
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,740
我只是不知道该说什么
It's just I don't know what to... say,

1549
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:12,350
但是我很荣幸
you know, but I'm honored.

1550
01:20:13,490 --> 01:20:14,560
那就好
Well, that's good.

1551
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:17,890
让我感觉很好
That makes me feel good.

1552
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:20,560
我能喘口气了
I can breathe.

1553
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:23,100
太好了
That's so great.

1554
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:25,850
我
I...

1555
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:54,070
{\an8}卡车司机326号地方工会

1556
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:57,350
我还能说什么  我的一切都是吉米给的
What can I say? I mean, I owe it all to Jimmy.

1557
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:00,940
他把我从运肉卡车中解救出来  给了我新的开始
He took me out of a meat truck, he gave me my start.

1558
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:04,520
他给我了首个职位  他给了我第一个工会
He gave me my first charter. He gave me my first union.

1559
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:07,180
-你好  -你好
- How are ya? - Hey, how are you?

1560
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,190
我是弗兰克·希兰  326号地方工会的新任主席
Frank Sheeran, the new president of Union 326.

1561
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,600
-我来自我介绍一下  -很高兴认识你
- I wanted to introduce myself. - Nice to meet ya.

1562
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:14,490
-你叫什么  -我叫阿尔
- What's your name? - My name's Al.

1563
01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:15,770
阿尔  很高兴认识你
Al. Nice to meet ya, Al.

1564
01:21:16,450 --> 01:21:18,770
-一点心意  -不  不用
- A little something... - No, no. Don't need it.

1565
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:19,850
-确定吗  -当然
- Sure? - Yeah.

1566
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:21,740
只是过来问个好  自我介绍一下
Just came here to say hello, introduce myself.

1567
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:23,940
有什么需要  只管联系我  好吗
You need anything, just get in touch with me. Okay?

1568
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:24,990
-你确定吗  -当然
- You sure? - Yeah.

1569
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:25,640
谢谢
Thank you.

1570
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:28,110
{\an8}弗兰克·希兰  326号地方工会主席

1571
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:27,860
所以  我们假设  如果他们能证明
So, hypothetically, if they can prove

1572
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:28,860
你从他们那偷了东西
that you stole from them,

1573
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:31,850
他们会想要你供出同伙的名字
what they're gonna want are names, so...

1574
01:21:33,530 --> 01:21:36,810
你愿意交代几个名字  免去牢狱之灾吗
Would you be willing to give up names to keep from going to jail?

1575
01:21:37,570 --> 01:21:38,310
不
No.

1576
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:40,940
那你就没什么好担心的了
Okay. So you got nothing to worry about.

1577
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:44,180
-律师会帮你摆平的  -谢谢  希兰先生
- The lawyers will take care of it. - Thank you, Mr. Sheeran.

1578
01:21:53,610 --> 01:21:57,850
沿80号州际公路西段开过宾州
The Interstate 80 West through the rest of Pennsylvania,

1579
01:21:58,150 --> 01:22:01,970
然后我们横穿俄亥俄州到托莱多
and then we'd go across Ohio all the way to Toledo,

1580
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:06,270
接着我们沿着75号公路北上底特律
and then we'd go 75 North to Detroit.

1581
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:09,310
依然能够准时到达
And we'd still get there on time.

1582
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,570
法官阁下  法律顾问已经告诉我的委托人
Your Honor, my client had been advised by counsel

1583
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:16,780
她妻子作为货运公司所有者之一
that it was perfectly legal for his wife

1584
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:18,970
是完全合法的
to be part owner of a trucking business.

1585
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:22,240
而在麦克莱伦委员会质询其合法性时
Still, when the McClellan Committee challenged its legality,

1586
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:22,240
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}美国参议院针对工人
及管理层不当行为特别委员会

1587
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,060
她第一时间退出了公司
she withdrew from the company immediately.

1588
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:26,430
事情到此就该告一段落
That should be the end of the matter.

1589
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:29,650
在十三次大陪审团调查中
There had been not one indictment served

1590
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:32,930
我的委托人没有一次被判有罪
against my client in 13 grand jury investigations.

1591
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:36,430
法官阁下  这是典型的
Your Honor, this is an example of

1592
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:38,930
对我的委托人和他的家人的恶意报复
a personal vendetta against my client,

1593
01:22:38,990 --> 01:22:42,650
是令人失望的司法部和司法部长罗伯特·肯尼迪
against his family, by a frustrated Justice Department

1594
01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:45,060
在针对我的委托人
and the attorney general, Robert Kennedy.

1595
01:22:51,650 --> 01:22:52,640
他手上有枪
He's got a gun!

1596
01:22:57,820 --> 01:22:59,470
把枪先抢下来
Get that gun out of his hand!

1597
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,020
别激动  小伙子
Easy, boy.

1598
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:11,780
那不是真枪吧
That was not a real gun, was it?

1599
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:12,810
枪是怎么进来的
How'd that gun get in?

1600
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,360
怎么进来的
How'd it get in here?

1601
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:15,720
又不是我的错
It wasn't my fault!

1602
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:16,970
我也不知道
I don't know!

1603
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:18,680
我的查奇
My Chuckie!

1604
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:20,390
这是我儿子
Hey, it's my son!

1605
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:23,020
这是我的孩子  我把他养大的
That's my kid. I raised this kid.

1606
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:24,890
你们看见了吗  看见他的英勇之举了吗
You see him? You see what he did?

1607
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:28,690
我告诉你们
I'll tell you this.

1608
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:31,470
他冲我开了枪  感觉像是小弹丸似的
He shot at me, and it was like a pellet or something.

1609
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:33,900
没什么感觉  就一点点冲击力
I didn't feel it, I just felt a little impact,

1610
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:35,970
甚至还比不上被BB枪打了
like I was shot not even with a BB gun.

1611
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:37,850
比BB枪更弱
Something even lighter.

1612
01:23:38,070 --> 01:23:39,180
但我冲向了他
But I charged him.

1613
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:41,360
我和查奇都冲向了他  如果你们看见了的话
I charged him and so did Chuckie, if you noticed.

1614
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,220
我把他教得很好
I taught him well.

1615
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:46,020
遇到持枪的永远要冲上去
You charge a guy, always charge a guy with a gun.

1616
01:23:46,490 --> 01:23:47,810
如果是持刀的跑就行了
With a knife, you run away.

1617
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,680
遇到持刀的就跑  持枪的就冲
Run away from a knife. So you charge with a gun,

1618
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,020
-持刀的就跑  -没错
- with a knife, you run. - That's right.

1619
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:54,770
我还押韵了
Hey! I rhymed!

1620
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:59,070
我知道很难让人相信  但我收到了上头的消息
I know it sounds crazy, but I got a message from a higher power

1621
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:01,280
{\an8}田纳西州纳什维尔警局

1622
01:23:59,070 --> 01:24:00,610
让我杀了吉米·霍法
telling me to shoot Jimmy Hoffa.

1623

1628
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:10,650

Eddie Partin, you know the guy from Baton Rouge,

1629

他也在这里

1630
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:13,030
好  我马上过去
Yeah. Yeah, I'll get right down.

1631

Out of my way, boys. Come on.

1632

让让
Come on, come on.

1633
01:24:22,450 --> 01:24:24,110
布伦南先生是否先说了
Did Mr. Brennan first say,

1634
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:25,780
或者你是否记得他首先说了
or do you remember him first saying

1635
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:28,470
像是"我要更改交易条款
something about, say, "I had to change the deal.

1636
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:30,900
我得让霍法也分一杯羹"这样的话
I have to cut Hoffa in on the new deal"?

1637
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:33,310
这不就是整件事的源头吗
Wasn't that like the chronology of the whole thing?

1638
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:36,280
我不知道他变更了交易条款
I don't know he changed the deal,

1639
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:39,820
但我在电话这头的理解是
but it was my understanding over the telephone that Brennan

1640
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:41,070
布伦南只代表了他自己
was speaking for himself.

1641
01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:43,350
她看上去很愤怒  这一看就很愤怒
She's an angry woman. That's an angry woman.

1642
01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:44,180
是啊

1643
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,440
-我想她曾经是个老师  -没错
- She was a teacher I think. - Oh, that's right.

1644
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:47,810
我们现在研究的是这个
What we're looking at is this one.

1645
01:24:48,110 --> 01:24:49,400
这个可不好搞定
This one is not approachable.

1646
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:50,930
她很难攻破
No, she'd be a tough nut to crack.

1647
01:24:51,110 --> 01:24:52,690
有很多家族财产
There's a lot of family money there.

1648
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,400
...将会截停搜查

1649
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,020
所有驶往古巴的船只
all ships bound for Cuba.

1650
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,240
若船长不停船
If the ships' captains do not stop,

1651
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,930
我们将采取武力截停
force will be used to stop them.

1652
01:25:00,150 --> 01:25:01,440
如果船停下...
If the ships do stop...

1653
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:03,690
我觉得可以选这个
See, I think there's an in here...

1654
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:04,440
你是否对大陪审团
Did you make this statement

1655
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:06,600
做出过如下陈述
to the grand jury? I'll read it for you.

1656
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:08,190
"布伦南过来跟我说了些
"Brennan came to me and said words

1657
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:09,900
类似于他要继续的话..."
to the effect he's gonna go ahead..."

1658
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:11,190
他开了家餐厅
He's got a restaurant.

1659
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:12,440
你查过违法行为了吗
Did you look into violations?

1660
01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:14,320
查了  我更愿意选女人
Yeah. I'd rather stick with the women.

1661
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:15,530
-她们更好搞定  -吉米  谢谢
- They're more approachable. - Jimmy, thank you.

1662
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:19,440
...已在古巴部署可用的中程导弹
...in Cuba of operational medium-range missiles.

1663
01:25:19,450 --> 01:25:21,940
他还表示如果导弹发射
He added that if one of the missiles is launched,

1664
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,470
可能会携带有核弹头
it would probably carry a nuclear warhead.

1665
01:25:24,610 --> 01:25:27,610
能够打击美国东南部任何地区
It could hit any spot in the southeast United States,

1666
01:25:27,610 --> 01:25:28,810
以及华盛顿南部
south of Washington.

1667
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:31,530
而我们无法拦截
And that we would have no way of intercepting it

1668
01:25:31,530 --> 01:25:33,430
也无法提前预警
or issuing a warning about it.

1669
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:36,100
这位嫁给了一个叫普莱切特的州警
This one's married to a state trooper named Plechette.

1670
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:37,680
不错
That's good.

1671
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:39,720
有门路吗
We know anyone?

1672
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:42,970
有  地方工会有个当过警察的
Well, yeah, we got an ex-cop in the Local.

1673
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:44,180
很好
That's good.

1674
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,390
我们的所有部队都提高了警戒级别
All our forces have been put on increased alert.

1675
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:10,610
过来跟我聊了几句  大意是
...came to me and said words to the effect

1676
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:13,570
他打算开家公司出租卡车
he's gonna go ahead and set up a company to lease trucks.

1677
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:16,440
但之后  他又打电话  他的原话是
But later, he called me on the phone and said quote,

1678
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:18,070
"我要更改交易条款
"I gotta change the deal

1679
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:20,560
因为我要让霍法也分一杯羹"
'cause I gotta cut Hoffa in on the deal."

1680
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:22,100
是这样吗  先生
Is that accurate, sir?

1681
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,100
这是另一个可以下手的对象
This one's another possibility.

1682
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,030
-等等  -她有过情人
- Wait. - Well, she had a boyfriend,

1683
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:28,180
她婚后还跟别人有一腿
she's seeing somebody else while she's married.

1684
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,820
所以可以用这个要挟她
So it could be... It could grab her,

1685
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:31,780
-抓着她不放  -对  但是...
- hold on to her. - Yeah, but...

1686
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:32,720

1688

车还没付钱

01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,930
如果你去参加并被请求发言  你会说什么
If you were to go and asked to speak, what would you say?

1757
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,470
我会说
I'd say, uh,

1758
01:29:59,070 --> 01:30:01,220
鲍比·肯尼迪现在只是个普通律师了
Bobby Kennedy is just another lawyer now.

1759
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:08,180
混蛋
Son of a bitch.

1760
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,320
{\an8}国际卡车司机工会

1761
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,100
很好  埃里克  非常感谢
Good, Eric. Thank you very much.

1762
01:30:35,110 --> 01:30:36,470
吉米说得对
Jimmy was right.

1763
01:30:38,150 --> 01:30:39,140
几乎是对的
Almost.

1764
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:42,600
鲍比的刁难到此为止了
That was the end of it with Bobby.

1765
01:30:43,820 --> 01:30:46,600
他卸任司法部长了  事情了结了
So much for him being the attorney general. That was done.

1766
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:53,060
鲍比跟我们的宿怨结束了
Bobby's vendetta was over, with us.

1767
01:30:59,030 --> 01:30:59,890
霍法先生
Mr. Hoffa,

1768
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:03,110
你因损害了这个国家的灵魂
you stand here convicted of having tampered

1769
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:05,060
被判有罪
with the very soul of this nation.

1770
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:08,600
但纳什维尔那个陪审团的事情还没完
But there was still that jury thing in Nashville.

1771
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,930
先生  这个国家的灵魂在于
The soul of this nation, sir,

1772
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:14,060
它神圣的司法程序
lies in its sacred processes of justice.

1773
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:16,100
正义必须得到伸张
Justice must be done.

1774
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:19,720
你因为曾邪恶地企图破坏这套程序
And for your wicked attempts to corrupt these processes,

1775
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:22,970
将会受到法律的制裁
justice will be done on you.

1776
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:25,970
我们终于抓到他了
We got him now.

1777
01:31:26,150 --> 01:31:27,240
我们抓到他了
We got him.

1778
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:30,430
女士们先生们  我们做到了
Ladies and gentlemen, we did it!

1779
01:31:32,450 --> 01:31:36,490
{\an8}囚车不作鸣枪警示

1780
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:50,390
但是吉米把一切都安排妥当了
But Jimmy, you know, he had it all set up.

1781
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:53,940
虽然表面看起来是
Although you knew it was supposed to look like Fitz

1782
01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:55,430
菲茨在管事
was the one in charge.

1783
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:57,470
但他通过比尔·巴法利诺和
He gave Fitz his orders through

1784
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:00,740
{\an8}詹姆斯·R·霍法

1785
01:31:57,470 --> 01:31:59,190
艾伦·多夫曼给菲茨下指令
Bill Bufalino and Allen Dorfman,

1786
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:00,770
他们还替吉米放贷
and they ran Jimmy's loans.

1787
01:32:00,990 --> 01:32:02,810
在里面待得还好吗  一切都...
But things are good in here? Everything is...

1788
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:03,990
一切都糟透了
Everything's terrible.

1789
01:32:03,990 --> 01:32:05,900
夜不能寐  因为担心
You don't sleep at night 'cause you're afraid

1790
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:07,990
有人会拿刀捅你
someone's gonna knife you.

1791
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:09,400
但你看上去不错  还不错
'Cause you look okay. You look okay.

1792
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:11,520
菲茨在哪  他迟到了
Where's Fitz? He's late.

1793
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,900
我们本来要在正门等他的  他...
Yeah. Well, we were gonna meet him in the front. He...

1794
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:15,890
在正门等他吗
Meet him in the front?

1795
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:16,990
他来了  他来了
Here he is, here he is.

1796
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:19,570
你到底去哪了  你来这干什么
Where the hell have you been? What are you doing here?

1797
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:21,350
你到底来干什么  菲茨
Why did you even come at all, Fitz?

1798
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:23,110
你知道自己迟到了吗
You know, are you aware you're late?

1799
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:24,690
我就想知道这个  你知道自己迟到了吗
That's all I want to know. Do you know you're late?

1800
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:25,450
对不起我迟到了  吉米
I'm sorry I'm late, Jimmy,

1801
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:27,070
但我们有很多事要做
but we got a lot going on.

1802
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:28,030
我们有很多事要做
We got a lot going on.

1803
01:32:28,030 --> 01:32:30,740
我不想听这种话  我想听点具体的
I don't wanna hear that. I wanna hear something concrete,

1804
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:32,850
我想听你直入正题
I wanna hear something straight on.

1805
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:35,560
我只想请你耐心一点
I'm just gonna ask you to be a little more patient.

1806
01:32:35,570 --> 01:32:36,360
我觉得我们会...
I think we're gonna have...

1807
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:38,770
我在坐牢  不会太耐心
I'm inside here. I'm not gonna be too patient.

1808
01:32:39,030 --> 01:32:42,180
尽管吉米对菲茨很不爽
As much as Jimmy was getting pissed off at Fitz,

1809
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:43,900
其他人还是喜欢他  因为
everybody else liked him because

1810
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:46,280
他们可以从他那里得到想要的一切
they could get anything out of him that they wanted.

1811
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:48,140
这是他们不能从吉米那得到的
They couldn't do that with Jimmy.

1812
01:32:49,610 --> 01:32:52,390
如果进了监狱  难免会发生这种事情
That's what happens when you go away to college.

1813
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:53,430
打得怎么样
How's that?

1814
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:57,600
吉米生菲茨的气
Jimmy's pissed off with Fitz.

1815
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:01,350
菲茨还不错  我们喜欢他
Fitz is okay. We like Fitz.

1816
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:02,970
我告诉你问题出在哪
I'll tell you what the problem is.

1817
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:05,120
吉米让那个难缠的多夫曼
Jimmy's got that ballbusting Dorfman

1818
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:08,430
拖延菲茨已经同意的贷款
holding up loans that Fitz already okayed.

1819
01:33:09,950 --> 01:33:11,030
我讨厌那个多夫曼
I hate that Dorfman.

1820
01:33:11,030 --> 01:33:13,390
他是个令人头疼的犹太人
He's such a pain-in-the-ass fucking Jew.

1821
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:18,060
你想让我怎么办
What do you want me to do?

1822
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:21,220
不  先别那样  先别那样
No, not that. Not that.

1823
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:24,020
你要做的就是
What you gotta do is, you know,

1824
01:33:24,030 --> 01:33:26,470
警告一下多夫曼
put a firecracker up Dorfman's ass.

1825
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:28,930
菲茨会明白的
Fitz'll get the message.

1826
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:30,890
他会明白的
He'll get the message.

1827
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,520
你不能对菲茨下手  因为如果...
I mean, you can't do it to Fitz because if...

1828
01:33:34,110 --> 01:33:35,110
如果你对那个酒鬼下手
if you do it to that lush,

1829
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:37,270
他会直接去找联调局  搞砸一切
he'll run right to the feds and screw up everything.

1830
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:39,270
但多夫曼
But Dorfman...

1831
01:33:40,030 --> 01:33:41,470
你要对多夫曼下手
You gotta do it to Dorfman.

1832
01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:56,100
{\an7}Cry - Johnnie Ray & The Four Lads

1833

1835
01:34:12,570 --> 01:34:20,220
{\an9}♪ If your heartaches Seem to hang around ♪

1836
01:34:19,950 --> 01:34:22,350
菲茨  菲茨明白我们的意思了
Fitz... Fitz got the message.

1837
01:34:25,490 --> 01:34:27,570
从此以后  任何人想从养老基金里
After that, anybody who wanted anything

1838
01:34:27,570 --> 01:34:30,020
捞一笔  都能得偿所愿
from the pension fund, they got it.

1839
01:34:34,490 --> 01:34:36,870
老是翻到这张牌
The thing keeps comin' around. Keeps comin' around.

1840
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:38,020
怎么回事
What's goin' on?

1841
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:40,020
-搞什么  -这家伙是谁
- Fuck is this? - Who's this guy?

1842
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:41,390
谁让你进来的
Who let you in?

1843
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:45,330
普罗文扎诺先生
Mr. Provenzano.

1844
01:34:45,330 --> 01:34:46,610
我是联调局的迪格雷奥里奥探员
I'm Agent DiGregorio of the FBI.

1845
01:34:46,610 --> 01:34:48,390
我有你的逮捕令  请站起来
I have a warrant for your arrest. Please stand.

1846
01:34:48,410 --> 01:34:49,420
我能把手里的牌打完吗
Can I finish my hand?

1847
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:50,640
不行  先生  请站起来
No, sir. Please stand.

1848
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:52,520
反正我手气烂透了
I had a bad fucking hand anyway.

1849
01:34:51,950 --> 01:34:59,070

人缘很好  于2001年2月23日寿终正寝

1850
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:53,770
牌才打到一半
Middle of the game.

1851
01:34:54,490 --> 01:34:55,810
让他一起打吧
Join the club. Deal him in.

1852
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:57,190
请伸另一只手
Other arm, please.

1853
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:58,890
-我能拿我的包吗  -不行  先生
- Can I get my bags? - No, sir.

1854
01:34:59,030 --> 01:35:01,780
我口袋里什么都没有  我穿着短裤呢
I got nothing in my pocket. I got fucking shorts on here.

1855
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:03,140
看看那边那只企鹅
Look at this penguin over there, huh?

1856
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:05,430
托尼  你能帮我拿下包吗
Hey, Tony, will you get my bags?

1857
01:35:05,490 --> 01:35:06,970
行  我会帮你拿包
Yeah, I'll get your bags.

1858
01:35:06,990 --> 01:35:08,520
这就像在看电视
This is like watchin' TV.

1859
01:35:10,110 --> 01:35:13,140
普罗因为敲诈被抓  判了七年
They got Pro for extortion and gave him seven years.

1860
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:16,060
把他送去了路易斯堡监狱
And they sent him to Lewisburg prison.

1861
01:35:16,650 --> 01:35:18,060
他和谁落在一起了
So who does he end up with?

1862
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:19,390
吉米
Jimmy.

1863
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:29,850
瞧瞧这个
Look at that.

1864
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:31,890
简直是艺术品
A work of art.

1865
01:35:32,450 --> 01:35:33,680
谢谢  皮特
Thank you, Pete.

1866
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:44,470
我要跟你谈谈养老金的问题
I gotta talk to you about a problem I got with my pension.

1867
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:48,810
我知道
I know.

1868
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:50,970
你知道
You know?

1869
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:53,140
你知道什么
What do you know?

1870
01:35:54,610 --> 01:35:55,270
我知道
I know

1871
01:35:56,110 --> 01:35:57,390
你有120万
you got a million two

1872
01:35:57,820 --> 01:36:00,390
而且出了问题
and, uh, there's a problem with it.

1873
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:04,020
那你会帮我查查吗
So you'll look into it for me?

1874
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:07,020
我要怎么查  我能查什么
How am I going to look into it? What am I gonna look into?

1875
01:36:07,990 --> 01:36:09,310
就这么回事
It is what it is.

1876
01:36:09,950 --> 01:36:10,810
怎么回事
Well, what is it?

1877
01:36:11,650 --> 01:36:12,520
这笔钱没了
You lost it.

1878
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:16,640
你进来时它就被没收了  就是这样
You forfeited it when you came in here. That's it.

1879
01:36:18,490 --> 01:36:19,850
所以你的也被没收了吗
So is yours forfeited too?

1880
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:20,930
没有
No.

1881
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:26,850
我们先理清楚  你的钱还在
Ok, let me get this straight. So yours is still there,

1882
01:36:27,450 --> 01:36:29,560
你的150万什么的
your million five, whatever it is,

1883
01:36:29,610 --> 01:36:30,640
但我的钱没了
but mine's gone?

1884
01:36:31,950 --> 01:36:33,810
对  我的钱还在
Yeah. Mine's still there.

1885
01:36:36,990 --> 01:36:38,470
但我俩现在都在牢里
But we're both sitting here.

1886
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:40,680
我俩都在牢里  没错
We're both sitting here. That's right.

1887
01:36:41,070 --> 01:36:42,970
不过我俩坐牢的原因不同
Only we're sitting here for different things.

1888
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:46,100
你是因为敲诈
You're sitting here for extortion.

1889
01:36:46,610 --> 01:36:48,930
我是因为欺诈
I'm sitting here for fraud.

1890
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:52,350
-那又怎样  -怎样  是有差别的
- So? - So? So there's a difference.

1891
01:36:52,650 --> 01:36:53,810
什么差别
What's the difference?

1892
01:36:56,950 --> 01:36:59,820
我没威胁任何人  但你威胁了
I didn't threaten anybody, you did.

1893
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:01,570
那又怎样  根本说不通
So what? That makes no sense.

1894
01:37:01,570 --> 01:37:02,780
当然说得通
What do you mean? It does.

1895
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:04,650
不  我不想跟你辩论
No, it doesn't. I don't want a debate.

1896
01:37:04,650 --> 01:37:06,970
-想想看  -我在想了  吉米
- Think about it. - I'm thinking about it, Jimmy.

1897
01:37:07,110 --> 01:37:08,640
别唬我  吉米
No, don't fuck with me, Jimmy.

1898
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:09,970
做点什么
Just do something about it.

1899
01:37:15,070 --> 01:37:16,680
"做点什么"是什么意思
What do you mean, "do something about it"?

1900
01:37:16,950 --> 01:37:17,820
我能做什么
What am I gonna do?

1901
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:19,360
拜托  你总有办法
Come on, there's always something you can do.

1902
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,810
不  联邦法律我没办法
No. It's federal law.

1903
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:22,570
-我不管  -你不管
- I don't care. - You don't care?

1904
01:37:22,570 --> 01:37:24,430
你还是能做点什么
No, you can still do something about it.

1905
01:37:25,150 --> 01:37:26,990
我无能为力  我能做什么
There's nothing I can do. What can I do?

1906
01:37:26,990 --> 01:37:28,360
把我的钱拿回来
You can get my fucking money.

1907
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:29,020
怎么拿
How?

1908
01:37:29,070 --> 01:37:30,440
-找个办法  -什么办法
- Some other way. - What way?

1909
01:37:30,450 --> 01:37:31,990
你怎么拿回你的钱  你就怎么帮我
The same way you got your money.

1910
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:34,100
小点声
Lower your fucking voice.

1911
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:36,740
你让我小点声
You telling me to lower my voice?

1912
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:37,940
我让你小点声
I'm tellin' you to lower your fucking voice.

1913
01:37:37,950 --> 01:37:38,900
鳖孙
Cocksucker.

1914
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:40,490
-别叫我鳖孙  -去你的
- Don't call me a cocksucker. - Fuck you.

1915
01:37:40,490 --> 01:37:42,140
你再骂我试试
Don't you fucking dare.

1916
01:37:43,450 --> 01:37:45,020
你是因为欺诈进来的
Look, you're here for fraud.

1917
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:47,030
-你偷钱  -我偷钱
- You stole money. - I stole money?

1918
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:47,690
我也偷钱
Yeah, I stole money.

1919
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:49,600
好吧  偷的手段不同  尽管如此
Okay, fine, in a different way, but still,

1920
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:51,770
我要我应得的那份
I want what I'm fucking owed.

1921
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:55,570
你们这些人
You people. You people.

1922
01:37:55,570 --> 01:37:56,940
-你说什么  -天啊
- What did you say? - Oh, my God!

1923
01:37:56,950 --> 01:37:57,610
你说什么
What did you say?

1924
01:37:57,610 --> 01:37:59,060
得了吧  还我说什么
Oh, come on, what I said.

1925
01:37:59,070 --> 01:38:00,190
我说什么
What the fuck did I say?

1926
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:01,820
你说了"你们这些人"
"You people." You said "You people."

1927
01:38:01,820 --> 01:38:03,650
那是什么意思  "你们这些人"
What does that fucking mean, "You people"?

1928
01:38:03,650 --> 01:38:04,470
我不想
I'm done

1929
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:06,970
再谈这事了
talking about this.

1930
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:09,140
-解释一下"你们这些人"  -我不谈了
- "You people"? - I'm done!

1931
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:11,640
你不谈了  看我不把你脑袋拧下来
You're done? I'll rip your fucking head off!

1932
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:13,180
你个人渣
Fucking piece of shit!

1933
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,520
我要杀了你
I'll fucking kill you!

1934
01:38:18,530 --> 01:38:21,270
我要杀了你  混账
I'll fucking kill you. Motherfucker!

1935
01:38:21,450 --> 01:38:22,390
搞什么
What the fuck...

1936
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:30,640
那时候你就知道一切将分崩离析
Right then, you knew it was all gonna fall apart.

1937
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:02,490
我不敢相信那个疯狂的王八蛋
I can't believe that crazy bastard

1938
01:39:02,490 --> 01:39:03,360
竟然觉得自己
thought he could do that

1939
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:07,110
能在哥伦布广场当着五千人的面得逞
right there at Columbus Circle, in front of 5,000 people

1940
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:08,350
还能逃脱
and get away with it.

1941
01:39:08,450 --> 01:39:11,360
我不敢相信  那可不对  弗兰克
I can't believe it. That is not right, Frankie.

1942
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:12,520
那可不对
That is not right.

1943
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:15,310
那人是个彻头彻尾的混蛋
That is a total piece of shit.

1944
01:39:15,650 --> 01:39:17,020
那人是个混蛋
That's a piece of shit.

1945
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:19,820
只有一个人有胆量
There's only one guy who would have the balls,

1946
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:22,930
有勇气那么做
the nerve, the audacity to do that.

1947
01:39:32,030 --> 01:39:34,850
城里叫他金发乔伊
He was known Downtown as "Joey the Blond,"

1948
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:38,100
但所有人  尤其是报纸
but everybody, especially the newspapers,

1949
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:40,220
都叫他疯子乔
called him "Crazy Joe."

1950
01:39:40,950 --> 01:39:42,070
...向上帝发誓
...shall be the truth,

1951
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:45,030
你所说的全是事实  没有任何隐瞒
the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1952
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:46,600
-我发誓  -请坐
- I do. - Be seated.

1953
01:39:48,990 --> 01:39:51,680
加洛先生  你要做开庭陈述吗
Mr. Gallo, do you have an opening statement?

1954
01:39:53,530 --> 01:39:54,220
要
Yeah.

1955
01:39:57,450 --> 01:39:59,680
这地毯特别适合玩掷骰子
This carpet would be great for a crap game.

1956
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:04,950
罗素说得对
Russ was right.

1957
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:08,600
还有谁会像他那样和娱乐圈的人鬼混
I mean, who the hell else runs around with show business people like that,

1958
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:11,060
成天到晚让报纸记者给他拍照
getting his picture taken in the papers all the time,

1959
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:12,270
{\an8}卡巴纳宫酒店

1960
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:14,170
想方设法吸引大家的注意力  搞什么
drawing attention to himself and everybody. What is that?

1961
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:16,430
他以为自己是谁  明星埃罗尔·弗林吗
Who does he think he is, Errol Flynn?

1962
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:19,470
他跟所有人和事对着干
He went against everything and everybody.

1963
01:40:19,470 --> 01:40:20,550
什么都不在乎
Just didn't give a shit.

1964
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:23,730
年轻的时候  他绑架了自己的老大
And, growing up, he kidnapped his own bosses.

1965
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:25,450
我不知道他是怎么逃脱的
I don't know how he got away with that.

1966
01:40:25,450 --> 01:40:28,170
一般人没法逃脱  绑架老大就是死路一条
You don't get away with that. You do that, you die.

1967
01:40:28,710 --> 01:40:29,650
就这么简单
That simple.

1968
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:31,290
他坐牢的时候
When he went away to the can,

1969
01:40:31,290 --> 01:40:34,110
招募了黑人而不是白人
he recruited black guys instead of his own kind.

1970
01:40:34,210 --> 01:40:36,230
等他出狱  没人知道他在做什么
And when he got out, nobody knew what he was doing,

1971
01:40:36,230 --> 01:40:37,480
跟谁一起做
or who he was doing with it.

1972
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:39,850
我们不知道是什么情况  没人知道
We didn't know what the hell was going on. Nobody did.

1973
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:42,190
如果你不喜欢他的做法
And if you don't like what he's doing,

1974
01:40:42,260 --> 01:40:43,450
你出声抱怨
and you say something,

1975
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:45,280
然后你就等着看会发生什么吧
then you see what happens.

1976
01:41:10,890 --> 01:41:16,070
{\an8}意大利裔美国人人权联盟

1977
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:16,460
谁会做那种事  谁会那么办事
Who does something like that? Who does things like that?

1978
01:41:16,670 --> 01:41:18,180
我告诉你
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

1979
01:41:19,390 --> 01:41:20,700
这个无赖
This disgraziato.

1980
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:23,310
他和奥斯瓦尔德是一类的
Him and Oswald. Two of a kind.

1981
01:41:23,310 --> 01:41:25,770
至少在达拉斯  那些孩子不在
At least in Dallas, the kids weren't there.

1982
01:41:25,770 --> 01:41:26,780
只有杰姬
It was just Jackie.

1983
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:29,300
乔伊  你的医生打来电话  你一小时之前死了
Joey, your doctor called. You died an hour ago.

1984
01:41:31,590 --> 01:41:32,670
你是犹太人吗
You a Jewish fellow?

1985
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:34,120
你想当犹太人吗
Would you like to be?

1986
01:41:35,290 --> 01:41:37,470
别担心割礼  现在不会那么做了
Don't worry about the operation. We don't do that no more.

1987
01:41:37,820 --> 01:41:38,760
现在会先打麻药
We freeze it.

1988
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,090
你就站着什么都不用做
And you stand there and don't do anything

1989
01:41:41,090 --> 01:41:43,180
一个墨西哥婆娘拿着块湿石头走过来
and a Mexican broad comes over with a wet rock.

1990
01:41:43,210 --> 01:41:44,050
啪
Thwack!

1991
01:41:44,810 --> 01:41:47,170
大笑没问题  我开所有人的玩笑
See, it's okay to laugh. I make fun of everybody.

1992
01:41:47,170 --> 01:41:50,130
上帝带我们来到世上就是为了让我们笑
That's why God put us on this earth, to laugh.

1993
01:41:50,130 --> 01:41:51,360
所有人都是我的讽刺对象
I work everyone.

1994
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,600
我开黑人玩笑  我开犹太人玩笑
I make fun of blacks, I make fun of Jews.

1995
01:41:53,610 --> 01:41:55,970
吉普赛人  意大利人
I work Gypsies, I work Italians.

1996
01:41:55,970 --> 01:41:58,170
那些意大利人可不行
Well, not those Italians.

1997
01:41:58,380 --> 01:41:59,900
不不不
No, no, no, no!

1998
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:02,150
没事的  乔伊  我有钱  别开枪
It's okay, Joey. I got the money. Don't shoot.

1999
01:42:04,130 --> 01:42:05,410
他们今天告诉我
I was told today,

2000
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:07,670
"说话千万小心"
"Be very careful about what you say."

2001
01:42:07,950 --> 01:42:11,330
但抛开那些玩笑  生日快乐  乔伊
But, uh, all kidding aside, happy birthday, Joey.

你不能在这儿说那种话  明白吗  不行
You can't say that stuff like that here. Okay? You can't do that.

2013
01:42:46,420 --> 01:42:48,370
为什么  只有瑞克斯能开玩笑吗
Why not? Rickles is the only one who can make jokes?

2014
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:49,570
他是老大
The man's a boss.

我也是老大  他是老大
So I'm a boss. He's a boss.

2016

那我们应该是兄弟  对吧
We're all supposed to be brothers, right?

我知道你是老大

我不是  但你们是
I'm not, but you guys are.

2025
01:43:04,850 --> 01:43:06,710
所以如果你能给点面子就好了
So that's why I would like it if you just...

2026
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:08,100
-好  -好吗
- All right. - Okay?

2027
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:09,260
-我们是兄弟  -对
- We're brothers? - You're brothers.

2028
01:43:09,310 --> 01:43:11,140
对  今天我过生日
Yeah. It's my birthday.

2029
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:12,380
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

2030
01:43:12,380 --> 01:43:14,060
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

2031
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:18,100
赶紧滚吧
Get the fuck out of here.

2032
01:43:39,710 --> 01:43:41,380
要做这种活儿
Now, for something like this,

2033
01:43:41,570 --> 01:43:43,100
你需要两把枪
you're gonna need two guns.

2034
01:43:43,340 --> 01:43:46,100
一把是用的  一把是后备
The one you're gonna use and a backup.

2035
01:43:47,030 --> 01:43:50,030
要比点22口径的更有威慑力
You want something with more stopping power than a .22.

2036
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,870
绝对不用消音器
You definitely don't want a silencer.

2037
01:43:57,990 --> 01:44:00,890
要弄出很大响声  吓得目击者逃走
You want to make a lot of noise to make the witnesses run away

2038
01:44:00,890 --> 01:44:02,620
这样他们就不会看你了
so they ain't gonna be looking at you.

2039
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:07,710
但点45口径的响声可不行
But not the noise a .45 makes

2040
01:44:07,710 --> 01:44:09,260
那样动静就太大了
'cause that makes too much noise,

2041
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:12,180
几个街区外的巡逻警车都能听到
and a patrol car can hear it a few blocks away at least.

2042
01:44:16,030 --> 01:44:19,870
警察管点32口径的叫女士枪  因为它比较好控制
The cops call a .32 a woman's gun because it's easier to handle

2043
01:44:19,870 --> 01:44:21,940
没有点38口径的破坏力
and don't do the damage a .38 does,

2044
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:24,080
但是足够了
but, you know, it does enough.

2045
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:42,710
{\an8}安贝特蛤蜊餐厅

2046
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:35,980
到时候是深夜  爱达荷州的游客不会在那儿
It would be late, so the tourists from Idaho

2047
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:37,920
他们已经睡觉了
wouldn't be there. They'd be in bed.

2048
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:40,550
他在小意大利区
And him being down there in Little Italy,

2049
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:43,380
也许会更自在  更放松
maybe he'd be more comfortable, more relaxed.

2050
01:44:44,830 --> 01:44:47,750
那天是他生日  所以他会带着老婆孩子一起去
It was his birthday so he'd be there with his wife

2051
01:44:47,890 --> 01:44:49,980
这样正好
and his kid which, in this case,

2052
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:52,610
因为这正是我们的目的
that's good because that's the point.

2053
01:44:52,610 --> 01:44:54,340
应该让他们亲眼见识
They should have to see what it's like.

2054
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:57,800
他已经喝了不少酒
He'd already been drinking,

2055
01:44:58,450 --> 01:45:00,290
这样他会迟缓很多
which would have slowed him down a lot.

2056
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:02,910
他的保镖会跟着他
His bodyguard would be with him

2057
01:45:02,910 --> 01:45:04,880
乔伊自己也应该是带着枪的
and Joey himself could be carrying, too,

2058
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:07,940
但他的枪可能在他老婆的包里
but then the piece would be in his wife's purse probably.

2059
01:45:14,290 --> 01:45:17,010
从来不会事先对你透露多少
You never got a lot of advance notice.

2060
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:19,680
你只知道你到时候要做什么
All you knew was your part of it.

2061
01:45:21,810 --> 01:45:24,290
红发约翰只知道
John the Redhead knew only one thing:

2062
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:26,180
他要开车送我过去
he was gonna drop me off,

2063
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:29,680
绕着街区转  然后再接我
circle the block and pick me up.

2064
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:34,940
{\an8}安贝特蛤蜊餐厅

2065
01:45:37,950 --> 01:45:40,110
你得先解决掉保镖
You wanna take out the bodyguard first.

2066
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:43,560
不是杀他  别杀他  让他失去行动能力就好
Not kill him. Don't kill him, just disable him.

2067
01:45:44,070 --> 01:45:45,450
你跟他无冤无仇
You got no argument with him,

2068
01:45:45,510 --> 01:45:47,830
所以别照着脸或者胸膛来一枪
so, not in the face or the chest.

2069
01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:51,880
有时  干这种活儿
Sometimes, with something like this,

2070
01:45:52,330 --> 01:45:54,670
你可能想先去趟厕所
you might want to go to the bathroom first.

2071
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:58,140
好确定没人跟踪你进来
It gives you a chance to make sure nobody followed you in.

2072
01:45:58,490 --> 01:45:59,900
也能让你确定
It also gives you a chance to make sure

2073
01:45:59,900 --> 01:46:02,520
无需担心厕所里的人
nobody is in the bathroom you have to worry about.

2074
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:05,420
也给你机会上趟厕所
It also gives you a chance to go to the bathroom.

2075
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:06,920
干活的时候你不想不舒服
You don't want to be uncomfortable.

2076
01:46:07,860 --> 01:46:11,180
但我之前去过  深夜在这么个小餐厅
But I went before, and in a place this small, this late,

2077
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:12,590
直接干活就行了
you might as well just get to work.

2078
01:46:13,310 --> 01:46:14,510
再来点红酒
We need more wine, all right?

2079
01:46:14,970 --> 01:46:16,370
汤米  再来点红酒
Tommy, some more wine.

2080
01:46:16,950 --> 01:46:17,840
之后呢
So how about after?

2081
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:20,090
-蛋糕  蛋糕  蛋糕  -现在还不行
- Cake, cake, cake! - Not yet.

2082
01:46:20,090 --> 01:46:21,470
你还没吃完饭呢
You're not even done eating the meal yet.

2083
01:46:21,470 --> 01:46:23,780
你要蛋糕  得了吧  不能这样
You want the cake? Come on, you can't do that.

2084
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:27,910
靠
Shit!

2085
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:29,850
操  操
Fuck! Fuck!

2086
01:47:04,580 --> 01:47:06,580
此事发生在纽约的小意大利区
It happened in New York's Little Italy,

2087
01:47:06,590 --> 01:47:09,910
传言这里是黑帮的中立地带
an area rumored to be neutral territory among mobsters.

2088

{\an8}安贝特蛤蜊餐厅

2089

凶杀之后
After the killing,

2090
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:13,390
警方找到了几把枪以及一些指纹

2091
01:47:13,390 --> 01:47:14,930
今日正在追查

"疯子乔"乔瑟夫·加洛

2093
01:47:16,670 --> 01:47:21,010
晚间来到这家温馨的海鲜餐厅

与他结婚不满一个月的妻子
with his new bride of less than a month,

以及与前妻所生的十一岁女儿一起庆祝
and his 11-year-old daughter by a previous marriage.

2096
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:29,510
他们在庆祝乔的47岁生日
They were, uh, celebrating Joe's 47th birthday.

2097
01:47:29,670 --> 01:47:32,090
那晚他们先去了一家夜店
They had been to a nightclub early in the evening.

2098
01:47:32,550 --> 01:47:36,750
他们坐在餐厅后面的一桌  总共六个人
They were sitting at a rear table, this group of six people,

2099
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:38,090
然后
when a, uh...

2100
01:47:39,380 --> 01:47:41,930
一个男人从后门进来
a man walked in from the back door,

2101
01:47:41,930 --> 01:47:43,430
直接走到
and he walked up, uh,

2102
01:47:44,430 --> 01:47:47,680
走到桌子边上  开了三枪
to the side of the table. He fired three shots.

2103
01:47:47,810 --> 01:47:49,490
他打了乔两枪
He hit Joe twice

2104
01:47:49,490 --> 01:47:51,490
-还打了他的保镖  -佩琪  走吧

乔伊·加洛的地盘总统街上
It's quiet here on President Street,

非常安静

甚至有些太安静了

在布鲁克林

乔伊·加洛是个英雄

据猜测  他的死亡或将引发一场帮派战争
Speculation has it that his death may start a gang war,

2114
01:48:10,530 --> 01:48:12,230
可能已经悄然开始

你现在打算做什么  吉米
What are you gonna do now, Jimmy?

2127
01:49:07,410 --> 01:49:10,020
我要做的第一件事就是
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do is register

2128
01:49:10,430 --> 01:49:12,220
去联邦缓刑办公室登记
with the Federal Probation Office,

2129
01:49:12,220 --> 01:49:16,540
然后就和我妻子一起去佛州晒太阳
and then I'm going down to Florida with my wife to get some sun.

2130
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:17,640
那之后有什么计划吗
Any plans after that?

2131
01:49:17,810 --> 01:49:20,500
我要夺回我工会的控制权

2132
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:21,910
你要怎么做  吉米

菲茨也要竞选  你感觉怎么样
How do you like Fitz running against you?

2134
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:26,030
感觉不好
I don't.

2135
01:49:26,030 --> 01:49:28,160
吉米  被关这么久是什么感觉
Jimmy, what was it like being locked up all that time?

2136
01:49:28,290 --> 01:49:29,770

01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:34,730
去卢姆餐厅买了几个辣味热狗
I picked up some chili dogs from Lum's,

2140

2143
01:49:41,380 --> 01:49:43,480
他们的秘诀就是用啤酒蒸香肠
The secret is they steam them in beer.

2144
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:45,620
这是全美最好吃的热狗
There ain't a better hot dog in America.

2145
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:47,950
警方称麦考德和他的同谋

2158
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:10,200
他当然受欢迎  能不受欢迎吗
Of course he's popular. Who wouldn't be popular?

2159
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:12,580
哪个弟兄问他借钱他都给
He loans money to every goombah who asks.

2160
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:16,050
所以托尼支持他  他把选票都给菲茨了
That's why Tony's behind him. He's given Fitz all his votes.

2161
01:50:16,050 --> 01:50:18,260
你受工会大多数人的支持
You got great support from most of the union.

2162
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:19,710
你只需要托尼·普罗
All you need is Tony Pro's

2163
01:50:19,710 --> 01:50:21,560
在东北部的选民  你就能赢
voters in the Northeast, and you can win.

2164
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:23,670
-你真不要吃一个吗  -不了  谢谢
- You sure you don't want one of these? - No, thank you.

2165
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:27,750
我就是不敢相信我要去找托尼·普罗要选票
I just can't believe I gotta go to Tony Pro to get votes.

2166
01:50:27,750 --> 01:50:29,020
这都什么跟什么
What is that?

2167
01:50:30,830 --> 01:50:33,110
托尼牢牢控制着菲茨  吉米
Tony has Fitz in his pocket, Jimmy.

2168
01:50:33,110 --> 01:50:34,450
工会不受黑帮控制
Wise guys don't run the union.

2169
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:35,840
有菲茨就行
With Fitz, they do.

2170
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:39,560
吉米  等你重新当上主席
Jimmy, listen, as soon as you're back as president,

2171
01:50:39,570 --> 01:50:40,690
你想做什么就做什么
you can do anything you want to.

2172
01:50:40,690 --> 01:50:42,450
你想解雇谁就解雇谁
You can fire anybody you want to.

2173
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:44,750
你把托尼·普罗解雇了都行
You can even fire Tony Pro.

2174
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:48,880
你可以盯着他  让他清空桌子
You could stand over him, watch him clear out his desk.

2175
01:50:48,890 --> 01:50:50,620
还可以让他脱光  搜他的身
You could strip-search the guy.

2176
01:50:51,490 --> 01:50:53,870
确保他走的时候连个回形针都带不走
Make sure he doesn't walk off with a paper clip.

2177
01:50:53,870 --> 01:50:55,820
对  听见没  你听见没
Yes. See that? Did you hear that?

2178
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:59,130
所有人都以为乔是白脸
See, everybody thinks Jo's the nice one

2179
01:50:59,130 --> 01:51:00,260
我是黑脸
and I'm the bad guy.

2180
01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:02,090
但其实是反过来
But it's opposite.

2181
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:05,640
她是大灰狼  我是小绵羊
She's the killer and I'm the sweetheart.

2182
01:51:06,980 --> 01:51:09,100
现在我要去和狗杂种讲和了
Now I gotta make peace with the cocksucker.

2183
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:12,210
我想和你重归于好
I want to make up with you.

2184
01:51:12,890 --> 01:51:16,010
我需要你支持我  拜托了  托尼
I need you to endorse me. Please, Tony.

2185
01:51:16,010 --> 01:51:17,060
求你了
Please.

2186
01:51:17,390 --> 01:51:18,260
该死
Fucking...

2187
01:51:19,690 --> 01:51:20,870
这事我做不来
I'm not gonna get through this.

2188
01:51:20,870 --> 01:51:22,760
你跟他谈谈就可以了
You gotta talk to him, that's all. Just...

2189
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:24,860
你得处理好
You gotta deal with it, that's all.

2190
01:51:24,150 --> 01:51:25,580
{\an8}顺其自然吧
Let the chips fall where they may.

2191
01:51:25,290 --> 01:51:27,040
不过他真是个狗杂种
He is a cocksucker, though.

2192
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:30,200
要是我坐下和他谈  你一起来吗
If I sat down with him, would you come along?

2193
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:31,620
你说什么呢  当然了
What are you talking about? Of course.

2194
01:51:31,910 --> 01:51:33,260
我怎么会不跟你去
How am I not gonna go with you?

2195
01:51:42,850 --> 01:51:43,890
妈的  走吧
Fuck it. Let's go.

2196
01:51:43,890 --> 01:51:45,780
吉米  吉米  给个机会
Jimmy, Jimmy. Give it a chance.

2197
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:47,620
给个机会  再等几分钟
Give it a chance. Give it a few more minutes.

2198
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:51,210
-就  -这样不行
- Just... - This isn't right.

2199
01:51:51,210 --> 01:51:53,310
这样不行  怎么能这样
This isn't right. You don't do this.

2200
01:51:53,310 --> 01:51:55,270
怎么能让人干等
You don't keep a man waiting.

2201
01:51:55,330 --> 01:51:56,300
我知道  我知道
I know. I know.

2202
01:51:57,800 --> 01:51:59,180
真要让人等
The only time you do

2203
01:51:59,790 --> 01:52:02,090
就代表你有话要说
is when you want to say something.

2204
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:04,910
-我知道  -你想说"去死"
- I know. - When you want to say "Fuck you."

2205
01:52:05,670 --> 01:52:06,620
只有这种解释
That's the only time.

2206
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:09,020
来了
Here they are.

2207
01:52:11,010 --> 01:52:12,490
你能相信这天气吗  弗兰克
Can you believe this weather, Frank? Huh?

2208
01:52:13,380 --> 01:52:16,620
外面快三十度了  真好
It's 85 degrees outside. Perfect.

2209
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:17,720
我是托尼·杰克
Tony Jack.

2210
01:52:18,590 --> 01:52:19,330
我是吉米
Jimmy.

2211
01:52:19,330 --> 01:52:21,940
纽约的人都要冻死了  看看我们
People freezing to death in New York and look at us, huh?

2212
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:25,460
我就想知道  我们干嘛不一直住在这里
Why we don't live here all year round is what I wanna know.

2213
01:52:25,980 --> 01:52:26,810
太棒了
Beautiful.

2214
01:52:27,410 --> 01:52:29,300
-这是夏天  -什么
- It's summer. - What?

2215
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:31,090
这是夏天
It's summer.

2216
01:52:32,430 --> 01:52:34,430
纽约的人没要冻死
People aren't freezing to death in New York.

2217
01:52:35,870 --> 01:52:36,790
现在是夏天
It's summer.

2218
01:52:39,660 --> 01:52:41,640
在我心里  纽约一直零下十三度
In my mind, it's always eight degrees in New York.

2219
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:42,520
我就想表个态
I'm making a point.

2220
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:44,380
你想表个态
You're making a point.

2221
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:46,790
穿成这样表态
Making a point dressing like that?

2222
01:52:47,610 --> 01:52:48,990
你开会就穿成这样吗
Is that how you dress for a meeting?

2223
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:53,890
你在佛州就穿成这样吗  穿西装
This is how you dress in Florida? In a suit?

2224
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:55,140
去开会吗
For a meeting?

2225
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:59,590
别说佛州  不管在什么鬼地方
Anywhere. Florida, Timbuktu, I dress in a suit.

2226
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:00,660
我开会都穿西装
For a meetin'.

2227
01:53:01,690 --> 01:53:03,350
-而且你迟到了  -什么
- And you're late. - What?

2228
01:53:04,430 --> 01:53:05,390
你迟到了
You're late.

2229
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:08,690
嗯  路上堵车
Yeah, there was traffic.

2230
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:10,110
是啊  堵车
Yes, traffic.

2231
01:53:10,910 --> 01:53:11,790
是不是堵车了
Wasn't there traffic?

2232
01:53:11,790 --> 01:53:13,430
-来堵车这一套  -的确堵车
- You give me traffic? - There was traffic.

2233
01:53:13,430 --> 01:53:14,930
你想要我们怎么办
What do you want from us?

2234
01:53:14,940 --> 01:53:15,790
保险杠都抵着保险杠了
It was bumper to fuckin' bumper.

2235
01:53:15,790 --> 01:53:17,870
是啊  堵车确实严重
Yeah, yeah. No, it's bad, you know?

2236
01:53:17,870 --> 01:53:18,780
堵车
Traffic.

2237
01:53:19,770 --> 01:53:22,880
我这辈子从来没有
I never waited for anyone who was late

2238
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:26,130
等人超过十分钟
more than ten minutes in my life.

2239
01:53:26,450 --> 01:53:28,450
十五分钟吧  比较合适
I'd say fifteen. Fifteen's right.

2240
01:53:28,450 --> 01:53:29,350
不  十分钟
No, ten.

2241
01:53:30,790 --> 01:53:32,700
我觉得不行  十分钟不够
I don't think so, ten's not enough.

2242
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:34,220
你得算上堵车的时间
You have to take traffic into account.

2243
01:53:34,220 --> 01:53:37,550
我算了  堵车的时间算进去了
That's what I'm doing. I'm taking traffic into account.

2244
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:39,210
所以给了十分钟
That's why it's ten.

2245
01:53:39,210 --> 01:53:41,390
-我还是坚持十五分钟  -十分钟
- I still say 15. - No, ten.

2246
01:53:42,170 --> 01:53:44,300
行吧  这点我们保留意见
Fine. We disagree on that.

2247
01:53:44,300 --> 01:53:46,030
要不就十二分半
How about twelve and a half minutes?

2248
01:53:46,180 --> 01:53:47,390
这就对了  十二分半
There we go, 12.5.

2249
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:49,910
中间值  正中间  太好了
The middle. Right in the middle. Beautiful.

2250
01:53:49,910 --> 01:53:50,910
超过十分钟
More than ten...

2251
01:53:52,330 --> 01:53:53,520
你就是有话要说了
you're saying something.

2252
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:56,450
-你有话要对我说吗  -我来了
- You saying something to me? - I'm here.

2253
01:53:58,200 --> 01:53:59,180
就这个意思
It says what it says.

2254
01:54:01,020 --> 01:54:02,240
那就这样吧
So there it is.

2255
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:05,220
接下来怎么谈
Where do we go from here?

2256
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:09,530
我能为你做什么
Well, what can I do for you?

2257
01:54:13,010 --> 01:54:13,990
我希望你
I want you...

2258
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:17,370
我
I...

2259
01:54:18,650 --> 01:54:20,360
我希望你支持我
I want you to endorse me...

2260
01:54:22,350 --> 01:54:23,910
支持什么你也清楚
for you know what.

2261
01:54:25,090 --> 01:54:27,740
在我们谈那个之前  先把另一件事讲清楚
Before we get to that, let's straighten that other thing up.

2262
01:54:27,930 --> 01:54:30,160
不  另一件事与我无关
No. The other thing is none of my business.

2263
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:32,480
你的养老金我做不了主
I can't do anything about your pension.

2264
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:36,140
不行  菲茨在就不行  菲茨是主席
I can't. Not with Fitz in there. Fitz is in there, you know.

2265
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:37,520
-你去找菲茨  -找了
- You go to Fitz. - I did.

2266
01:54:37,530 --> 01:54:38,660
-他会帮你  -我找了
- He'll help you out. - I did.

2267
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:40,670
他说会帮我解决  没问题
He said he'll take care of it, no questions asked.

2268
01:54:41,150 --> 01:54:42,720
你不愿意  但是他愿意
You wouldn't do that but he will.

2269
01:54:43,810 --> 01:54:44,990
我是说另一件事
I meant the other thing.

2270
01:54:47,250 --> 01:54:48,210
哪件事
What other thing?

2271
01:54:48,620 --> 01:54:49,500
你很清楚
You know.

2272
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:50,820
我不清楚
I don't know.

2273
01:54:51,180 --> 01:54:52,340
你要道歉
Your apology.

2274
01:54:54,610 --> 01:54:55,660
我要道歉
My apology?

2275
01:54:57,390 --> 01:54:58,550
我道什么歉
My apology for what?

2276
01:54:58,770 --> 01:55:00,440
就是那时你像个国王一样
For what you said when you were sitting there

2277
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:02,510
吃着冰激淋说出的话
eating your ice cream like some fucking king.

2278
01:55:03,910 --> 01:55:06,310
那可是种族污蔑  "你们这些人"
That was an ethnic slur. "You people."

2279
01:55:07,170 --> 01:55:09,100
-你知道他说了什么吗  -不  我听说
- Did you know what he said? - Nah, I mean, I heard...

2280
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:11,590
我听说你们在牢里吵了一架  但我不清楚
I heard you had an altercation in the can, but I don't know.

2281
01:55:11,590 --> 01:55:13,010
对  "你们这些人"
Yeah, "You people."

2282
01:55:14,530 --> 01:55:16,270
你就这么说的  对吧  吉米
That's what you said. Right, Jim?

2283
01:55:17,860 --> 01:55:20,010
"你们这些人"  我是不如你吗
"You people." Am I beneath you?

2284
01:55:22,140 --> 01:55:23,030
一点没错
Definitely.

2285
01:55:23,510 --> 01:55:25,120
-吉米  别这样  -吉米  你干嘛
- Jimmy, come on. - Jimmy, what're you doing?

2286
01:55:25,120 --> 01:55:27,420
别忘了  你今天的地位全靠"我们这些人"
Don't forget, "You people" got you where you are.

2287
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:29,890
别  别跟我说这种话  你个狗东...
Don't...don't tell me that, you fucking...

2288
01:55:29,890 --> 01:55:30,690
那就是你的问题所在  吉米
That's your problem, Jimmy.

2289
01:55:30,690 --> 01:55:32,780
你的问题在于你是个人渣
Your problem is you're a piece of shit.

2290
01:55:32,890 --> 01:55:33,840
吉米  拜托
Jimmy, come on.

2291
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:35,940
-吉米  你在干什么  -天呐  吉米  别这样
- Jimmy, what are you doin'? - Jesus, Jimmy, come on.

2292
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:38,090
我叫你支持我  你却跟我说这么多废话
I asked for your endorsement and you're giving me all this crap.

2293
01:55:38,090 --> 01:55:39,420
我叫你向我道歉
I asked for your apology.

2294
01:55:39,420 --> 01:55:42,070
你他妈算老几  我为什么要向你道歉
Who the fuck are you to apologize to?

2295
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:42,850
吉米
Jimmy...

2296
01:55:42,970 --> 01:55:44,400
你他妈算老几啊
Who the fuck are you?

2297
01:55:44,920 --> 01:55:45,420
和气点
Be gentle.

2298
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:47,130
-我不需要跟你谈  -坐下吧  托尼
- I don't need this. - Let's just sit down. Tony.

2299
01:55:47,330 --> 01:55:49,390
我就需要吗  难道我需要你
I need this? I need you?

2300
01:55:49,390 --> 01:55:50,900
-没错  你需要我  -得了吧
- Yeah, you need me. - Oh, please.

2301
01:55:50,900 --> 01:55:52,790
吉米  拜托  你对他有所求
Jimmy, come on. You're asking him for something.

2302
01:55:52,790 --> 01:55:54,890
这家伙让我紧张  他总是说些让我生气的话
The guy gets me nervous. He talks about things that get me upset.

2303
01:55:54,890 --> 01:55:56,580
-冷静点  -既然大家都来了
- Take it easy. - Everybody's here.

2304
01:55:56,580 --> 01:55:59,290
我们就赶紧开会吧  来吧
Let's have the fucking meeting. Come on.

2305
01:55:59,290 --> 01:56:00,630
-我们好好谈谈  -仅此而已
- Let's talk. - That's all.

2306
01:56:01,030 --> 01:56:01,980
他人来了
He's here.

2307
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:08,610
你们在牢里吵的就是这个吗
Was this the altercation youse had in the can?

2308
01:56:08,610 --> 01:56:09,760
嗯  跟这差不多吧
Yeah, it was something like this.

2309
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:11,550
我们  我们最后打了起来
We... We got to arm wrestling.

2310
01:56:12,830 --> 01:56:13,750
他输了
He lost.

2311
01:56:13,870 --> 01:56:15,750
有脸说我输了  你该瞧瞧他的肋骨
I lost. You should see his ribs.

2312
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:18,430
你们还是谈正事吧  别扯其他的
Why don't you just talk about what you need to talk about.

2313
01:56:18,430 --> 01:56:19,710
-没错  -就是啊
- That's right. - Yeah.

2314
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:21,460
你希望我怎么做
What do you want me to do?

2315
01:56:22,280 --> 01:56:23,160
我的确说了"你们这些人"
I said, "You people."

2316
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:25,070
你希望我怎么做  为此道歉吗
What do you want me to do, apologize for it?

2317
01:56:25,070 --> 01:56:27,340
那正是我想要的  吉米  一句道歉
That's exactly what I want, Jimmy. An apology.

2318
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:29,150
那我就为此道歉
I'll apologize for it.

2319
01:56:29,740 --> 01:56:30,720
我也别无他求
That's all I want.

2320
01:56:32,510 --> 01:56:35,720
前提是你先为这次迟到道歉
After you apologize for being late,

2321
01:56:36,770 --> 01:56:39,440
你个狗娘养的外国佬
you motherfucking wop cocksucker.

2322
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:42,280
吉米  你他妈是疯了吗
Jimmy, are you out of your fucking mind?

2323
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:44,210
我可以为迟到道歉
I'll apologize for being late

2324
01:56:44,380 --> 01:56:47,030
但我会先绑架你孙女  把她的内脏挖出来
after I kidnap your granddaughter, rip her guts out,

2325
01:56:47,030 --> 01:56:48,960
然后装在信封里寄给你
and send them to you in a fucking envelope!

2326
01:56:52,990 --> 01:56:54,780
把他拉开  快
Get him off! Come on!

2327
01:56:55,210 --> 01:56:55,830
我要杀了他
I'll fucking kill him!

2328
01:56:55,830 --> 01:56:57,340
-别打了  托尼  -天呐
- Come on, Tony! - Jesus!

2329
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:04,480
你觉得罗素...
You think Russ would...

2330
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:06,540
会不会解决掉那家伙
would do something about this guy?

2331
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:08,880
那很复杂
That's complicated.

2332
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:11,440
是啊  的确很复杂
Yeah. It's complicated.

2333
01:57:11,580 --> 01:57:13,870
我倒是想亲手宰了那个狗东西
I'd like to clip the motherfucker myself, you know,

2334
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:15,930
-获得他们的同意  但是...  -我懂
- Get the okay from them. But... - I know.

2335
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:17,610
必须除掉这家伙
This guy's gotta go.

2336
01:57:18,540 --> 01:57:19,960
必须除掉他  弗兰克
He's gotta go, Frank.

2337
01:57:20,260 --> 01:57:22,150
他们不可能同意我这么做的
I'm not gonna get the okay to do that.

2338
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:25,750
弗兰克  跟那家伙谈谈
Frank, just talk to the guy.

2339
01:57:26,060 --> 01:57:28,050
好吗  找他好好谈谈
Okay? Just talk to him.

2340
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:33,780
{\an8}纽约  东哈莱姆区
第115大街

2341
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:38,410
泽西的那些家伙不停给我打电话
These guys from Jersey keep fucking calling me

2342
01:57:38,410 --> 01:57:40,480
跟我说这两人之间的矛盾
about this bullshit between these two guys.

2343
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,520
我把我对他们说的话再跟你们说一遍
I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told them.

2344
01:57:43,370 --> 01:57:45,690
我不认同普罗针对吉米说的那些话
I don't approve of what Pro said about Jimmy.

2345
01:57:45,690 --> 01:57:46,280
是啊
No.

2346
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:48,850
谁会那样去威胁别人的孙辈啊
I mean, who talks like that about a person's grandchildren?

2347
01:57:49,470 --> 01:57:51,040
-那是不对的  -是啊
- It's not fucking right. - No.

2348
01:57:51,230 --> 01:57:56,520
{\an8}托尼·萨雷诺  绰号"胖子托尼"
被判一百年徒刑
1992年死于狱中  享年80岁

2349
01:57:56,370 --> 01:57:57,760
但普罗也不是无名小卒
But Pro isn't nobody.

2350
01:57:58,970 --> 01:58:00,000
吉米应该明白这点的
Jimmy should know that.

2351
01:58:00,750 --> 01:58:01,700
我能怎么办
What am I gonna go?

2352
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:04,320
我又没办法告诫那家伙能说什么  不能说什么
I'm not gonna tell this guy what he can or can't fucking say,

2353
01:58:04,510 --> 01:58:05,460
把他当小孩管教
like he's a child.

2354
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:07,140
听着
Well, listen.

2355
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:09,250
吉米其实没什么恶意  他只是很生气
Jimmy don't mean nothing. He just gets upset.

2356
01:58:09,250 --> 01:58:11,200
罗素  拜托  我们都知道他暴躁易怒
Russ, come on, we all know he's a fucking hothead.

2357
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,550
我们都曾有过暴躁易怒的时候
We're all hotheads once in a while.

2358
01:58:12,550 --> 01:58:14,720
是没错  但吉米有时会说些不该说的话
Yeah, but Jimmy says things he shouldn't say sometimes.

2359
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:16,330
是  我们有时也都会那样
Yeah. We all do that too.

2360
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:18,230
该有人让他冷静下来
Well, somebody should just calm him down.

2361
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:24,720
好吧  我会...
Yeah, well, that... I'm gonna...

2362
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:27,020
我会让他冷静下来的  他很不好搞  但...
I'm gonna calm him down. He's difficult, but...

2363
01:58:27,020 --> 01:58:28,720
或许这能帮他冷静下来
Maybe this could help him calm down.

2364
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:30,470
你可以告诉他  我向来都很喜欢他
You could tell him that I always liked him.

2365
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:35,600
并且我不会阻拦他夺回他的职位
And I won't stand in his way of him trying to get his job back.

2366
01:58:35,990 --> 01:58:37,020
我会的  我会告诉他这点的  托尼
I will. I will tell him that, Tony.

2367
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:38,220
-好吗  -好的
- Okay? - Yes.

2368
01:58:38,450 --> 01:58:40,530
那可无法让我冷静下来
That's not making me calm down.

2369
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:41,990
站我这边
Standing by me.

2370
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:44,240
那他妈是什么意思
What the fuck does that mean?

2371
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:48,170
站我这边跟采取措施
Standing by me ain't the same thing as doing something

2372
01:58:48,170 --> 01:58:51,880
处理一个失控的疯子  可不是一回事
about some out-of-control fucking psycho!

2373
01:58:52,250 --> 01:58:54,260
吉米  矮子可不是无名小卒
Jimmy, the Little Guy ain't a nobody.

2374
01:58:54,260 --> 01:58:55,460
你必须明白这点
You gotta understand that.

2375
01:58:55,460 --> 01:58:56,990
-他可不是无名小卒  -他是个龟孙
- He ain't a nobody. - He's a cocksucker.

2376
01:58:56,990 --> 01:58:58,600
菲茨也是个龟孙
Fitz is a cocksucker.

2377
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:01,660
我要把这些龟孙全都解决掉
I'm gonna deal with both these cocksuckers...

2378
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:03,230
我亲自动手
myself!

2379
01:59:04,180 --> 01:59:06,290
这里以前是我的办公室
This used to be my office.

2380
01:59:06,350 --> 01:59:09,570
进去找弗兰克·菲茨西蒙斯吧  你们是找不到他的
Go look for Frank Fitzsimmons there. You're not gonna find him.

2381
01:59:07,820 --> 01:59:09,440
{\an8}国际卡车司机工会

2382
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:12,260
因为他在全国各地旅游
That's because he travels all over the country

2383
01:59:12,270 --> 01:59:15,610
寻找好的高尔夫球场  他就只会干这个
looking for goddamn golf courses because that's what he does.

2384
01:59:15,610 --> 01:59:16,730
他喜欢打高尔夫
He plays golf.

2385
01:59:16,940 --> 01:59:18,660
他算老几  能跟在尼克松身边
Who is he to run around with Nixon,

2386
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:20,640
跟在司法部长身边
run around with the attorney general?

2387
01:59:20,670 --> 01:59:25,080
他整天就知道打高尔夫  还能领全额薪水
He does this and collects full-time salary while he's doing it.

2388
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:26,040
那是怎么做到的
Now, how do you do that?

2389
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:29,140
这份工作  一天24小时都不够忙活的
There's not enough hours in a day to do this job.

2390
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:31,610
我因为欺诈罪被判刑入狱
I was sent to prison for fraud.

2391
01:59:32,450 --> 01:59:34,070
他的所为  才叫欺诈呢
This is fraud, what he's doing.

2392
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:38,100
那么菲茨对吉米的回应是怎样的呢
So what's Fitz's answer to Jimmy?

2393
01:59:38,370 --> 01:59:39,990
他给吉米的老朋友
He does it by sending a message

2394
01:59:39,990 --> 01:59:42,250
戴夫·约翰逊传达了一条信息
to Jimmy's old friend, Dave Johnson.

2395
01:59:42,580 --> 01:59:46,030
戴夫·约翰逊  他是299号地方工会的主席
Now, Dave Johnson, he ran Local 299.

2396
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:48,780
信息是这样的
This was the message.

2397
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:54,870
菲茨就是以这种方式表明
So this is how Fitz says

2398
01:59:54,870 --> 01:59:58,180
他希望我的老朋友戴夫·约翰逊退位
he wants my old pal Dave Johnson to step down

2399
01:59:58,180 --> 02:00:02,740
好让他的儿子接管299号地方工会
so he can have his son take over Local 299.

2400
02:00:03,230 --> 02:00:07,390
那么我打算用接下来的方式拒绝他儿子小菲茨
This is how I'm gonna say no to his son, little fucking Fitz.

2401
02:00:08,790 --> 02:00:10,040
她长得很像你妈
She looked a lot like your mother.

2402
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:11,060
体型都差不多
About the same size.

2403
02:00:11,060 --> 02:00:11,910
爸  拜托  你都说了上千遍了
Pops, come on, you told me like a thousand times.

2404
02:00:11,910 --> 02:00:14,160
长得漂亮  她长得很漂亮
Good-looking girl. She was a good-looking girl.

2405
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:17,070
但我当时真不知道那不是你妈
But I had no idea that it wasn't your mother.

2406
02:00:17,070 --> 02:00:17,990
当时那里很暗...
It was dark and...

2407
02:00:22,070 --> 02:00:25,170
{\an7}霍法

2408
02:00:23,350 --> 02:00:25,170
{\an9}约·霍法
运输部  女助理

2409
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:29,460
接下来菲茨用这种方式表明他不喜欢
This is how Fitz says he doesn't like

2410
02:00:29,460 --> 02:00:31,830
我选定的299号工会负责人
who I say runs the 299.

2411
02:00:32,530 --> 02:00:33,770
他开除了我老婆
By firing my wife

2412
02:00:33,770 --> 02:00:38,100
让她失去了年薪4.8万美元的工会工作
from her forty-eight-fucking-thousand- dollar-a-year union job!

2413
02:00:38,770 --> 02:00:40,780
{\an8}卡车司机299号地方工会

2414
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:23,230
狗娘养的  他去死吧
Son of a bitch. Fuck him!

2415
02:01:23,230 --> 02:01:25,560
他事先在水门大厦
He had previously taped the locks

2416
02:01:25,690 --> 02:01:28,480
大门的锁上贴了个胶带
on the entry door of the basement of the Watergate...

2417
02:01:28,490 --> 02:01:30,360
-你在看什么  -就...
- What are you looking at? - Uh, it's...

2418
02:01:31,180 --> 02:01:32,080
是大耳朵
It's Big Ears.

2419
02:01:32,710 --> 02:01:40,290
{\an8}小埃弗雷特·霍华德·亨特
前中情局探员

2420
02:01:32,780 --> 02:01:35,390
他注意到那个胶带被人撕掉了
He had noticed that the tape had been removed,

2421
02:01:36,570 --> 02:01:38,750
于是他又重新贴了胶带
and he re-taped the door.

2422
02:01:39,780 --> 02:01:40,650
大耳朵
Big Ears?

2423
02:01:41,220 --> 02:01:42,030
那是...
That's, uh...

2424
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:44,180
我很多年前认识的一个人
Somebody I met a long time ago. Just...

2425
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:47,750
他的耳朵也没那么大啊
His ears ain't so big.

2426
02:01:47,750 --> 02:01:50,900
那个时候  我就说  "收工吧"
...at that point, I said "Let us junk it,"

2427
02:01:50,920 --> 02:01:52,950
也就是放弃行动
meaning let us scrap the operation.

2428
02:01:52,950 --> 02:01:56,710
利迪先生和麦考德先生私下谈了谈
Mr. Liddy and Mr. McCord talked between themselves

2429
02:01:56,840 --> 02:01:59,460
就做出了决定  继续行动
and the decision was made to go.

2430
02:01:59,900 --> 02:02:01,280
我当时觉得这很鲁莽...
I thought it was very foolhardy...

2431
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:03,060
那么  在你看来  弗兰克·菲茨西蒙斯
So, Frank Fitzsimmons, in your opinion,

2432
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:06,430
{\an8}媒体见面会  直播

2433
02:02:03,060 --> 02:02:05,550
应该继续担任卡车司机工会的主席吗
should he remain president of the Teamsters?

2434
02:02:05,550 --> 02:02:06,640
绝对不能
Absolutely not.

2435
02:02:06,430 --> 02:02:11,220
{\an8}詹姆斯·霍法

2436
02:02:06,760 --> 02:02:09,330
弗兰克·菲茨西蒙斯已经将他的工会
Frank Fitzsimmons has sold his union out

2437
02:02:09,570 --> 02:02:11,110
卖给了他的黑社会朋友
to his underworld pals.

2438
02:02:11,550 --> 02:02:12,960
黑帮控制着他
The mob controls him,

2439
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:15,630
那意味着他们也控制着我们的养老金
which means it controls our pension fund.

2440
02:02:15,770 --> 02:02:19,690
我说的是上十亿美元的低息或无息贷款
I'm talking about a billion dollars in low or no-interest loans

2441
02:02:19,690 --> 02:02:22,330
都被他借给了已知的黑帮分子
this man has given to known racketeers

2442
02:02:22,440 --> 02:02:23,990
用到他们非法勾当中
for their illegal enterprises.

2443
02:02:24,180 --> 02:02:25,160
再也不可能了
Not anymore.

2444
02:02:25,390 --> 02:02:28,510
船将沉  老鼠该弃船而逃了
It's time for the rats to abandon ship.

2445
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:29,870
他是认真的吗
Is he serious?

2446
02:02:30,510 --> 02:02:32,680
吉米才不是认真的  这都是宣传手段
Not Jimmy. This is all publicity.

2447
02:02:32,680 --> 02:02:34,780
他在竞选公职  只是做做样子罢了
He's running for office. He's putting on a show.

2448
02:02:34,780 --> 02:02:37,540
是啊  都是空口号  没有实质
Yeah, it's all puff. It's got no substance, nothing.

2449
02:02:37,540 --> 02:02:39,150
或许他就是认真的
Maybe he means what he says.

2450
02:02:39,680 --> 02:02:42,180
-托尼  他在竞选  -罗素
- Tony, he's campaigning. - Russ.

2451
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:43,850
他可以信口开河
He's liable to say any fucking thing.

2452
02:02:43,860 --> 02:02:45,650
我才不管他是不是在竞选
I don't care if he's campaigning.

2453
02:02:45,650 --> 02:02:47,030
他不能说这种话
He can't talk like that.

2454
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:48,400
那可不好
It's no fucking good.

2455
02:02:48,490 --> 02:02:49,550
我明白你的意思
I understand what you're saying.

2456
02:02:49,550 --> 02:02:51,140
你知道他该做什么吗  罗素
You know what he should do, Russ?

2457
02:02:51,640 --> 02:02:53,570
他应该将他那一大笔养老金提现
He should cash in that big pension of his.

2458
02:02:53,990 --> 02:02:56,030
多陪陪他的孙辈们
Spend more time with his grandchildren.

2459
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:58,440
他有幸福美满的家庭  不是吗
He got a beautiful family, no?

2460
02:02:59,460 --> 02:03:00,730
是啊  是啊  没错
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, right.

2461
02:03:00,730 --> 02:03:01,860
或许他应该放轻松
Maybe he should relax.

2462
02:03:04,150 --> 02:03:05,310
该让人给他传个话
Word should get back to him.

2463
02:03:10,370 --> 02:03:11,850
我  我只想说
I... I just wanna say...

2464
02:03:11,850 --> 02:03:14,260
我不希望你误会我接下来的话
I don't want you to take this the wrong way.

2465
02:03:14,690 --> 02:03:15,960
但我之前跟一些人在一起
But there I was with some people

2466
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:17,900
你也知道是哪些人  他们说...
and they were saying, and you know who they are...

2467
02:03:17,900 --> 02:03:18,890
他们说...
They were saying...

2468
02:03:20,590 --> 02:03:23,190
"请转告吉米我们爱他
"Please tell Jimmy we love the guy.

2469
02:03:23,580 --> 02:03:26,020
我们并不想惹麻烦
We don't want any problem.

2470
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:27,890
我们只是认为他应该...
We just think that he should...

2471
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,930
享受陪伴孙辈的日子
maybe enjoy his grandchildren,

2472
02:03:30,930 --> 02:03:33,360
享受养老金  享受目前的生活"
enjoy his pension, enjoy his life as is."

2473
02:03:33,390 --> 02:03:35,020
不用再说了  弗兰克
Go no further, Frank.

2474
02:03:37,020 --> 02:03:38,070
是谁说的
Who said it?

2475
02:03:39,380 --> 02:03:41,430
-是谁说的并不重要  -当然重要
- It don't matter who said it. - Oh, it matters.

2476
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:43,980
-是罗素吗  -不是
- Was it Russell? - No.

2477
02:03:43,980 --> 02:03:45,140
当然不是罗素
Of course it's not Russell.

2478
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:48,610
是迈阿密那事儿的那个龟孙吗
It's that little cocksucker from the Miami fiasco?

2479
02:03:48,890 --> 02:03:50,020
-不是吗  -不是
- No? - No.

2480
02:03:50,060 --> 02:03:51,430
不是他吗  真不是吗
Not him. No?

2481
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:52,760
那是谁
Then who?

2482
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:56,470
我还是告诉你吧
I'm gonna tell you.

2483
02:03:56,980 --> 02:03:57,890
是托尼
Tony.

2484
02:03:58,700 --> 02:03:59,630
托尼
Tony?

2485
02:03:59,890 --> 02:04:00,760
哪个托尼
Which Tony?

2486
02:04:01,220 --> 02:04:02,250
那么多人叫托尼
They're all named Tony.

2487
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:05,610
意大利人是怎么回事
I mean, what's the matter with Italians?

2488
02:04:05,620 --> 02:04:06,790
他们难道没别的名字取了吗
They can only think of one name.

2489
02:04:08,720 --> 02:04:09,700
另一个托尼
The other Tony.

2490
02:04:11,710 --> 02:04:12,670
哪个
What Tony?

2491
02:04:15,650 --> 02:04:17,060
萨雷诺
Salerno.

2492
02:04:25,490 --> 02:04:26,920
我能说什么呢
Well, what can I say?

2493
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:30,380
吉米  我这是在帮你
Jimmy, I'm trying to help you.

2494
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:32,310
-让你明白一些事  -我知道
- I'm trying to tell you something. - I know you are.

2495
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:35,340
弗兰克  想都别想
Frank, don't even think about it.

2496
02:04:35,930 --> 02:04:37,510
我向来是有话直说
I don't keep my mouth shut...

2497
02:04:37,510 --> 02:04:38,970
-我知道  -对谁都是如此
- I know that. - ...for anyone.

2498
02:04:38,970 --> 02:04:42,610
我知你知  但他们不知道
I know that, you know that, they don't know that.

2499
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:47,240
这就是我的为人本性  我也不会做出任何改变
That's who I am, that's what I am and that's what I'm gonna do.

2500
02:04:49,370 --> 02:04:50,750
可以找人转告他了
Somebody can tell him that.

2501
02:04:50,990 --> 02:04:51,980
他这么说了
He said that?

2502
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:54,590
我只说了个大概  你懂的
In so many words, you know.

2503
02:04:54,770 --> 02:04:56,440
那他在口出狂言之前
Well, before he says something like that,

2504
02:04:56,440 --> 02:04:58,200
就应该想到乔·加洛
he should remember that Joe Gallo liked to make

2505
02:04:58,200 --> 02:04:59,650
也是老管不住自己的嘴巴
a lot of fucking noise, too.

2506
02:04:59,910 --> 02:05:01,500
找个人转告他吧
Somebody should tell him that.

2507
02:05:01,540 --> 02:05:02,580
又是谁说的
Who said?

2508
02:05:04,330 --> 02:05:06,290
-托尼  -他说的
- Tony. - He said that?

2509
02:05:06,410 --> 02:05:08,160
行了  我决定了
That's it. That does it.

2510
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:11,450
我到死都不会退休
I'm never gonna retire now.

2511
02:05:12,660 --> 02:05:13,870
找个人转告他吧
Somebody can tell him that.

2512
02:05:13,870 --> 02:05:16,120
吉米  我跟他说了  说了不知道多少遍
Jimmy, I did tell him. I told him over and over.

2513
02:05:16,120 --> 02:05:18,030
那这样  你跟他说别再传来传去了
All right, you told him. Let's stop this, then.

2514
02:05:18,030 --> 02:05:19,450
算了吧  不谈了
Forget it. Enough.

2515
02:05:20,580 --> 02:05:22,160
让我好好享用我的冰淇淋
Let me enjoy my ice cream here.

2516
02:05:27,910 --> 02:05:28,790
怎么了
What's the matter?

2517
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:30,410
没事
Nothing.

2518
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:31,870
说啊
What?

2519
02:05:31,870 --> 02:05:33,120
-真没事  -怎么可能没事
- Nothing. - What do you mean, nothing?

2520
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:34,660
你想说什么  告诉我
Come on, you're thinking something. What?

2521
02:05:35,410 --> 02:05:36,910
我只是...
I just...

2522
02:05:38,410 --> 02:05:39,790
怎么了  说啊  别扭扭捏捏的
What? Come on. What are you doing?

2523
02:05:39,790 --> 02:05:42,240
-现在说不太合适  -你什么意思
- It ain't the right time. - What do you mean it ain't the right time?

2524
02:05:42,250 --> 02:05:43,990
现在就很合适  什么时候说都合适
It is the right time. What isn't the right time?

2525
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:44,790
快说
Say it.

2526
02:05:47,330 --> 02:05:48,870
地方工会正在筹备一场
The Local's putting together

2527
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:51,370
给我的答谢晚宴
a testimonial dinner for me and...

2528
02:05:51,370 --> 02:05:53,490
给你的答谢晚宴  那很好啊
A testimonial dinner for you, that's good.

2529
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:56,160
是的  不过之后有...
Yeah. But later... Later, when...

2530
02:05:56,370 --> 02:05:57,250
你想说什么
What's the matter?

2531
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,330
我打算问你愿不愿意
I was gonna ask you if you would...

2532
02:06:04,330 --> 02:06:05,910
为我颁奖
present the award to me.

2533
02:06:07,450 --> 02:06:08,410
这个嘛
Well...

2534
02:06:09,290 --> 02:06:10,950
有心了  弗兰克
That's nice of you, Frank.

2535
02:06:10,950 --> 02:06:13,040
真的  你能想起我真好
Really. That's nice of you. And, you know...

2536
02:06:13,750 --> 02:06:14,870
还有谁会参加
Who's gonna be there?

2537
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:17,110
都会来
Everybody.

2538
02:06:17,110 --> 02:06:22,040
是一大群叫托尼的吗
Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony, and Tony, huh?

2539
02:06:23,250 --> 02:06:24,750
下城的都会来
Everybody from Downtown.

2540
02:06:25,790 --> 02:06:28,160
算了  还是不太好  到时候所有人都会来
Nah. Nah, it ain't a good idea. Everybody's gonna be there.

2541
02:06:28,160 --> 02:06:30,790
你会不自在的
People... You're gonna be uncomfortable.

2542
02:06:30,790 --> 02:06:34,160
我才不管谁去谁不去
I don't give a fuck who's there.

2543
02:06:34,290 --> 02:06:35,580
难道那群狗杂种在
We gonna let those cocksuckers

2544
02:06:35,580 --> 02:06:38,870
我就不能出席你的重大晚宴了吗  休想
keep me from your big night? There's no way.

2545
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:39,910
不可能
No.

2546
02:06:40,410 --> 02:06:43,540
我会去的  而且是我荣幸之至
I'm gonna be there. And I'll be honored to be there.

2547
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,160
你当之无愧
You deserve this.

2548
02:06:45,370 --> 02:06:47,290
-谢谢你  吉米  -没事
- Thank you, Jimmy. Thank you. - Yeah.

2549
02:06:50,530 --> 02:06:53,530
-看那个内奸迪恩  -是啊
- That mole Dean. - Yeah.

2550
02:06:53,530 --> 02:06:55,490
-这婆娘挺漂亮  -确实
- She's a good-looking broad. - She's nice.

2551
02:06:55,500 --> 02:06:56,660
直到六月份
I did not realize

2552
02:06:56,660 --> 02:06:58,830
我才知道霍华德·亨特先生
that Mr. Howard Hunt worked most of the time

2553
02:06:58,830 --> 02:07:00,080
在白宫的大部分时间
while he was at the White House

2554
02:06:58,950 --> 02:07:02,040
{\an8}前白宫法律顾问
约翰·W·迪恩三世

2555
02:07:00,080 --> 02:07:02,080

Now, let me tell you about the first time I met Frank.

2581
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:25,330
他带我去吃牛排晚餐
He took me out to a steak dinner,

2582
02:08:25,330 --> 02:08:27,410
他问我说  "你的牛排要几分熟"
and he asked me, he said, "How do you like your steak?"

2583
02:08:27,410 --> 02:08:29,160
我说"我喜欢一分熟"  他说"我也是"
I said, "I like it rare." He said, "Me too."

2584
02:08:29,160 --> 02:08:31,500
然后就开始上牛排了  我的是一分熟
Well, they bring out the steaks. Mine's rare.

2585
02:08:31,700 --> 02:08:33,830
弗兰克的那份正从厨房里走出来
Frank's was still walking from the kitchen.

2586
02:08:35,660 --> 02:08:37,580
他转身对我说  "其实吧
He turns to me, he said, "Well, you know,

2587
02:08:37,580 --> 02:08:39,910
我喜欢动物  我不想杀生"
I'm an animal lover. I don't wanna hurt it."

2588
02:08:41,750 --> 02:08:43,120
他居然喜欢动物
He's an animal lover.

2589
02:09:07,160 --> 02:09:09,240
这家伙连主席都没当上
This guy is not even the goddamn president

2590
02:09:09,250 --> 02:09:11,410
就在拖延别人的贷款了

2591
02:09:12,080 --> 02:09:13,750
-你确定吗  -我确定
- Are you sure? - I'm sure.

2592
02:09:14,450 --> 02:09:15,450
他是怎么办到的
And how's he supposed to do that?

2593
02:09:15,450 --> 02:09:17,040
因为他的手下拖延了
Because his guys are holding 'em back loans

They gotta sign off on it.

2600
02:09:33,750 --> 02:09:35,990
他们本应该听菲茨的安排开绿灯
They're supposed to be rubber-stamping what Fitz says.

2601
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,290

2604
02:09:44,830 --> 02:09:46,370
我以为已经处理好了
I thought we took care of that.

2605
02:09:47,620 --> 02:09:48,950
你知道他怎么跟人说的吗

他说一旦菲茨下位  他成功上台

And if you don't have his money and interest in two seconds,

2610
02:09:59,290 --> 02:10:00,620
他就要全部接管
he's taking 'em over.

2611
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:02,200
不能让他得逞

与钱无关
It's not about money.

2626
02:10:42,870 --> 02:10:43,910
如果不是为了钱

那我就真的有点搞不懂了
then I'm really having trouble understanding,

2628
02:10:45,870 --> 02:10:48,370
我们谈了那么久到底是为了什么
because I don't know what all the talk is about.

2629
02:10:48,580 --> 02:10:49,830
这是我的工会
It's my union.

2630
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,950
-这很难理解吗  -不是
- Is that hard to understand? - No, no.

这是你的工会  没问题  永远都是你的工会
It's your union, that's right. It'll always be your union.

2632
02:10:55,500 --> 02:10:57,080
你完全可以下台在幕后管理
You could step down and still run it.

2633
02:10:57,080 --> 02:10:59,290
-我才不会下台  -你这话什么意思
- No, you don't step down. - What do you mean?

2634
02:10:59,290 --> 02:11:01,330
罗素  下台是管不了工会的
Russ, you don't step down to run a union.

2635
02:11:01,330 --> 02:11:03,200
下台是直接进坟墓
You step down to go to your grave.

2636
02:11:03,370 --> 02:11:05,000
听好了

2637
02:11:05,500 --> 02:11:08,240
我还是在想...不好意思
I still think... I can't help but think, I'm sorry,

2638
02:11:08,250 --> 02:11:10,580
你这么迫切是出于什么其他理由吗
but is there another reason or something?

2639
02:11:10,580 --> 02:11:13,450
这是我的工会  "其他理由"又是什么意思
This is my union! What do you mean, "another reason"?

2640
02:11:14,750 --> 02:11:16,330
这是我的工会
This is my union.

2641
02:11:16,330 --> 02:11:18,040
好吗  你先明确好这一点
All right? Let's start with that

2642
02:11:18,040 --> 02:11:19,950
再去弄清楚别的事情
and then try to understand things.

2643
02:11:19,950 --> 02:11:22,000
听我说  有人

他们有点顾虑
they're a little concerned.

2646
02:11:28,120 --> 02:11:31,250
有人  不是我  他们觉得你可能...
Some people, not me, they think that you might...

2647
02:11:31,910 --> 02:11:32,870
我可能什么
I might...

2648
02:11:32,870 --> 02:11:36,910
你可能没有表达出应有的感激之举
You might be demonstrating a failure to show appreciation.

2649
02:11:39,540 --> 02:11:41,370
我没有表现出感激
I'm not showing appreciation?

2650
02:11:41,910 --> 02:11:43,990
有人是这么说的
According to, you know, some people.

2651
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:47,080

我没有供出任何一个人
I didn't name one fucking name.

2654

-你做得对  -我做得对
- You did the right thing. - I did the right thing.

2655
02:11:54,750 --> 02:11:55,830
你做得很对
You did the right thing.

2656
02:11:55,830 --> 02:11:57,740
我每天都要跟那个
I sat there every day with that

2657

爱发牢骚的新泽西狗杂种坐在一起

talking to me about his woes, his problems,

2659
02:12:05,410 --> 02:12:08,580

and all I wanted to do was finish my ice cream in peace.

2663
02:12:20,120 --> 02:12:21,660
-没错  -没人会这么做
- That's right. - Nobody.

2664
02:12:22,540 --> 02:12:24,160
还说我没有表示感激
I'm not showing appreciation?

2665
02:12:24,290 --> 02:12:25,370
不是我说的
It's not me.

2666
02:12:25,830 --> 02:12:26,910
是有人这么说
According to some people...

2689
02:13:41,120 --> 02:13:41,950

真漂亮
This is beautiful.

2730
02:16:54,500 --> 02:16:57,410
我不知道该说什么  罗素  这...
I... I don't... I don't know what to say, Russ. It's...

2731
02:16:58,200 --> 02:17:00,450
快戴上  看看怎么样
Slip it on. See how it looks.

2732
02:17:04,450 --> 02:17:06,120
-感觉好吗  -好
- Feel good? - Yeah.

2733
02:17:08,080 --> 02:17:11,000
你知道我让你变得多强吗  知道多强吗
You know how strong I made you? You know how strong?

2734
02:17:12,750 --> 02:17:13,910
你是我的小子
You're my kid.

2735
02:17:15,080 --> 02:17:17,290
没人...没人能搞你
Nobody... Nobody can fuck with you.

2736
02:17:17,620 --> 02:17:18,500
没人
Nobody.

2737
02:17:44,870 --> 02:17:46,000
听着  弗兰克
Listen, Frank.

2738
02:17:46,910 --> 02:17:49,750
我们的朋友又失控了
Things have gotten out of hand with our friend again.

2739
02:17:50,950 --> 02:17:54,160
有些人对他意见很大
And some people are having serious problems with him.

2740
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:57,990
到现在这个地步
And it's at a point where

2741
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,540
你必须找他谈谈  告诉他
you're gonna have to talk to him and tell him

2742
02:18:01,410 --> 02:18:02,950
到此为止了
it's what it is.

2743
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:06,540
到此为止
What it is?

2744
02:18:06,790 --> 02:18:08,830
是的  这是他们的意愿
Yes. It's what they want.

2745
02:18:09,290 --> 02:18:10,620
已经到这步了
It's where it's gotten.

2746
02:18:12,290 --> 02:18:14,540
你和他亲近  或许他会听你的
You're close to him. Maybe he'll listen to you.

2747
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,410
你知道我和他谈过
You know I talked to him.

2748
02:18:16,410 --> 02:18:18,410
他这人很固执  你了解他的
He's a tough guy to talk to. You know him.

2749
02:18:18,410 --> 02:18:20,240
他没得选
He has no choice.

2750
02:18:20,250 --> 02:18:22,040
他没得选
He has no choice.

2751
02:18:22,450 --> 02:18:24,160
这些是大人物
These are the higher-ups.

2752
02:18:25,910 --> 02:18:28,540
他也是个大人物  不是吗
Well, he's a higher-up too. I mean... No?

2753
02:18:29,250 --> 02:18:31,330
和他们不同  你知道的
Not like this. You know that.

2754
02:18:31,500 --> 02:18:32,870
拜托  弗兰克
Come on now, Frank.

2755
02:18:35,870 --> 02:18:37,700
如果他们能干掉一个总统
If they can whack a president,

2756
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,200
他们就能干掉一个工会主席
they can whack a president of the union.

2757
02:18:41,870 --> 02:18:44,410
你知道  我也知道
You know it and I know it.

2758
02:18:54,750 --> 02:18:56,660
我和他谈过一次又一次
I talk to this guy, I talk to him, I talk to him,

2759
02:18:56,660 --> 02:18:58,040
他就是不听
I talk to him, he don't listen.

2760
02:18:58,040 --> 02:19:00,290
但他现在必须听  我得让他听进去
But he's gotta listen now. I gotta make him listen.

2761
02:19:02,870 --> 02:19:06,410
这样不对  他就是个傻瓜
That ain't right. He's... he's a fucking knucklehead.

2762
02:19:17,160 --> 02:19:19,410
吉米  我和罗素谈了
Jimmy. I talked to Russ.

2763
02:19:19,870 --> 02:19:21,160
他和托尼谈过
He talked to Tony.

2764
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:22,500
他说的话是认真的
He means what he's saying.

2765
02:19:23,370 --> 02:19:25,450
-谁  罗素吗  -不  托尼
- Who? Russ? - No, Tony.

2766
02:19:25,580 --> 02:19:26,910
-托尼  -是的
- Tony? - Yeah.

2767
02:19:27,370 --> 02:19:28,870
我说的话也是认真的
Well, I mean what I'm saying.

2768
02:19:29,790 --> 02:19:33,620
他那该死的西西里肥脑袋似乎就是不明白
He can't seem to get that through his fat, fucking Sicilian head.

2769
02:19:33,620 --> 02:19:35,580
对不对  别担心
Can he? Don't worry about it.

2770
02:19:35,580 --> 02:19:36,700
你怎么了
What's the matter with you?

2771
02:19:36,830 --> 02:19:38,040
你看起来...
You... you look...

2772
02:19:38,040 --> 02:19:39,200
-我很担心  -我知道
- I'm concerned. - Yeah, I know.

2773
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:41,500
你看起来就在担心  你担心什么
You look concerned. What are you concerned about?

2774
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:42,370
我...
I'm... I'm...

2775
02:19:42,370 --> 02:19:43,950
该担心的是他们
They should be concerned.

2776
02:19:43,950 --> 02:19:45,290
-他们确实担心  -那就让他们担心去
- They are. They are. - Well, let them be.

2777
02:19:45,290 --> 02:19:46,870
他们不止有一点点担心
They're more than a little concerned.

2778
02:19:46,870 --> 02:19:48,290
他们担心颇多
There's widespread concern.

2779
02:19:48,290 --> 02:19:49,750
这是个大问题
It's a big problem.

2780
02:19:51,330 --> 02:19:55,290
托尼让老爷子叫我告诉你...
Tony told the old man to tell me to tell you...

2781
02:19:55,700 --> 02:19:57,040
"到此为止了"
"It's what it is."

2782
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:02,040
到此为止
What it is?

2783
02:20:02,040 --> 02:20:03,290
到此为止了
It's what it is.

2784
02:20:07,250 --> 02:20:08,450
拜托  听我说
Please, listen to me.

2785
02:20:10,700 --> 02:20:12,160
他们不敢
They wouldn't dare.

2786
02:20:12,620 --> 02:20:14,450
-别...  -他们不敢
- Don't... - They wouldn't dare.

2787
02:20:14,450 --> 02:20:16,290
-吉米  -得了吧  弗兰克
- Jimmy... - Please, Frank, come on.

2788
02:20:16,290 --> 02:20:18,080
-别说他们不敢  -不
- Don't say they wouldn't dare. - No.

2789
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:21,120
别跟我说这种话...都是胡扯
Don't... don't tell me that kinda... That's fairy tales.

2790
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:23,330
别说他们不敢
No, don't say they wouldn't dare.

2791
02:20:23,700 --> 02:20:26,370
如果我出了什么事
If something funny happens to me...

2792
02:20:28,290 --> 02:20:29,160
他们就完了
they're done.

2793
02:20:29,160 --> 02:20:31,290
你明白吗  他们也清楚这点
You understand that? And they know it.

2794
02:20:31,290 --> 02:20:33,910
因为我有文件  我有证据
Because I got files. I got proof.

2795
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:35,750
我有记录  我有录音带
I got records. I got tapes.

2796
02:20:35,750 --> 02:20:38,200
只要我想  他们随时会完蛋
Any time I want, they'll be gone.

2797
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:39,830
这些几内亚混蛋
These Guinea motherfuckers

2798
02:20:39,830 --> 02:20:41,990
余生都会在监狱度过
will spend the rest of their lives in jail,

2799
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:43,870
他们清楚
and they know it.

2800
02:20:44,450 --> 02:20:45,040
他们清楚
They know it.

2801
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:47,410
但你现在说的正是他们担心的
But what you're saying is what they're concerned about.

2802
02:20:47,410 --> 02:20:49,120
我在说的是我知道他们的事
What I'm saying is I know things.

2803
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:52,540
我知道他们不知道我知道的事
I know things they don't know I know.

2804
02:20:52,910 --> 02:20:55,080
-拜托  -你真的要冒那个险吗
- Please... - Are you gonna take that chance?

2805
02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:57,200
我冒什么...我为什么要冒险
What chance am I... Why should I be taking a chance?

2806
02:20:57,200 --> 02:20:58,830
他们说到此为止了
They're saying this is it.

2807
02:20:59,540 --> 02:21:01,540
他们说到此为止  那就到此为止吗
They're saying this is it, and then it's it?

2808
02:21:01,540 --> 02:21:03,660
-胡说  胡说  弗兰克  -别这样
- Bullshit. Bullshit, Frank. - Come on.

2809
02:21:03,660 --> 02:21:05,200
吉米  我是想告诉你
Jimmy, I'm trying to tell you something.

2810
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:07,450
我知道你是  你在告诉我他们威胁我
I know you are. You're telling me that they're threatening me

2811
02:21:07,450 --> 02:21:09,080
我必须照他们说的做
and I gotta do what they say.

2812
02:21:09,080 --> 02:21:11,910
那不只是威胁  那是底线
It's more than a threat. It's the bottom line.

2813
02:21:11,910 --> 02:21:12,910
底线
The bottom line.

2814
02:21:13,750 --> 02:21:15,120
到此为止了
It's what it is.

2815
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:17,830
他们搞我  我就搞他们
They do something to me, I do something to them.

2816
02:21:18,660 --> 02:21:21,120
我就知道这个  别的我不知道  你知道吗
That's all I know. I don't know anything else. Do you?

2817
02:21:23,540 --> 02:21:26,080
那我要怎么做  我该怎么跟麦基说
So what am I gonna do? What am I gonna tell McGee?

2818
02:21:26,540 --> 02:21:27,870
说你不肯听吗
That you're not gonna listen?

2819
02:21:28,250 --> 02:21:29,580
他不习惯有人不听他的
He ain't used to people not listening to him.

2820
02:21:29,580 --> 02:21:30,620
我也是
Well, neither am I.

2821
02:21:32,080 --> 02:21:33,950
-什么  -我也是
- What? - Neither am I.

2822
02:21:34,950 --> 02:21:35,870
那我不知道该怎么办了
Then I don't know what to do.

2823
02:21:35,870 --> 02:21:37,620
或许你该找些保镖
I mean, maybe you should get some bodies around you

2824
02:21:37,620 --> 02:21:39,290
-保护你  -得了吧
- for protection. - Come on. Please.

2825
02:21:39,540 --> 02:21:41,240
我不会选那条路
I'm not gonna go that route.

2826
02:21:41,250 --> 02:21:42,910
别这么对我  弗兰克
Don't do this to me, Frank.

2827
02:21:42,910 --> 02:21:45,330
你说"找些保镖"是什么意思  我不需要
What do you mean, "bodies around me"? I don't need...

2828
02:21:45,330 --> 02:21:47,910
你找保镖  他们就会找上你的家人
You put bodies around you, then they go after your family.

2829
02:21:47,910 --> 02:21:50,160
-这不重要  你担心吗  -我担心
- It doesn't matter. You worried? - I'm worried.

2830
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:52,700
你去找些保镖吧  我告诉你为什么
Get some bodies around you. I'll tell you why.

2831
02:21:53,750 --> 02:21:55,120
这事可能落到你身上
This could happen to you.

2832
02:21:55,330 --> 02:21:57,330
他们可能找上你
They could come after you

2833
02:21:57,620 --> 02:21:58,910
因为你支持我
since you're with me.

2834
02:21:59,450 --> 02:22:00,200
不是吗
No?

2835
02:22:02,830 --> 02:22:03,870
我很担心
I'm worried.

2836
02:22:04,160 --> 02:22:06,540
告诉罗素我对他只有尊重
Tell Russ I got nothing but respect for him.

2837
02:22:06,870 --> 02:22:09,160
我和他有点小摩擦
I got a little trouble with him.

2838
02:22:09,410 --> 02:22:11,700
我们之前谈的时候  我有点失控
We were talking before and I just got a little crazy.

2839
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:14,790
-你知道我什么样  有时会发脾气  -是的
- You know how I am. I just blow. Sometimes. - Yeah.

2840
02:22:14,790 --> 02:22:16,200
气得扭头就走
I just walked away like that.

2841
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:18,200
但我就是这样的人
But I get that way. I get abrupt.

2842
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:21,040
或许你能告诉他我多么尊重他
Maybe you could tell him how much I respect him.

2843
02:22:21,620 --> 02:22:23,620
我对他只有尊重
I have nothing but respect for this guy.

2844
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:25,330
我永远不会伤害他
I would never hurt him,

2845
02:22:25,790 --> 02:22:28,790
不管我手上有什么文件  不管我做什么
no matter what I do with files, or whatever I do with anything.

2846
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:31,160
你应该亲自告诉他
But you should tell him. Yourself.

2847
02:22:31,160 --> 02:22:32,410
不  我不要亲自告诉他
No, I'm not gonna tell him myself.

2848
02:22:32,410 --> 02:22:33,450
-拜托  -算了吧
- Please. - Come on.

2849
02:22:33,450 --> 02:22:36,000
-亲口说更有意义  -他是你的导师
- It would go a long way. - He's your rabbi.

2850
02:22:36,410 --> 02:22:38,040
你有今天全靠他
Because of him, you're here.

2851
02:22:38,330 --> 02:22:39,250
你告诉他
You tell him.

2852
02:22:40,200 --> 02:22:41,080
听我说
Listen to me.

2853
02:22:41,120 --> 02:22:44,120
最终只有一件事是真的
At the end, there's only one thing that's real.

2854
02:22:44,750 --> 02:22:46,660
这是我的工会
This is my union.

2855
02:22:48,450 --> 02:22:51,410
这是我的工会  弗兰克
This is my union, Frank.

2856
02:22:53,700 --> 02:22:55,790
明确这一点  其他就简单了
Very simple when you say it that way.

2857
02:23:01,160 --> 02:23:02,160
佩琪
Peggy!

2858
02:23:02,370 --> 02:23:04,200
我们跳舞吧
Shall we dance?

2859
02:23:04,290 --> 02:23:05,580
失陪
Excuse us.

2860
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:39,410
距离底特律几小时车程
A couple of hours outside Detroit,

2861
02:23:39,410 --> 02:23:41,620
我们决定住一晚
we figured we'd spend the night,

2862
02:23:41,870 --> 02:23:43,500
早上再赶路
drive up in the morning.

2863
02:23:43,790 --> 02:23:45,700
我们要去参加婚礼
I mean, the wedding, that was the thing.

2864
02:23:46,250 --> 02:23:50,040
比尔·巴法利诺要把女儿嫁给一个好男人
Bill Bufalino, you know, was giving his daughter away to a hell of a guy.

2865
02:23:50,250 --> 02:23:52,540
比之前那个无赖好
Better than the bum she was with before.

2866
02:23:52,750 --> 02:23:54,580
这是件好事
And that was all well and good.

2867
02:23:55,160 --> 02:23:58,500
但婚礼实际是求和任务
But the wedding was really a peace mission.

2868
02:23:59,580 --> 02:24:00,790
那才是我们参加的目的
And that's what we were there for.

2869
02:23:59,870 --> 02:24:03,120
{\an9}哥伦布
代顿
底特律

2870
02:24:00,790 --> 02:24:02,750
大家差不多都知道
And everybody kinda knew that,

2871
02:24:02,790 --> 02:24:04,750
我们是去理清这件事的
and we were there to straighten it all out.

2872
02:24:05,330 --> 02:24:06,700
-吉米  -是我
- Jimmy? - Yeah.

2873
02:24:06,700 --> 02:24:08,490
我和老爷子在一起  我们开车过去
I'm with the old man, we're driving up.

2874
02:24:08,500 --> 02:24:10,870
他希望我们能把整件事理清楚
He hopes we can straighten this whole thing out.

2875
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:12,080
他说了什么
What did he say?

2876
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:13,540
他说希望我们能理清这事
He said he hopes we can straighten it out.

2877
02:24:13,540 --> 02:24:15,410
婚礼之后  我们坐下谈谈
After the wedding, we sit down, we talk,

2878
02:24:15,410 --> 02:24:16,370
理清这事
we straighten it out.

2879
02:24:16,370 --> 02:24:17,330
婚礼啊
Right, the wedding.

2880
02:24:17,330 --> 02:24:18,870
我不准备参加婚礼
I'm not going to the wedding.

2881
02:24:18,910 --> 02:24:20,700
太多我不喜欢的人会到场
Too many people I don't like are gonna be there,

2882
02:24:20,700 --> 02:24:22,620
所以我不准备去
so I'm not going to the wedding.

2883
02:24:22,620 --> 02:24:23,990
你不去参加婚礼吗
You're not going to the wedding?

2884
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:25,200
我不会去
I'm not gonna be there.

2885
02:24:27,580 --> 02:24:28,540
那我们可以...
Well, then we could...

2886
02:24:29,080 --> 02:24:30,490
吉米  你想在哪里谈都可以
Jimmy, then we could do it anywhere you want.

2887
02:24:30,500 --> 02:24:32,540
可以在你家
We can do it at your house.

2888
02:24:32,540 --> 02:24:33,990
你想在哪里都行
We can do it anywhere you want.

2889
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:35,370
地点任你选择
Wherever you're comfortable.

2890
02:24:36,330 --> 02:24:37,290
湖边怎么样
The lake?

2891
02:24:37,410 --> 02:24:39,580
好  湖边  你想在那里谈吗
Yeah, the lake. You wanna do it at the lake?

2892
02:24:40,790 --> 02:24:43,540
我一开始就想把这事谈妥
From day one, I wanted to work this out.

2893
02:24:43,540 --> 02:24:46,740
-我知道  我知道  -从他妈的一开始
- I know. I know. - From day fucking one.

2894
02:24:46,750 --> 02:24:49,540
我明白  我比任何人都清楚  我知道
I know. Nobody knows better than me. I know that.

2895
02:24:49,540 --> 02:24:52,500
好  就你们俩来吧
All right, uh... Just you two, right?

2896
02:24:52,700 --> 02:24:54,450
别带上那个矮子
I mean, not the Little Guy.

2897
02:24:54,660 --> 02:24:56,740
-不  他当然得去  -不行
- No, of course, the Little Guy. - No.

2898
02:24:56,750 --> 02:24:58,290
我不要跟他谈
I'm not doing it with him.

2899
02:24:58,290 --> 02:24:59,950
吉米  只有我们三个人谈没有用
Jimmy, there's no point just the three of us.

2900
02:24:59,950 --> 02:25:01,080
不  不  不
No, no. No, no.

2901
02:25:01,080 --> 02:25:03,410
就我们三个人谈  就这样...
Just the three of us. That's the way it's...

2902
02:25:03,410 --> 02:25:04,910
只有我们三个人谈没有用
There's no point just the three of us.

2903
02:25:04,910 --> 02:25:06,200
矮子必须得在场
It's gotta be the Little Guy with us.

2904
02:25:06,200 --> 02:25:08,830
不  我不要再跟那个小龟孙谈了
No, I'm not sitting down with that little cocksucker again!

2905
02:25:08,830 --> 02:25:11,370
你明白吗  我做不到  弗兰克
Do you understand? I can't do it, Frank!

2906
02:25:11,370 --> 02:25:11,910
你必须跟他谈
You have to.

2907
02:25:11,910 --> 02:25:13,410
不  吉米  你得跟他谈谈
No, Jimmy, you gotta sit down with him.

2908
02:25:13,410 --> 02:25:14,660
-什么都不必做  -大家都说...
- We don't gotta do anything. - Everybody says...

2909
02:25:14,660 --> 02:25:16,870
我这是出于对他们的礼貌
This is a courtesy with these people.

2910
02:25:16,870 --> 02:25:18,080
完全是给他们面子
A complete courtesy.

2911
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:19,330
-你懂的  -我明白
- You know that. - I understand.

2912
02:25:19,330 --> 02:25:21,160
但你得试着让这事过去
But you gotta try and move past that.

2913
02:25:21,160 --> 02:25:22,790
我已经让这事过去了
Get past it? I am past it!

2914
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:25,070
我再也不会见那个混蛋了
I'm never seeing that motherfucker again.

2915
02:25:25,070 --> 02:25:26,370
-这就是...  -吉米  你得坐下来好好谈
- You see that's... - Jimmy, you gotta sit down.

2916
02:25:26,370 --> 02:25:27,410
大家都这么说
Everybody says so.

2917
02:25:27,410 --> 02:25:29,870
但这没有意义  只有一点
But there's no point. There's only one point,

2918
02:25:29,870 --> 02:25:31,990
我不想这么做  我也不会这么做
I don't wanna do it and I'm not gonna do it.

2919
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:33,660
弗兰克  我要挂你电话了
Frank, I'm gonna hang up on you now.

2920
02:25:33,660 --> 02:25:35,830
拜托  理解一下  好吗
Please. Understand this. Okay?

2921
02:25:49,450 --> 02:25:52,330
-他怎么说  -他在考虑
- What did he say? - Uh, he's thinking about it.

2922
02:25:52,660 --> 02:25:54,160
-考虑  -对
- Thinking about it? - Yeah.

About five.

2929
02:26:29,410 --> 02:26:30,370
五点吗
Five, huh?

2930
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:34,700
也许你该给吉米打个电话
Maybe you should give Jimmy a call.

2931
02:26:34,700 --> 02:26:36,870
他说他会考虑的  对吗
I mean, he said he was gonna think about it, right?

2932
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:43,870
好
Okay.

2933

That's good. That's good, 'cause, uh...

2936
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:02,700
另外那件事我改变主意了
I changed my mind about the other thing.

2937
02:27:04,450 --> 02:27:06,200
-是吗  -嗯

好  我想让你在场
Yeah, I want you there.

2970
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:43,200
跟安吉洛的人要来这瓶红酒醋
It was the best move we made,

2971
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:45,950
是我们做过最明智的事
getting this red wine vinegar from Angelo's guy.

2972
02:28:48,120 --> 02:28:51,950
跟另一个混混要来的意大利橄榄油也不错
Great Italian olive oil we got from that other mooch was not bad either.

2973

卡塔尼亚的橄榄油最棒了

计划有变
There's been a change.

2976
02:29:04,540 --> 02:29:08,280
明天早上别那么早出发
Instead of, uh, going up early,

2977
02:29:08,280 --> 02:29:11,120
我们先待一会儿  然后再开车过去
we're gonna hang around tomorrow morning and then go drive up.

2978
02:29:12,080 --> 02:29:15,750

3005
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:46,010
去克林顿港干什么
But... But what's in Port Clinton?

3006
02:31:46,420 --> 02:31:47,510
坐飞机
A plane.

3007
02:31:51,060 --> 02:31:52,640
坐飞机  去哪里
A plane? To where?

3011
02:32:09,250 --> 02:32:10,720
你回来之后
And when you come back,

3012
02:32:11,150 --> 02:32:14,020
我们带上夫人们
me and you, we get together with the girls,

3013
02:32:14,020 --> 02:32:16,100
优哉游哉地上路
we take a nice slow drive up.

3014
02:32:16,880 --> 02:32:18,830
时不时停下来抽根烟
With cigarette breaks, you know.

3015
02:32:30,250 --> 02:32:31,160
弗兰克
Frank.

3016
02:32:32,050 --> 02:32:34,450
我必须让你去做这件事
I had to put you into this thing,

3017
02:32:34,920 --> 02:32:36,980
否则你绝不会袖手旁观
or you would never let it happen.

3018
02:32:37,930 --> 02:32:39,480
我知道你不会
And I know you wouldn't.

3019
02:32:44,960 --> 02:32:46,730
但事已至此
But it's gonna happen.

3020
02:32:49,070 --> 02:32:52,270
不管怎样  都得解决他
Either way, he's going.

3021
02:32:58,160 --> 02:33:00,810
我明白你的感受  弗兰克  相信我
I know how you feel, Frank. Trust me.

3022

我明白你的感受
I know how you feel.

3023
02:33:04,060 --> 02:33:06,780

I told you before, we tried everything to help him.

你知道的
You know that.

3025
02:33:07,930 --> 02:33:09,380
你尽力了
You tried.

3026
02:33:11,910 --> 02:33:13,980
这是他自找的
He brought this on himself.

3027
02:33:15,820 --> 02:33:17,830
还牵扯到了我们
And it's landing on us.

3028
02:33:21,550 --> 02:33:23,890
他们同意这样安排
The only reason they agreed to this

3029
02:33:24,420 --> 02:33:26,500
是出于对我的尊重
was out of respect to me.

3030
02:33:28,980 --> 02:33:31,050
你和琳妮不会有事的
But you and Reenie will be okay,

3031
02:33:31,560 --> 02:33:33,000
因为你是我的人

Let's go. I don't want your father yelling at me for being late.

3047

3063
02:40:46,370 --> 02:40:48,090
要给你拿张报纸吗  弗兰克

3065

不知道

你从哪弄来的
Where did you get it?

3072
02:41:26,220 --> 02:41:28,480
你说呢  卖鱼的地方
What the fuck. At a fish place.

3073
02:41:30,390 --> 02:41:34,000
你就直接过去说"给我条鱼"吗
What, you just go in there and say, "Gimme a fish"?

3074
02:41:34,930 --> 02:41:36,370
差不多吧
Pretty much. Yeah.

3075
02:41:37,890 --> 02:41:39,460
你没说你要鲑鱼
You didn't say you want a salmon,

3076
02:41:39,460 --> 02:41:41,330
还是黑线鳕

还是鳕鱼吗
you want a... a fucking cod?

3078
02:41:43,640 --> 02:41:46,890
是哪种鱼有什么关系吗
What the fuck does it matter what kind of fish it was?

3079
02:41:47,160 --> 02:41:48,650
你为什么那么关心那条鱼
Why are you so concerned about this fish?

3080
02:41:48,650 --> 02:41:50,130
我只是想搞清楚...

3081

Does it...

3082
02:41:53,430 --> 02:41:56,500
怎么能买到一条鱼  却不知道是什么鱼
...how a person can buy a fish and not know what kind it was.

3083
02:41:58,510 --> 02:42:01,250
那条鱼就在那里等着我
There was a fish waiting for me there.

3084
02:42:04,170 --> 02:42:07,550
我没问那是什么鱼  抱歉
I didn't ask what kind of fish it was. I'm sorry.

3093
02:42:52,660 --> 02:42:54,640
-谁让你来的  -吉米
- Who invited you? - Hey, Jimmy.

3094
02:42:57,260 --> 02:42:58,740
你是谁
Who the fuck are you?

3095
02:42:58,970 --> 02:43:00,110
我是普罗的人
I'm with Pro.

3096
02:43:00,440 --> 02:43:01,700
你是普罗的人
You're with Pro?

3097
02:43:01,970 --> 02:43:04,400
你是那个放我鸽子的龟孙的人
Are you with the cocksucker who just stood me up?

3098
02:43:04,400 --> 02:43:06,560
我不会等人超过十分钟
I don't wait for anybody more than ten minutes.

3099
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:08,150
他在房子里
He's at the house.

3100
02:43:08,500 --> 02:43:09,540
什么房子
What house?

和罗素在一起
With Russ.

3102

3104
02:43:16,290 --> 02:43:18,490
到底怎么回事
What the fuck is going on?

3105
02:43:18,710 --> 02:43:20,910
我一直在等你  我两点就到了
I was waiting for you. I was there at two o'clock.

3106
02:43:20,910 --> 02:43:21,950

抱歉  但麦基来了  他决定过来
I'm sorry. But McGee's here, he decided to come.

But he ain't comfortable here. He don't wanna come here.

3109

他在房子里
He's at the house.

他决定过来
He decided to come.

3112
02:43:34,690 --> 02:43:36,810
他是来帮忙理清这件事的
Yeah, he came to help straighten this all out.

3113
02:43:38,230 --> 02:43:39,500
房子
The house?

3114
02:43:45,080 --> 02:43:47,080
事后我们会带你来取车的
We'll bring you back after to get your car.

3115
02:43:53,010 --> 02:43:53,880
没错

3116
02:43:55,700 --> 02:43:56,640
好吧
Okay.

3118
02:44:09,080 --> 02:44:11,950
{\an8}红狐餐厅

3119
02:44:13,270 --> 02:44:14,170
之前车里放了条鱼
There was a fish in here,

3120
02:44:14,170 --> 02:44:16,620
但我们已经清理干净了
but we cleaned it up.

3121
02:44:16,860 --> 02:44:17,980
鱼
A fish?

3122
02:44:19,180 --> 02:44:20,980
查奇在车里放了条鱼
Chuckie had a fucking fish in here.

3123
02:44:20,980 --> 02:44:21,940
他连是什么鱼都不知道
Didn't even know what kind.

3124
02:44:21,940 --> 02:44:24,020
但现在没事了  我擦干净了
But it's okay now. I wiped it up.

3125
02:44:24,020 --> 02:44:26,830
-我在座位上垫了块手帕  -我闻出来了
- I got the handkerchief here. - Yeah, I can smell it.

3126
02:44:27,300 --> 02:44:27,800
查奇
Hey, Chuckie.

3127
02:44:27,800 --> 02:44:29,890
你在车里放了条鱼吗
You had a fish in here in your car?

3128
02:44:29,890 --> 02:44:31,470
给鲍比·霍姆斯的
For Bobby Holmes.

3129
02:44:31,480 --> 02:44:33,310
你知道的  鲍比喜欢吃鱼
You know, Bobby likes fish.

3130
02:44:33,310 --> 02:44:35,050
我们清理干净了  吉米  没关系
We cleaned it up, Jimmy. It's all right.

3131
02:44:35,050 --> 02:44:36,240
你清理干净了

-你清理干净了  -是的

你这辈子有抓过鱼吗

没有

Listen to me. Never put a fish in your car.

3139
02:44:50,220 --> 02:44:51,890
味道是散不掉的
You never get the smell out.

3140
02:44:51,940 --> 02:44:53,760
-嗯...  -除非包装得很好
- No... - Unless you pack it tight, you know.

3141
02:44:53,760 --> 02:44:55,150
嗯  我知道

你会受益匪浅的
It'll help you in life.

3145
02:45:04,680 --> 02:45:07,530
弗兰克  你就不能两点来找我  告诉我这事吗
Frank, you couldn't come by at 2:00 and tell me this?

3146
02:45:07,650 --> 02:45:10,640
我傻傻地在那等了你四十分钟
I was waiting there 40 minutes like a fuckin' moron.

3147
02:45:10,640 --> 02:45:13,180
吉米  抱歉  我刚到就赶过来了
Jimmy, I'm sorry. I came as soon as I got here.

3148
02:45:13,180 --> 02:45:15,090
-你今天早上到的  -不是
- You got in this morning. - No, no, no.

3149
02:45:15,090 --> 02:45:16,290
我今天下午才到的
I got here this afternoon.

3150
02:45:16,290 --> 02:45:19,180
罗素在克林顿港办事  我得等他
Russell had business in Port Clinton. I had to wait for him.

3151
02:45:19,180 --> 02:45:20,800
他提醒了我  我忘记了
He reminded me. I forgot.

3152
02:45:20,800 --> 02:45:22,940
所以我们马上赶来  我刚到
So, we had to come and as soon as we got here,

3153
02:45:22,950 --> 02:45:24,580
就直接过来找你了
I came right here to see you.

3154
02:45:24,580 --> 02:45:26,980
没有对罗素不敬的意思
All due respect to Russ, you know,

3155
02:45:27,810 --> 02:45:30,730
但应该让人提前告诉我的
but somebody should have come tell me, you know.

3156
02:45:30,730 --> 02:45:34,140
最起码应该来告诉我时间推迟了
Just come tell me it's 2:30, 2:40, at the very least.

3157
02:45:34,150 --> 02:45:35,810
你说得对  我是说...
You're not incorrect. I mean...

3158
02:45:35,810 --> 02:45:39,930
普罗算哪根葱  还派个狗腿子过来
Who the fuck is Pro? He sends a fucking errand boy here.

3159
02:45:39,930 --> 02:45:41,050
他不会待太久
He ain't stayin'.

3160
02:45:41,060 --> 02:45:42,190
我知道他不会待太久
I know he ain't staying.

3161
02:45:42,190 --> 02:45:44,290
关键不在于他待多久
That's not the point, he's staying or not staying.

3162
02:45:44,290 --> 02:45:46,120
关键在于普罗派他过来
The point is Pro sent him.

3163
02:45:46,130 --> 02:45:46,970
知道吗
You know?

3164
02:45:46,970 --> 02:45:48,750
关键是他应该亲自来接我
Point is, he should've come picked me up himself.

3165
02:45:48,750 --> 02:45:50,350
这才是问题的关键
That's the point I'm makin'.

3166
02:45:53,560 --> 02:45:55,710
你戴着这副眼镜能看得清吗
Can you even see out of those glasses?

3167
02:45:56,760 --> 02:45:58,650
我什么都看不清
I can't see a fucking thing.

3168
02:45:58,650 --> 02:46:01,390
很好  幸好不是你开车
That's good. I'm glad you're not driving, then.

3169
02:46:09,810 --> 02:46:11,390
就在这...这边
Yeah, it's right... It's right up...

3170
02:46:11,890 --> 02:46:13,740
就在这边  这边
It's right up here. Right... Right up...

3171
02:46:13,930 --> 02:46:15,690
有楼梯的那房子
That building with the staircase.

3172
02:46:17,420 --> 02:46:19,060
你带家伙了吗
You got your friend with you?

3173
02:46:19,070 --> 02:46:20,750
-带了  -很好
- Right here. - Good.

3174
02:46:21,430 --> 02:46:23,240
谁知道这个龟孙会做出什么事
You never know with this cocksucker,

3175
02:46:23,380 --> 02:46:25,250
不管罗素在不在场
with or without Russ there.

3176
02:47:04,600 --> 02:47:06,370
快走  弗兰克  快

卡车司机工会前主席詹姆斯·霍法
James Hoffa, former president of the Teamsters Union,

3189
02:49:44,660 --> 02:49:46,010
于周三失踪

02:49:46,010 --> 02:49:49,320
截至今晚  尚未发现他的踪迹
And as of tonight, no trace of him has been found.

3191
02:49:49,320 --> 02:49:52,100
霍法在监狱服刑四年  他坦承
Hoffa spent four years in prison and made no bones

3192
02:49:52,100 --> 02:49:53,530
-自己打算...  -弗兰克
- about his intention... - Frank.

3193
02:49:53,530 --> 02:49:55,750
从他的继任弗兰克·菲茨西蒙斯手上

3194
02:49:55,750 --> 02:49:57,000
夺回主席之位
Frank Fitzsimmons.

3195
02:49:57,010 --> 02:49:59,040
菲茨西蒙斯的儿子是副主席...
Fitzsimmons' son is the vice president of...

3196
02:49:59,050 --> 02:50:00,160
还没消息吗
Still nothing?

3197
02:50:01,480 --> 02:50:04,490
小菲茨西蒙斯的车被炸了  他当时不在车内
...young Fitzsimmons' car was bombed. He was not in it.

3198
02:50:04,490 --> 02:50:07,680
但底特律地方工会内确有不和
But there is bad blood in the Detroit Local.

3199
02:50:07,890 --> 02:50:10,710
霍法于周三下午失踪

3200
02:50:10,840 --> 02:50:14,170
目前已过去48个小时  仍然不清楚
Now, more than 48 hours later, with no word yet

3201
02:50:14,170 --> 02:50:18,170
霍法出了什么事  警方对此极为关切
on what happened to Hoffa, police are extremely concerned.

3202
02:50:18,170 --> 02:50:20,470
当局急于弄清楚
Authorities are most anxious to find whom

3203
02:50:20,470 --> 02:50:23,710
霍法在红狐餐厅外见的是谁
Hoffa was supposed to meet outside the Red Fox restaurant

3204
02:50:23,710 --> 02:50:25,410
那是最后有人看到他的地方
where he was last seen.

3205
02:50:25,930 --> 02:50:29,530
警方认为可能是安东尼·加卡罗内
Police think it could have been a man named Anthony Giacalone,

3206
02:50:29,530 --> 02:50:32,190
他被称为底特律黑手党的大佬
described as a big man in the Detroit Mafia.

3207
02:50:32,190 --> 02:50:35,560
霍法的儿子詹姆斯今天试图联系加卡罗内
Hoffa's son, James, tried to contact Giacalone today,

3208
02:50:35,570 --> 02:50:36,740
但没能联系上
but didn't succeed.

3209
02:50:36,900 --> 02:50:39,040
霍法的亲朋好友今天留在
Hoffa's family and friends stayed

3210
02:50:39,040 --> 02:50:41,080
位于湖口镇的家中
in the family home in Lake Orion today...

3211
02:50:41,080 --> 02:50:42,710
我应该打给约
I should call Jo.

3212
02:50:44,600 --> 02:50:46,350
你还没有打给约吗
You haven't called Jo yet?

3213
02:50:53,320 --> 02:50:54,280
为什么
Why?

3214
02:50:54,810 --> 02:50:55,700
什么
What?

3215
02:50:56,900 --> 02:50:57,810
为什么
Why?

3216
02:50:59,450 --> 02:51:00,420
什么为什么
Why what?

3217
02:51:02,520 --> 02:51:03,960
你为什么还没有打给约
Why haven't you called Jo?

3218
02:51:04,670 --> 02:51:08,120
有人索要赎金之类的吗
Has anybody come forward with a ransom demand or anything like that?

3219
02:51:08,150 --> 02:51:09,110
目前还没有
Not as of yet.

3220
02:51:09,430 --> 02:51:11,840
你认为这起绑架是为了索要赎金吗
Do you think the abduction was for ransom?

3221
02:51:12,540 --> 02:51:13,880
我现在打给她
I'm gonna call her now.

3222
02:51:15,460 --> 02:51:16,460
你认为这起绑架
Do you think the abduction

3223
02:51:16,460 --> 02:51:19,610
和他所在的299号地方工会
had anything to do with the recent conflicts

3224
02:51:19,620 --> 02:51:21,580
最近的内部冲突有关吗
within Local 299, his own Local?

3225
02:51:21,580 --> 02:51:24,050
我认为工会政治
I think the union politics

3226
02:51:24,050 --> 02:51:25,970
当然是需要进行调查的
is certainly something that has to be investigated.

国际卡车司机工会的一位高层人士
One high official of the Teamsters International

3228
02:51:28,510 --> 02:51:30,300
声称他担心发生了最坏的事

底特律外的一处卡车休息站
At a truck stop outside Detroit,

3233
02:51:39,820 --> 02:51:42,850
霍法在这升任卡车司机工会主席
where Hoffa rose to the top in the Teamsters Union,

3234
02:51:42,850 --> 02:51:45,180
站内的卡车司机们众说纷纭
truck drivers had a variety of theories...

她自那天后就没和我说过话

她现在有份好工作  住在费城外
She's got a good job now and lives just outside Philly.

3238
02:51:57,780 --> 02:51:59,530
但我的女儿

佩琪
Peggy...

3240
02:52:02,230 --> 02:52:03,480
自那天后
disappeared...

3241
02:52:04,780 --> 02:52:06,510
就从我的生命中消失了
from my life that day.

3242
02:52:10,340 --> 02:52:11,330
喂
Hello.

3243
02:52:13,520 --> 02:52:15,160
-喂  -喂
- Hello. - Hello?

02:52:16,250 --> 02:52:17,220
约
Jo?

3246
02:52:18,240 --> 02:52:19,520
是关于...
It's... It's...

3247
02:52:19,760 --> 02:52:22,580
-弗兰克  是你吗  -是我
- Frank. Frank? - Yeah. Yeah.

3248
02:52:23,130 --> 02:52:25,040
-嗯  -我不...
- Yeah... - I don't...

3249
02:52:25,910 --> 02:52:28,280
-听着  我...  -弗兰克
- Look, I... - Frank...

3250
02:52:28,840 --> 02:52:31,140
你觉得他还活着吗
Do you think... Do you think he's alive?

3251
02:52:34,070 --> 02:52:35,550
他肯定还活着
He's gotta be.

3252
02:52:36,660 --> 02:52:38,500
你得乐观一点
You know, you gotta think positively.

3253
02:52:38,510 --> 02:52:40,730
还没过很久...
It's just, you know, it ain't that long. It's just...

3254
02:52:40,730 --> 02:52:41,610
但你...
But do you...

3255
02:52:42,430 --> 02:52:43,890
你知道他现在还好吗
Do you know he's okay?

3256
02:52:43,890 --> 02:52:46,600
不不不  你了解我的  我...
No, no, no, I mean, you know me, I...

3257
02:52:46,600 --> 02:52:49,390
他可能干了"香蕉乔"那样的事
He maybe did something like the Joe Bananas thing,

3258
02:52:46,620 --> 02:52:49,410

约瑟夫·博南诺的外号

3259
02:52:49,390 --> 02:52:52,670
把自己绑架了
where, you know, he had himself kidnapped

3260
02:52:52,670 --> 02:52:55,890
然后毫发无损地回来了
and then came back, but he wasn't hurt, nothing happened.

3261
02:52:55,890 --> 02:52:57,770
也许他
Maybe he...

3262
02:52:58,030 --> 02:52:59,110
也许他只是想
Maybe he just felt, you know,

3263
02:52:59,110 --> 02:53:00,970
清理一下自己的思绪
he wanted to clear his head a bit.

3264
02:53:00,970 --> 02:53:03,200
但你得相信...
But you gotta just think that it's gonna be...

3265
02:53:03,910 --> 02:53:05,700
不会有事的
It's gonna be okay.

3266
02:53:06,140 --> 02:53:07,510
不会有事的
It's gonna be okay.

3267
02:53:09,340 --> 02:53:10,720
他不会...
He's gonna be...

3268
02:53:12,380 --> 02:53:14,820
你有什么需要的话尽管找我
If you need anything, I'm here for you.

3269
02:53:14,820 --> 02:53:17,160
任何事都行
Anything. Anything.

3270
02:53:18,090 --> 02:53:20,000
你可以...可以再打给我吗
Can you just... Can you call me again?

3271
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,180
好  我会...会打给你的
Yeah, I'll call... I'll call you.

3272
02:53:23,700 --> 02:53:25,270
好  我会打给你的
Yeah, I'll... I'll call you.

3273
02:53:26,440 --> 02:53:28,420
我明早打给你
I'll check in with you tomorrow.

3274
02:53:28,420 --> 02:53:30,150
好  明天打给我
Yes, call me tomorrow.

3275
02:53:30,160 --> 02:53:32,590
好  我明早打给你  好吗
Okay. I'll call you in the morning, okay?

3276
02:53:32,590 --> 02:53:33,610
你保证吗
Promise?

3277
02:53:33,610 --> 02:53:35,250
别担心  坚强点
Don't worry. Be strong.

3278
02:53:35,520 --> 02:53:37,280
乐观点  好吗
Be positive, huh?

3279
02:53:37,790 --> 02:53:40,500
好了  约  好了
Okay, Jo, okay, okay.

3280
02:53:41,090 --> 02:53:42,160
好了
Okay.

3281
02:53:42,410 --> 02:53:44,260
-好  -我晚点再打给你  再见
- Okay. - Talk to ya a little later. Bye.

3282
02:53:44,260 --> 02:53:46,590
-再见  -再见  弗兰克
- Bye. - Goodbye, Frank.

3283
02:54:45,290 --> 02:54:48,010
就是这么简单
It was no more complicated than that.

3284
02:54:50,060 --> 02:54:51,260
希兰先生
Mr. Sheeran,

3285
02:54:51,920 --> 02:54:54,240
你知道是否有人  是什么人
do you know who, if anyone,

3286
02:54:54,240 --> 02:54:57,030
绑架了詹姆斯·霍法吗
was behind the disappearance of James Hoffa?

3287
02:54:57,030 --> 02:55:00,620
跟吉米有关系的人
Everybody who ever had anything to do with Jimmy

3288
02:55:00,620 --> 02:55:02,500
都被传唤进行问询
was hauled in and questioned.

3289
02:55:02,500 --> 02:55:03,440
根据律师的建议
On the advice of counsel,

3290
02:55:03,450 --> 02:55:05,610
恕我拒绝回答这个问题
I respectfully decline to answer that question

3291
02:55:05,610 --> 02:55:07,990
因为这可能会使我负罪
on the grounds that it might tend to incriminate me.

3292
02:55:07,990 --> 02:55:09,240
好吧  我换个问题
Okay, let me ask you this:

3293
02:55:10,280 --> 02:55:11,530
我的笔是什么颜色
what color is my pen?

3294
02:55:14,150 --> 02:55:15,360
所有人都行使第五修正案拒绝回答
And everybody took the Fifth.

3295
02:55:15,360 --> 02:55:18,570
在那种情况下  只能这么做
I mean, in that situation, that's what you do.

3296
02:55:18,570 --> 02:55:19,780
不然还能怎么做呢
What else are you gonna do?

3297
02:55:19,950 --> 02:55:24,530
然而所有人都因某件事被控告和定罪
Still, everybody got indicted or convicted on one thing or another,

3298
02:55:24,530 --> 02:55:25,820
但不是因为那件事
but not that.

3299
02:55:25,820 --> 02:55:27,030
不是因为吉米
Not about Jimmy.

3300
02:55:27,240 --> 02:55:30,190
如你所知  没有人因为这件事入狱
Nobody, as you know, even went to jail for that.

3301
02:55:30,200 --> 02:55:32,280
也没有人松口  这不常见
And nobody talked, which is unusual,

3302
02:55:32,280 --> 02:55:34,940
因为通常来说  三个人守不住秘密
'cause usually, three people can keep a secret

3303
02:55:34,950 --> 02:55:36,740
除非另外两人不在人世
only when two of them are dead.

3304
02:55:38,820 --> 02:55:41,400
布鲁诺·邓赞塔和马尔科·罗西
Bruno Denzetta and Marco Rossi,

3305
02:55:41,400 --> 02:55:45,240
他们因敲诈一家货运公司而分别被判刑二十年
they got 20 years each for shaking down a trucking company.

3306
02:55:45,990 --> 02:55:47,570
普罗和他们一起被判刑
Pro was convicted with them,

3307
02:55:47,570 --> 02:55:49,240
但他早就因为
but he was already back in school

3308
02:55:49,240 --> 02:55:51,740
我之前说过的另一件事进了监狱
for that other matter I talked about before.

3309
02:55:51,820 --> 02:55:53,650
还记得可怜的工会财务
Well, you remember that poor union treasurer,

3310
02:55:53,650 --> 02:55:56,610
"三指"托尼吗  就是比普罗获得更多选票的那个
Tony "Three Fingers," who got more votes than Pro?

3311
02:55:56,610 --> 02:55:57,820
他们因此把他做掉了
They got him on that.

3312
02:55:58,110 --> 02:56:01,450
小虫萨利动的手
Sally Bugs, you know, he did that one.

3313
02:56:07,360 --> 02:56:11,320
有一天  有人看见小虫走进了政府大楼
One day, Bugs was seen walking into the Federal building.

3314
02:56:12,200 --> 02:56:14,400
他做的事不是犯罪
What he did itself ain't no crime.

3315
02:56:14,400 --> 02:56:16,910
很多人都因为做了某事而被传唤
I mean, a lot of people get called in for things.

3316
02:56:17,450 --> 02:56:19,070
但萨利明白事理
But Sally knows better.

3317
02:56:19,610 --> 02:56:21,820
他怎么会什么都没告诉别人呢
How come he didn't say anything to anybody?

3318
02:56:23,150 --> 02:56:24,990
他一句话都没跟别人说
He didn't tell anybody one word.

3319
02:56:25,610 --> 02:56:26,950
一句话都没有
Not one word.

3320
02:56:28,030 --> 02:56:29,700
可以肯定的是
And one thing for sure,

3321
02:56:30,780 --> 02:56:32,780
他去那里不是为了吃午餐的
he didn't go there for fucking lunch.

3322
02:56:46,030 --> 02:56:46,820
萨利
Sally.

3323
02:56:47,820 --> 02:56:49,570
-你好吗  -你好啊  爱尔兰人
- What's good? - Hey, Irish.

3324
02:57:02,030 --> 02:57:03,820
后来才知道萨利确实跟别人说了
Turns out Sally did tell somebody

3325
02:57:03,820 --> 02:57:05,610
他要去那里办事
he had to go in there for something.

3326
02:57:05,610 --> 02:57:07,190
只不过对方忘了告诉别人
They just forgot to tell somebody else.

3327
02:57:07,200 --> 02:57:09,360
我们杀错人了
So it was a bad hit.

3328
02:57:12,320 --> 02:57:14,530
吉米的儿子查奇  他的养子
Jimmy's son, Chuckie, you know, his foster son,

3329
02:57:14,530 --> 02:57:16,030
也参与了这件事
was in the thing, too,

3330
02:57:16,030 --> 02:57:17,740
但他并不知情
but he didn't know it.

3331
02:57:18,490 --> 02:57:20,610
查奇只知道他要接
All Chuckie knew was he was pickin' up

3332
02:57:20,610 --> 02:57:22,360
我和一个普罗的人
one of Pro's guys and me,

3333
02:57:22,360 --> 02:57:24,490
然后我们要一起到红狐餐厅
and we was all gonna pick up his dad

3334
02:57:24,490 --> 02:57:26,320
接他爸去开会
at the Red Fox for a meeting.

3335
02:57:27,110 --> 02:57:28,570
他参与了这件事  没错
Well, I mean, he was in it, yeah,

3336
02:57:28,570 --> 02:57:30,860
可以这么说  但他是糊里糊涂的
you could say that, but stupidly.

3337
02:57:31,570 --> 02:57:34,400
我一直对查奇心怀愧疚
I... I always felt sorry for Chuckie in this whole thing.

3338
02:57:34,400 --> 02:57:36,110
我现在仍然很愧疚
And I... I still do.

3339
02:57:36,200 --> 02:57:37,860
联调局因为一台车的破事
And the Feds gave him ten months

3340
02:57:37,860 --> 02:57:40,530
让他被判刑十个月  事情大概就是这样
for some bullshit thing about a car, and that's about it.

3341
02:57:40,530 --> 02:57:41,820
谁知道是在搞什么
Who knows what the fuck...

3342
02:57:43,900 --> 02:57:47,200
胖子托尼·萨雷诺因为所得税的事情被抓
Fat Tony Salerno, they got on an income tax thing.

3343
02:57:48,110 --> 02:57:49,070
不久之后
A little while after,

3344
02:57:49,070 --> 02:57:51,740
他被查出患有前列腺癌
he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.

3345
02:57:55,490 --> 02:57:58,160
北加州有一家
There's a... a pork store up in...

3346
02:58:00,700 --> 02:58:02,530
猪肉店
northern California.

3347
02:58:03,950 --> 02:58:04,780
就在
Right around...

3348
02:58:06,400 --> 02:58:07,320
核桃溪市边上
Walnut Creek.

3349
02:58:07,320 --> 02:58:08,820
你是从那里来的  对吧
You're from up there, ain't you?

3350
02:58:09,280 --> 02:58:10,740
-对  -嗯
- Yeah. - Yeah.

3351
02:58:10,820 --> 02:58:12,990
你可能还认识店主
And you might even know the guy that runs it.

3352
02:58:13,650 --> 02:58:15,910
其实  我想让你帮个忙
Actually, I'm looking for a little favor...

3353
02:58:16,320 --> 02:58:17,950
帮他  不是帮我
for him, not for me.

3354
02:58:19,110 --> 02:58:22,780
你能不能帮他弄张机票  比如去澳大利亚的
But if you can get him a ticket, like, to Australia...

3355
02:58:24,400 --> 02:58:25,450
你懂我的意思
You know what I mean.

3356
02:58:28,240 --> 02:58:29,030
好
Yeah.

3357
02:58:30,820 --> 02:58:32,660
你愿意帮他出国吗
You want to help him get down there?

3358
02:58:38,400 --> 02:58:39,360
愿意
Ye... Yeah.

3359
02:58:39,610 --> 02:58:41,400
罗素被抓了
Now, Russell, he got pinched

3360
02:58:41,400 --> 02:58:44,030
因为杰克·拿波里从他那赊账
for telling Jimmy the Weasel to strangle Jack Napoli

3361
02:58:44,030 --> 02:58:46,820
拿走了价值两万五的珠宝却没还钱
over some beef about 25 grand of jewelry

3362
02:58:46,820 --> 02:58:49,360
于是他让黄鼠狼吉米
that Jack took on credit from Russell

3363
02:58:49,360 --> 02:58:51,110
去把杰克勒死
and then he never paid for.

3364
02:58:51,530 --> 02:58:53,820
你不能对罗素做这样的事
Now, with Russ, you don't do that.

3365
02:58:54,950 --> 02:58:58,160
问题在于  黄鼠狼叛变了
So, only thing is, the Weasel, he flipped.

3366
02:58:58,240 --> 02:58:59,610
他身上带了窃听器
He had a wire on him.

3367
02:59:00,110 --> 02:59:02,700
他们声称他"密谋杀害目击者"
They called it "conspiracy to kill a witness."

3368
02:59:02,740 --> 02:59:04,030
显而易见的是
It was obvious to everybody else

3369
02:59:04,030 --> 02:59:05,860
拿波里做得不对
that Napoli was clearly in the wrong.

3370
02:59:05,860 --> 02:59:08,070
这难道不明显吗
I mean, how could you not see that?

3371
02:59:08,070 --> 02:59:09,940
他陷害了他  这是诱捕
He set him up. It was entrapment.

3372
02:59:09,950 --> 02:59:11,320
难道不是吗
What else could you call it?

3373
02:59:11,530 --> 02:59:14,860
但这件事我现在也不想细说
But that's another thing I don't wanna get into now.

3374
02:59:15,820 --> 02:59:16,610
举起右手
Raise your right hand.

3375
02:59:16,610 --> 02:59:19,990
他们把我送上法庭  指控我行贿和工会诈骗
They brought me up on bribery and labor racketeering charges

3376
02:59:19,990 --> 02:59:22,200
还有其他一些我不知道的破事
and some other bullshit things I don't know.

3377
02:59:21,780 --> 02:59:25,700
{\an8}谋杀  谋杀未遂  恐吓  挪用公款  纵火

3378
02:59:22,450 --> 02:59:24,280
你是否向上帝发誓  你所说的全是事实
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

3379
02:59:24,280 --> 02:59:25,860
-没有任何隐瞒  -我发誓
- so help you God? - I do.

3380
02:59:25,860 --> 02:59:27,990
你是否还告诉他们巴法先生
Did you also tell them that Mr. Boffa

3381
02:59:27,990 --> 02:59:30,110
送了你和你妻子豪车
had given you and your wife luxury vehicles?

3382
02:59:30,110 --> 02:59:33,360
科尔先生  我工作了44年
Mr. Cole, I worked for 44 years,

3383
02:59:33,360 --> 02:59:37,820
我没收过巴法或者别人的任何不法之财
I never took one dime illegal off Boffa or nobody else.

3384
02:59:37,820 --> 02:59:40,280
你怎么想是你的事  跟我没关系
You can think whatever you wanna think. Don't matter to me.

3385
02:59:40,280 --> 02:59:43,360
但他们能落实的罪名  只有我炸了一家吊车公司
But all they got me for was blowing up a crane company

3386
02:59:43,360 --> 02:59:45,440
那家公司开除了我的两个工会谈判代表
that fired two of my shop stewards

3387
02:59:45,450 --> 02:59:46,820
却没有正当的理由
for no good reason.

3388
02:59:49,110 --> 02:59:51,030
还有我的林肯汽车
And... And my Lincoln.

3389
02:59:51,570 --> 02:59:54,280
我从尤金·巴法手里买下来的
I mean, I bought that car from Eugene Boffa.

3390
02:59:55,070 --> 02:59:57,650
他向货运公司出租卡车司机
He leased truck drivers to freight companies,

3391
02:59:57,650 --> 03:00:00,360
然后付给他们低于正常标准的工资
and then he paid them substandard wages.

3392
03:00:02,450 --> 03:00:04,690
他们说我买这辆车花的钱
They said I paid a lot less for the car

3393
03:00:04,700 --> 03:00:06,280
远低于其价值
than what it was worth.

3394
03:00:06,780 --> 03:00:08,860
他们说这辆车是贿赂
They said the car was a bribe.

3395
03:00:14,900 --> 03:00:16,820
我爱这辆车
I... I... I loved that car.

3396
03:00:17,570 --> 03:00:21,110
但它不值得我为它坐十八年牢
But it wasn't worth the 18 years they gave me for it.

3397
03:00:21,570 --> 03:00:22,610
这是肯定的
That's for sure.

3398
03:00:27,490 --> 03:00:29,740
罗素中风了
Russell, he had a stroke.

3399
03:00:29,900 --> 03:00:33,450
胖托尼尿失禁了
Fat Tony, he couldn't control his urine no more.

3400
03:00:33,490 --> 03:00:38,110
我在安齐奥的散兵坑里得上的关节炎
And my arthritis that started in the foxholes of Anzio

3401
03:00:38,110 --> 03:00:40,740
不断折磨着我的腰
was eatin' away at my lower back now,

3402
03:00:40,740 --> 03:00:43,360
我的脚已经没什么知觉了
and I couldn't feel much in my feet no more.

3403
03:00:43,780 --> 03:00:44,900
我需要拄拐杖
I needed a cane.

3404
03:00:44,900 --> 03:00:47,860
但他们不会在牢里给你配拐杖
But, you know, they're not gonna give you a cane in the can

3405
03:00:47,860 --> 03:00:50,450
因为他们怕你把它当作武器
because they say you're gonna use it as a weapon.

3406
03:00:50,780 --> 03:00:52,530
有一种叫诺立汀的药
There was this medicine, Neurontin,

3407
03:00:52,530 --> 03:00:53,690
对我有点帮助
it helped me a little bit,

3408
03:00:53,700 --> 03:00:55,820
但也会使你神经错乱
but it also made you loopy.

3409
03:00:55,820 --> 03:00:56,610
他要打中了
He's got it!

3410
03:00:57,400 --> 03:00:58,240
他要打中了
He's got it!

3411
03:00:59,990 --> 03:01:01,320
我们在严寒中
We were all falling apart right there

3412
03:01:01,320 --> 03:01:02,990
都要崩溃了
in the freezing fucking cold.

3413
03:01:02,990 --> 03:01:04,860
我在这里就能看到  你现在怕了吗
I can see it from here. You getting scared now?

3414
03:01:04,860 --> 03:01:06,780
你再练个十年
Yeah, you stay here another fucking ten years,

3415
03:01:06,780 --> 03:01:07,910
才有可能赢我
you'll beat me.

3416
03:01:17,110 --> 03:01:18,990
这是好喝的葡萄汁吗
Is this the good grape juice?

3417
03:01:31,740 --> 03:01:32,820
我吃不了这个
I can't eat it.

3418
03:01:33,610 --> 03:01:35,320
-吃一口  -我没牙  吃不了
- Take a bite. - I got no teeth. I can't.

3419
03:01:35,320 --> 03:01:36,660
给我一小块
Put a little piece.

3420
03:01:37,110 --> 03:01:38,530
一小块就好  谢谢
Just a little piece, thank you.

3421
03:01:38,530 --> 03:01:39,530
还要吗
That's it?

3422
03:01:53,070 --> 03:01:54,820
-好吃吧  -好吃
- E buono, no? - Buono.

3423
03:01:55,400 --> 03:01:56,320
好吃
Buono.

3424
03:02:01,200 --> 03:02:02,700
吉米是个好人
Jimmy was a good man.

3425
03:02:03,400 --> 03:02:05,780
他还有美满的家庭  不是吗
You know? He had a nice family too, huh?

3426
03:02:08,780 --> 03:02:10,570
是的  我知道
Yeah. Yeah. I know.

3427
03:02:12,240 --> 03:02:14,700
我从没想过要把事情做这么绝
I never wanted it to go that far.

3428
03:02:23,860 --> 03:02:26,410
我为了我们的利益而放弃了他
I picked us over him.

3429
03:02:27,530 --> 03:02:28,320
去他们的
Fuck 'em.

3430
03:02:29,740 --> 03:02:30,530
去他们的
Fuck 'em.

3431
03:02:32,740 --> 03:02:33,660
去他们的
Fuck 'em.

3432
03:02:39,700 --> 03:02:43,700
吃吧  小子  吃吧
Mangia che cresci... figlio mio, mangia.

3433
03:02:58,530 --> 03:02:59,280
罗素
Hey, Russ.

3434
03:02:59,820 --> 03:03:01,110
弗兰克
Hey, Frankie.

3435
03:03:01,110 --> 03:03:02,940
-你要去哪  -什么
- Where you goin'? - What?

3436
03:03:02,950 --> 03:03:05,530
-你要去哪  -我要去教堂
- Where you goin'? - I'm going to church.

3437
03:03:05,990 --> 03:03:06,820
教堂
Church?

3438
03:03:07,400 --> 03:03:09,070
别笑  到时你就知道了
Don't laugh, you'll see.

3439
03:03:09,110 --> 03:03:10,360
别笑
Don't laugh.

3440
03:03:10,820 --> 03:03:12,030
到时你就知道了
You'll see.

3441
03:03:19,900 --> 03:03:21,700
罗素去了教堂
Russell went to church.

3442
03:03:23,820 --> 03:03:26,950
后来他去了监狱的医院
Then he went to the prison hospital.

3443
03:03:29,240 --> 03:03:32,570
再后来他进了坟墓
And... And then he went to the graveyard.

3444
03:03:35,400 --> 03:03:37,540
主耶稣基督
Lord Jesus Christ...

3445
03:03:38,530 --> 03:03:40,360
我在那年的十月出狱了
I got out that October.

3446
03:03:40,450 --> 03:03:42,700
琳妮在十二月去世了
Reenie died in December.

3447
03:03:42,900 --> 03:03:45,660
准确地说是12月23日
On December 23rd, to be exact.

3448
03:03:46,030 --> 03:03:47,200
肺癌
Lung cancer.

3449
03:03:47,700 --> 03:03:48,860
一点也不意外
No surprise.

3450
03:03:49,860 --> 03:03:52,610
即使夺去了我们必死的身躯
...even as it claims our mortal bodies.

3451
03:03:53,030 --> 03:03:55,900
让我们的姐妹在此安眠
Grant that our sister may sleep here in peace,

3452
03:03:55,900 --> 03:03:58,320
直至您用荣光将她唤醒
until you awaken her to glory.

3453
03:03:58,900 --> 03:04:01,530
因为您就是复苏和生命
For you are the resurrection and the life.

3454
03:04:01,650 --> 03:04:04,240
然后她将与您面对面
And then she will see you face to face,

3455
03:04:04,280 --> 03:04:06,570
在您的光明中看见光明
and in your light will see light,

3456
03:04:06,780 --> 03:04:11,110
感受上帝的光辉  直到永远
and know the splendor of God for ever and ever.

3457
03:04:11,360 --> 03:04:12,280
阿门
Amen.

3458
03:04:45,360 --> 03:04:50,200
这个赛季他的击打率比生涯平均的29.6%
...six points shy of his career average of .296

3459
03:04:50,360 --> 03:04:51,740
低了六个百分点
coming into this season.

3460
03:04:51,990 --> 03:04:54,780
费城队阵容里前四位击球员
Top four batters in this lineup for Philadelphia

3461
03:04:54,780 --> 03:04:57,030
都是左右手都能打的
today are all switch hitters.

3462
03:05:50,860 --> 03:05:53,490
使一些政策制定者失望的是
Much to the frustration of some policy makers,

3463
03:05:53,490 --> 03:05:56,320
北约军事领导人不会冒险
NATO military leaders will not risk

3464
03:05:56,320 --> 03:05:59,990
对科索沃的塞尔维亚军队发动低空袭击
low flying attacks on Serb troops in Kosovo.

3465
03:06:01,150 --> 03:06:04,440
还需要进行多日的系统轰炸
It could take days more of systematic bombing,

3466
03:06:04,450 --> 03:06:05,780
尤其是因为塞尔维亚人
especially since the Serbs

3467
03:06:05,780 --> 03:06:08,940
将很多防空导弹藏了起来
have hidden so many of their anti-aircraft missiles,

3468
03:06:08,950 --> 03:06:11,990
想引诱北约军队进行低空空袭
in essence, daring NATO to fly low.

3469
03:06:34,820 --> 03:06:37,070
你去吧  去吧
You go... you go there. Yeah, yeah.

3470
03:06:37,570 --> 03:06:38,490
去吧
Yeah, yeah.

3471
03:06:45,150 --> 03:06:48,400
{\an8}暂停营业
请到隔壁柜台

3472
03:06:47,990 --> 03:06:48,910
佩琪
Peggy.

3473
03:06:49,070 --> 03:06:51,910
佩琪  我只是想和你聊聊
Peggy. I just want to talk.

3474
03:07:13,450 --> 03:07:15,200
我只是  我...
I just, you know... I...

3475
03:07:15,400 --> 03:07:16,860
她走开了
She walked away.

3476
03:07:17,950 --> 03:07:20,650
我知道她生我的气  但我想...
I know she's mad at me and all, but I... I want...

3477
03:07:20,650 --> 03:07:23,490
打给她  打给她  我只是想和她聊聊
Call her. Call her. I just want to talk to her.

3478
03:07:24,860 --> 03:07:26,820
和她聊什么呢
Talk to her and tell her what?

3479
03:07:27,030 --> 03:07:27,820
什么
What...

3480
03:07:28,490 --> 03:07:30,660
我只是想跟她道个歉  仅此而已
I just want to say I'm sorry. That's all.

3481
03:07:32,150 --> 03:07:33,160
为什么道歉
For?

3482
03:07:35,650 --> 03:07:36,410
听着
Look...

3483
03:07:37,860 --> 03:07:40,990
我知道我不是个好父亲  我知道
I know I wasn't a... a good dad. I know that.

3484
03:07:40,990 --> 03:07:43,570
我知道  我只是想保护她
I know that. I was just trying to protect her.

3485
03:07:43,700 --> 03:07:44,820
保护你们每个人不受伤害
Protect all of youse.

3486
03:07:44,820 --> 03:07:47,360
那就是我做的事
I mean, that's what I was doing. That's...

3487
03:07:48,360 --> 03:07:49,360
受什么伤害
From what?

3488
03:07:50,610 --> 03:07:51,570
一切事情
Well, everything.

3489
03:07:52,200 --> 03:07:52,950
我是说
I mean...

3490
03:07:53,570 --> 03:07:57,070
某种程度上  你们以前过着受保护的生活
You... Youse had a sheltered life, in a way,

3491
03:07:57,240 --> 03:07:59,110
因为你们没见过我所见过的事
because you didn't see what I see

3492
03:07:59,110 --> 03:08:00,450
没经历过我所经历的事
and what I've been through.

3493
03:08:02,280 --> 03:08:04,950
外面有很多坏人
There's a lot of bad people out there.

3494
03:08:05,240 --> 03:08:06,530
我还能做什么
What else am I gonna do?

3495
03:08:07,530 --> 03:08:10,410
爸  你根本不知道我们以前的感受
Daddy, you have no idea what it was like for us.

3496
03:08:11,700 --> 03:08:13,360
我们出了问题没法找你
I mean, we couldn't go to you with a problem

3497
03:08:13,360 --> 03:08:14,940
怕你会做不好的事
'cause of what you would do.

3498
03:08:14,950 --> 03:08:17,360
我们没法向你寻求保护
You know, we couldn't come to you for protection

3499
03:08:17,360 --> 03:08:19,910
因为你会做可怕的事
because of the terrible things that you would do.

3500
03:08:22,570 --> 03:08:23,570
我只是  只是
I was just... I was...

3501
03:08:23,570 --> 03:08:26,110
不想看你们受到伤害  仅此而已
I didn't want to see youse get hurt, that's all.

3502
03:08:31,200 --> 03:08:33,820
我知道你们读到过  听说过很多我的事情
I know you read a lot of things about me, heard about me.

3503
03:08:34,280 --> 03:08:35,200
对不起
I'm sorry.

3504
03:08:35,860 --> 03:08:36,700
我...
I...

3505
03:08:38,950 --> 03:08:42,240
我现在能做些什么来补偿你们吗
Can I do anything now to make it up to you?

3506
03:08:53,860 --> 03:08:56,280
如果你想要奢华一点的
If you're looking for something with a little bit more luxury,

3507
03:08:56,280 --> 03:08:58,280
我们有这两款
we have these two models over here.

3508
03:08:58,490 --> 03:09:00,910
它们就像棺材界的凯迪拉克
They're like the Cadillacs of caskets.

3509
03:09:01,150 --> 03:09:02,780
如果你要火化的话
Now, if we puttin' you in the fuckin' oven,

3510
03:09:02,780 --> 03:09:04,740
用什么棺材其实都无所谓
it really doesn't matter what you go in.

3511
03:09:05,070 --> 03:09:06,650
越便宜越好
The cheapest shit possible.

3512
03:09:06,650 --> 03:09:08,610
复合板就够了
Particle board, that's it.

3513
03:09:08,610 --> 03:09:11,240
后事打算怎么办  火葬吗
What are we doin' today? Are we doin' a cremation?

3514
03:09:11,780 --> 03:09:13,950
-土葬  -土葬
- A burial. - Burial?

3515
03:09:14,450 --> 03:09:16,070
是男人还是女人
Is it for a man or for a woman?

3516
03:09:16,110 --> 03:09:16,990
是我
Me.

3517
03:09:18,150 --> 03:09:19,030
靠
Shit.

3518
03:09:23,650 --> 03:09:24,950
有喜欢的吗
You see anything you like?

3519
03:09:36,360 --> 03:09:38,490
-那个绿色的  -那个很漂亮
- That green one. - That's a beauty.

3520
03:09:38,490 --> 03:09:40,740
如果你今天就买的话
That one'll set you back about $7,500

3521
03:09:40,740 --> 03:09:42,200
大概要七千五百块
if you take it home today.

3522
03:09:43,070 --> 03:09:43,990
你觉得呢
What do you think?

3523
03:09:45,570 --> 03:09:46,700
能便宜点吗
Can you do any better?

3524
03:09:47,650 --> 03:09:51,820
伙计  你想在这棺材里长眠是吧
I mean, buddy, this is what you want to go home in, no?

3525
03:09:53,950 --> 03:09:56,660
那就算你六千吧  怎么样
I think we could go six on that for you. How about that?

3526
03:09:57,150 --> 03:09:59,780
-六千现金  行吗  -可以
- Six flat cash work for you? - That's good.

3527
03:10:00,650 --> 03:10:01,570
可以
Good for me.

3528
03:10:21,650 --> 03:10:22,990
迟早
Sooner or later,

3529
03:10:23,400 --> 03:10:26,490
这世上每一个人都有离开的那天
everybody put here has a date when he's gonna go.

3530
03:10:26,490 --> 03:10:28,110
人生就是如此
That's just the way it is.

3531
03:10:29,240 --> 03:10:33,200
我认为离开的时候肯定会发生什么
And I think there's gotta be something when you go

3532
03:10:33,860 --> 03:10:38,160
不然  这一切到底是怎么开始的
'cause, I mean, how the hell did this whole thing start?

3533
03:10:42,200 --> 03:10:44,690
比我聪明的人都没搞清楚
People smarter than me can't figure it out.

3534
03:10:44,700 --> 03:10:46,530
所以我绝对不会选择火葬
That's why I would never go for cremation

3535
03:10:46,530 --> 03:10:48,860
因为那就真的结束了
because it's so... it's so final.

3536
03:10:50,780 --> 03:10:51,910
这个
This... This one.

3537
03:10:53,700 --> 03:10:55,450
1948号
1948.

3538
03:10:56,280 --> 03:10:59,320
对埋葬你的人来说最难接受的
That's the hardest part of anybody when they bury youse,

3539
03:10:59,320 --> 03:11:00,990
就是入土的时候
is when they go into the ground

3540
03:11:01,200 --> 03:11:03,530
因为那就真的结束了
because it's... it's so final.

3541
03:11:04,820 --> 03:11:07,240
如果你要埋在房子里  房子还在
If you go into a building, the building's there.

3542
03:11:07,280 --> 03:11:08,660
墓还在
The crypt is there.

3543
03:11:08,780 --> 03:11:10,400
一定要用金属棺材
It has to be a metal casket,

3544
03:11:10,400 --> 03:11:12,240
他们把你放在房间里
and they have you in the room.

3545
03:11:12,610 --> 03:11:13,820
都放好
And all that there.

3546
03:11:14,070 --> 03:11:15,360
就不算完全结束了
It's just not as final.

3547
03:11:15,360 --> 03:11:18,320
你死了  但还没结束
You're dead, but it ain't that final.

3548
03:11:21,490 --> 03:11:25,740
抱歉  如果你们想谈霍法先生的事
I'm sorry, but I gotta direct youse to my attorney,

3549
03:11:25,740 --> 03:11:26,990

3551
03:11:31,950 --> 03:11:33,740
雷加诺先生
or any matter, for that matter.

3552
03:11:34,030 --> 03:11:35,860
我没有别的可说的
I got noth... nothing new to say.

3553
03:11:36,990 --> 03:11:38,070
他死了
He's dead.

3554
03:11:38,990 --> 03:11:39,990
谁死了
Who's dead?

3555
03:11:40,650 --> 03:11:42,190
你的律师  雷加诺先生
Your attorney, Mr. Ragano.

3556
03:11:42,200 --> 03:11:43,070
-他死了  -是的
- He's dead? - Yeah.

3557
03:11:43,070 --> 03:11:44,070
谁干的
Who did it?

3558
03:11:45,990 --> 03:11:46,990
癌症
Cancer.

3559
03:11:49,780 --> 03:11:51,660
所有人都死了  希兰先生
Everybody's dead, Mr. Sheeran.

3560
03:11:53,490 --> 03:11:54,610
结束了
It's over.

3561
03:11:55,150 --> 03:11:56,280
他们都死了
They're all gone.

3562
03:11:56,570 --> 03:11:58,660
罗素  安吉洛  萨雷诺
Russell, Angelo, Salerno,

3563
03:11:58,900 --> 03:12:01,240
普罗  多夫曼  小虫萨利
Pro, Dorfman, Sally Bugs.

3564
03:12:01,240 --> 03:12:02,360
他们都死了
They're gone.

3565
03:12:04,030 --> 03:12:05,240
你在保护谁
Who are you protecting?

3566
03:12:07,490 --> 03:12:08,780
你知道谁没死吗
You know who's not gone?

3567
03:12:10,400 --> 03:12:12,820
霍法先生的家人  他的孩子们
Mr. Hoffa's family. His children.

3568
03:12:13,280 --> 03:12:16,700
他们还活着  他们一辈子都得不到真相
They're here. And they gotta live not knowing.

3569
03:12:17,740 --> 03:12:18,820
那很难熬
That's hard to do.

3570
03:12:21,860 --> 03:12:23,490
你也有孩子  弗兰克
I mean, you got kids, Frank.

3571
03:12:24,150 --> 03:12:25,280
你能想象吗
Can you imagine?

3572
03:12:30,900 --> 03:12:34,200
弗兰克  是时候了  该说出真相了
Frank, it's time. It's time you say what happened.

3573
03:12:40,900 --> 03:12:42,950
你们看起来人不错
You seem like nice fellas.

3574
03:12:43,780 --> 03:12:45,860
感谢你们亲自来找我
I appreciate youse coming to see me.

3575
03:12:46,650 --> 03:12:48,570
但我帮不了你们
But I... I can't help you.

3576
03:12:52,280 --> 03:12:53,110
就这样吗
That's it?

3577
03:12:53,150 --> 03:12:54,030
就这样
That's it.

3578
03:13:01,070 --> 03:13:03,690
圣母玛利亚
Holy Mary, Mother of God...

3579
03:13:03,700 --> 03:13:05,030
圣母玛利亚
Holy Mary, Mother of God...

3580
03:13:05,030 --> 03:13:07,650
-请为我们这些罪人祈祷  -请为我们这些罪人祈祷
- Pray for us sinners... - Pray for us sinners...

3581
03:13:07,650 --> 03:13:11,200
-现在和我们临终时  -现在和我们临终时
- Now and at the hour of our death. - Now and at the hour of our death.

3582
03:13:11,320 --> 03:13:12,910
-阿门  -阿门
- Amen. - Amen.

3583
03:13:15,740 --> 03:13:16,740
这...
That was...

3584
03:13:17,450 --> 03:13:18,990
这还不错
That wasn't too bad.

3585
03:13:19,280 --> 03:13:20,610
很久没祷告过了
It's been a while.

3586
03:13:21,110 --> 03:13:22,190
真的很不错
Not bad at all.

3587
03:13:22,200 --> 03:13:24,610
真心实意的  发自内心
And the intention was there. The intention.

3588
03:13:24,610 --> 03:13:25,490
我知道
I know.

3589
03:13:26,400 --> 03:13:28,240
我知道你是发自内心的
I know the intention is there.

3590
03:13:28,360 --> 03:13:29,740
是真的  神父
It was there, Father.

3591
03:13:31,400 --> 03:13:33,110
你对自己做过的事
Do you feel anything for...

3592
03:13:33,530 --> 03:13:35,910
有任何感觉吗
for what you've done?

3593
03:13:39,280 --> 03:13:42,660
没有  不过也许...
I, I don't. I mean, maybe that...

3594
03:13:43,650 --> 03:13:45,570
我现在坐在这里跟你说话
Because I'm here now talking to you,

3595
03:13:45,570 --> 03:13:47,610
也许这本身就是
that in itself is,

3596
03:13:47,610 --> 03:13:51,030
一种尝试...
you know, an attempt to...

3597
03:13:54,570 --> 03:13:57,820
但你真的一点感觉都没有吗
But you don't feel anything at all?

3598
03:13:59,490 --> 03:14:00,320
没有
No.

3599
03:14:03,070 --> 03:14:04,820
都是过去的事了
Water under the dam.

3600
03:14:09,200 --> 03:14:13,320
对他的家人有没有愧疚呢
Any... Any remorse for the families?

3601
03:14:13,530 --> 03:14:16,110
我不认识他的家人
I... I didn't know the families.

3602
03:14:18,950 --> 03:14:21,070
我不认识他们  只认识一个
I didn't know 'em. Except one I knew.

3603
03:14:26,780 --> 03:14:29,740
我认为我们可以悔过
I think we can... we can be sorry...

3604
03:14:29,820 --> 03:14:33,360
我们可以悔过  即使我们不觉得难过
We can be sorry even when we don't feel sorry.

3605
03:14:33,400 --> 03:14:36,400
我们可以做出意志上的决定
Well, for us to say, to make a decision of the will...

3606
03:14:36,400 --> 03:14:37,360
"上帝啊
"God...

3607
03:14:38,070 --> 03:14:39,820
我很抱歉  上帝
I am sorry, God.

3608
03:14:41,450 --> 03:14:42,700
原谅我"
Forgive me."

3609
03:14:43,610 --> 03:14:46,570
这就是意志上的决定
And that... that's a decision of the will.

3610
03:14:54,200 --> 03:14:55,490
什么样的人
What kind of man

3611
03:14:57,400 --> 03:15:00,110
会打那样一通电话
makes a... a phone call like that?

3612
03:15:05,700 --> 03:15:07,940
什么意思  什么电话
What do you mean? What phone call?

3613
03:15:07,950 --> 03:15:10,320
我不能告诉你
Well, I can't tell you.

3614
03:15:12,610 --> 03:15:13,910
我不能  我得...
I can't. I got...

3615
03:15:15,070 --> 03:15:16,110
没关系
That's okay.

3616
03:15:19,700 --> 03:15:21,610
弗兰克  你想再和我祷告一次吗
Frank, do you wanna pray with me again?

3617
03:15:21,610 --> 03:15:22,530
好的
Yeah.

3618
03:15:23,530 --> 03:15:25,490
这次我们用自己的话来说  好吗
This time, we'll do it in our own words. Okay?

3619
03:15:25,490 --> 03:15:26,320
好
Okay.

3620
03:15:28,650 --> 03:15:30,820
上帝啊  我们来到您面前
God, we come before you

3621
03:15:31,360 --> 03:15:33,700
罪孽深重  忧伤不已
sinful and sorrowful.

3622
03:15:33,950 --> 03:15:36,240
罪孽深重  忧伤不已
Sinful and sorrowful.

3623
03:15:37,280 --> 03:15:41,280
我们知道您善良仁慈
We know you are all good and all merciful.

3624
03:15:41,450 --> 03:15:44,860
我们知道您善良仁慈
We know you are all good and all merciful.

3625
03:15:45,950 --> 03:15:49,030
-我们请求您  -我们请求您
- We ask you... - We ask you...

3626
03:15:49,030 --> 03:15:51,240
用您的眼光

3627
03:15:51,240 --> 03:15:54,240
用您的眼光
to help us see ourselves...

3628
03:15:54,240 --> 03:15:57,490
-帮我们看清自己  -帮我们看清自己
- as you see us. - as you see us.

3629
03:15:59,900 --> 03:16:01,490
这是我女儿  佩琪
That's my daughter, Peggy.

3630
03:16:01,900 --> 03:16:03,240
-是吗  -是的
- Is it? - Yeah.

3631
03:16:03,450 --> 03:16:04,780
我好像还没见过她
I don't think I've met her yet.

3632
03:16:05,030 --> 03:16:07,910
她不怎么过来
Well, she... she ain't been around too much.

3633
03:16:08,110 --> 03:16:09,740
她是你的独生女吗
Is she your only child?
