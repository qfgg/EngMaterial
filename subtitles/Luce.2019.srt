18
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,880
为了表彰我们的学术成就的

20
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,220
然而我想请求各位同学
I instead ask my fellow classmates

21
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,540
向引领我们的将军致敬
to honor the generals that lead us.

22
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,800
如果没有父母和老师
Without our parents and our teachers,

23
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:03,130
我们就会是对未来的战斗毫无准备的士兵
we would be troops unprepared for the battles that lay ahead of us.

24
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,590
我们知道未来的路并不好走
We know the road won't be easy.

25
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,920
但有了你们的爱和信任
But with your love and your faith,

26
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,220
我们肯定能顺利地走下去
we can be certain we'll find a way.

27
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,280
所以我希望接下来的请求不会太过分
So I hope it's not going too far out of line

28
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,720
请同学们起立
to ask my classmates to rise...

29
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,230
利用这个机会表示感谢
and to take this opportunity to thank you...

30
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,400
感谢老师
our teachers...

31
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,900
感谢父母
and our parents...

32
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,200
感谢他们帮我们成为理想中的自己
for helping us become who we're meant to be.

33
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,340
希望你们喜欢这掌声  因为等到明天
I hope you enjoyed that because tomorrow

34
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,420
我们又要让你们抓狂了
we'll be back to driving you crazy.

35
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,880
太棒了
It was incredible.

36
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,550
我想问个问题  怎么才能克隆这个家伙
Here's my question: How do we clone this guy?

37
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,300
怎么才能克隆他
How do we clone him?

38
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,450
干得漂亮
Great job.

39
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,160
-谢谢  -打扰一下
- Thank you. - Excuse me.

40
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,560
-请问是埃德加夫妇吗  -威尔逊老师
- Mr. And Mr. Edgar? - Ms. Wilson!

41
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,990
这位是威尔逊老师
Guys, this is Ms. Wilson,

42
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,580
我的历史与政府老师
my history and government teacher.

43
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,700
幸会
A pleasure.

44
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,160
早有耳闻
We've heard so much about you.

45
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,080
-是吗  -你的课堂
- Have you? - Well, your class.

46
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,090
卢斯总是提起
Luce can't stop talking about it.

47
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,550
是吗
Is that so?

48
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,380
威尔逊老师很严厉  但还是我最喜欢的老师之一
Ms. Wilson's tough, but still one of my favorites.

49
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,550
你喜欢我的演讲吗
Did you like my speech?

50
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,620
喜欢
I did.

51
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,970
威尔逊老师总是说
Ms. Wilson's always saying

52
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,140
我们应该直抒胸臆  不计代价
we should speak our minds no matter the cost.

53
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,500
我同意
Amen to that.

54
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,350
很高兴终于见到你了
Well, it's great to finally meet you.

55
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,460
我也是
You too.

56
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,810
卢斯是我们最好的学生之一
Luce is, uh, one of our best.

57
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,170
他是学校里重要的榜样人物
He's an important example to the school.

58
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,440
我们很为他骄傲
We're very proud of him.

59
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,380
应该的
You should be.

60
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,390
失陪一下  丹
Excuse me. Dan...

61
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,200
我不想再演讲一次了
I don't want to give another one.

62
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,240
为什么  他们请你合情合理
Why? It makes sense they asked you.

63
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,560
你讲得很好
You did a great job.

64
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,120
我只不过是发表了一次演讲
I literally just gave a speech.

65
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,750
你做的公共演讲越多
The more public speaking you do,

66
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,530
申请好大学就越容易
the better it'll look for college.

67
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,900
你答应他们了吧
You told them you'd do it, right?

68
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,870
你觉得呢
What do you think?

69
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,250
威尔逊老师似乎人挺好的
So Ms. Wilson seems nice.

70
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,460
很严厉
Stern...

71
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,960
-你想说她是个婊子吗  -彼得
- Don't you mean a bitch? - Peter!

72
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,940
人们嘴上说严厉  意思就是婊  你也一样
When people say stern, they mean bitch. You meant bitch.

73
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,230
-你只是不想直接说出来  -不  我说的是严厉
- You didn't want to say bitch - No, I said stern.

74
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,970
因为你不想政治不正确
because you didn't want to be politically incorrect

75
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,900
-但你就是想说她是婊子  -不
- but you meant bitch. - No.

76
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,900
我知道严厉是什么意思  谢谢
I know what stern means, thank you.

77
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,900
但她确实是个婊子
She is a bitch though.

78
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,700
我们能不能别诋毁一个
Can we not denigrate a woman

79
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,700
可能为了当一个领导者
who probably had to assume certain characteristics

80
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,350
而不得不表现出某种特征的女人
in order to attain a leadership role?

81
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,660
不过  你不是说最喜欢她的课吗
Anyway, I thought you said it was your favorite class.

82
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,150
-我喜欢那个学科  -他喜欢那个学科
- I like the subject. - He liked the subject.

83
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,940
尽管老师很婊
In spite of the bitch thing.

84
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,710
好吧  你可以批评有权势的女性
Okay, it's fine to criticize powerful women.

85
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,380
但别用带有性别歧视的语言
Just don't use the sexist language.

86
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,040
我们俩都知道了
Strung together copy.

87
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,210
很好
Nice!

88
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,730
你应该谈谈自己
You should make it personal.

89
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,270
什么
What?

90
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,500
他们让你下次做的演讲
The next speech they want you to give,

91
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,780
谈谈自己
make it about you.

92
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,320
好
Okay.

93
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,360
听着
And listen...

94
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,180
你是个很棒的演讲者
You're a really good public speaker

95
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,080
还是个出色的辩论者
and you're an excellent debater.

96
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,420
但你有自己的故事可以讲述
But you have your own story to tell

97
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,680
我觉得你应该讲自己的故事
and I think you should tell it.

98
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,210
会激发人们的共鸣
It gives people something to grab onto.

99
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,380
我管得太多了吗
Am I overstepping?

100
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,470
你的建议很好
It's good advice.

101
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,890
我只是想帮你
Just want to be helpful.

102
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,850
你帮到了
You are.

103
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,680
我要继续忙了
I'm going to get back to work now.

104
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,810
好
Okay.

105
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,690
抱歉打扰了你
Sorry for interrupting.

106
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,640
差点就把你的手夹断了
You're gonna lose a limb like that.

107
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,730
看到我的三角函数课本了吗  我昨天放在这的
See my trig textbook? I stashed it here yesterday.

108
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,730
没看到  欧力基
No, it's not here, Orlicki.

109
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,940
-我靠  -你知道
- Fuck me. - You do realize

110
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,280
每个人都有自己的储物柜吧
everyone gets their own locker, right?

111
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,030
知道  但我的在楼的另一边
Yeah. But mine's on the other side of the building,

112
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,740
-每次都害我迟到  -欧力基
- makes me late all the time. - Shit! Orlicki!

113
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,740
听说昨晚有人叫这个家伙再演讲一次
Heard our boy here got asked to give another speech last night?

114
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,540
-真的吗  -他简直是
- Seriously? - Motherfucking

115
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,160
纳尔逊·曼德拉再世
Nelson Mandela over here!

116
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,960
不知道为什么从来没人让我去演讲
I don't get why I never get asked.

117
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,250
因为你成绩差
'cause you're a C+ student.

118
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,940
整篇演讲都会是关于黄片和大麻的
The entire speech would be about porn and blunts.

119
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,780
有道理
Fair enough.

120
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,590
靠  看呀
Shit! Check it out!

121
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,920
女士们
Hey, yo, ladies!

122
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,660
-斯蒂芬妮·金  你好吗  -我们走
- Stephanie Kim, what's good? - Let's go.

123
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,310
你为什么盯着卢斯看  斯蒂芬妮
Why you staring at Luce, Stephanie?

124
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,470
我在和你说话呢
I'm talking to you.

125
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,140
不是每个人都喜欢你的大嘴的
Not everyone likes your big mouth.

126
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,380
你妈喜欢
Your mama does.

127
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,940
她爱我的大嘴
She loves my big mouth.

128
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,810
喜欢我舔她的逼
Loves it all over that pussy!

129
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,340
你太恶心了
Man, you're so gross!

130
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,050
抱歉
Sorry, bro.

131
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,140
训练时见
Hey yo, I'll see you all at practice.

132
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,100
法律就是法律
A law is a law.

133
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,780
这曾经也是法律
Pole-tests used to be law.

134
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,160
种族隔离和划红线也是
So was segregation. Red lining.

135
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,230
这不一样
That's not the same.

136
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,860
你的理由呢
Explain why.

137
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,480
就是不一样
It's just not.

138
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,330
以前的情况和现在不一样
Things were different back then.

139
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,400
怎么不一样
Different how?

140
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,800
比如时代不一样
Well, like that was a different time.

141
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,880
社会规范不一样
Social norms were different.

142
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,700
人们的期望和态度也不一样
People's expectations, their attitudes...

143
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,290
这对你来说不重要吗
Is this not important to you?

144
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,880
回答我
Well?

145
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,260
重要
It is.

146
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,150
你得说得更清楚一点
You might want to speak more clearly.

147
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,470
我听不清你说什么
I can't hear you.

148
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,470
重要
It is.

149
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,560
记住了  对她而言
Keep in mind, that for her,

150
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,910
这个知识可能无关紧要  但你而言
this knowledge is incidental but for you

151
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,560
可能事关生死
it can be life or death.

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,290
所以你需要足够严肃地
So you might want to treat this material

153
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,480
对待这个主题  米克斯先生
with the seriousness it deserves, Mr. Meeks.

154
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,500
这也让我想起  我差不多
Which reminds me, I'm almost done

155
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,010
把你们的作业改完了  我道歉
grading your assignments. I apologize,

156
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,210
比平常花的时间久了一点  但是
it's taking me a little longer than usual but,

157
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,880
你们很快就会收到反馈
you'll have them back soon.

158
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,670
好了
All right...

159
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,470
德肖恩
Deshaun...

160
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,050
德肖恩
Deshaun!

161
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,900
我们来看看里面
Let's have a look in here. Okay...

162
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,050
-看看  -感觉怪怪的
- Let's see... - That feels funny!

163
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,200
是吗
Oh yeah?

164
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,370
这样呢
What about that?

165
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,990
怪吗
Does that feel funny?

166
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,210
周末去康奈尔玩怎么样
How do you feel about a weekend trip to Cornell?

167
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,080
-这周末吗  -对
- This weekend? - Yeah.

168
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,980
玛吉的姐姐说她会打点关系
Maggie's sister said she'd make a call

169
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,060
让卢斯能有和教授独处的时间
and get Luce some one-on-one time with the professor.

170
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,360
这周末我们要参加新生儿派对
This weekend we have the sip-and-see.

171
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,440
-天呐  -你不想去的话
- Oh my God! - If you don't want to go,

172
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,070
应该早点说  对吧
you should have said, right?

173
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,100
嗯  我不是不想去
Yeah, well, it's not that I don't want to go. I mean,

174
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,990
-相信我  我不想去  但是  -你就是讨厌婴儿
- Trust me. I don't want to go, but... - No, you just hate babies.

175
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,580
我不讨厌婴儿
I do not hate babies.

176
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,860
我超喜欢婴儿
I mean, I love babies!

177
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,440
但你讨厌婴儿
But you hate babies.

178
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,170
我只是惊讶于你把
Well, I'm just shocked you're prioritizing

179
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,170
前任的新生儿派对看得比儿子的大学教育更重
your ex's sip-and-see over your son's college education,

180
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,300
不过这只是我的个人想法
but hey, that's just me.

181
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,820
好吧  我懂你意思了
Okay. Punchline and point made.

182
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,340
好吧  你来决定带什么东西
Okay, fine. You're in charge of picking up

183
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,140
去参加新生儿派对
whatever someone brings to a sip-and-see.

184
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,060
好的  回家见
Got it. Okay, see you at home.

185
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,920
回见
See ya.

186
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,510
喂
Hello?

187
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,550
没错  是我
Yes, this is Amy.

188
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,350
各就各位
On your mark...

189
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,850
预备
Set...

190
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,310
跑
Go!

191
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,350
{\an8}新星高中
将军运动场

192
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,220
-埃德加夫人  -你好
- Mrs. Edgar. - Hi.

193
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,810
感谢你抽出时间来一趟
I appreciate you coming back down here.

194
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,530
必须要为重要的事情腾出时间
Well, you have to make time for what's important.

195
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,780
说得没错
Ain't that the truth.

196
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,060
-学生们有你这样的老师真幸运  -谢谢
- Kids are lucky to have you. - Thank you.

197
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,940
-卢斯也一样  -我们有他真幸运
- Luce too. - We're lucky to have him.

198
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,000
我们很关心他的成功
We care a great deal about his success.

199
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,360
-我和彼得也是  -当然
- Peter and I too. - Of course.

200
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,200
而且我知道家庭环境很重要
And I know context matters.

201
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,660
请坐
Please, sit.

202
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,430
考虑到卢斯的背景
Given Luce's background,

203
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,220
你和彼得一定遇到了很多难题
you and Peter must have faced quite a few challenges.

204
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,140
语言障碍  文化冲击
the language barrier, the culture shock.

205
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,520
他的适应能力很强
He's a resilient kid.

206
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,050
是的  但这也证明了你们的培养有方
He is. But it's also a testament to your parenting.

207
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,010
谢谢
Well, thank you.

208
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,610
我们得到了很多支持  尤其是最开始的时候
We had a lot of support, especially in the early days. I mean,

209
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,360
把一个孩子从战区接出来
you don't pull a kid out of a war zone

210
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,950
让他变成卢斯这样  没有许多帮助是不行的
and have him turn out like Luce without a lot of help.

211
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:20,930
我想也是
I bet.

212
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,270
所以我很难开口
Which is why this is so difficult.

213
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,310
难开口
Difficult?

214
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,670
上周  我给班上布置了一份作业
Last week, the class was given an assignment

215
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,570
以一个历史人物的口吻写篇论文
to write in the voice of an historical figure.

216
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,010
有学生选择了大萧条开始时的罗斯福总统
Some students picked FDR at the start of the Great Depression

217
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,960
甚至是猪湾的菲德尔·卡斯特罗
or even Fidel Castro at the Bay of Pigs.

218
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,290
目的是让他们开动脑筋
The goal was to get them to think outside of the box.

219
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,130
只是想确保你明白我为什么谈这个
Just want to make sure you understand where I'm coming from.

220
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,630
请看
Please.

221
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,680
这个弗兰茨·法农是谁
Who is this Frantz Fanon?

222
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,640
一个泛非洲革命者
He was a pan-African revolutionary.

223
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,440
他主张暴力是必要的净化力量
He argued that violence was a necessary cleansing force,

224
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,720
使殖民地人民摆脱殖民者需要它
that it was needed to free colonized people from their rulers.

225
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,300
-你教这个吗  -不教
- You-you teach this? - I don't.

226
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,800
听着
Look,

227
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,820
我不会假装明白
I won't pretend to know

228
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,830
卢斯要如何面对自身的某些方面
what it's like for Luce to confront certain aspects of who he is

229
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,160
我也无权
and it's not within my purview

230
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,230
说一个十岁前一直在...
to say what a boy who spent his first 10 years in...

231
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,520
厄立特里亚
Eritrea.

232
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,480
没错
Right.

233
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,250
那会是什么样子
What that might have been like,

234
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,090
他为了融入这里又做出了哪些调整
what kind of adjustments he must have made in order to fit in here.

235
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,010
我不知道他的治疗详情
And I don't know the details of his treatment...

236
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,800
你肯定听说过他经历了数年的恢复
Well, I'm sure you've heard he went through years of recovery

237
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,100
他没有表现出...
and he showed no signs of...

238
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,500
-我无意暗示  -我只想说清楚
- I-I didn't mean to imply... - No, I just want to be clear that

239
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,350
不管他那时遭受或造成了什么暴力
whatever violence he both suffered and inflicted during that time

240
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,440
都处理过了  已经治疗了
was dealt with, it's been processed.

241
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,270
当然
Of course.

242
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,610
但是鉴于现在校园安全的情况
But with the climate around school security the way it is right now,

243
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,390
你应该能理解我的担心
you can understand my concern.

244
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,770
是的
Yes.

245
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,690
所以我觉得我需要搜查他的储物柜
Which is why I felt I needed to search his locker.

246
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,830
-你说什么  -艾米
- I'm sorry? - Amy...

247
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,160
他就是写了篇论文
He wrote a paper.

248
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,120
可是在这篇论文中他描述
A paper in which he describes

249
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,420
他认为政治问题的解决方法
his belief that the solution to a political problem

250
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,920
就是枪杀那些你不认同的人
is to gun down those with whom you disagree.

251
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,050
好吧  但他是站在这个人物的立场上
Right. But he was assuming a character.

252
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,200
这是作业要求的  你...
The assignment called for this and you...

253
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,540
我在他的储物柜发现了这个
I found this in his locker.

254
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,270
-不  -艾米
- No. - Amy.

255
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,140
不  抱歉
No, I'm sorry.

256
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,350
我尊重我儿子的隐私
I respect my son's privacy.

257
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,270
他写了一篇论文吓到了你  行
Now, he wrote a paper that scared you. Fine.

258
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,400
那是你和他之间的事
That's between you and him.

259
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,740
但我不会  我不会侵犯他应有的隐私权
But I won't, I will not violate his right to the privacy he's owed.

260
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,970
这是烟花
They're fireworks.

261
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,120
非法且非常危险的烟花
Illegal and very dangerous fireworks.

262
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,660
可以在墙上炸出个洞  更别说...
They could put a hole in the wall, let alone...

263
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,850
你到底想说什么
Where are you going with this?

264
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,660
现在只有我知道这件事
Right now I'm the only one who knows about them,

265
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,530
但如果别人发现呢
but what if someone else were to find them?

266
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,210
如果一个不像你我这样了解卢斯的人
If someone who didn't know Luce the way you and I do

267
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,340
意外发现这些烟花
were to stumble on this

268
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,370
再加上他这样背景的人写下这种言论...
within the context of his background having written this...

269
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,740
你拿着
Take them.

270
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,500
和他谈谈
Talk to him.

271
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,590
他这个模范对我们学校太重要  不能让他搞砸
Who he is is too important to this school for him to fuck it up.

272
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,250
他不能搞砸
He can't fuck it up.

273
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,420
请和他谈谈
Talk to him, please.

274
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,810
我会的
I will.

275
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,870
是你一直在谈论斯蒂芬妮
You're the one who keeps talking about Stephanie.

276
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,450
-我没有  -你到底什么毛病
- No, I'm not! - The fuck is wrong with you?

277
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,370
闭嘴  放开我
Shut it! Get off me!

278
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,230
你就该闭上你的嘴  混蛋
You should have kept your mouth shut, little shit.

279
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,400
我告诉过你
I told you!

280
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
你们搞什么  别这样
What the hell! Come on!

281
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,070
-他告诉了所有人  -去你的
- He told everybody! - Fuck you!

282
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,160
科里  科里  科里
Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey!

283
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,010
如果这事传开  就怪你们两个
If this gets out, it's on your two.

284
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,120
你们两个
Both of you!

285
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,870
-有什么事吗  -没事  教练
- Everything okay? - Everything's fine, coach.

286
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,020
卢斯  来我办公室
Luce, my office.

287
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,130
好的
Sure thing.

288
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,990
你从头到尾读完了
You read the whole thing?

289
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,850
是的
Yeah.

290
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,660
孩子确实会被一些思想迷住
Okay, yeah, kids get taken with ideas.

291
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,990
他可能在网上偶然看到弗兰茨·法农
Look, he probably stumbled across Frantz Fanon on the internet

292
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,370
过分着迷了
and went overboard.

293
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,960
我大学时读了共产党宣言
I read the Communist Manifesto when I was an undergrad

294
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,130
那一个月见人都叫同志
and called people comrade for a month.

295
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,880
好吧  我觉得他很聪明  不会那样
Yeah, well, I think he's a little too smart for that.

296
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,670
储物柜里放爆炸物不叫聪明
Not too smart to have explosives in his locker.

297
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,720
-那是烟花  -非法烟花
- They're fireworks. - Illegal fireworks

298
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,680
-我上网查了  -那也还是
- that have explosive capacity, - Still...

299
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,050
具有猎枪冲击那种爆炸力
I Googled this, of a shotgun blast.

300
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,210
那是烟花
They're fireworks.

301
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,870
没什么好震惊的
It's not shocking.

302
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,080
确实令人震惊
That is shocking.

303
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,960
好吧  那怎么办
Okay, so what?

304
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,010
-什么怎么办  -什么  什么  我们的
- So what? - What? What, our...

305
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,470
即将在毕业礼上致辞的优秀青年儿子
teenage soon-to-be valedictorian son is,

306
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,760
-暗地里是个激进分子吗  -不
- is secretly a radical? - No.

307
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,910
-恐怖分子吗  -不
- A terrorist? - No.

308
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,320
-当然不是  -那是什么
- Of course not. - What then?

309
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,280
我不知道  只是确实有情况
I don't know. It's just something's going on

310
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,060
我想要及时处理
and I want to be in front of it.

311
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,860
糟糕
Shit.

312
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,940
艾米  你搞什么
Amy, what the fuck?

313
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,940
学校怎么样
How was school?

314
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,490
什么情况
What's going on?

315
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:31,910
没什么
Nothing.

316
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,830
学校怎么样  训练怎么样
How was school? How was practice?

317
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,750
跟平时一样
Uneventful.

318
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:37,790
傻
Psy.

319
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,250
-你吃饭了吗  -还没
- Have you eaten? - Not yet.

320
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,380
那好  你爸买了咖喱饭
Good, because your dad picked up curry.

321
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,880
棒
Sweet!

322
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,310
你把东西放好我们就开饭了
Okay, put your stuff down so we can eat.

323
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,560
-好的  -好
- Cool. - Great.

324
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,900
-等我来了再开吃  -好的
- Don't start without me. - We won't.

325
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,000
-刚刚什么情况  -我不想他知道
- What was that? - I don't want him to know

326
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,800
-我们翻了他的东西  -我们没翻
- we've gone through his things. - We didn't go through his things.

327
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,670
或是搞得像我们背着他找了老师
Or make it seem like we went behind his back to his teachers.

328
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,010
-艾米  -拜托  彼得
- Amy... - Come on, Pete.

329
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,880
我们花了多少年才让他变成现在这样
How many years did it take us to get him here?

330
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,510
多少个夜晚我爬到他床下
How many nights did I crawl underneath that bed

331
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,500
因为他太害怕不敢睡床上
because he was too scared to sleep in it?

332
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,270
我们建立的那份信任
What we've built. That trust.

333
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,750
我不会拿它冒险  不会
I won't risk it. I won't.

334
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,890
我把一切都准备好了
I got everything ready.

335
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,830
是的  我明天会去和医生谈
Yes, I'll be by to talk with the doctors tomorrow

336
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,940
然后就没问题了
and we'll be all set.

337
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,190
罗斯
Rose...

338
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,780
罗斯  我已经告诉你了
Rose, I told you already, okay?

339
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,700
好的  回头见
Okay. I'll see you soon.

340
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,660
我也爱你
I love you too.

341
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,770
好吧  谁告诉你们了
Okay, so who told you?

342
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,520
-告诉我们什么  -你们显然知道
- Told us what? - You clearly know.

343
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,480
我们知道什么
What do we know?

344
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,110
你们...你们不知道吗
You don't... you don't know?

345
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,990
你认为我们知道或不知道什么  亲爱的
What is it that you think we do or do not know, honey?

346
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,620
里夫斯教练让我当队长
Coach Reeves offered me Captain.

347
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,180
天啊  太棒了
Oh my God! That's amazing!

348
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,890
是的  酷毙了
Yeah! It's... it's dope.

349
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,270
他说我会是一些队友的好榜样
Says I'll be good example for certain teammates.

350
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,520
但要练田径以及准备辩论
But between track and debate prep,

351
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,560
还有威尔逊让我们做的额外作业
plus the extra shit Wilson has us doing...

352
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,750
什么意思
What, how do you mean?

353
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,170
没什么  只是...
Nothing. It's just...

354
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,760
你真的不喜欢她  是吧
You really don't like her, do you?

355
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,100
很复杂
It's complicated.

356
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,680
说来听听
Try me.

357
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,270
好吧  你们还记得斯蒂芬妮·金吧
Okay. You remember Stephanie Kim, right?

358
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,620
-有点...  -完全不记得
- Sort of... - Not a clue.

359
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,540
她之前来过一次
She came over one time last...

360
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,820
-继续说  -总之
- Go on. - Anyway.

361
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,420
几周前一次派对后
There were these rumors going around about her

362
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,920
开始有她的谣言
after this party a few weeks ago.

363
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,340
-什么谣言  -大家都在喝酒
- What kind of rumors? - People were drinking

364
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,410
没人知道到底发生了什么  但...
and no one really knows what happened, but...

365
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,430
斯蒂芬妮有点喝高了
Stephanie got kind of messed up.

366
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,260
和几个男生发生了一些事
Something happened with some guys.

367
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,760
然后威尔逊插手了
Then Wilson got involved

368
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,020
没人能真的证明什么
and no one really could prove anything

369
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,810
但她一直拿斯蒂芬妮举例
but she kept using Stephanie as like an example.

370
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,230
把她变成受害者
Turning her into a victim.

371
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,380
-具体呢  -这个
- How? - Well,

372
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,360
我们会讨论中东女性之类的话题
we'll be talking about women in Middle East or something

373
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,690
她专门针对斯蒂芬妮  说一些什么
and she singles her out, says some shit like,

374
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,110
"我们都切身了解女性鼓起勇气"
"We all know firsthand how important it is for women

375
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,370
"站出来反抗有多重要"
to have the courage to stand up, to fight."

376
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,660
我不明白
I don't understand.

377
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,200
这也不算是针对她吧
It's not exactly singling her out.

378
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,600
是她表述的方式
It's how she says it.

379
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,960
好像每个人在她看来都是个象征
Like everyone's a symbol to her.

380
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,080
斯蒂芬妮  德肖恩  我们的存在
Stephanie, Deshaun, we all exist

381
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,340
都是为了证实她眼中的世界
to confirm the world is the way she sees it.

382
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,360
她也这么对你吗
So does she do that kind of thing with you?

383
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,820
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding?

384
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,260
我就是个招牌男孩
I'm a fucking poster boy.

385
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,380
克服了悲惨过去的黑人男孩
Black kid who overcame his tragic past,

386
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,330
美国为什么能成功的例子  都是狗屁
the example why America works. It's bullshit.

387
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,010
所以你不喜欢她给你加标签
So you don't like her labeling you?

388
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,670
我不喜欢象征主义
I don't like tokenism.

389
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,440
惩罚一个符合刻板印象的人
What's the difference between punishing someone

390
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,170
和奖励一个不符合刻板印象的人  有什么区别吗
for being a stereotype and rewarding them if they're not?

391
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,940
其中一个有好处
One of the two comes with benefits.

392
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,070
你所说的好处
What you'd call a benefit,

393
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,030
在我看来是不请自来的责任
I'd call a responsibility I didn't ask for.

394
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,100
好吧  那说实话的责任呢
Okay, what about responsibility to tell the truth?

395
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,660
-什么  -彼得
- What? - Peter...

396
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,660
你得到的其中一个好处就是无罪推定
So, one of the benefits you get is benefit of the doubt.

397
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,870
-为自己解释的机会  -为自己解释
- A chance to explain yourself. - Explain myself?

398
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:31,020
-够了  -其他学生可没有这待遇
- Enough. - Whereas another student might not. So...

399
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,500
你还有没有要跟我们交代的
You have anything you want to tell us?

400
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,070
-彼得  别这样  -交代什么
- Peter, stop. - About what?

401
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,790
问你妈吧
Ask your mom.

402
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,920
把饭吃了
Finish your food.

403
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,460
{\an8}新星将军队

404
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,460
{\an7}哈丽特·威尔逊

在吗
Knock knock.

411
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,880
让我们过去
We've been summoned.

412
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:00,970
宝贝
Honey...

413
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:20,960
{\an8}卢斯
我们得谈谈

414
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:24,000
{\an8}早上有辩论练习  晚上见

415
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,390
埃德加检察官
Prosecutor Edgar,

416
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,460
今天要手下留情啊  你们都还好吗
take it easy on me today. How are you all doing?

417
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,790
很高兴你能来参加  威尔逊老师
Ms. Wilson, so glad you could join us.

418
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,600
卢斯希望有人能帮他演练一下
Luce was hoping to get some help building his next case.

419
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,770
你和丹校长就是全明星阵容了
I figure you and Principal Dan are the all stars.

420
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,840
我们今年能打进决赛  对不对
We're going to nationals again this year, right?

421
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,900
-绝对的  -好样的
- 100 percent. - Boom!

422
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,680
所以说他是我的得意弟子
That's why this one's my thoroughbred.

423
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,220
好  这就开始吧
Okay, let's have it.

424
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,310
威尔逊老师
Ms. Wilson...

425
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,560
好啊  让我们听听你准备了什么
Of course. Let's, uh, let's hear what you got.

426
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,150
-你在做什么  -天呐  彼得
- What are you doing? - Jesus, Pete!

427
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,170
直接把它们扔了不就好了吗
Doesn't it make sense just to get rid of them?

428
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,340
它们太危险了
They're so dangerous.

429
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,080
我们得留着直到搞清楚整件事为止
We hang on to them until we get to the bottom of this.

430
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,580
放在这里就没事了
They'll be safe here.

431
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,170
怎么了
What?

432
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,170
怎么了
What?

433
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,110
我的论点基于两个案例
My argument is premised on two court cases:

434
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,570
1975年的格斯诉洛佩兹案
Goss v. Lopez, 1975,

435
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,830
以及1985年的新泽西州诉TLO案
and New Jersey v. T.L.O., 1985.

436
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,910
在格斯案中  俄亥俄州一家学校以不良行为为由
In Goss, an Ohio school suspended nine students

437
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,540
责令九名学生停课查看
for delinquent behavior,

438
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,830
但最高法院认为
but the Supreme Court found

439
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,570
不经正当程序剥夺学生受教育权
that depriving students of their right to an education

440
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,700
是对学生公民权利的侵害
without due process is a violation of their civil rights.

441
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,160
威尔逊老师  你同意这一观点吗
Ms. Wilson, do you agree with that?

442
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,200
什么
I'm sorry?

443
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,800
你认同这些学生的
Do you agree that those kids

444
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,660
公民权利受侵犯了吗
were deprived of their civil rights?

445
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,580
我不了解案件细节  但是
I don't know the specifics of the case, but...

446
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,090
-原则上...  -原则上没问题  对吧
- the principal... - Principal makes sense, right?

447
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,770
教育权属于公民权利
Education is a civil right.

448
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,510
人人都享有公民权利
Everyone should have civil rights.

449
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,380
-对  -在第二个案件中
- Right. - In the second case

450
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,680
一名学生被指控在学校洗手间抽烟
a student is accused of smoking in the school bathroom,

451
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,300
但没有证据
but there's no proof.

452
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,270
这一论断完全是基于一名教师的怀疑
The charge is premised on a teacher's suspicion.

453
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,280
所以学校搜了她的钱包  发现了香烟
So the principal searched her purse and found cigarettes

454
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,370
以及大麻相关用品
and marijuana-related paraphernalia.

455
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:19,560
你认同这一做法吗
Do you agree with that?

456
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,500
法院怎么宣判的
What did the court say?

457
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,540
法院认为学生在学校
The court found that students

458
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,270
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}合理隐私期待
界定自然人在什么场合拥有隐私的要素之一
只有自然人能证明拥有合理隐私期待的前提下
才能享受美国第四宪法修正案的保护

459
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,270
享有较弱的隐私期待
have a reduced expectation of privacy in schools.

460
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,780
有道理
It makes sense.

461
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,780
是吗
Does it?

462
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:33,720
学校是一个特殊的社会机构
A school is a unique social institution.

463
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,800
其中的成员是法律上的未成年人
It's populated by people who aren't adults in the eyes of the law.

464
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,560
必须上学的人
People who have to be here.

465
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,630
-学生  -对
- Students. - Yes.

466
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,420
学生不算完全的人
Students are half people.

467
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,350
卢斯
Luce,

468
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,400
你有什么威尔逊老师能回答的
is there a specific question you have

469
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,220
具体问题要问吗
that Ms. Wilson might be able to address?

470
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,680
有的
Totally.

471
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,640
谢谢  坦尼森老师
Thanks Ms. Tennyson.

472
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,570
我希望威尔逊老师能帮助我解答的问题
Basically my question that I hope Ms. Wilson can help me with

473
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,620
与这个弱隐私期待
is around this idea of reduced expectation

474
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,840
以及法院对学生公民权的认可有关
versus the affirmation by the court of student civil rights.

475
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,670
比如说如何判定
Like what are the criteria for evaluating

476
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,490
侵害隐私的行为
what's a violation of privacy?

477
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,430
隐私权属于公民权吗
Is privacy a civil right?

478
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,290
是的
I think so.

479
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,710
也许法律没那么明确
Maybe the law isn't so sure.

480
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,180
如果我不经你同意搜查你的办公桌
If I went through your desk without you knowing,

481
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,510
你会感觉这侵犯了你的隐私吗
would you feel like your privacy was violated?

482
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,050
会
Yes, I would.

483
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:21,340
那么
So?

484
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,140
但是感觉不能成为法律依据
Feelings aren't a legal argument.

485
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,610
在新泽西州案中  那位老师
In the New Jersey case, the teacher assumed

486
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,020
以她的感觉判定那女孩犯了错
the girl was guilty because of her feelings.

487
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,610
那是合理的怀疑
That's called reasonable suspicion.

488
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,160
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}不准确  美国宪法规定
为了保护人们的合理隐私期待
此类搜查需要许可令

489
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,150
警察只需要这个就能搜查你的车
It's all the police need to search your car.

490
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,150
所以关键在于合理的定义
So it's about what's reasonable.

491
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,860
这是法院的事
That's what courts are for.

492
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,370
但其实只是在于人  对吗
Really it's just about people though, right?

493
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,790
在于对方的表现是否符合我们对其的认知
Whether they conform to what we think they are.

494
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,500
不是那么简单的
It's not that simple.

495
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,540
世上没有简单的事
Nothing ever is.

496
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,940
非常感谢你的帮助  威尔逊老师
Thank you so much for your help, Ms. Wilson.

497
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,900
很顺利  是不是
This was, this was great, right?

498
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,800
随时恭候
Any time.

499
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,720
天呐  这孩子真出色  是不是
God, that kid is something else, isn't he?

500
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,990
好了  大家放下手机
All right, people, phones away.

501
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,990
我看见你了  萨莎
I see you, Sasha.

502
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,700
还有你  斯蒂芬妮·金
And you too, Stephanie Kim.

503
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,380
-好  -表演时间到
- All right. - It's show time!

504
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,800
你搞砸了  另外兄弟
You fucked up. And bro,

505
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,010
你不能把欧力基压在柜门上打
you can't just go slamming Orlicki against a locker.

506
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,550
他跟其他人胡说八道
He's out there telling everybody.

507
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,330
又不是说大家都不知道
It's nothing half the school didn't already know.

508
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,920
另外  我和斯蒂芬妮谈了
Besides, I talked to Stephanie.

509
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,550
你们俩还说话
You two still talk?

510
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,730
不算吧  但总有人得去解决这件事
Not really, but someone had to resolve this

511
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,680
-免得出事  -她没问题吧
- before it blows up. - Is she gonna be cool?

512
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,070
-对  -她不会惹事吧
- Yeah. - Is she gonna be cool?

513
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,510
不会有事的  兄弟
Everything's going to be cool, man.

514
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,760
和欧力基和好  行吗
Just squash the beef with Orlicki, all right?

515
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,600
-科里  -行  兄弟  随便吧
- Corey! - All right, man. Whatever.

516
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,570
德肖恩胆子真大
Deshaun's one bold-ass nigga.

517
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,830
自从威尔逊把他赶出校队
Since Wilson got him tossed off the team,

518
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,070
他就自暴自弃了
he's been messed up.

519
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,990
回头见  兄弟
I'll catch you later, man.

520
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,290
-嘿  -好
- Yo. - Yeah.

521
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,800
我们说好了的
We agreed on this.

522
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,880
你和我一起住的话  你得负责任
If you live with me, you have to be responsible for...

523
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,260
我只要你乖乖服药
All I ask is if you're staying on top of your medication.

524
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,390
我知道医生说了什么  罗斯玛丽
I know what the doctor said, Rosemary.

525
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,180
这不等于我没意见
It doesn't mean I'm comfortable with it.

526
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,870
全家人里面
Out of everyone in this family,

527
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,830
只有我一次又一次帮你
you know that I've been there for you time and time again.

528
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,860
我讨厌那样
I resent that.

529
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,110
我得挂了  罗斯  我们今晚再聊
I gotta go, Rose. We'll talk tonight.

530
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,700
-一切都还好吗  -都很好
- Everything okay? - Everything's fine.

531
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,070
家务事吗
Family stuff?

532
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,420
对  私事
Personal business, yes.

533
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:50,990
懂了
Gotcha.

534
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,680
谢谢你今早的指导
Thanks for your guidance this morning.

535
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,330
对我理清论点真的很有帮助
It really helped make my case.

536
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,670
我很高兴
I'm glad.

537
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,130
你是想见我吗
You wanted to see me?

538
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,840
我想跟你谈谈你的作业  卢斯
I wanted to talk to you about your assignment, Luce.

539
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,760
作业怎么了
What about it?

540
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,310
我假定你和你妈谈过了
I assumed you spoke to your mother...

541
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:09,140
我都还没有回家  怎么可能和我妈谈过
I haven't gotten it back yet. How could I talk to my mom about it?

542
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,390
我直说吧
Well, I'll just say, uh...

543
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,280
读完你的作业  我对你陈述的
After reading through it, I have some concerns

544
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,910
一些观点有些担忧
about some of the arguments you made.

545
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,020
那不是我的观点
Well they aren't mine.

546
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,400
什么
Excuse me?

547
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,150
那些论点  是弗兰茨·法农的
The arguments, they're Frantz Fanon's.

548
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,860
我知道
I realize that.

549
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,920
作业要求以他的口吻写
The assignment was to write in his voice.

550
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,660
你真认为我相信那一套
You really think I believe that stuff?

551
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,870
我不知道
Well, I don't know.

552
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,220
如果我不认识你  我读完那作业
If I didn't know you, Luce, it would be reasonable for me

553
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,470
完全有理由认为你...
to read that assignment and conclude...

554
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,580
但你认识我
But you do know me.

555
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,460
听我说
Look, um,

556
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,670
吓到你我很抱歉
I'm sorry if I scared you.

557
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,090
我只想把作业做好
I just wanted to do a good job.

558
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,180
你的确完成得不错
You did do a good job.

559
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,640
我懂
I mean, I get it.

560
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,900
-懂什么  -我懂
- Get what? - Well, I get

561
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,770
如果一个在学开车前就先会开枪的人
how someone who learned how to shoot a gun before driving a car

562
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,030
写那么一篇东西
writing something like that

563
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:57,140
可能会吓到别人
might make someone freaked out.

564
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,150
我只是希望你知道我不是那样的人  威尔逊老师
I just hope you know me better than that, Ms. Wilson.

565
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,980
我也觉得你不是  卢斯
I like to think that I do, Luce.

566
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,950
你还有什么想跟我谈的吗
Is there anything else you wanted to talk to me about?

567
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,200
没有了
No.

568
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,580
告诉你妈  我希望她给我打个电话
But tell your mom I'd like her to call me.

569
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:14,950
为什么
Why?

570
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,160
因为我想和她聊聊
Because I want to speak with her.

571
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,420
聊什么
What about? I mean,

572
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,670
除非你们有私交  否则我猜和我有关
I guess it's about me unless you guys are friends or something.

573
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,420
请让她给我打电话  卢斯
Please have her call me, Luce.

574
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,010
谢谢你过来
Thank you for stopping in.

575
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,130
好的
Of course.

576
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,680
威尔逊老师
Hey, Ms. Wilson...

577
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,310
你最喜欢哪个节日
What's your favorite holiday?

578
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:40,770
-什么  -你最喜欢哪个节日
- Excuse me? - What's your favorite holiday?

579
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,310
我不确定  大概圣诞节吧
I don't know. Christmas maybe.

580
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,020
我最喜欢独立日
Mine is Independence Day.

581
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,940
我来美国之前
Before I came here,

582
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,280
我一个节日也没听说过
I didn't know a single holiday and

583
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,780
我记得我妈努力跟我解释各种节日
I remember my mom trying to explain what they were.

584
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,470
没有听说过节日的话  很难理解
It's a hard concept to grasp if you've never heard of it,

585
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,000
但是
but,

586
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,220
搞懂所有节日后  我最喜欢的节日
once I learned them all, my favorite, hands down,

587
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,380
毫无疑问  一直都是独立日
has always been Independence Day.

588
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,000
为什么
Why is that?

589
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,840
我喜欢它的含义
I like what it represents.

590
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,130
自由
Freedom,

591
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,300
力量
strength,

592
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,970
个性
individuality.

593
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:18,930
另外我也喜欢烟花  那种光芒
Also I love the fireworks. The lights.

594
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,370
卢斯  我要提醒你  你在这里是个学生
Luce, I'd like to remind you that you're still a student here

595
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,280
我是你的老师
and I am your teacher.

596
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,790
无论你把什么视为不公
And regardless of what you may view as some sort of injustice

597
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,630
-你在说什么  -或者不合理
- What are you talking about? - or unfair,

598
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,080
记住这里的规矩
just remember how things are organized around here.

599
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:40,330
当然了  回头见
Totally. I'll see you around.

600
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,050
-丘萨克的财报  -谢谢  贝丝
- The financials from Cusack. - Thanks, Beth.

601
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,190
季终支出结算  是不是
Quarter end payments went out, right?

602
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:56,850
对
Yes.

603
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:03,600
怎么
Yeah?

604
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:09,110
威尔逊老师  你好吗
Ms. Wilson. How are you?

605
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,450
她为什么给你打电话
Why is she calling you?

606
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:18,300
我记得我也还是家长之一呢
Well, last I checked I'm one of two parents.

607
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,300
没错  但她之前都是跟我沟通的
Yeah, but she was communicating with me

608
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,590
现在怎么变成给你打电话了
and now she's calling you?

609
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,120
好吧  她可以跟任一家长谈论我们儿子的问题
Well, we're both available to talk about our son.

610
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:27,250
这个女人对卢斯抱有恨意
This woman has some kind of vendetta against Luce.

611
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,520
-恨意  真的吗  -是的
- Vendetta? Really? - Yeah.

612
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,980
她之前跟他有过节  而现在
She has some thing with him and now,

613
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,010
现在她试图对我们分而治之
now she's trying to divide and conquer.

614
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,390
说话真有水平
Nice word choice.

615
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,940
她之前那样对斯蒂芬妮·金
What she did with Stephanie Kim

616
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,900
现在又想这样对卢斯
and what she's trying to do now with Luce,

617
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,810
她对不同的孩子用不同标准
this woman holds different kids to different standards based on...

618
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,890
你有见到或听到她对那女孩做的事情吗
Did you see or hear what she did to that girl?

619
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:47,110
-我听到的足够下判断了  -从卢斯那里听的
- I've heard enough to know. - From Luce, yeah.

620
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,980
是的  从我们儿子那里听的  他对我们一直很诚实
Yes, from our son, who has always been honest with us.

621
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,620
除了在储物柜里藏着非法烟花
Except about having illegal fireworks in his locker.

622
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,950
那件事他并没有说谎
He didn't lie about that.

623
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,370
-是吗  -没告诉我们
- Is that so? - Not telling us

624
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,530
和说谎可是两码事
and lying are two different things.

625
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,160
如果他做坏事是有模式的呢
And what if there's a pattern here?

626
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,290
-模式  -没错
- A pattern? - Yeah.

627
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,260
论文  烟花  威胁老师
The paper, the fireworks, the threat...

628
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:05,830
彼得
Peter...

629
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,520
-我们至少得坦诚面对  -绝对不行
- We have to be at least open to the possibility - Absolutely not.

630
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,960
儿子可能做某些事的可能
that our son is capable of...

631
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,300
做什么  做什么的可能
Of what? Capable of what?

632
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,430
告诉我你知道他是个好孩子  彼得
Tell me you know he's a good kid, Pete.

633
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,650
告诉我如果真的出事
Tell me if shit hits the fan,

634
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,190
我们不会舍弃我们的儿子
we aren't about to abandon our son.

635
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,440
-我们当然不会舍弃他  -我们的黑人儿子得面对
- Of course we're not going to abandon him. - Our black son to a system

636
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,560
一个本来就想整死他的体系
that already wants to shit all over him.

637
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,950
我们的职责是保护他  支持他
It's our job to protect him, to have his back.

638
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,540
那只一部分  我们还有一种职责
That's part of it. It's our job

639
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,000
-是做正确的事  -是为他
- to do what's right. - By him.

640
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,690
是为他做正确的事
To do what's right by him.

641
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,540
-卢斯  -怎么
- Luce! - Yeah?

642
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,590
-有时间吗  -你说过会按我的方法做的
- Got a minute? - You said you'd do this my way.

643
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,280
-是的  -怎么了
- Yeah. - What's up?

644
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,490
你有没有威胁你的老师
Did you threaten your teacher?

645
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,720
-亲爱的  -什么
- Honey... - Excuse me?

646
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,540
你听到我说的了
You heard me.

647
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,680
我有没有威胁...
Did I threaten...?

648
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,290
威尔逊老师打电话了
Ms. Wilson called.

649
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,680
威尔逊老师说我威胁她了吗
Ms. Wilson said I threatened her?

650
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,250
有没有
Did you?

651
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,180
-她说什么  -她说...
- What did she say? - She said...

652
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,050
别管她说了什么  你干什么了
Never mind what she said. What did you do?

653
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,880
她让我过去见她
She asked me to come and see her.

654
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,220
然后
And?

655
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,510
我感谢她帮我理清辩论的论点
I thanked her for helping me with my debate case.

656
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,310
-她帮了你  -是的  她跟丹校长
- She helped you? - Yeah, her and Principal Dan.

657
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,560
我为什么要威胁她
Why would I threaten her?

658
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,430
她想跟你谈什么事情
What did she want to talk to you about?

659
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,070
一篇论文  我们之前有误会
A paper. We had a misunderstanding.

660
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,270
我为此道歉
I apologized for it.

661
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,110
你有没有提到独立日
You say anything about the 4th of July?

662
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,770
-什么  -亲爱的
- What? - Honey...

663
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,370
-还有烟花  -那怎么能算是威胁
- About fireworks? - How is that a threat?

664
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:17,950
你到底有没有提到独立日
Did you or did you not say something about the 4th of July?

665
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,170
我说独立日是我最爱的节日
I said the 4th of July was my favorite holiday.

666
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,210
你为什么那样说
Why would you say that?

667
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,840
因为我以为我们在聊天
Because I thought we were having a conversation.

668
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,260
她说我威胁她了
She says I threatened her?

669
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,450
卢斯  我需要你跟我说实话
Luce, I need you to be straight with me for a second.

670
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,750
-我什么时候不说实话了  -喂
- When am I not? - Hey!

671
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,210
好的
Sure.

672
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,630
你有什么想跟我们交代的吗
So is there anything you want to tell us?

673
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,150
-没有  -确定吗
- No. - You sure about that?

674
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,900
确定什么  天啊  如果你们
Am I sure about what? Jesus, if you guys

675
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,610
-想问我...  -你为什么
- want to ask me... - Why did you have

676
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,610
把非法烟花放在储物柜里
illegal fireworks in your locker?

677
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,860
-什么  -你为什么
- What? - Why did you have

678
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,950
把非法烟花放在储物柜里
illegal fireworks in your locker?

679
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,200
-我没有  -卢斯  别对我说谎
- I didn't. - Luce, don't lie to me.

680
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,440
-我没有  -卢斯
- I'm not. - Luce!

681
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:53,830
你怎么知道我储物柜里有什么
How would you know what's in my locker?

682
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,870
-哈丽特告诉我们的  -哈丽特的话可真多
- Harriet told us. - Harriet has a lot to say.

683
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,210
别管她说什么了  你到底放没放
Never mind what she said. Did you or didn't you?

684
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,070
-就我所知没有  -你知道吗
- Not that I know of. - Oh, you know what?

685
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,200
-不管了  -我们的储物柜共用
- Fuck this. - We share lockers.

686
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,510
校队里的男生都共用储物柜
The guys on the team share lockers.

687
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,000
欧力基的储物柜里有我的东西  我的里有他的东西
Half my shit is in Orlicki's, half his shit is in mine.

688
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,180
大部分情况下我都不知道储物柜里有什么东西
I don't know what 90% of the crap at the bottom is,

689
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,040
-更别说知道是谁的了  -所以
- let alone who it belongs to. - So...

690
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,290
所以我储物柜里的东西不全是我的
So not everything in my locker belongs to me.

691
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,460
那就好
Okay, good.

692
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,230
这就没事了
That's good.

693
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,610
这回你就明白了
Now, you understand

694
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,050
不仅要搞清楚
why it's important to know

695
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,110
储物柜里有什么东西  还要知道是谁的
not only what's in your locker, but who it belongs to.

696
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,240
-是的  -对吧
- Yes. - Right?

697
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,610
你不能盲目地相信别人
You can't blindly trust people to...

698
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:32,100
你还真信这套鬼话
Okay. You seriously buy this shit?

699
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,400
不是吧
Seriously?

700
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:41,000
你是说恰好有人把非法烟花放在你储物柜里
So someone just happens to leave a bag of illegal fireworks

701
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,780
而且你还不知道是谁
in your locker and you have no idea?

702
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,910
然后有个你不喜欢的老师
And then this teacher, who you don't like,

703
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,290
无理地搜了你的储物柜  找到了这些烟花
unjustifiably searches your locker and finds them.

704
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,850
你只是巧合之中的
You're just an unlucky victim

705
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,500
-不幸受害者  是吗  -是真的
- of circumstance, right? - It's the truth.

706
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,180
我可不这么觉得
That doesn't sound like the truth to me.

707
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,380
我觉得你说的是狗屁
That sounds like bullshit.

708
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:06,720
你相信我吗
You believe me?

709
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,730
我们能解决这个问题
We can figure this out.

710
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:51,240
{\an8}选手德
什么时候能见面

711
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,150
我没跟任何人说过斯蒂芬妮和派对的事
I didn't tell anyone about Stephanie or the party.

712
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:23,900
科里应该冷静下来
Corey should calm the fuck down.

713
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,320
我跟他说过了  一切正常
I talked to him, everything's fine.

714
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,240
是啊  你他妈跟我脖子上的淤青说一切正常吧
Yeah, tell that to the bruise on my fucking neck.

715
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,700
你得理解他的处境
You gotta understand where he's coming from.

716
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,490
你爸上了达特茅斯[名校]Your dad went to Dartmouth.

717
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,010
你爷爷上了达特茅斯
Your granddad went to Dartmouth.

718
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,870
连你的狗大概都能上达特茅斯
Your dog could probably get into Dartmouth.

719
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,710
科里可没有这种背景
Corey doesn't have that.

720
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,960
他只要惹上一点点事  就会成为下一个德肖恩
A whiff of something up with him and he's the next Deshaun.

721
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:47,670
可不能晚上乱逛抽大麻  兄弟
Can't be walking around at night smelling high, bro.

722
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,720
你真的觉得有人能阻止你吗
You seriously think someone's gonna stop you?

723
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:53,140
我也不想成为下一个德肖恩
I'm not interested in being the next Deshaun either.

724
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,140
你跟德肖恩不一样
You're not like Deshaun.

725
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,560
我们都是黑人  欧力基
We're both black, Orlicki.

726
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:01,810
确实  但他是那种黑人
Yeah, but he's like black-black.

727
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,150
那我是哪种黑人
Then what am I?

728
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,940
你是卢斯
You're Luce.

729
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,720
你在干什么
What are you doing?

730
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,350
你去哪里了
Where were you?

731
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,680
我去跑步了  有什么事
I went for a run. What do you want?

732
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,740
我想向你道歉
I just wanted to apologize

733
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,690
为之前的事
for before.

734
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,870
-你父亲...  -觉得我是个骗子吗
- Your father... - ...thinks I'm a liar?

735
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:50,040
不是  他很困惑  我们都是
No, he-he's confused. We both are.

736
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,360
困惑什么事
Confused about what?

737
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,910
我跟你说过威尔逊的为人
I told you the kind of person Wilson is.

738
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,590
你不顺应她的心意
You don't conform to what she wants

739
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,910
那你就成了她的敌人
and suddenly you're the enemy.

740
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,450
听着
Look...

741
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,680
我明白别人对你期望过高可能显得不公平
I know it can seem unfair how much people expect of you.

742
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,630
但你不明白
You don't, though.

743
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:06,960
不可能明白
You can't.

744
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,770
有时候我那么努力
And sometimes I'm working so hard

745
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,020
想要维持这一切
to keep this all together,

746
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,840
-让我感觉一切都...  -都怎么
- it feels like it'll all just... - What?

747
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,860
-都怎么  -我不可能完美
- Just what? - I can't be perfect.

748
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,860
没有人期望你完美
No one expects you to be perfect.

749
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,890
威尔逊就是
Wilson does.

750
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,990
信不信由你  她只是在保护你
Believe it or not, she's just trying to protect you.

751
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,350
她是在保护我象征的意义
She's trying to protect her idea of me.

752
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,770
跟你和他一样
Same as you and him.

753
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,190
这么说不公平
That's not fair.

754
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,030
不公平不代表不是真的
Unfair doesn't make it untrue.

755
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,920
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}用户在向好友发送消息后
消息在限定时间后
会彻底的从好友设备及软件服务器上删除

756
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,920
{\an8}阅后即焚
选手德发来消息

757
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,490
卢斯
Luce...

758
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,910
我还得早起参加训练呢
I have to get up early for practice in the morning.

759
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,500
晚安  艾米
Good night, Amy.

760
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,180
{\an8}卢斯·埃德加

761
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,600
{\an8}好友

762
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,900
{\an8}斯蒂芬妮·金

763
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:48,280
{\an8}你与斯蒂芬妮·金不是脸书好友

764
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,320
卢斯  我是斯蒂芬妮
Hey, Luce, it's Stephanie.

765
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:55,190
我真讨厌这样
I fucking hate it.

766
00:41:55,790 --> 00:42:00,990
威尔逊说我就是一个女性默默忍受痛苦的例子
Wilson said I was an example of a woman suffering in silence.

767
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,410
所以大家又开始八卦了
So everyone is gossiping again.

768
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:07,000
你让我们暂时分开也许是对的
You were probably right for us to take a break.

769
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:10,210
我只是想像以前那样跟你聊天
I just wish we could talk like we used to.

770
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:11,750
再见
Bye.

771
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,320
你看上去不一样了
You look different.

772
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,400
新接发
New weave.

773
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:36,860
哪种的
What kind?

774
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,740
印度的
Indian.

775
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,330
-谢谢  -给你
- Thank you. - Here you go.

776
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:51,790
他们现在让你吃什么药
What do they have you taking now?

777
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:53,250
氯氮平
Clozapine.

778
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,090
让我汗流浃背
Makes me sweat like the devil.

779
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:58,470
哈丽特
Harriet,

780
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,140
这是什么
what is this?

781
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,600
希腊酸奶
That's Greek yogurt.

782
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,060
尝尝
Just taste it.

783
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,680
好吧
All right.

784
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:10,940
还行啊  不好吃
It's good, no!

785
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,400
你看起来那么...
You looked so...

786
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,330
这早餐还差不多
Now this what I call breakfast.

787
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,750
闭嘴吧  你什么时候拒绝过培根
Shut your mouth. Since when you ever turn down some bacon?

788
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,940
我知道这东西我们吃了一辈子了  但是
I know we ate this our whole lives but,

789
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,400
这速食产品里面全是毒药
this instant shit's made of poison.

790
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,570
我都不知道我们是怎么活下来的
I don't know how we made it through.

791
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,820
罗斯
Rose?

792
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,710
威尔逊老师
Ms. Wilson?

793
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,250
-你认识哈丽特  -威尔逊老师是我的老师
- You know Harriet? - Ms. Wilson's my teacher.

794
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:24,310
这个世界真小啊
Ain't the world tiny and great!

795
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,690
我是来给募捐活动买零食的
I just came here to pick up snacks for the fundraiser.

796
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:27,940
这个年轻人刚刚在跟我说
This young man was just telling me

797
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,560
什么旧石器时代饮食
about something called paleo.

798
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,850
是一种模仿穴居人的饮食
It's a diet, how the cavemen ate.

799
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,770
穴居人的寿命可不长  卢斯
Cavemen didn't live long, Luce.

800
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:36,400
但我打赌他们死的时候都有八块腹肌
Well, I bet they went out with great abs.

801
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:40,150
他是不是很可爱
Ain't he the cutest?

802
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,460
威尔逊老师
Ms. Wilson,

803
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,070
罗斯玛丽应该来参加我们学校的文化月庆典
Rosemary should come to our Culture Month Gala at school.

804
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,990
我要发表演讲
I'm giving a speech.

805
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,490
-是吗  -是的
- Is that right? - Yeah.

806
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,220
我平时没什么机会出门
I don't normally get to go places,

807
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,700
要是我能去就太好了
so that would be a treat for me.

808
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,210
她应该来参加  对吧  威尔逊老师
She should come. Right, Ms. Wilson?

809
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,290
我们可以商量一下
We'll talk about it.

810
00:44:58,890 --> 00:44:59,500
好吧
Cool.

811
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:02,550
很高兴认识你  罗斯玛丽
It was nice meeting you, Rosemary.

812
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,470
希望到时候你能来
And, um, I hope you can make it.

813
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,720
我也是
Me too!

814
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:09,680
-再见  -再见
- Bye. - Bye.

815
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,270
卢斯算哪门子黑人名字
What kind of black name is Luce?

816
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,190
彼得
Hey, Pete.

817
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,570
彼得  你想抱会儿他吗
Pete, you want to give him a whirl?

818
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:30,530
那是谁  那是谁
Who is that? Who is that?

819
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,670
谢谢  我真的很高兴你们俩能来
Thank you. I'm really glad you guys could make it.

820
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:53,890
你好吗
How you doing?

821
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:05,530
到底要我告诉你几遍  不行
How many times do I have to tell you no?

822
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,130
你得跟小孩子讲话了
You have to start talking to a little kid.

823
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:09,170
这他妈就是洗车  你想争辩什么
It's a fucking car wash. What are you arguing about?

824
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:10,460
他来这干什么
What the hell's he doing here?

825
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,580
听着  不许参加队里的活动
Come on, man, look. No team events.

826
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:14,510
-这是  -这事已经跟你解释过了
- It's a... - This has been explained to you.

827
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:16,890
我不会为了洗车这种事跟你争辩的
Bro, I'm not arguing with you over no car wash.

828
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:18,930
-你什么毛病  -这是队伍的募捐活动
- What's your problem? - It's a fundraiser for the team.

829
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:21,210
教练里夫斯  我的错  我邀请的德肖恩
Coach Reeves, it's my fault. I invited Deshaun.

830
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,270
我没意识到这也违反了
I didn't realize it violated

831
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:24,930
他与学校达成的协议
the terms of his agreement with the school.

832
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,760
你介意我俩在他走之前讨论一下作业吗
Do you mind if we talk about an assignment real quick before he goes?

833
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,970
尽快说完就行
As long as it's quick.

834
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:33,930
-好  谢谢教练  -走吧  哥们
- Cool. Thanks, Coach. - Come on, bro.

835
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,140
-这事不好意思  -不  让他去死吧
- Sorry about that. - No, fuck his bitch ass, man.

836
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,020
那个老黑总是在打压我  从第一天起就这样
That nigga always undermining with me, bro, from day one.

837
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:43,650
没了你我们的长跑项目都弱爆了
Well we're getting killed on these distance events without you, bro.

838
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,730
科里跑得根本不行
Corey can't run for shit.

839
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,280
除非终点线那有小骚逼等着他
unless there's pussy waiting at the finish line.

840
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:53,550
说不好  要是像她姐姐那样的小骚逼的话
Don't know. If it's anything like his sister's pussy,

841
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:54,990
那玩意可不干净
that shit got stains on it.

842
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,200
我听说了
So I've heard.

843
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:00,710
你和迈克·杰夫斯怎么回事
What's going on with you and Mike Jeffs?

844
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,060
我看见你和他还有他的小弟们在一块
I've been seeing you hanging around with him and his boys.

845
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,130
我不知道你们关系都那么好了
I didn't know you all were tight like that.

846
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:12,180
说不好  我又不是未来的诺贝尔奖得主
I don't know. It ain't like future Nobel Laureates and shit.

847
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,030
不是诺贝尔奖得主
You don't have to be a Nobel Laureate

848
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:16,060
也知道迈克·杰夫斯不是什么好东西
to know that Mike Jeffs is bad news, bro.

849
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,060
你为什么跟他们扯上关系了
Why you getting mixed up with those guys?

850
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:21,020
搞什么  淡定好吗  我没事
What the fuck? Chill out, all right? I'm good.

851
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:23,270
靠  你还要管我裤子提的不够高吗
Damn, my pants too low, too?

852
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:25,520
我要想有所成就就一定要把裤子提好吗
I gotta hike them up if I want to make something of myself?

853
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,210
老黑  你不要对我指手画脚的
Na, my nigga, don't come over here and try to patronize me.

854
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:29,110
别这样  哥们
Come on, man.

855
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,290
我不知道你是不是忙着应付威尔逊
I don't know if you've been busy distracted

856
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:33,800
还有这些个虚伪小人全天候捧你臭脚
with Wilson and the rest of these fake-ass motherfuckers

857
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,740
但是我跟你们没关系了  哥们
sucking your dick 24/7 but my shit is done, bro.

858
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:38,160
结束了
It's finished.

859
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:42,250
事实上  有多少次我们是一起抽的  卢斯
As a matter of fact, how many time we smoke together, Luce?

860
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:46,210
卢斯  有多少次是你来我家抽大麻的
Luce, how many times you come to my crib and blaze?

861
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,010
威尔逊在我的储物柜里找到了大麻  我被踢出队
Wilson finds weed in my locker and now I'm off the team.

862
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:53,090
我的奖学金没了
That's my scholarship gone.

863
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,810
为什么是我  不是你
Why me and not you, my nigga?

864
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,100
回答我的问题  为什么是我而不是你
Answer the question. Why me and not you?

865
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:03,070
-我不知道  -你不知道
- I don't know. - You don't know.

866
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,910
你明明知道我在说什么
You exactly know exactly what the fuck I'm talking about.

867
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:06,230
因为他们想让你赢
It's because they want you to win.

868
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:09,740
否则的话  他们那些自强自立的屁话
Otherwise, all their little up by your own bootstraps bullshit,

869
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,570
就不适用了
it don't apply.

870
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,240
但话说回来  我瞎说什么呢
But then again, why am I trippin'?

871
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,620
至少要有一个奥巴马  对吧
Gotta have at least one Obama, right?

872
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,870
这不是我求来的  哥们
I didn't ask for this, man.

873
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,410
不是你求来的
You didn't ask for this.

874
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:25,460
那你想跟我交换吗
So, what, you want to trade or something?

875
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:32,760
我就知道你不想
Yeah, I didn't think so.

876
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:34,550
德肖恩
Deshaun...

877
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,760
我想弥补这一切
I want to make this right.

878
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:50,820
罗
Ro?

879
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,240
罗
Ro?

880
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:01,500
罗
Ro?

881
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,710
天啊
God.

882
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,860
不  不
No, no...

883
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,160
我刚才
I was...

884
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:43,080
我刚才在走路  我想走到那边去  然后
I was walking and I was trying to make it there and then...

885
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:46,290
食物  食物就
the food, the food was...

886
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:50,310
-我来收拾  我来收拾  -没事的
- I'll clean it. I'll clean up. - You're okay.

887
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:51,170
我来收拾
I'll clean it up.

888
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:57,630
深呼吸  深呼吸
Breathe. Breathe.

889
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:06,160
抱歉我迟到了
Sorry I'm late.

890
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,150
没事  请坐吧
No. Please, sit.

891
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:13,000
他们搞错了  我点的卡布奇诺
They screwed up the order. I asked for cappuccinos

892
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,500
然后给我们的是星冰乐
and they gave us Frappuccinos.

893
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,900
-我更喜欢这个  -是吗
- I like these more. - You do?

894
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:19,570
我至少要喝三杯  否则都撑不到吃晚饭
Can't make it to the dinner without at least three of them.

895
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:21,120
好吧
Okay.

896
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:25,290
-谢谢你  -不  应该谢谢你来
- Thank you. - No, thank you for, um,

897
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:28,680
见我  你肯定觉得有点奇怪
meeting me. This must be a little weird.

898
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,210
的确
It is.

899
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,630
好吧  有件和卢斯有关的事
Okay. Um, yeah, well I guess I was hoping you could help me with

900
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:36,170
我希望你能帮个忙
something to do with Luce.

901
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:38,510
我们其实没什么来往了
We don't really talk a lot anymore.

902
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,640
-是吗  -自从分手之后
- You don't? - Not since we broke up.

903
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:43,640
什么
What?

904
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,890
你不知道我们分手了吗
You didn't know we broke up?

905
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:47,980
我不知道你们交往过
I didn't know you dated.

906
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,610
交往了多久
For how long?

907
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,940
埃德加夫人
Mrs. Edgar,

908
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,330
跟你说我和卢斯的事  我有点不自在
I don't feel comfortable telling you about me and Luce.

909
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,130
当然
Yeah, of course.

910
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:03,370
因为我不清楚你为什么想知道
Because I don't know why you want to know.

911
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,410
-好的  我来解释一下  -好
- Okay. Let me explain myself. - Yeah.

912
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:10,470
-这和哈丽特·威尔逊有关  -什么
- This is about Harriet Wilson. - What?

913
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:12,380
我需要知道她对你做了什么
I need to know what she did to you.

914
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,310
因为卢斯告诉我们
Because Luce told us

915
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:17,230
她发现派对上出了什么事情之后
that when she found out what happened at the party...

916
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:20,310
卢斯发誓他不会告诉任何人派对上出了什么事
Luce swore he wouldn't tell what happened at the party.

917
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:22,010
我还以为他不知道出了什么事呢
I thought he didn't know what happened.

918
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:25,720
我该走了
I should go.

919
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,390
不  等等  斯蒂芬妮  求你了
No, wait. Stephanie, please.

920
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,230
听我说
Listen to me.

921
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:32,270
我只想知道真相  好吗
I just want to know the truth, Okay?

922
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:35,690
如果威尔逊老师让你觉得发生的那些事情
Now, if Ms. Wilson made you feel like whatever happened

923
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:38,400
应该变成什么政治宣言
should be some kind of a political statement,

924
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:40,610
那她就错了
then that's wrong of her.

925
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:44,130
作为女人  我们需要做的就是互相支持
As women what we need to do is support each other.

926
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:45,200
你懂吗
Do you understand?

927
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,040
我不确定
I'm not sure.

928
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:50,000
我想要支持你
I want to support you.

929
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:52,370
你理应得到支持
You deserve to be supported.

930
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:57,880
好吧
Okay.

931
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:05,840
但是在我支持你之前  我需要知道出了什么事
But for me to do that I need to know what happened.

932
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:07,650
说得轻松
It's easy to say that.

933
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,780
但是一旦你知道了  就不能当作不知道了
But once you know something, you can't un-know it.

934
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,770
我想知道  不管是什么
I want to know, no matter what.

935
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:17,370
拜托
Please.

936
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:30,090
{\an8}康复中心

937
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:41,300
哈丽特  求你了
Harriet, please...

938
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,500
对不起  我想不出别的解决办法了
I'm sorry. I just can't think of any other way to resolve this.

939
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,930
你患有精神疾病  罗
You suffer from a condition, Ro.

940
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,450
很明显我家已经不是个理想的环境了
And it's clear my home is no longer an ideal environment.

941
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:51,440
你听起来就像那些医生
You sound like one of them doctors

942
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,830
她又要丢下我了
she about to dump me with again.

943
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:55,150
-我不是要丢下你  -是吗
- I'm not dumping you. - Oh really?

944
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,650
感觉你就是要丢下我  哈丽特
That's what it feels like, Harriet!

945
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,020
别这样
Come on, now.

946
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,160
别闹了  别闹了
Don't make a scene. Don't make a scene.

947
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,600
哈丽特
Harriet!

948
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:07,830
-罗  -没事  没事
- Ro... - It's fine. It's fine.

949
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:09,150
没事  没事
It's fine, it's fine...

950
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:10,280
没事
It's fine!

951
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,460
哈丽特
Harriet!

952
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,090
欧力基办了个派对
Orlicki had a party.

953
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,090
我喝多了
I was drunk.

954
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:36,950
我和两个朋友一起去的  我们三个都喝多了
I had gone with two friends. All three of us were drunk.

955
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:39,190
千万别告诉别人  太难堪了
Please don't tell anyone this, it's embarrassing.

956
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:42,530
不  就我们两个知道  我保证
No, no, this is between us. I promise.

957
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:48,750
大家一直在喝一种像糖浆一样的东西
People kept having shots of stuff that tasted like syrup,

958
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,240
我一直在喝  因为很轻松
and I just kept drinking it because it was easy.

959
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,810
但是我感到头晕
but I got dizzy.

960
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,310
跟朋友走丢了
I lost my friends.

961
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:03,590
欧力基找到我  让我去地下室里躺一会
Orlicki found me and told me to go lie down in the basement.

962
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:06,580
那里很黑
It was dark.

963
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,830
我看不见
I couldn't see.

964
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,870
我摸索着走到沙发那里
I felt my way over to the couch

965
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:13,530
但是那里有人
but there were people there.

966
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:18,700
接下来  有人说我们应该玩圣诞老人游戏
Next thing, I knew someone said we should play the Santa Claus game.

967
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,820
那是什么
What's that?

968
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:24,170
就是他们玩的傻帽游戏
It's this stupid game that guys play

969
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:27,300
把女孩从一个人的大腿上传到另一个人的大腿上
where a girl gets passed around from lap to lap

970
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,240
根据女孩允许他们上下其手的程度
and depending on how far she lets them go

971
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,390
或者他们有多喜欢你坐在他们腿上
or how much they like you sitting on them,

972
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,520
他们给你打分  一声到三声
they rate you from one to three.

973
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,020
嚯嚯嚯
Ho ho hos.

974
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,900
我的天  这不是真的吧
My God, that can't be real.

975
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:39,580
还有比这还恶劣的游戏
There are worse games.

976
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:42,160
总之
Anyway,

977
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:45,310
他们开始把我传来传去
they started passing me around.

978
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,290
我一直在想  天呐
I kept thinking, "God,

979
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,520
万一我现在吐了怎么办
what if I throw up right now?

980
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,700
那得多难堪啊
How embarrassing would that be?"

981
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:58,160
开始的时候  他们在笑
When they started, they were laughing.

982
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:01,730
但是时间越久
But the longer it went on...

983
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:07,650
我越觉得这游戏永远都不会结束了
And it felt like it went on forever.

984
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,390
我只能听到呼吸声
All I could hear was breathing.

985
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:16,450
呼吸
Breathing,

986
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:18,620
计数
and counting.

987
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,440
一  二
One, two,

988
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,650
二
two,

989
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:26,390
三
three...

990
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:30,170
一  二
One, two...

991
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:32,550
在某一时刻
At some point

992
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:33,590
我绝对说了
I definitely said

993
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:34,960
想让他们停下来
I wanted them to stop.

994
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,340
但也许听起来像是开玩笑
But maybe it sounded like I was joking

995
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,960
或者我只是在脑子里对自己说的
or maybe it was just something I said to myself in my head...

996
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:46,360
到处都是手
There were hands everywhere.

997
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,150
感觉像是  他们要把我吞噬掉
It was like they were swallowing me.

998
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,090
有时候在他们的大腿上
And sometimes in their laps

999
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:59,920
我可以感觉到...
I could feel...

1000
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,820
真恶心
Gross.

1001
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:16,680
我再醒过来的时候  卢斯在我身旁
When I woke up, Luce was there.

1002
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,450
他说他看到并叫停了他们
He said he found them and told them to stop.

1003
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,400
然后就一直跟我待在一起
And he stayed with me the rest of the night.

1004
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,270
有没有可能...
Is it possible that...?

1005
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:29,930
卢斯也参与其中了
Was Luce one of the guys?

1006
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:31,380
他不会那么做的
He wouldn't do that.

1007
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,820
-但他...  -他就是不会
- But he... - He just wouldn't.

1008
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,170
威尔逊老师是怎么回事
What happened with Ms. Wilson?

1009
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,260
当时有很多谣言
There were a lot of rumors.

1010
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,400
与此同时
It was at the same time

1011
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,230
德肖恩·米克斯被踢出了校队
Deshaun Meeks got kicked off the team

1012
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:53,020
因为威尔逊老师在他的储物柜里发现了大麻
because Wilson found weed in his locker.

1013
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:56,410
她搜了德肖恩的储物柜吗
She searched Deshaun's locker?

1014
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:58,520
然后还叫了警察
And called the cops.

1015
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:01,670
我不想报警  我能说什么
I didn't want that. What would I say?

1016
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,180
我什么都想不起来了
I couldn't remember anything

1017
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:06,810
而且我肯定没跟大家说我喝醉了啊
and I definitely didn't tell everyone I was drunk.

1018
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,170
卢斯怎么说的
What did Luce say?

1019
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:12,550
他说我不出声是对的
He said I was right not to tell.

1020
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,740
因为他要保护自己的朋友们吗
Because he was protecting his friends?

1021
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,580
因为他要保护我
Because he was protecting me.

1022
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:20,600
他不想逼我做任何我不情愿做的事
He didn't want me to do anything I didn't want to do.

1023
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:27,640
你俩为什么分手
Why did you two break up?

1024
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,100
我也不知道
I don't know.

1025
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:32,990
我很想他
I miss him.

1026
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,630
他是我有史以来最好的男友
He's the best boyfriend I ever had.

1027
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,160
斯蒂芬妮...
Stephanie...

1028
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:48,800
对发生的事我真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry for what happened.

1029
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:50,120
不用抱歉
Don't be.

1030
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:53,710
现在都没事了
Everything is fine now.

1031
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,350
你去哪了
Where were you?

1032
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,080
急诊病人
Emergency patient.

1033
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,750
是吗
Oh, really?

1034
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:57,710
-凯伦看起来挺好的  -是挺好的
- Karen seems good. - Yeah, she is.

1035
00:58:58,470 --> 00:58:59,570
他们很幸福
They're happy.

1036
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:02,060
那孩子动个不停
The baby fidgets.

1037
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:05,790
小孩子就是这样的
I think that's just a baby thing.

1038
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:11,980
你喝醉了吗
Are you drunk?

1039
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,260
所以不是只有那个孩子会那样
So you don't think it's that baby in particular.

1040
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,420
我怎么会知道
How would I know?

1041
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,600
我们又没生过小孩  所以...
I mean, I don't know, so...

1042
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,740
我怎么会知道
how would I know?

1043
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:27,580
是啊
Yeah.

1044
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,270
是吧
Right?

1045
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:32,680
是啊  你说得没错
Yeah, I guess you wouldn't.

1046
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:33,740
是啊
No.

1047
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,290
你没机会给自己的小孩换尿布
You know, it's not Luce's fault

1048
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:39,600
并不是卢斯的错
you were denied diaper changing privileges.

1049
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,660
没错
No.

1050
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:45,930
谢谢
Thanks.

1051
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,520
我们做出了选择
Look, we made a choice.

1052
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,480
只要你承认我们付出了代价  我就没意见
I'm okay with that as long as you recognize it cost us.

1053
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:52,630
意思是
Which means?

1054
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,210
曾经我确实想要不一样的生活
I did want something different once.

1055
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,420
十年过去了  你却深陷其中
Ten years and you're trapped.

1056
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,800
这是你说的
Your words.

1057
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:02,380
你自己说的  你想要不一样的生活
Well, you said it. You wanted something different.

1058
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:04,950
-是的  -比如呢
- I did, yeah. - Like what?

1059
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:09,500
我为我们的儿子感到骄傲
Look, I'm proud of our son.

1060
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:13,720
我爱他  我对他的爱
Okay, I love him. I love him

1061
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:17,250
远远超出我自己的理解  好吗
more than I'll ever understand, okay?

1062
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:20,560
但我们花费了数年时间带他治疗
But we spent years with him in therapy

1063
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,110
还有康复
and rehabilitation.

1064
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:23,940
我们的朋友们无法理解
Our friends couldn't understand

1065
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:25,870
为什么我们不能自己生个孩子
why we didn't just have a kid of our own.

1066
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:28,350
所以当他们忙着做那些
And so while they fell away doing

1067
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:31,370
正常人做的事
what normal fucking people do,

1068
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:33,960
我们拼尽全力给他创造一个天地
we worked our asses off to give him a life,

1069
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,280
而代价就是我们自己的生活
at the expense of our own.

1070
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,330
所以假装我们毫无牺牲鬼都不信
So to pretend that that didn't cost us anything is bullshit.

1071
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:40,700
我没假装
I wasn't pretending.

1072
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,310
你就是在假装  艾米
You are! Amy.

1073
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:46,250
你就是
You are.

1074
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:49,180
你如此渴望他成长为
You want so desperately for him

1075
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:50,610
你心目中的样子
to be what you want him to be,

1076
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:52,540
你故意忽视眼前发生的事
you're ignoring what's right in front of you.

1077
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:56,210
无论他是什么样的人  都是我们的儿子
What he is, is our son.

1078
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:57,320
没错
Right.

1079
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,390
这是无法改变的事实
And nothing's going to change that.

1080
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,420
没错
Right.

1081
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,590
所以...
So...

1082
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:07,630
去它的
fuck this.

1083
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,930
去你的
Fuck you.

1084
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:25,100
我来到这里
I came here,

1085
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,240
来到美国
to America,

1086
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:29,500
来到这所学校
to this school,

1087
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:32,790
然后找到了自我
and I found myself.

1088
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:39,900
第一次见到我母亲的时候  她不会念我的名字
When I first met my mother, she couldn't pronounce my name.

1089
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:44,850
她一遍又一遍的尝试
She tried over and over to get the emphasis

1090
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:46,740
想找准音节的重音  但是
on the syllables correct, but...

1091
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,920
她就是不会念
she just couldn't.

1092
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:54,270
所以我父亲提议给我改名
So my father suggested that they rename me.

1093
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:04,250
他们选了卢斯这个名字
They picked Luce,

1094
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:06,290
然后...
and, uh...

1095
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:14,350
我在考虑今晚演讲的内容时
I thought about that when I was figuring out

1096
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:16,130
想到了这件事
what to say to you all tonight.

1097
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:22,150
我意识到身为美国人我是多么幸运
And I realized how lucky I am to be an American.

1098
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:27,740
因为在这里我有重新开始的机会
Because here I got the chance to start over.

1099
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,320
我可以重新定义自己
To redefine myself.

1100
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,690
在这里我们可以选择自己的人生  在这里...
Here we can be who we choose. Here...

1101
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:32,580
还记得那年生日我们送给他的那条鱼吗
Remember that fish we got him for his birthday?

1102
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:40,330
-丹尼斯  -是的
- Dennis. - Yeah, that's right.

1103
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:43,260
可怜的丹尼斯
Yeah. Poor Dennis.

1104
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:48,010
他把鱼捞出来
Yeah. The way he just pulled him out

1105
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:50,380
扔到房间另一头
and threw him across the room like that.

1106
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:53,340
就像扔一片肉一样
Like a piece of deli meat.

1107
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:57,290
"我只是想看它飞起来的样子  妈妈"
"I just wanted to see him fly, mom."

1108
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,800
我们没有搞砸  对吧
We didn't screw up, did we?

1109
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:09,720
没有
No.

1110
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:14,080
一切都没问题
Everything's fine.

1111
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:26,550
{\an8}阅后即焚
斯蒂芬妮·金发来消息

1112
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:32,120
{\an8}斯蒂芬妮
你妈人很好  我感觉好多了

1113
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:40,100
{\an8}我
那就好  对了  德答应了

1114
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:48,220
{\an8}斯蒂芬妮
我们得谈谈

1115
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:02,740
用暗号说话是什么意思呢
So, what does it mean to speak in code?

1116
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,280
这能让你分辨出特定的群体
Well, it tells you about a particular group.

1117
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:09,300
有共同词汇的必要性
The necessity to have a shared vocabulary.

1118
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:10,370
抱歉
Sorry.

1119
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:17,070
在社会中有共同斗争的必要性
To have common struggles in a society.

1120
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:19,080
语言是一条纽带
You see, language is a bond.

1121
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,620
它将我们每个人区分开来  但更重要的是
It's how we tell each other apart, but more importantly,

1122
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:23,450
它将我们团结在一起
it's how we stick together.

1123
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:24,590
不好意思  威尔逊老师
Excuse me, Ms. Wilson,

1124
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:26,190
我需要你跟我来一趟
I need you to come with me please.

1125
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:27,690
快
Right now.

1126
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:41,670
我姐姐在哪
Where's my sister?

1127
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:43,630
她在这工作  她就在这
She works here. She is here.

1128
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:44,890
-罗斯玛丽  -我姐姐呢
- Rosemary! - Where's my sister?

1129
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:48,880
罗斯玛丽  我就在这  就在这
Rosemary! I'm right here. I'm right here.

1130
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:50,540
走吧  我们回家吧
Now come on, let's go home.

1131
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:53,000
-你家不欢迎我  -不是的
- You don't want me at home. - That's not true.

1132
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,120
你不...你以我为耻
You won't... You're ashamed of me.

1133
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:57,820
不是的
I am not.

1134
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:00,720
你恨我
You... You hate me.

1135
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,230
-别胡说了  罗  -你恨我
- Don't talk nonsense, Ro. - You hate me.

1136
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:04,980
-你恨我  -看着我
- You hate me. - Look at me.

1137
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:08,160
手机都放下
Put those phones away.

1138
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:11,740
你觉得丢脸了  你觉得丢脸了
You're embarrassed. You're embarrassed!

1139
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:12,920
-你觉得丢脸了  -停下
- You're embarrassed! - Stop this!

1140
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,130
立刻停下  罗斯
Stop it right now, Rose!

1141
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:18,250
她觉得丢脸了  觉得我丢她脸了
She's embarrassed! She's embarrassed of me!

1142
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:19,710
你觉得我丢你脸了
You're embarrassed of me!

1143
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:23,690
我是你的黑人老妹
I am your black nigger bitch sister!

1144
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:26,510
我是你的血亲  不是这些白人
This your blood. Not these white folk.

1145
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:29,790
我是你的血亲  你是甩不掉的
I am your blood. You can't get rid of blood.

1146
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:34,710
你无法甩掉血脉  我是你妹妹  你...
You can't run from blood! I am your sister! You...

1147
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,010
-她是病人  警官  -别跑
- She's-she's sick, officers. - Don't run!

1148
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,300
冷静下来
Relax! Calm down!

1149
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:43,290
冷静
Relax.

1150
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:44,630
放开我  放开我
Get off of me! Get off of me!

1151
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:46,080
-冷静  -放开我
- Calm down. - Get off of me!

1152
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,830
冷静下来  否则我电击你了
Relax or you'll be tased.

1153
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:49,550
-冷静  -放开我
- Calm down. - Get off of me!

1154
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:50,880
我要电击你了
I'm going to tase you!

1155
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,040
-请冷静  -放开我
- Calm down! Please! - Relax!

1156
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:54,860
求你了
Please.

1157
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:59,090
不
No!

1158
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,000
哈丽特  哈丽特  哈丽特
Harriet, Harriet...Harriet!

1159
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,210
冷静
Calm down!

1160
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,660
能给她披件衣服吗
Can you cover her up?

1161
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:09,420
你们能给她披件衣服吗
Can you please just cover her up?

1162
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,170
放下手机  立刻回教室
Put the phones down. Get back to class now.

1163
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:13,770
手机给我  快点
Give me your phone. Come on!

1164
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:16,990
这里每个人的手机
I want every single phone in this hallway

1165
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:18,600
都交到我办公室
in my office right now.

1166
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:20,220
所有手机
Every cell phone!

1167
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:39,600
天啊  我这辈子都没见过这样的事
My God! I've never seen anything like it in my entire life.

1168
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:41,570
太疯狂了
It was insane.

1169
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,770
谁能想到威尔逊老师的家人是疯子
Who knew that Ms. Wilson's family was so fucked up?

1170
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,530
我是你的黑人老妹
I am your black, nigger...

1171
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:53,890
-这是今天发生的吗  -是的  很疯狂吧
- This was today? - Yeah, it's crazy, huh?

1172
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:57,900
天啊
Oh my God!

1173
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,190
-不是吧  -操
- Oh, come on. - Oh, fuck.

1174
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:04,380
哈丽特在哪
Where's Harriet?

1175
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:06,640
我觉得她和她妹妹
I think she spent most of the day

1176
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,590
今天大半天都在警局里
at the police station with her sister.

1177
01:08:08,970 --> 01:08:10,750
不过证明了
Just goes to show you.

1178
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:12,570
证明了什么
What?

1179
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:14,170
没什么  就是...
Nothing, it's just...

1180
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,040
你永远不知道人们在经历什么
You never really know what's going on with people.

1181
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:20,080
生活中不为人知的那一面
Like, in life. Outside of what you know.

1182
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:23,130
我不应该说她是个婊子的
I shouldn't have said she was a bitch.

1183
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:30,360
卢斯  我觉得我欠你一个道歉
Well, I think I owe you an apology, Luce.

1184
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:32,590
-为什么  -真的
- For what? - Really.

1185
01:08:32,610 --> 01:08:35,130
你从来没有给我任何理由怀疑你的诚实
You've never given me any reason to doubt your integrity.

1186
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:37,130
你应该知道  我们支持你
You should know we got your back.

1187
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:41,020
-无论发生什么吗  -无论发生什么  小混蛋
- No matter what? - No matter what. Asshole.

1188
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:49,650
放下手机  立刻回教室
Put your phones down, get back to class now.

1189
01:09:58,030 --> 01:10:07,250
{\an8}黑鬼婊子

1190
01:10:13,730 --> 01:10:14,860
谁啊
Who is it?

1191
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,150
我得跟你谈谈卢斯
I need to talk to you about Luce.

1192
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:35,110
哈丽特  如果你上网搜索"模范学生"
Harriet, if you Googled "model student"

1193
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:37,040
卢斯·埃德加的照片就会跳出来
Luce Edgar's picture would come up on the computer

1194
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:40,250
而你要跟我说这孩子在你房子外涂鸦了
and now you're telling me that this kid, graffiti-ed your home?

1195
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:41,600
不仅仅是涂鸦  丹
It's not just the graffiti, Dan.

1196
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,320
嗯  他还写了一篇令人不安的论文
No, he also wrote an upsetting paper.

1197
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,980
-论文中他主张暴力...  -这篇论文
- In which he argued violence... - A paper

1198
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:46,370
你手上已经没有存档了
that you no longer have a copy of.

1199
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:47,190
我交给她妈妈了
I gave it to his mother.

1200
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:48,990
这篇令人不安的论文
An upsetting paper where it sounds

1201
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:51,470
只不过是他按照作业要求完成的
like he did exactly what the assignment asked him to do.

1202
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:54,440
我明白误解和挑衅之间的区别
I know the difference between miscommunication and provocation.

1203
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,350
我能分得清楚
I can tell the difference between them.

1204
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:58,530
有没有这种可能
Isn't there a chance, just maybe,

1205
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:03,190
他写的东西超出了你的理解范围
that what he wrote just went over your head?

1206
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:05,110
我不是在挖苦你
I don't mean that as a dig.

1207
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:07,530
拜托  我认为你很有才华
Come on, I think you're brilliant.

1208
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:10,030
你善于表达  你是个出色的老师
I think you're articulate, you're a great teacher,

1209
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:13,700
但你也知道  我们都会时不时地看走眼
but you know, we all misread signals from time to time.

1210
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:18,180
有一项性侵犯的指控
There's an allegation of sexual assault.

1211
01:11:19,870 --> 01:11:21,740
一名学生来找我说
A student came to me and said

1212
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:24,330
卢斯在派对上对她进行了性侵犯
Luce sexually assaulted her at a party.

1213
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:32,220
-哪个学生  -丹
- Which student? - Dan...

1214
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:33,760
你说的可是犯罪
You're talking about a crime now.

1215
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:37,910
我不会因为你这些毫无根据的指控和直觉
I'm not gonna ruin a kid's life because you come here

1216
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:41,020
就毁了一个孩子的人生
with some unsubstantiated accusations and hunches.

1217
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:42,680
那就让我证明给你看
Then let me prove it.

1218
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:49,430
怎么了
Hey, what's up?

1219
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:53,840
之前我还不相信  但也许你是对的
I didn't buy it before but maybe you're right,

1220
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,250
也许她真的对卢斯抱有奇怪的恨意
maybe she has some kind of weird vendetta thing for Luce.

1221
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:58,560
等一下
Okay, hold on.

1222
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,880
你没能让她如愿
She doesn't get what she wants out of you

1223
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:00,920
于是她就来找我了
so then she comes to me.

1224
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,310
还是不成功  他就去找丹了
Then when that doesn't work she goes to Dan.

1225
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,260
她自己的生活出现危机  却拿我们的儿子出气
She's having a personal crisis, she's taking it out on our son.

1226
01:12:06,610 --> 01:12:08,700
让我来处理  让我来
Just let me handle it. Just let me.

1227
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,240
-好吧  -好  再见
- Okay. - Okay. Bye.

1228
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:42,840
你回家做什么
What are you doing home?

1229
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:45,780
我只是
I, uh,

1230
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:48,550
去训练前回来拿几样东西
just needed to pick up a few things before practice.

1231
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,940
-你看了丹发来的电邮吗  -看了
- You see Dan's email? - Yeah.

1232
01:12:54,190 --> 01:12:55,730
不知道到底是什么事
I'm not sure what it's about.

1233
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,700
看来只能等着瞧了
I guess we'll just wait and see.

1234
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,520
是啊
Guess so.

1235
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:03,650
我接受了你的建议
I'm, um, I'm taking your advice you know.

1236
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:05,070
什么建议
About what?

1237
01:13:05,530 --> 01:13:06,740
演讲
The speech.

1238
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:11,250
我准备谈谈自己  你应该会很骄傲的
I'm making it more personal. I think you'll be proud.

1239
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:14,240
一定会的
I'm sure I will be.

1240
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:16,920
那个
So, um,

1241
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,730
谈话的时候见
I'll see you at the meeting.

1242
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:20,690
-六点整  -对
- Six o'clock sharp. - Great.

1243
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,000
你为什么不告诉我你跟斯蒂芬妮谈过了
Why didn't you tell me you talked to Stephanie?

1244
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,110
你觉得她不会告诉我吗
You didn't think she would tell me?

1245
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:36,680
我觉得我们两个都没有
I don't think either of us have been great

1246
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,650
把所有事情告诉对方  卢斯
at keeping each other in the loop, Luce.

1247
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:40,190
你想证明什么
What are you trying to prove?

1248
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:41,670
你想隐瞒什么
What are you trying to hide?

1249
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:43,330
我没有隐瞒任何事
I'm not trying to hide anything.

1250
01:13:43,330 --> 01:13:45,670
我从斯蒂芬妮那里听到的不是这样的
That's not the impression I got from Stephanie.

1251
01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:47,650
-她说什么了吗  -你说呢
- What did she say? - You tell me.

1252
01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:48,850
找她谈的人是你
You're the one that talked to her.

1253
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:50,180
-停下  -停什么
- Stop it. - Stop what?

1254
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:51,780
-这个游戏  -什么游戏
- This game. - What game?

1255
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:54,290
-你对那个女孩做了什么  -怎么  你认为我
- What did you do to that girl? - What, you think I...?

1256
01:13:54,290 --> 01:13:56,560
别管我怎么想  你对她做了什么
Never mind what I think. What did you do to her?

1257
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,400
-我做了正确的是  -通过撒谎吗
- I did the right thing. - By lying?

1258
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,710
-她威胁说要自杀  -通过保护
- She threatened to kill herself. - By protecting...

1259
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:00,570
威尔逊老师一直在逼她
Ms. Wilson kept pushing for her...

1260
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:02,740
通过保护伤害她的人吗
By protecting the people who hurt her?

1261
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:04,080
我只是想让她好起来
I just wanted her to get better.

1262
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,310
那你为什么不求助
Then why didn't you ask for help?

1263
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:07,100
-她在好转  -我认为你在撒谎
- She was getting better. - I think you're lying.

1264
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,880
-我没撒谎  -跟我说实话
- I'm not lying. - Tell me the truth.

1265
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,710
-我说的就是实话  -别再骗我了
- I'm telling you the truth. - Stop lying to me.

1266
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:14,040
-我没撒谎  我没撒谎  -给我说实话
- I'm not lying. I'm not lying! - Tell me the fucking truth!

1267
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,090
你为什么要写那篇论文
Why did you write that paper?

1268
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,730
如果我告诉你那是我相信的理念呢
What if I told you it's what I believed?

1269
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:30,910
你相信
You believe in

1270
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:33,690
通过伤人来表明观点
hurting people to make a point?

1271
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:35,680
你不知道  你根本没读  对吧
You wouldn't know. You never read it, right?

1272
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:42,660
卢斯  我...
Luce, I...

1273
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:50,940
我觉得
I feel like...

1274
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:56,200
你们都在等着我证实一件事
you're all waiting for me to confirm this thing...

1275
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:59,530
一件没人愿意大声说出来的事
that no one wants to say aloud.

1276
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:03,070
我拼命努力
And I'm trying so hard

1277
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:05,360
不想证实那件事
not to be that.

1278
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,580
但过了一段时间  你就会情不自禁地想
But after a while you can't help but think that maybe

1279
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:11,640
-也许一切都是徒劳  -你在说什么
- you're fighting a losing battle. - What do you mean?

1280
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:12,800
我在说
I mean

1281
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,340
我只能成为圣人或者恶魔
it's like I only get to be a saint or a monster.

1282
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:18,360
不是这样的  不管你是谁
That's not true. We always accepted you

1283
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:19,640
我们一直都接纳你
for whoever you are.

1284
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,280
我不相信你  艾米
I don't believe you, Amy.

1285
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:26,510
而且我觉得我要窒息了  我喘不上气
And I feel like I'm suffocating. Like I can't breathe.

1286
01:15:26,510 --> 01:15:29,280
所以有我在啊  我来帮助你保护你
That's why I'm here, to help you and to protect you.

1287
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,540
如果你正是我需要保护的原因之一呢
What if you're part of what I need protecting from?

1288
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:46,790
我要迟到了
I'm gonna be late, um...

1289
01:15:48,930 --> 01:15:50,390
谈话的时候见
I'll see you at the meeting.

1290
01:16:15,230 --> 01:16:18,410
{\an8}将军队

1291
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:21,260
我保证会尽量减少痛苦
I promise it'll be as painless as possible.

1292
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:22,810
我们就在走廊那头
We'll be just down the hall.

1293
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,930
等时候到了  我会护送你进去
When the time comes, I'll escort you in and

1294
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,020
你只要把你告诉我的告诉他们就行了
you just tell them what you told me.

1295
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:29,880
然后你就没事了
And then that's it, you're done.

1296
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,170
卢斯会在场吗
Luce will be there?

1297
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,060
你说话的时候  我可以让他回避
I can have him step out when it's time for you to speak.

1298
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:35,490
那他妈妈呢
What about his mom?

1299
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:36,880
她会在场
She'll be there.

1300
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:37,980
是的
Yes.

1301
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:42,580
你很勇敢
You're brave.

1302
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:45,730
因为你今天展现了勇气
It's because you show courage today, that

1303
01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:48,250
明天就不会有别人和你有一样的遭遇了
someone else doesn't suffer like you did tomorrow.

1304
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:50,820
你明白吗
You understand?

1305
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,220
那就好
Good.

1306
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:57,450
很好
Good.

1307
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:02,500
五  六  七  八
Five, six, seven, eight.

1308
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:03,670
稍息
Parade rest.

二  三  四  定
Two, three, four... boom!

1322
01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:47,530
你们好  进来吧
Hey, guys. Come on in.

1323
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:48,870
你好吗  艾米
How you doing, Amy?

1324
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:50,580
你好吗  彼得  很高兴见到你
How you doing, Peter? Good to see you.

1325
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,160
-丹  -丹
- Hey, Dan. - Dan.

1326
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:54,520
-你们怎么样  -不太好
- You all right? - Been better.

1327
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,520
-诊所怎么样  -很忙  总是很忙
- How's the clinic? - Busy. Always busy.

1328
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,340
-忙是好事  -是啊
- Busy is good. - Yeah.

1329
01:17:58,350 --> 01:17:59,740
忙总是好的
Busy is always good.

1330
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:02,970
她来了
Here she is.

1331
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:06,480
哈丽特·威尔逊
Harriet Wilson.

1332
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,660
你认识彼得和艾米·埃德加
You know Peter and Amy Edgar.

1333
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:09,890
-彼得  艾米  很高兴见到你们  -我们也是
- Good to see you, Amy. Peter. - Good to see you, too.

1334
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:11,140
很高兴见到你
Good to see you.

1335
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:16,060
现在只剩  风云人物没来了
So we're just, uh, missing the man of the hour here.

1336
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,560
他应该快到了
He should be along here.

1337
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:21,750
抱歉  抱歉
Sorry, sorry.

1338
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:24,200
-我忘记时间了  -训练到忘记时间
- I lost track of time. - Lost track at the track.

1339
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,920
果然是我了解的卢斯
Sounds like the Luce I know.

1340
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,380
-你好吗  -我很好  谢谢  陶森校长
- How are you? - I'm great. Thanks, Principal Towson.

1341
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:30,310
-你好吗  -陶森校长
- How are you? - Principal Towson.

1342
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:32,770
快毕业了就变得这么正经
Notice he's all formal now that he's a senior.

1343
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,510
准备去上大学了  对吧
Getting ready for college, right?

1344
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:37,510
-没错  -聪明人  聪明人
- That's right. - Smart man. Smart man.

1345
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:39,300
请坐  各位  我们坐吧
Have a seat, guys. Come on, sit down.

1346
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:43,410
-那么  -我想
- So... - I'd like to...

1347
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:44,570
不吉利
Jinx!

1348
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:46,660
你先请
Go ahead. You first.

1349
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:50,030
那我先说最重要的
Well, I guess first things first.

1350
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:53,330
我们之间有一系列的误解
There have been a series of miscommunications

1351
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:56,840
我认为与其试图解决这些问题
and I think rather than try to hash all that out,

1352
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:01,160
不如承认我和卢斯之间
it's probably more productive to just acknowledge

1353
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:03,980
已经出现了一些摩擦
some tension has developed between Luce and me.

1354
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:05,350
这种事时有发生
It happens.

1355
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,690
双方的意思被误解
Signals get crossed and

1356
01:19:06,690 --> 01:19:09,230
我们必须想办法解开误会
we have to find a way to untangle the knots,

1357
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:12,320
即使我们不清楚最开始误会是如何出现的
even if we're not sure how those knots got there in first place.

1358
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,990
说得没错  还有
Definitely. And...

1359
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:15,610
我只是想为让你
I just want to apologize

1360
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:17,870
感到不被尊重而道歉
for making you feel disrespected.

1361
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,660
这学期我肩上的担子很重
I've taken on a lot this semester,

1362
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:22,620
我知道这不是借口  真的不是
and not that that's an excuse, it's not but...

1363
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:26,000
但我最近的表现不佳  为此我道歉
I haven't been my best self lately and I'm sorry for that.

1364
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:30,380
-谢谢你  卢斯  -不客气
- Thank you, Luce. - You're welcome.

1365
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:33,590
目前为止  我觉得进展非常顺利
This is going really well, I think, so far.

1366
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:35,470
我们来谈谈威胁吧
Let's talk about the threat.

1367
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:37,470
我也为此道歉  威尔逊老师
I'm sorry for that too, Ms. Wilson.

1368
01:19:37,470 --> 01:19:38,010
什么
Sorry?

1369
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:39,510
你这是承认吗
Are you admitting it now?

1370
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:40,720
就像我说的
Like I was saying,

1371
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:42,560
考虑到我最近的压力
given the stress I've been under,

1372
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,430
我说的话听起来肯定有点...
I'm sure what I said sounded a bit...

1373
01:19:44,430 --> 01:19:47,690
不不不  不好意思  这不是压力导致的
No, no, no. I'm sorry, but this isn't about some

1374
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:49,810
语气不善的问题
stress-induced problem of tone.

1375
01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:51,060
这是一个人暗示
This is about one person

1376
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:52,940
对另一个人施加暴力
suggesting violence against another.

1377
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:54,610
-你说什么  -你当时不在场  埃德加
- Excuse me? - You weren't there, Mr. Edgar.

1378
01:19:54,610 --> 01:19:56,860
有些互动必须亲身经历
There are interactions that must be experienced

1379
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:59,160
才能理解其中的意图
in order to appreciate their intent.

1380
01:19:59,160 --> 01:19:59,700
无意冒犯
Respectfully,

1381
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:02,410
我认为你应该更加慎重地措辞
I think you should choose your words more carefully.

1382
01:20:02,410 --> 01:20:04,660
-我儿子刚刚道歉了  -真的吗
- My son has just apologized. - Has he?

1383
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:07,750
哈丽特  我觉得为了让谈话进行下去
I-I think in the interest of moving forward, Harriet,

1384
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:11,130
我觉得你承认卢斯确实道歉了会比较有帮助
it would be helpful for you to acknowledge Luce did in fact apologize.

1385
01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:12,550
你昨晚在哪里
Where were you last night?

1386
01:20:12,670 --> 01:20:16,380
-什么  -我家被人破坏了
- What? - My home was vandalized.

1387
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:18,550
-等一下  -我想知道从放学
- Just a second... - I want to know where you were

1388
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:20,890
到我回家期间你在哪里
between when school let out and I got back to my house.

1389
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:22,680
-我出去了  -去哪里了
- I was out. - Where?

1390
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,430
我儿子被指控犯罪了吗
Is my son being accused of a crime?

1391
01:20:24,430 --> 01:20:25,930
他马上就要被指控了
He sure as hell is about to be.

1392
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:27,020
如果他被指控了
Because if he is,

1393
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:29,230
如果他被指控犯罪了
if he is being accused of a crime,

1394
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:29,890
那我要请律师
I want a lawyer.

1395
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:30,900
爸  没事的  我什么都没做
Dad, It's fine. I didn't do anything.

1396
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:32,480
这个女人的妹妹
This woman's sister,

1397
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:35,610
这个女人的妹妹刚刚经历了众目睽睽之下的
this woman's sister has just gone through a very public

1398
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:37,610
-精神崩溃  -好了
- mental breakdown. - All right.

1399
01:20:37,610 --> 01:20:39,360
你怎么知道不是她干的
How do you know she's not responsible?

1400
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,030
-我妹妹不会那么做  -我儿子也不会
- My sister wouldn't do that. - Well, neither would my son.

1401
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:42,110
好了  好了
All right, okay.

1402
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,410
大家冷静...卢斯
Everybody just... Luce,

1403
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:46,000
你能帮帮我们吗
can you help us out here?

1404
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:49,080
你能告诉我们昨天放学后你去哪了吗
Can you tell us where you were after school yesterday?

1405
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,420
-我不想说  -你去哪了
- I don't want to say. - Where were you?

1406
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:58,130
-和朋友在一起  -哪些朋友
- With friends. - Who?

1407
01:21:00,050 --> 01:21:01,180
看  她在撒谎  丹
See, he's lying, Dan.

1408
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:02,050
哈丽特
Harriet!

1409
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,640
陶森校长  我可以解释我去哪了
Principal Towson, I can explain where I was

1410
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:06,350
但我不想给别人惹上麻烦
but I do not want to get people in trouble.

1411
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:09,020
我尊重你的谨慎  但是
I respect your discretion, but,

1412
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:11,100
卢斯  你妈妈  你爸爸  威尔逊老师
Luce, your mom, your dad, Ms. Wilson,

1413
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:15,110
我们都只是想弄明白是怎么回事  好吗
we're all just trying to pin down what's going on here, okay?

1414
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:17,860
如果你知道些什么  如果你能帮助我们
And if you know anything, if you could help us with that,

1415
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:19,860
这对你只有好处
it's-it's only going to help you.

1416
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,820
这让我很难堪
It's embarrassing for me.

1417
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:24,530
开什么玩笑
You gotta be kidding.

1418
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:25,290
哈丽特
Harriet.

1419
01:21:28,790 --> 01:21:29,910
说吧  卢斯
Go ahead, Luce.

1420
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:42,010
请不要告诉任何人我给你看了这个
Please don't tell anyone I'm showing you this.

1421
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:44,180
这是背叛朋友
It's a violation of trust.

1422
01:21:49,980 --> 01:22:04,880
{\an8}约翰逊  二十小时前
飞叶子

1423
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:53,020
怎么着
What up?

1424
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:14,830
我不想给他们惹上麻烦
I don't want them to get in trouble.

1425
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:16,170
没人惹上麻烦
No one's gonna get in trouble.

1426
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:17,670
你们都是好孩子
All right, you guys are good kids.

1427
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:19,460
-我们都知道  -这都是放屁
- We all know that. - This is bullshit.

1428
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:20,800
哈丽特  失陪一下
Harriet. Excuse me.

1429
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,590
哈丽特
Harriet!

1430
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:23,220
哈丽特
Harriet!

1431
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:32,270
{\an8}将军队

1432
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:29,180
斯蒂芬...
Steph...

1433
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:34,440
我认为那所大学对你来说是个很好的选择
I think that's a really good choice for you.

1434
01:22:34,690 --> 01:22:37,070
我知道你最初没有把它纳入考虑  但我...
I know it wasn't on your original list, but I...

1435
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:40,520
是你让她来找我的
You told her to come to me.

1436
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:43,360
-什么  -你告诉了她该说什么
- I'm sorry? - You told her what to say.

1437
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,360
丹  她在说什么
Dan, what is she talking about?

1438
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:45,450
请解释一下  哈丽特
Please explain what your're talking about, Harriet.

1439
01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:47,910
我觉得威尔逊老师最近遭遇了太多事
I think Ms. Wilson's just been through a lot.

1440
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:50,530
先是她的妹妹精神崩溃
Between what's happened with her sister's breakdown

1441
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:53,080
然后她的家又被人破坏
and someone vandalizing her house.

1442
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,330
她糊涂了
She's confused.

1443
01:22:54,330 --> 01:22:56,500
对吧  威尔逊老师  你糊涂了
Right, Ms. Wilson? You're confused.

1444
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:58,710
卢斯  我需要你回避一下
Luce, I'm going to need you to step out for a moment.

1445
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:00,880
我还以为这次谈话的目的就是让大家
I thought this meeting was to get together

1446
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:01,670
一起把事情搞清楚
and figure things out.

1447
01:23:01,670 --> 01:23:03,920
是的  但我需要和你的家长
Yes. But I need to speak with your parents

1448
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,890
还有陶森校长单独谈  请配合
and Principal Towson alone. Please.

1449
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:09,560
-好的  -不
- Sure. - No.

1450
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:10,810
他可以留下
He can stay.

1451
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:11,930
不管你要对我们说什么
Whatever you have to say to us,

1452
01:23:11,930 --> 01:23:13,520
都可以让他听着
you can say in front of him.

1453
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:18,600
你儿子把非法烟花带进了学校
Your son brought illegal fireworks onto school property.

1454
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:20,230
-什么  -我搜查了卢斯的储物柜
- Excuse me? - I searches Luce's locker

1455
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:21,690
发现了非法烟花
and I found illegal fireworks.

1456
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:23,230
你为什么没告诉我  哈丽特
Why didn't you tell me this, Harriet?

1457
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:26,780
等一下  学生们共用储物柜  对吧
Well, hold on. The kids share lockers, right?

1458
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:29,370
考虑到卢斯是模范学生  有人觉得
Well, it makes sense that given the kind of student Luce is

1459
01:23:29,370 --> 01:23:32,200
在他的储物柜里藏东西比较安全也不奇怪了
that someone would think his was the safe hiding place.

1460
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,660
烟花是谁的都有可能
The fireworks could have belonged to anyone.

1461
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:36,540
而且我已经吸取了教训
And I've learned my lesson.

1462
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:37,920
我会把锁的密码换了
I'm going to change my combination

1463
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,380
我们不会再共用储物柜了
and we won't share lockers anymore.

1464
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:41,250
好的
Okay.

1465
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:44,050
哈丽特  烟花现在在哪里
Harriet, where are the fireworks now?

1466
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:46,090
艾米
Amy?

1467
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:48,470
什么事
Yes?

1468
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:49,970
烟花在哪里
Where are they?

1469
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:53,470
-什么意思  -我交给你了
- What do you mean? - I gave them to you.

1470
01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:58,060
我不知道她在说什么
I don't know what she's talking about.

1471
01:23:58,060 --> 01:23:58,860
什么
What?

1472
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,940
对  她打电话给我
Nope. She called me

1473
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:02,860
声称她发现了烟花
and she claimed she found these fireworks.

1474
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:04,570
声称我儿子威胁了她
She claimed my son threatened her.

1475
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:05,650
-艾米  -然后她把我们
- Amy! - And then she drags us

1476
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:07,190
拖到你面前  丹
down here in front of you, Dan,

1477
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,450
并且威胁要对我儿子采取法律行动
and threatens legal action against my son

1478
01:24:09,450 --> 01:24:11,320
而他显然没有犯罪
for a crime he clearly didn't commit.

1479
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:13,450
不好意思  闹剧可以结束了吗
I mean, I'm sorry, but are we done here?

1480
01:24:13,450 --> 01:24:15,490
我们能回到这个女人决定对我儿子
Can my son go back to being the student he was

1481
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,000
进行某种疯狂的政治迫害之前吗
before this woman decided to go after him

1482
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,170
回到之前让我儿子接着做模范学生
on some kind of insane witch hunt?

1483
01:24:20,170 --> 01:24:21,590
不  彼得
No, Peter...

1484
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:23,460
我认为
I think

1485
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,760
谈话结束了  哈丽特
we're done here, Harriet.

1486
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,800
不不不  丹
No, no, no. Dan...

1487
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,760
对  哈丽特
Yeah, Harriet.

1488
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:30,720
谈话结束了
We're done.

1489
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:32,430
我不想再听了
We are done.

1490
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,100
艾米  彼得  谢谢你们能来
Amy, Peter, thank you for coming.

1491
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:37,690
闹成这样我很抱歉  我会做出补偿的
I'm very sorry about this. I will make it up to you.

1492
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:40,020
我保证  卢斯  谢谢你
I promise. Luce, thank you.

1493
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:42,060
-晚安  陶森校长  -谢谢你
- Good night, Principal Towson. - Thank you.

1494
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:43,190
好了  威尔逊老师
All right, Ms. Wilson...

1495
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:45,570
丹
Dan,

1496
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:46,650
斯蒂芬妮·金之前就在我办公室
Stephanie Kim was in my office.

1497
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:48,490
-什么都别说  别说  -不  丹
- Just don't say anything. Don't say anything. - No, Dan...

1498
01:24:48,490 --> 01:24:50,410
我们明天会谈这事的
We're going to talk tomorrow. Okay?

1499
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,580
-没关系  我们明天谈  -不
- It's okay, we'll talk tomorrow. - No.

1500
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:24,650
要是你们饿了  我可以把剩菜热一热
I can heat up leftovers if anyone wants.

1501
01:25:24,650 --> 01:25:25,610
我不要
No, I'm good.

1502
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:28,570
-他生我气了吗  -没有
- Is he mad at me? - No, he's fine.

1503
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:30,700
他只是...
He's just...

1504
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:33,120
你饿了吗
Are you hungry?

1505
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:35,580
我应该抓紧准备演讲了
I should probably get to my speech.

1506
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:39,040
好的  等不及想听了
Okay. Well, can't wait to hear it.

1507
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:42,580
谢谢  艾米  晚安
Thanks, Amy. Good night.

1508
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,220
闻起来真香
That smells good.

1509
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:36,300
我也有一定的家庭生活能力
I'm capable of a certain level of domesticity.

1510
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,140
想吃早餐吗
Want some breakfast?

1511
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:42,560
不了  谢谢
No, thanks.

1512
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:55,370
大姨夫的坏心情仍在继续
And the man period continues unabated.

1513
01:26:57,700 --> 01:26:59,120
能送我去学校吗
Can I get a ride to school?

1514
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:02,040
你要我开车送你
You want me to drive you?

1515
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:03,660
有何不可
Yeah, why not?

1516
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:06,290
好
Okay.

1517
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:20,430
不知发生了什么
I wonder what happened.

1518
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:27,110
如果学校停课我会告诉你的
I guess I'll let you know if school gets canceled.

1519
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:28,040
{\an8}北弗吉尼亚高中

1520
01:27:35,530 --> 01:27:37,990
现在的情况太难办了
This is an impossible situation.

1521
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:40,700
哈丽特  要是你没藏那些烟火...
If you hadn't of hidden those fireworks, Harriet...

1522
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:44,620
丹  我为这所学校奉献了一切
I've given this school everything, Dan.

1523
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,500
十五年来我一直
For 15 years I've

1524
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:50,880
为这些学生无私奉献
given everything I have to these kids.

1525
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,170
他们是我的生命
They're my life.

1526
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:57,390
你知道我不是骗子  你很清楚
And you know I'm not a liar. You know it.

1527
01:27:59,050 --> 01:28:01,010
我们先从休假开始
We'll start with a leave of absence.

1528
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:03,510
我们会展开调查
There will be an investigation.

1529
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,720
而且哈丽特  我必须告诉你
And, Harriet, I have to tell you

1530
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,770
学校是不会支持你的
this school can't stand behind you.

1531
01:28:26,410 --> 01:28:28,460
不  不  不
No, no, no!

1532
01:28:36,590 --> 01:28:39,180
消防队长让孩子们停课回家了
The fire marshal's sending the kids home.

1533
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:42,140
什么
What?

1534
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:48,440
-有人受伤吗  -没有
- Was anyone hurt? - No.

1535
01:28:49,350 --> 01:28:50,230
那就好
Good.

1536
01:28:52,770 --> 01:28:53,690
很好
That's good.

1537
01:28:55,570 --> 01:28:57,740
我认为我们现在有义务
I think we have an obligation here.

1538
01:28:58,780 --> 01:28:59,780
什么义务
What does that mean?

1539
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:03,160
哈丽特会丢掉工作
Harriet's going to lose her job.

1540
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,410
还发生了火灾
There was a fire.

1541
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:10,040
可能会有人受伤的
People might have been hurt.

1542
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:12,750
没人受伤
No one was.

1543
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:16,630
可能是卢斯干的  艾米
Could have been Luce. Amy.

1544
01:29:16,630 --> 01:29:18,880
他整夜都和我们在家  彼得
He was with us all night, Pete.

1545
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,420
-如果你要指控...  -来这套吗
- So if you're accusing... - Really?

1546
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:22,010
不  如果你要指控他
No, if you're accusing him,

1547
01:29:22,010 --> 01:29:25,140
先想清楚你到底站在谁那边
just think carefully about who's side you're on.

1548
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:27,810
-老天  -这是我们共同的愿望
- Jesus... - We both wanted this.

1549
01:29:27,810 --> 01:29:29,600
不  我的愿望是家庭
No, I wanted a family.

1550
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:34,360
我的愿望简单  理智  正常
I wanted something simple and sane and normal.

1551
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:38,570
我们的生活不非得是政治宣言
Our lives didn't have to be a political fucking statement.

1552
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:40,200
我不想要...
I didn't want...

1553
01:29:43,780 --> 01:29:44,620
他
Him?

1554
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:48,790
我认为一定要有
I think there has to be...

1555
01:29:50,290 --> 01:29:51,620
某种限度
some kind of limit.

1556
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:53,670
什么限度  告诉我
A limit to what? Tell me.

1557
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,420
我爱他的限度吗
To how much I love him?

1558
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:58,380
我努力的限度吗
To how hard I've worked?

1559
01:29:58,670 --> 01:30:01,630
为了确保他有机会享受生活  获得成功
To ensure he had a chance at life, at success?

1560
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:02,930
不  彼得  我不同意
No, Pete, I disagree.

1561
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:04,590
这是没有限度的
There is no limit to that,

1562
01:30:04,590 --> 01:30:06,470
而学校发生的偶然事故...
and some random accident at school...

1563
01:30:06,470 --> 01:30:08,100
-妈的  艾米  -听我说
- Fuck, Amy! - Listen to me!

1564
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:12,690
学校发生的偶然事故不会改变这一点
Some random accident at school is not going to change that.

1565
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:17,980
所以告诉我
So just tell me...

1566
01:30:19,610 --> 01:30:21,070
你到底站在谁那边
who's side you're on.

1567
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,330
我们这边  艾米
Our side, Amy.

1568
01:30:31,330 --> 01:30:32,250
我们这边
Ours.

1569
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:37,040
我的家人这边
My family's.

1570
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:39,880
谢谢你
Thank you.

1571
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:19,170
卢斯  你在哪儿
Luce! Where are you?

1572
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:22,300
我正要离开学校  着火的是威尔逊老师的教室
I'm leaving school. The fire was in Ms. Wilson's classroom.

1573
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:23,300
我觉得过意不去
I feel bad.

1574
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:24,840
我想做点什么安慰她
I want to do something nice for her.

1575
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:27,430
先回家  我来接你
Come home first. I can pick you up.

1576
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:28,720
我马上就回家
I will in just a little.

1577
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:29,930
卢斯  等等
Luce, wait.

1578
01:31:30,050 --> 01:31:30,810
爱你
Love you.

1579
01:31:44,530 --> 01:31:45,940
你在开玩笑吧
You gotta be joking.

1580
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:48,570
德肖恩和我组织全队凑钱买了花
Deshaun and I got the team to chip in for flowers.

1581
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:49,700
德肖恩是吗
Deshaun?

1582
01:31:52,370 --> 01:31:53,120
怎么了
What?

1583
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:54,580
没事
Nothing.

1584
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:57,170
我过敏
I'm allergic.

1585
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,220
你不能闯进来  卢斯
This is not okay, Luce.

1586
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:10,680
我只是想谈谈
I just want to talk.

1587
01:32:11,140 --> 01:32:12,970
这样不行
Well, this is not okay.

1588
01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:24,030
太可怕了
That's awful.

1589
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:26,780
有人叫过你黑鬼吗
You ever been called that?

1590
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:28,610
没有
No.

1591
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:31,910
怪不得你总是自视甚高
No wonder you're always so pleased with yourself.

1592
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:34,500
这话什么意思
What does that mean?

1593
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:37,200
你气愤人们把你放进盒子里
You're mad people put you in a box.

1594
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:39,080
-是你把我放进盒子里  -我保护了你
- You put me in a box. - I protected you.

1595
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:40,330
但没保护德肖恩
But not Deshaun.

1596
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:43,420
你抓到他之后
After you busted him,

1597
01:32:44,090 --> 01:32:46,590
你找来我  科里
you had that meeting with me and Corey

1598
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:49,510
还有队里所有的黑人选手
and all the other black runners on the squad.

1599
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:53,220
你说不沦为刻板印象
And you said it is your solemn duty

1600
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:55,770
是你们庄严的责任
to never be stereotypes.

1601
01:32:57,020 --> 01:32:58,310
学学卢斯
Look at Luce.

1602
01:32:59,190 --> 01:33:00,860
成为卢斯
Be like Luce.

1603
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:01,810
是的
Yes.

1604
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:04,570
我记得他们都看着我
And I remember them all looking at me.

1605
01:33:05,730 --> 01:33:07,280
他们并不嫉妒
They weren't jealous.

1606
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:11,030
他们只是想弄明白
They were just trying to figure it out.

1607
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:13,450
我怎么变成那样
How do I get that?

1608
01:33:15,370 --> 01:33:17,710
而我满脑子想的都是德肖恩
And all I can think about was Deshaun.

1609
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:20,000
他唯一的希望就是那个体育奖学金
All he had was that athletic scholarship

1610
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,500
而你却把它夺走了
and you took it from him.

1611
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:23,500
你把它夺走是因为他不是我
You took it from him because he wasn't me.

1612
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:24,500
-对  -为什么
- Yes. - Why?

1613
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:27,460
因为多一个我没有打压的德肖恩·米克斯
Because for every Deshaun Meeks I don't come down on,

1614
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:29,130
就会多一个我没法栽培的卢斯·埃德加
there's a Luce Edgar I can't lift out.

1615
01:33:29,130 --> 01:33:30,430
胡说八道
That's bullshit.

1616
01:33:30,630 --> 01:33:32,260
为什么我们必须做到完美才能被接纳
Why do we have to be perfect to be accepted?

1617
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:33,760
孩子  这就是我们的人生
Boy, that's our life!

1618
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,510
不  你只是太渴望得到认可
No, you're so desperate for approval

1619
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:37,180
为此你不惜牺牲自己人
that you'll eat your own just to get it.

1620
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:39,020
-谁的认可  -你觉得呢
- Whose approval? - Who do you think?

1621
01:33:40,310 --> 01:33:43,730
每一个让你感到身为黑人不够好的人
Everyone who made you feel like being black wasn't good enough.

1622
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,440
但我不需要他们的认可
But I don't need their approval.

1623
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:49,030
我不会为了让别人好受
I'm not going to be somebody's symbol

1624
01:33:49,030 --> 01:33:50,490
就化为一个象征
just to make them feel better.

1625
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:53,570
你还是不明白
You still don't get it.

1626
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:55,240
你不明白
You don't get it.

1627
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:58,740
这不仅仅关乎你我
It's not just about you and it's not about me.

1628
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:02,460
美国把你放在盒子里
America put you in a box.

1629
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:06,500
里面狭小肮脏  你动弹不得
And it's tight and it's dirty and you can't move.

1630
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:08,920
但现实就是这样
But guess what? Too bad.

1631
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:12,720
不管你愿不愿意  我们都在一个盒子里
We're all in there together, whether you like it or not.

1632
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:18,930
而盒子里的光是有限的  卢斯
And only so much light gets in that box, Luce.

1633
01:34:19,930 --> 01:34:22,730
有人能照到  有人照不到
Some people get it, and some people don't.

1634
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:25,230
但谁能照到不是由你决定的
But it's not on you to decide who gets it and who doesn't.

1635
01:34:25,230 --> 01:34:27,530
你说得太对了  是你
You're damn right it's on you!

1636
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:30,530
是你
It's on you.

1637
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:36,910
毕竟  你忙着制造不在场证明的时候
After all, who did you use to do your little errands

1638
01:34:36,910 --> 01:34:39,750
你找了谁帮你搞小动作呢
while you were busy establishing alibis?

1639
01:34:45,790 --> 01:34:47,420
这不是一回事
It's not the same thing.

1640
01:34:50,050 --> 01:34:51,920
你还有很多要学的  小伙子
You got a lot to learn, little man.

1641
01:34:53,630 --> 01:34:57,760
现在你给我滚出去
Now you get the fuck out of my house.

1642
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,180
滚出去
Get out of my house!

1643
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:06,210
见鬼  见鬼
Shit! Shit!

1644
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:06,200
你在藏圣诞礼物吗
Are you hiding Christmas presents?

1645
01:40:09,490 --> 01:40:12,040
你以前就是把我的圣诞礼物藏在那里的
That's where you used to hide my Christmas presents.

1646
01:40:15,580 --> 01:40:17,620
你每次都很惊讶
You were always so surprised.

1647
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:21,340
我很擅长表现得惊讶
I'm good at acting surprised.

1648
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:39,730
给你
Here.

1649
01:41:12,090 --> 01:41:13,470
还记得丹尼斯吗
Remember Dennis?

1650
01:41:14,310 --> 01:41:15,060
记得
Yeah.

1651
01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:19,980
我当然记得丹尼斯
Of course I remember Dennis.

1652
01:41:23,230 --> 01:41:25,230
我想我们可以再试一次
I thought we could try again.

1653
01:41:31,660 --> 01:41:32,660
谢谢
Thanks...

1654
01:41:35,330 --> 01:41:36,080
妈妈

1655
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:46,130
你的前途一片光明
You have your whole future ahead of you.

1656
01:41:47,630 --> 01:41:49,300
充满可能性
Full of potential.

1657
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:53,470
希望你是对的
Hope you're right.

1658
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:56,310
我确定我是对的  亲爱的
I know I'm right, honey.

1659
01:41:58,680 --> 01:41:59,520
我确定
I know.

1660
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:35,840
{\an8}文化月集会

1661
01:42:35,850 --> 01:42:37,100
大家好
Hi, everyone.

1662
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:41,230
我想感谢陶森校长给我这个机会
I want thank Principal Towson for giving me this opportunity.

1663
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:45,560
能在此向你们讲述我的故事对我来说意义重大
It means a lot to be able to talk with each of you about my story,

1664
01:42:45,650 --> 01:42:47,690
有人说我的故事很独特
which I'm told is pretty unique,

1665
01:42:47,690 --> 01:42:50,190
但我还是觉得自己很普通
even though I still feel pretty regular.

1666
01:42:51,940 --> 01:42:56,450
我很幸运  有两个了不起的父母
I'm lucky enough to have two amazing parents

1667
01:42:56,910 --> 01:42:58,030
他们在我七岁的时候
who when they saw my picture

1668
01:42:58,030 --> 01:43:00,330
看到我的照片没有被吓到
at seven years old weren't scared.

1669
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:02,750
或者他们被吓到了  不过掩藏的很好
Or if they were they did a good job of hiding it

1670
01:43:02,750 --> 01:43:04,960
因为养育我长大的父母
because the parents I grew up with

1671
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,340
心中只有爱和勇气
were nothing but loving and brave.

1672
01:43:10,130 --> 01:43:13,260
我来到美国
I came here to America,

1673
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,430
来到这所学校
to this school,

1674
01:43:16,300 --> 01:43:18,060
然后找到了自我
and I found myself.

1675
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:21,890
第一次见到我母亲的时候
When I first met my mother,

1676
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:23,890
她不会念我的名字
she couldn't pronounce my name.

1677
01:43:24,770 --> 01:43:26,440
她一遍又一遍的尝试
She tried over and over

1678
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:28,690
想找准音节的重音
to get the emphasis on the syllables correct,

1679
01:43:28,690 --> 01:43:30,190
但她就是不会念
but she just couldn't.

1680
01:43:30,190 --> 01:43:33,780
所以我父亲提议给我改名
So my father suggested that they rename me.

1681
01:43:34,610 --> 01:43:38,410
他们选了卢斯这个名字  含义是光
They picked Luce, which means light.

1682
01:43:39,030 --> 01:43:40,700
因为我妈妈总是说
Because my mom always said that

1683
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:43,410
有一小束光在我体内照耀
there was a little beam of light shone inside me.

1684
01:43:43,580 --> 01:43:45,120
要是那束光驱散
If only they could sweep the darkness

1685
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:47,250
前七年的黑暗就好了
of those first seven years away.

1686
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:50,170
我在考虑今晚演讲的内容时
I thought of that as I was figuring out

1687
01:43:50,170 --> 01:43:52,380
想到了这件事
what to say to you all tonight.

1688
01:43:54,210 --> 01:43:58,890
我意识到身为美国人我是多么幸运
And I realized how lucky I am to be an American.

1689
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:04,270
因为在这里我有重新开始的机会
Because here I got the chance to start over.

1690
01:44:05,430 --> 01:44:06,980
在这里我们可以做自己
Here we get to be who we are

1691
01:44:06,980 --> 01:44:09,770
虽有缺点仍被接纳
and still be accepted despite our flaws.

1692
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,610
在这里我们可以讲述自己的故事
Here we get to tell our own story.

1693
01:44:15,150 --> 01:44:16,240
而这是我的故事
This is mine.

1694
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:20,950
他们第一次告诉我我的新名字的时候
When they first told me my new name,

1695
01:44:20,950 --> 01:44:22,280
我才刚开始学英语
I was still just learning English,

1696
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:24,990
于是我把它当成了"loose"这个词
so I took it to be the word "loose,"

1697
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,960
Loose
L-o-o-s-e,

1698
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:29,420
定义是可拆卸的
which is defined as something detachable,

1699
01:44:29,420 --> 01:44:32,500
不易固定的东西
not easily fixed in place, or pinned down...

1700
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:37,320
{\pos(192,200.8)}卢斯
