00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,290
这是我的世界
This is my world.

7
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,910
恶劣  嵯峨  寒冷
Harsh, jagged, freezing.

8
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,210
不得不说
And I gotta say,

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,700
这简直太棒了
it's awesome!

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,580
这里什么都有
It's got everything.

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,460
冰  岩石  冰  雪  冰  有好多冰
Ice, rocks, ice, snow, ice. It's got a lot of ice.

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,840
很多现代化设施
Plenty of modern amenities.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,300
最棒的是  大家都很快乐
And the best part, everyone's happy.

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,010
那是因为我们的世界是建立在石头之上的
That's because our world is built on a foundation of stones.

15
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,890
不是那些  是这些
Not those. These.

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,340
我们有书写在石头上的律法
See, we have these laws that are written in stone.

17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,060
真正的书写在石头上
Literally, written in stone!

18
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,110
由守石人解释并执行
Interpreted and enforced by the Stonekeeper.

19
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,780
这些石头是保护我们安全的
The stones are here to protect us and keep us safe.

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,310
它们基本能告诉我们需要知道的一切
They pretty much tell us everything that we need to know.

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,480
重要的事  比如世界是如何创造的
Important stuff, like how the world was created

22
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,790
我们都是从伟大的天之牦牛屁股上掉下来的
when we all fell from the butt of the great sky yak

23
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,030
以及我们的世界是一座岛
and how our world is an island

24
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,580
它漂浮在无尽云彩组成的海上
that floats on a sea of endless clouds,

25
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,880
倚靠在大山地猛犸象的背上
resting on the backs of the great mountain mammoths.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,970
我们得喂猛犸象吃冰  这样它们才不会过热
And how we have to feed ice to the mammoths, so they don't overheat

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,710
否则它们会死的
'cause if they did, they would die,

28
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,470
那样我们就会都掉进无尽的虚无
and we would all fall into the great nothing.

29
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,340
这里什么都没有
There's nothing down here!

30
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,100
但我最喜欢的石头
But my favorite stone of all

31
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,390
上面写着必须敲响铜锣
is the one that says the gong must be rung

32
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,840
叫醒发光的大蜗牛
to wake the great glowing snail

33
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,480
让它爬过天空  给村子带来光明
so it can crawl across the sky and bring light to the village.

34
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,600
我超爱那个
I love that one.

35
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,150
那可能是最重要的工作了
It might be the most important job of all.

36
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,360
不吹不擂  那份工作刚好属于我爸爸
And, humble brag, that job belongs to my dad.

37
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,110
他向这份工作倾注了他的激情  奉献
He does it with passion, commitment

38
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,290
还有他强健的助手的帮助...
and the help of his able-bodied assistant...

39
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,170
起来了  米果  该敲锣了
Up and at them, Migo! Time to ring the gong.

40
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,160
就是我
...me.

41
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,540
好嘞
Yes!

42
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,710
可以说  我在学习操作绳子
I guess you could say I'm learning the ropes

43
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,330
轮子
and the wheel

44
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,010
还有曲轴
and the crank

45
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,270
如果我爸爸不敲锣  我们就都处在黑暗中了
because if my dad didn't ring the gong, we'd all be in the dark.

46
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,430
发射
Launch!

47
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,850
这个活儿不容易
It isn't easy.

48
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,730
它需要技巧  胆量和决心
It requires skill, rock-solid nerves,

49
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,730
还有肩膀上的一个结实的脑袋
and a good, strong head on your shoulders...

50
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,070
因为真的没有其它办法可以敲锣了
...because there's literally no other way to ring a gong.

51
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,270
搞定
Oh, yeah.

52
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,450
这让我爸爸的生活有了重大意义
It gives my dad a great sense of purpose.

53
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,820
我说了  这是个重要的工作
Like I said, it's an important job,

54
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,000
终有一天  这个工作会传给我
a job that'll one day be mine.

55
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,490
干得漂亮
Whoa-hem Good one, Dam!

56
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,000
我等不及看到
And I can't wait for the day

57
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,660
我叫醒村子那天的到来了
that it's me who gets to wake the village.

58
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,170
*看下面的每个人*
*Look at everybody there below*

59
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,670
*那是我热爱并熟悉的雪人*
*All the yetis that I love and know*

60
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,840
*他们在醒来看这美好的早上*
*And they're waking up to see this awesome morning*

61
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,080
*他们都面带微笑*
*They've all got a smile*

62
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,220
*这是我爱这的另一个原因*
*on their face. Another reason I love this place*

63
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,100
*这里永远充满生机和乐趣*
*'Cause it's always full of life and never boring*

64
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,400
*看看我们周围*
*Look all around us*

65
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,150
*满是岩石和冰雪*
*It's all rock and ice and snow*

66
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,030
*滴水成冰地寒冷*
*Frigid and freezing*

67
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,980
*我知道  这样真美妙*
*Yeah, it's pretty great, I know*

68
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,450
*这是崭新的一天*
*And hey, hey. It's another day*

69
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,410
*正如每一天*
*Like every other*

70
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,740
*我什么都不想改变*
*I don't wanna change a thing*

71
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,330
*一点都不想改变*
*Not one little thing*

72
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,710
*石头说什么我就做什么*
*I mean, because I do what the stones say*

73
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,790
*我做得还不错*
*And I'm doing okay*

74
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,760
*有什么比这更好  这就是最好*
*What could be better than this? It is what it is*

75
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,300
*这就是完美*
*It is perfection*

76
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,650
*看大家各司其职  而且心情愉快*
*Look at everybody do their part and they do it with a happy heart*

77
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,940
*这让大家的生活都有了更大的意义*
*And it gives them all a sense of greater purpose*

78
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,090
*这就是*
*Well, that's the way that*

79
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,580
*我想要的生活  我要让大家都以我为傲*
*I wanna be I wanna make them all proud of me*

80
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,290
*做一个稳重的雪人  服务人民*
*Just be a steady yeti at their service*

81
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,200
你们真的相信猛犸象在支撑着我们吗
Do you seriously believe mammoths are holding us up?

82
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,250
-嗯  -什么在支撑着猛犸象
- Mmm-hmm. - What's holding up the mammoths?

83
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,620
听我来说  下面全都是猛犸象
Uh, hello. It's just mammoths all the way down.

84
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,080
别听他们的  他们在质疑石律
Don't listen to them. They're questioning the stones.

85
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,370
我们可不能质疑石律  对吧
And we don't do that. Okay?

86
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,090
*如果有问题  让你迷惑不解*
*If there's a question causing you to go astray*

87
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,010
*埋在心里  等你忘记就好了*
*Just stuff it down inside until it goes away*

88
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,680
-知道吗  -米果呢
- Got it? - Where's Migo?

89
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,470
米果  你永远不会成为敲锣人...
Migo, you will never be the gong ringer...

90
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,480
慢着  什么
Wait, what?

91
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,980
如果你不练习的话
...if you don't practice.

92
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,560
他要给你属于你自己的头盔
He's giving you your own helmet.

93
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,110
我搞砸了惊喜  抱歉  爸爸
Oh, I blew the surprise! Sorry, Dad.

94
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,400
属于我的头盔  难道今天就是注定的那一天
My own helmet? You mean today's the day?

95
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,860
恭喜你  米果
Congratulations, Migo.

96
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,110
今天是大日子啊  儿子
Big day, son!

97
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,370
各位  我要练习敲锣了
Hey, everyone, I get to do a practice gong!

98
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,620
*大家一起唱*
*And now we all say*

99
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,420
*这是崭新的一天*
*Hey, hey It's another day*

100
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,250
*正如每一天*
*Like every other*

101
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,410

102
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,250

103
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,760

*I mean because we like living this way*

104
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,920

*It is perfection*

117
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,490
敲锣练习
Practice gong!

118
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,330
敲锣练习
Practice gong!

119
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,280
-敲锣练习  -敲锣练习
- Practice gong! - Practice gong!

120
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,040
-敲锣练习  -敲锣练习
- Practice gong! - Practice gong!

121
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,050
-敲锣练习  -敲锣练习
- Practice gong! - Practice gong!

122
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,500
-准备好了吗  -早就好了
- You ready? - Beyond ready!

123
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,130
真是迫不及待真正尝试一番了
Can't wait till this is my actual job!

124
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,550
对  马上你就要继承伟大的家族传统了
Yup. Soon you will join a long line of family greats.

125
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,430
平头叔叔  凹头爷爷
Uncle Flathead, Grandpa Smashhead,

126
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,140
架子头太爷爷  猛头婶婶  浆糊脑子舅舅
Great Grandpa Shelf head, Aunt Crushedhead, Uncle Mushbrain,

127
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,270
梆梆阿姨  没脖子南多  蹲蹲表哥
Aunt Bam Bam, No-neck Nando, Cousin Squatly,

128
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,150
道格和他的蠢木槌理论
Doug and his dumb mallet theory.

129
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,060
还是不提他了
We don't talk about him.

130
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,140
还有你妈妈
And your mom.

131
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,980
她要是在这里教你就好了
Wish she was here to teach you.

132
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,270
-你就教得很好  爸爸  -谢谢  儿子
- You're doing great, Dad. - Thanks, son.

133
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,530
好了  首先  检查风向
Okay, first, check your wind.

134
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,830
一点风就能把你吹得偏离正轨
Doesn't take much to blow you off course.

135
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:05,990
风向  没问题
Wind, check.

136
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,150
很好  下面是瞄准目标
Good. Now, true your aim.

137
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,700
如果不瞄准  那肯定不会成功
You'll never succeed if your aim isn't true.

138
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,460
目标  没问题
Aim, check!

139
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,340
好极了  下面的很重要
Great! Now, this is important.

140
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,460
-即使你知道会很疼...  -嗯
- Even though you know it's gonna hurt... - Mmm-hmm.

141
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,510
你也得用脑袋径直撞上去
...you gotta hit it head-on.

142
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,210
-真的很疼吗  -只有头两年吧
- Does it really hurt? - Only for the first year or two.

143
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,470
好吧  你以前是不是跟我一样高
Hmm. Did you actually used to be my height?

144
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,260
不是  我比你高多了
Nope, I was much taller.

145
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,060
我花了好多年才练成这样
Took me years to achieve this.

146
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,880
一天都没错过
Never missed a day!

147
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,550
-没错  -好
- Oh, yeah! - Cool!

148
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
-准备好了吗  -好了
- Ready? - Ready.

149
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,100
说出那个词吧  儿子
Say the word, son.

150
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,230
发射
Launch!

151
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,940
我告诉过你得抬起脚来吗
Uh, did I mention you gotta keep your feet up?

152
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,570
-没有  -你得把脚抬起来
- No. - You gotta keep your feet up.

153
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,940
知道了
Check.

154
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,570
好了  发射
Okay. Launch!

155
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,450
发射
Launch!

156
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,830
发射
Launch!

157
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,700
真没想到会这样
Never seen that happen.

158
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,490
发射
Launch!

159
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,750
好样的  米果
Attaboy, Migo!

160
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,430
咪琪
Meechee.

161
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,010
米果  瞄准目标
Migo, true your aim!

162
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,520
瞄准目标
True your aim!

163
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,390
-糟糕  -糟了
- Oh, no. - Uh-oh!

164
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,900
我的头盔  我的...
My helmet! Where's my...

165
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,000
那是什么
What is that?

166
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,340
不好  什么情况
Hey, hey! What?

167
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,020
快走开  走开
Go! Get away!

168
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,190
停  一点都不好玩
Stop it! Not funny! Aah!

169
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,370
看看你的小脚丫  小脚
Look at your small foot! Small foot.

170
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,840
小脚怪  小脚怪  天啊  是个小脚怪
Smallfoot. Smallfoot! Oh, my gosh, it's a smallfoot!

171
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,550
不  不  回来
Oh, no! No. Come back!

172
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,270
苍天啊
Oh, holy wowness!

173
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,970
各位  快来看
Everyone! You gotta see this!

174
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,560
过来  过来  过来
Come here! Come here! Come here!

175
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,490
各位
Hey, everyone!

176
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,070
-听我说  各位  -米果
- Listen, listen! Everyone! - Hey, Migo.

177
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,280
-你没敲到锣  -我知道
- You missed the gong. - I know.

178
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,660
-你没敲到锣  米果  -我知道
- You missed the gong, Migo. - I know.

179
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,450
快来  围过来  围过来  好
Come here. Gather round, gather round. Okay.

180
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,330
我看到一一个小脚怪
I saw a smallfoot!

181
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,460
-什么  -什么
- What? - What?

182
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,370
-什么  -什么
- What? - What?

183
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,580
-什么  -什么
- What? - What?

184
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,380
-什么  -什么
- What? - What?

185
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,090
-什么  -好疼
- What? - Ow!

186
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,210
不信你们自己来看  快来
Just come here and see for yourself! Let's go! Come on!

187
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,720
我们走
Everyone, let's go!

188
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,300
他疯了
He's crazy!

189
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,010
爸爸
Dad!

190
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,450
那东西从天空中掉下来
It came at me from the sky.

191
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,870
是个闪闪发光的会飞的硬东西
It was like some sort of hard, shiny flying thing!

192
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,330
它发出的声音像...
It made a sound like...

193
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,830
就是此时它到了我跟前
And that's when it scooped me up!

194
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,250
看  就在这里
Look. It's right this way.

195
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,250
不  但是...
NO! But...

196
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,470
不不不
No! No, no! No!

197
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,300
本来就在这里的
It was right here!

198
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,060
我发誓  那个闪闪发光会飞的东西
I swear! This shiny, flying thing.

199
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,940
那个小脚怪就是从那里面射出来的
That's what the smallfoot shot out of.

200
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,310
咻的一下
It was like, poof!

201
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,480
然后有个像皮肤的大东西在它上面  就好像...
And then this big skin thing landed on top of it. It was like...

202
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,730
然后它看到了我  唱出了最奇怪最美妙的歌
And then it saw me, and it sang the most strange, beautiful song.

203
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,700
就这样...
It was like...

204
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,530
更像是这样...
Almost, it was more like...

205
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,240
说不定它还在附近
Oh, it's probably still around here somewhere.

206
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,490
我们找找吧  大家一起来
Let's look for it. Come on, everyone!

207
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,410
还在附近
Still around here?

208
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,500
-有可能在村子里  -有可能在我家里
- It could be in the village! - It could be at my house!

209
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,910
保护孩子们
Get the children!

210
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,670
米果疯了
Migo's gone crazy!

211
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,000
-他说看到了一个小脚怪  -可能吗
- He said he saw a smallfoot! - Is that possible?

212
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,170
你在这里
Oh, there you are!

213
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,330
-是真的吗  -等等  大家别慌
- Is it real? - Wait! Hold on! Everyone!

214
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,050
那东西看起来没那么可怕  其实还有点可爱
It didn't seem all that scary! It was kind of cute!

215
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,350
大家给我爸爸让路
Everyone, make way for my dad!

216
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,480
我是说守石人  抱歉  爸爸
Uh, I mean, the Stonekeeper. Sorry, Dad.

217
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,730
是守石人  快点  索普  你搞砸了
I mean, Stonekeeper. Come on, Thorp. You blew it.

218
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,070
大家早上好  你好吗
Good morning, everyone! Hey, how are you?

219
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,230
-天啊  -是因为米果没敲到锣吗
- Oh, boy. - Is this about Migo missing the gong?

220
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,190
守石人  他看到了一个小脚怪
Stonekeeper, he saw a smallfoot!

221
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,350
他说有可能还在附近
He said it might still be out there!

222
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,240
他说那是从天上掉下来的
He said it fell from the sky!

223
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,990
盖瑞  冷静  你知道自己不冷静会是什么样
Garry, calm down. You know how you get.

224
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,490
好吧  我尽量  不过我好怕
Okay, I'll try, but I'm just so scared.

225
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,230
我知道米果的小"故事"
Now, I know Migo has gotten

226
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,870
让大家都很紧张
you all very anxious with his little "Story,"

227
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,130
但大家不用害怕  因为那不是真的
but there's nothing to fear because it isn't true.

228
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,160
但我亲眼看到了
But I saw one!

229
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,670
不  你没有
No, you didn't.

230
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,710
我看到了
I did.

231
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,840
你不可能看到  因为根本不存在
You can't have seen it because it doesn't exist.

232
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,500
我知道  因为石律说没有小脚怪这种东西
I know. I know. Because the stone says there's no such thing as a smallfoot.

233
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,090
没错  说得一清二楚
Yeah, right there, clear as day.

234
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,920
我知道  但它就出现在了我面前
I know, but it was right there in front of me!

235
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,550
米果
Hey, Migo!

236
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,430
你怎么知道那是个小脚怪
How do you know it was a smallfoot?

237
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,850
因为它有个小脚
Because it had a small foot.

238
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,560
爸爸
Uh, Dad?

239
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,770
爸爸  显然他看到了什么东西
Daddy, clearly, he saw something.

240
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,280
我没有否认他看到了东西
Oh, I'm not denying he saw something.

241
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,120
极有可能他滑倒了
Most likely, he slipped,

242
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,070
撞到了头  撞傻了  看到了一头牦牛
hit his head, got confused, and saw a yak.

243
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,570
这下我明白了
Okay, I get it now.

244
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,540
如果米果说他看到了一个小脚怪
Because if Migo is saying he saw a smallfoot,

245
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,490
那他就是说石律是错的
then he's saying a stone is wrong.

246
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,540
你是这个意思吗  米果  石律是错的
Is that what you're saying, Migo? That a stone is wrong?

247
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,620
不  他不是那个意思
Nope! He is not saying that!

248
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,420
我来跟他谈谈  孩子嘛
Let me talk to him. Kids, right?

249
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,840
米果  你在干什么
Migo, what are you doing?

250
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,590
在全村人面前和守石人作对
Challenging the Stonekeeper in front of the whole village?

251
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,970
爸爸  你一直跟我说的那条建议是什么来着
Dad, what's the piece of advice you're always giving me?

252
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,130
"照别人说的做"
"Do what you're told."

253
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,720
-另一条  -"融入大家"
- The other one. - "Blend in."

254
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,680
另一条
The other one.

255
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,390
"听石律的话"  "做大家的一份子"
"Follow the stones." "Be a cog."

256
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,640
"做好自己的事"  "绝不对守石人提出异议"
"Do your part." "Never disagree with the Stonekeeper."

257
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:51,930
"永远坚持真理"
"Always be true!"

258
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,020
我那说的是敲锣  不是挑战石律
That was about hitting a gong. Not challenging a stone.

259
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,950
因为如果有悖于石律  那肯定是错的
'Cause if it goes against a stone, it can't be true!

260
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,400
可是如果我说我没看到小脚怪
But if I say I didn't see a smallfoot,

261
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,860
那我就是在说谎
then I'm lying.

262
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,990
米果
Migo,

263
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,660
你不是想当下一个敲锣人吗
I thought you wanted to be the next gong ringer.

264
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,490
是的
I do.

265
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,620
那你还说石律是错的吗
Then are you still saying a stone is wrong?

266
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,790
如果说我看到了一个小脚怪
If saying I saw a smallfoot

267
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,290
意味着石律是错的  那确实是这样
means that a stone is wrong, then I guess I am.

268
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,640
米果啊
Oh, Migo.

269
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,930
虽然这么说让我很心痛  真的
It pains me to say this. It truly does.

270
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,220
但你让我别无选择
But you leave me no choice.

271
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,270
违背石律是大不敬
Disobeying the stones is a grave offense.

272
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,360
从今天起  你将被驱逐出村子
From this day forward, you will be banished from the village!

273
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,900
-什么  -直到你准备好
- What? - Until you are ready

274
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,780
站在我们所有人面前
to stand before us all

275
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,160
告诉我们真相
and tell us the truth.

276
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,540
我说的就是真的
I am telling the truth.

277
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,540
就这样  各位  回去工作
That's all, everyone. Back to work.

278
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,250
继续过好完美的一天
Let's make it another perfect day.

279
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,380
守石人  拜托
Stonekeeper, please.

280
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,710
那是我儿子
That's my son.

281
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,470
给他点时间让他单独思考一下
Just give him a little time alone out there to think.

282
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,250
他会恢复理智的
He'll come to his senses.

283
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,900
-斯努兹  -喂
- Sooze. - Hey!

284
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,270
你被驱逐了  记得吗
You're banished, remember?

285
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,060
-你知道那是什么意思  -是的 索普
- You know what that means. - Yes, Thorp.

286
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,820
是吗  是什么意思
You do? What does it mean?

287
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,420
-索普  -来了
- Thorp! - Coming!

288
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,360
我们回头再聊
We'll circle back.

289
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,230
几乎没什么能在喜马拉雅山严酷寒冷的环境下生存
Few can survive the cold, brutal environment of the Himalayas,

290
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,320
但这种独特的生物可以
but this ingenious creature defies the odds.

291
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,700
那就是稀有的喜马拉雅跳蛛
The rare Himalayan jumping spider!

292
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,910
尽在本周《珀西・帕特森的野生动物》
This week on Percy Patterson's Wildlife!

293
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,370
这种敏捷的蜘蛛一次可产一千个卵
This agile arachnid can lay 1,000 eggs at a time

294
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,460
而且可以跳50英尺高
and can jump 50 feet into the air!

295
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,840
它肯定要好好准备一番
There's an element of mental preparation, I'm sure.

296
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,680
它在袭击我  糟了
It's attacking! Oh, no!

297
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,640
它的毒液要进入我的大脑了
The venom! It's going to my brain!

298
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,970
我的脸麻了
I can't feel my face.

299
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,430
继续拍  继续拍
Keep rolling. Keep rolling.

300
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,760
卡
Cut!

301
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,270
我要在你眼前融化了
I'm melting before your eyes.

302
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,730
-珀西  -我们加点特效上去
- Percy! - And we'll add an effect.

303
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,530
融化  融化  融化
Melting, melting, melting.

304
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,070
-珀西  -这段剪掉
- Percy! - Cut this bit out.

305
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,610
我要闭上一只眼
I'm gonna shut one of my eyes.

306
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,030
我的眼睛啊  好疼
Hey, my eye! My eye!

307
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,030
卡  你在干什么
Cut! What are you doing?

308
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,280
我在拯救我们的节目
I'm saving our show.

309
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,080
我被袭击会有很多人看的
Me being attacked would get huge ratings!

310
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,040
我们的节目是教育启发性节目
Our show is educational and enlightening!

311
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,490
要激起大家
A show that promotes respect

312
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,460
对地球上其它生物的尊重
for our fellow creatures on this planet.

313
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,710
我知道  所以才没人看
I know. That's why no one's watching.

314
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,750
所以我才不看
That's why I don't watch.

315
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,380
布兰达  除我们的蜘蛛跳部分外的桥段都很无聊
Look, Brenda, unless our spiderjumps, it's boring.

316
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,220
它跳起来了
Hey, it jumped!

317
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,720
真令人激动  拍下来了吗
Now, that was exciting. Did we film that?

318
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,300
当然没有了  好吧  那我过来
No, of course not. All right, I'll just have to go over here

319
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,720
采访一块树皮好了
and interview a piece of bark, shall I?

320
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,110
-雪怪  -什么
- Yeti. - What?

321
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,980
飞机坠毁在雪里
Plane crashed in the snow.

322
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,150
尖牙  利爪  庞然大物
Teeth, claws, huge!

323
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,280
我看到了一只雪怪
I saw a yeti!

324
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,700
你说雪怪
Yeti, you say?

325
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,240
我请你喝一杯  你给我详细说说
Let me buy you a drink, and you can tell me all about it.

326
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,830
-你相信我  对吧  -当然了
- You believe me, right? - Of course, I believe you!

327
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,580
真的吗  你可以相信我 我是飞行员
You do? You can trust me. I fly planes!

328
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,920
米果
Migo.

329
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,590
-是谁  -米果
- Who's there? - Migo.

330
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,390
是谁
Hello?

331
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,350
小脚怪  是你吗
Smallfoot? Is that you?

332
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,850
我可能是疯了  难怪没人相信我
Maybe you are going crazy. No wonder no one believes you.

333
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,930
我们相信你
We believe you.

334
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,810
你好
Hi.

335
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,360
米果
Migo.

336
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,780
-福林  -什么
- Fleem! - What?

337
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,610
伙计们
Heh. You guys.

338
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,240
只有我觉得他发现是我们后很失望吗
Is it just me, or does he look disappointed that it's us?

339
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,870
你想要所见之物的证据吗
You want proof that you saw what you saw?

340
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,660
-对  -我们有证据
- Yeah. - We got proof.

341
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,330
那你们相信我看到一个...
So, you believe me that I saw a...

342
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,330
一个小...
A small...

343
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,960
-他们在听  -谁
- They're listening. - Who?

344
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,660
压迫的隔墙之耳
The ears of oppression.

345
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,550
-对  -这...
- Yeah. - Uh...

346
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,460
这边来  隐匿模式
This way, stealth mode.

347
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,100
今天还能再怪一点吗
Could this day get any more bizarre?

348
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,880
太近了吗
Is this too close?

349
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,020
你知道你现在是什么吗
You know what you are now?

350
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,550
我们的人
One of us.

351
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,970
等等
Uh. Hey, wait up!

352
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,980
我们的人  我们的人  我们的人
One of us! One of us! One of us!

353
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,440
别告诉关吉是我说的  不过他有点多疑
Now, don't tell Gwangi I said this, but he's a bit paranoid.

354
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,690
福林  你是在说我吗
Fleem, are you talking about me?

355
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,110
明白我的意思吗
Do you see what I mean?

356
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,070
蔻卡跟石头说话  好像它们听得见一样
Kolka talks to rocks like they can hear her.

357
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,120
福林  嘘
Fleem! Shh!

358
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,450
他们说我讨厌  烦人  不消停
I've been told I'm pesky, annoying, and a real pain,

359
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,330
但有谁听妈妈的话啊  对吧
but, hey, who listens to their mom, right?

360
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,830
你们要带我去哪里
Where are you taking me?

361
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,960
我们的社长要求会面
Our leader requests a meeting.

362
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,750
慢着  你们有社长  是谁
Wait. You have a leader? Who?

363
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,590
到时候你就知道了
You'll see.

364
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,970
天啊
Oh, boy.

365
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,310
他来了
He's here.

366
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,530
-咪琪  -欢迎
- Meechee? - Welcome!

367
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,860
很高兴你来了
I'm really glad you're here.

368
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,690
什么
What?

369
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,360
这是什么地方
What is this place, exactly?

370
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,540
SES的秘密总部
The secret headquarters of the S.E.S.

371
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,990
"爱谁爱死"
The Esias?

372
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,870
不是不是  是三个字母  SES
No, no, no. It's three letters. Like S-E-S.

373
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,330
"小脚怪存在  傻逼"的英文缩写
Stands for "Smallfoot Exists, Suckas!"

374
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,510
福林  是"小脚怪论证社团"的英文缩写
Fleem, it's "Smallfoot Evidentiary Society."

375
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,760
我取的名字更好玩  但是...
I mean, my name's got a lot more pizzazz, but...

376
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,800
慢着  这是个小脚怪社
Wait. You're, like, a smallfoot club?

377
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,000
等等  你是社长
And hold on. You're the leader?

378
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,090
但你是守石人的女儿
But you're the Stonekeeper's daughter.

379
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,420
我爱我父亲
Look, I love my father,

380
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,130
但他并不是大家所说的"态度开明"
but he isn't exactly what you would call "Open to new ideas."

381
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,640
因为问题带来知识
Because questions lead to knowledge.

382
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,560
而知识就是力量
And knowledge is power.

383
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,140
所以说你们不止相信有小脚怪
So you don't just believe in the smallfoot.

384
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,020
你们还在寻找
You've been looking for one.

385
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,940
对  你看到那些"X"了吗
Yes. You see all the X's?

386
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,190
多年来我们找遍了整座山  就是想找一个
We have searched the entire mountain for years trying to find one.

387
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,610
你们为什么找"X"
Why are you looking for X's?

388
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,620
我们不是找"X"  而是找小脚怪
We're not looking for X's. We're looking for the smallfoot.

389
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,990
而你看到过一个
And you have seen one.

390
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,700
但我无法证实
But I can't prove it.

391
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,410
这就用到我们了
That is where we come in.

392
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,580
关吉  给他看证据
Gwangi, show him the evidence.

393
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,870
这就是你的证据
Here's your proof.

394
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,590
首先是小脚怪的皮毛
First item, smallfoot pelt.

395
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,010
这一证据证明它每年都会掉毛
Evidence suggests it sheds its skin annually.

396
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,810
其次是小脚怪角  我们觉得它只有一个角
Second item, smallfoot horn. We believe it only has one.

397
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,680
然后是这个
And then there's this.

398
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,600
无形智慧卷轴
The scroll of invisible wisdom.

399
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,980
想象一下他们放在这里的好东西
Just imagine the amazing stuff they put on here.

400
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,730
我觉得这都是胡扯
A bunch of crap, if you ask me.

401
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,820
这什么都证明不了
This proves nothing!

402
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,110
给他看最后一样
Show him the last one.

403
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,870
这是我发现的第一件证据
It's the first piece I ever found.

404
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,740
也是这一切的开始
It's the thing that started all of this.

405
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,860
那是触发器  他想起来了
That was a trigger. He's triggered!

406
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,410
你有小脚
Look at your small foot.

407
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,120
-你确实看到了  -它去哪里了
- You did see one. - Where did it go?

408
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,330
-我不知道  -努力想
- I don't know! - Think!

409
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,290
-到记忆深处  -扇他
- Reach into your memory! - Slap him!

410
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,330
不  它乘风飞过了云端
No! It got whisked away on the wind, over the clouds!

411
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,590
往哪飞了  往上  往一边  哪里
Which way? Up? Sideways? Where?

412
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,260
往下
Down!

413
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,300
你是说往下吗
Did you say down?

414
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,630
-扇他  -福林
- Slap him! - Fleem!

415
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,260
往下  当然了
Down! Of course!

416
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,310
我一直觉得
You know, I have always thought

417
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,970
山浮着是很奇怪的事
it was weird that a mountain floats

418
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,150
因为显然有无形的力量在把我们往下拉
when there's obviously some invisible force pulling us downward

419
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,820
让我们身边的一切不飘到空中去
and keeping everything around us from drifting off into the sky.

420
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,650
当然了  这只是理论
Of course, this is just a theory.

421
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,860
但这就是我们在这上面找不到的小脚怪原因
But that's why we haven't found one up here.

422
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,110
因为它是在下面这里
Because it's down here,

423
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,280
在云下面
below the clouds.

424
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,950
如果你要证据  我们就需要去那里
And if you want proof, that's where we need to go.

425
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,080
到虚无中去
In the nothing?

426
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,420
你们疯了
You're crazy.

427
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,660
不许说我疯
Don't call me crazy.

428
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,210
对  不许说一个疯子疯
Yeah. Never call a crazy guy crazy.

429
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,760
你们想知道为什么那叫"虚无"吗
You want to know why it's called the nothing?

430
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,510
因为那里什么都没有
Because there's nothing down there!

431
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,840
你为什么这么认为
Why do you believe that?

432
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,380
因为石律是这么写的
Because it's in the stones.

433
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,640
石律还说没有小脚怪呢
So is the one that says there's no smallfoot.

434
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,810
可你却看到了一个
And yet you saw one.

435
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,390
对  石律为什么要提到不存在的东西
Yeah. Why is there a stone that says something doesn't exist?

436
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,390
那不正证明它其实是存在的吗
Doesn't that just prove that it actually does?

437
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,640
如果一条石律是错的  那其它的也可能是错的
And if one stone is wrong, then others could be as well.

438
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,060
什么  其它石律  你觉得有多少是错的
What? Other stones? How many do you think are wrong?

439
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,650
整条绳子上的
The whole robe.

440
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,700
这一切都太疯狂了  我不参与了
You know what? This whole thing's insane. I'm out.

441
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,030
米果  等等
Migo, wait.

442
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,040
我只想证明我看到了一个小脚怪
Hey, I just wanna prove that I saw a smallfoot

443
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,410
好让我不再被驱逐
so I can get un-banished.

444
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,240
但是你呢  你想
But you, you wanna, what,

445
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,070
推翻我们这个世界的基石吗
tear down everything our world is built on?

446
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,540
重点不是推翻旧思想
It's not just about tearing down old ideas.

447
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,790
而是找到新的
It's about finding new ones.

448
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,040
你跟我来
You know what? Come with me.

449
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,550
*看看周围我们以为的这个世界*
*Take a look around and see the world we think we know*

450
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,640
*仔细看看*
*And then look closer*

451
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,030
*除了眼睛看到的美丽外表  还有更多*
*There's more to life than meets the eye a beauty to behold*

452
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:03,320
*世界比我们知道的大*
*It's all much bigger than we know*

453
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,750
*它只是刚开始在我们面前展开*
*It's only just beginning to unfold*

454
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,040
*让它都展开吧*
*So let it all unfold*

455
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,750
*远远超出你的思想所及*
*Far beyond all reason in your mind*

456
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:21,550
*有个神秘的世界等待你去探寻*
*There's a world mysterious there for you to find*

457
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:26,090
*我们一直都有的问题*
*All these questions that we always had*

458
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:30,720
*我们都很好奇  这没有什么不对*
*All we are is curious. There's nothing wrong with that*

459
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:35,390
*去探寻每一个角落*
*So go 'round every corner*

460
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:39,780
*探索每一天天空*
*Search every part of the sky*

461
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:45,200
*充满惊奇的生活*
*'Cause a life that's full of wonder*

462
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,370
*才是美妙的生活*
*Is a wonderful life*

463
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,470
*表面之下有我们要学习的东西*
*Dig beneath the surface find the lessons there to learn*

464
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,090
*然后深入研究*
*And then dig deeper*

465
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:15,060
*正视你的直觉  不要留一点遗憾*
*Feed your intuition. Don't leave any stone unturned*

466
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:20,600
*寻求真理*
*Be the seeker of the truth*

467
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,660
*响应它的召唤*
*Listen when you hear it calling you*

468
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,660
*你知道它在召唤你*
*You know it's calling you*

469
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,740
*远远超出你的思想所及*
*Far beyond all reason in your mind*

470
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:38,460
*有个神秘的世界等待你去探寻*
*There's a world mysterious there for you to find*

471
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:43,050
*我们一直都有的问题*
*All these questions that we always have*

472
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:47,590
*我们都很好奇  这没有什么不对*
*All we are is curious. There's nothing wrong with that*

473
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,310
*去探寻每一个角落*
*So go 'round every corner*

474
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:56,900
*探索每一天天空*
*Search every part of the sky*

475
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:02,400
*充满惊奇的生活*

476
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,730
*才是美妙的生活*

477
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,830
*才是美妙的生活*
*Is a wonderful life*

478
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,250
*才是美妙的生活*
*Is a wonderful life*

479
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,460
*才是美妙的生活*
*Is a wonderful life*

480
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,340
米果  下面有个世界等着我们
Down there, Migo, a world awaits.

481
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,300
好  我去
Okay, I'll go.

482
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,390
-真的吗  -你有计划吗
- Really? - Do you have a plan?

483
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,100
当然有计划
Of course, we have a plan.

484
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,350
这个计划可能需要再计划一下
Uh, I think the plan might need more planning.

485
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,810
认识你很高兴
It was nice knowing you!

486
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,200
我得调整一下绳子  有点紧了
Hey, I need to readjust the harness. It's a little too tight.

487
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,270
-这绳子应该够长了  -"应该"
- This should be enough rope. - Should be?

488
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,240
我们不知道具体有多深
We don't know exactly how far down it is.

489
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,280
那是我们所有的绳子了
It's also all the rope we have.

490
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,150
好了  要做的话就得快点
Okay, if we're gonna do this, we gotta do it fast.

491
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,160
关吉  告诉他我们的计划
Gwangi, tell him the plan.

492
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,620
-天啊  -听好
- Oh, boy. Oh! - Listen up.

493
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,660
拉一下表示继续往下  两下表示停
Pull once to go lower, twice to stay put,

494
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,250
三下表示上来
three times to come up.

495
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,120
四下表示你到底了
Four pulls means you've reached the bottom

496
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,330
我们可以安全下去
and it's safe for us to come down.

497
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,290
慢着  第二个是什么来着
Wait. What was the second one?

498
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,000
其实根本不重要
Look, it doesn't really matter.

499
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,680
安全词是"神秘生物"
Your safe word is "Mystical creature."

500
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,680
其实那算个短语了
That's more of a phrase, really.

501
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,560
如果你大喊出来  我们会
If you shout it, we'll

502
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,970
停止任务  把你拉上来
abort the mission and pull you right on up.

503
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,680
"救命"如何  我大喊"救命"  简短有力
How aboutjust "Help"? I'll scream, "Help!" Nice and short.

504
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,190
你会做的很棒的
You're gonna do great.

505
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,190
是吗  你真的这么认为
Yeah? You really think so?

506
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,190
开始吧
Let's do this!

507
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,820
米果
Migo!

508
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,980
如果你死了  你的东西能都归我吗
If you die, can I have all your worldly possessions?

509
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,940
-福林  -好吧  抱歉  等你死了
- Fleem! - Right. Sorry, when you die.

510
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,490
看到什么了
What do you see?

511
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:35,700
目前为止只有云  还是云
Uh, so far just seeing cloud, and more cloud.

512
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,450
慢着慢着  那是什么
Wait. Wait. What is that?

513
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,240
-不  -抱歉  是我的手
- Oh, no! - Sorry, that was just my hand.

514
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,580
好吧
Okay.

515
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,460
还是云  更多的云
Still clouds. More clouds.

516
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,000
-糟了  -云还真多啊
- Uh... - Man, there's a lot of clouds.

517
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,500
-咪琪  是你吗  -索普来了
- Meechee, you out here? - Thorp!

518
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,420
怎么了
H-Oh? Why "h-oh"?

519
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,840
糟糕  神秘生物
Uh-oh. Mystical creature!

520
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,430
你们几个在这里干什么
Hey, what are you freaks doing out here?

521
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,340
神秘生物
Mystical creature!

522
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,980
那是什么
Uh, what was that?

523
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,770
是风
Uh, it's the Wind!

524
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,230
-什么  -风在这里发出奇怪的声音
- Huh? - Yeah, it makes strange noises out here.

525
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,900
神秘生物
Mystical creature!

526
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,820
别闹了  你们举止很奇怪
Stop it. You're all acting weird.

527
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,030
我不喜欢奇怪  让人感觉很奇怪
I don't like weird. Weird is weird, okay?

528
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,990
我好像听到了米果高亢的
I thought I heard Migo's high-pitched,

529
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,580
烦人的声音  他在哪里
kind of annoying voice. Where is he?

530
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,160
-挂在...  -说实话
- Hanging over the-- - Honestly,

531
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,590
我们不知道他在哪里
we have no idea of the status of his whereabouts.

532
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,090
拉几下表示上去
How many times was up?

533
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,870
拉几下
How many times?

534
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,390
有什么事不太对  我想想
Something's not right here. Let me think about this.

535
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,800
有什么事对不上
Ugh, something's not adding up.

536
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,850
我算不太清
Yeah, I can't do math.

537
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:39,970
你们跟我来
You're coming with me.

538
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,190
不
Oh, no!

539
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,940
绳子显然不够长
Definitely not enough rope!

540
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,840
各位
Guys?

541
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,420
各位
Guys?

542
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,140
天哪
Oh, boy.

543
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,360
这里根本不是虚无
This is so not nothingness!

544
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,870
这里有好多好多东西
This is definitely something-ness.

545
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,960
天哪  瞧瞧你
Oh, my gosh! Look at you!

546
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,210
小家伙
Hi, little guy!

547
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,540
不
Oh! No!

548

That is just harsh!

好了  等等  等等
Okay, okay, back up, back up.

558
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,300
你想采访一个声称看到雪怪的人
You wanna interview a man who says he saw a yeti?

559
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,680
你还真信他的话
And you actually believe him?

560
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,880
当然不信了  但是这能做一期好节目
Of course not. But it makes for good TV.

561
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,470
那个人起了高原反应
That man has altitude sickness.

562
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,600
他需要救助
He needs help!

-等他帮完我们再说  -什么

布兰达  你知道这个村庄是为什么而闻名吗
Brenda, do you know what this village is famous for?

565
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,440
雪怪
Yetis.

566
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,040
这个星球上没有哪里
More reported yeti sightings

567
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,110
比这里出过更多的雪怪目击事件
here than anywhere else on the planet.

568
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,440
所以呢
So?

569
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
试想看
Picture this.

570

我们来这里寻找喜马拉雅跳蛛
We're here looking for the Himalayan jumping spider,

571
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,410
结果拍到了雪怪
but we capture on film a yeti.

572
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,990
我们发布视频  肯定会被大量转发  爆炸新闻
We post the video. It goes viral. Then boom!

573
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,490
我的收视率一路飙升
My ratings skyrocket!

574
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,410
雪怪根本不存在
Yetis don't exist.

575
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,580
是吗
Or do they?

576
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,340
我今天到镇上搞了套变装  很像
Picked up a suit in town this afternoon, and it's a cracker.

577
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,660
里面还带高跷
Has stilts and everything.

578
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,090
你要穿上这个欺骗你的粉丝
You're gonna put that thing on and deceive your fans?

579
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,380
当然不是  我会出镜采访
Of course not! I'll be on camera.

580
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,880
变装的是你
You'll be in the suit.

581
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,760
你怎么了
What has happened to you?

582
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,510
那个热爱动物  激励我去热爱动物的
Where is the Percy Patterson who loved animals,

583
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:35,470
正直的珀西・帕特森去哪里了
who inspired me to love them, who had integrity?

584
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,890
我很正直啊
I have integrity.

585
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,980
好吧  对  我要做一件不正直的事
Okay, yes, I've gotta do one thing without integrity,

586
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,780
然后我就一直保持正直了
and then I'll just be all integrity all the time.

587
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,320
我满心都是正直
I will ooze integrity.

588
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,640
全身浸泡在正直里
I shall bathe in it.

589
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,910
我会有一款叫"正直"的运动饮料
I will have a sports drink called "Integrity"

590
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,740
我会授权  不是免费的
that I will endorse, not for free,

591
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,200
但是我会把钱拿去做慈善
but I will take that money and give it to charity.

592
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,210
我就是有这么正直
That's how much integrity I will have!

593
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,540

682
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,710
但我觉得你一点都不可怕  你好可爱
But you don't look terrifying to me. You're adorable.

683
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,250
小脚怪之歌  我知道  我知道
Ooh, the smallfoot song. I know this one. I know it. I know it.

684
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,130
那样不对吗
Was that not right?

685
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,690
我只需要把你带回家
I just need to take you home

686
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,110
向大家证明
and prove to everyone that

687
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:09,100
你的存在  然后就不会被驱逐了  好吗
you exist so I can get un-banished. Okay?

688
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,480
你想带点什么吗  好吧
You wanna bring anything? Okay.

689
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,490
那个也想带上吗  好的  过来
You wanna bring that, too? Okay, come here.

690
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,710
那看上去不错
Ooh, that looks cool!

691
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,620
不
No!

692
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,710
等等  你要去哪里
Whoa, whoa. Wait! Where you going?

693
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:35,330
看看你这兴奋的样子
Look how excited you are.

694
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,600
住手
Stop it!

695
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,440
这太讽刺了
That's ironic.

696
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,320
小脚怪  喂
Smallfoot? Hello?

697
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,570
应该会掉出一颗来吗
That supposed to fall out like that?

698
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,320
我们得放回去  原来是在这里的吧
Hmm, we need to put that back in there. It goes there, right?

699
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,200
天啊
Oh, boy.

700
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,080
好吧  带上这个
All right, take a little bit of that...

701
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,470
希望你不要介意  不过我要带你回家了
I hope you don't mind, but I'm taking you home.

702
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,550
我会说"你们好啊"
I'm gonna be all like, "Yo, what's up?"

703
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,550
他们会说"那是...什么"
And they're gonna be like, "Yo, is that a... What?"

704
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,910
然后我就会一脸"没错"
And I'm gonna be like, "Yeah!"

705
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,180
他们就会一脸震惊
Their faces are gonna be like, "Ahhh!"

706
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,760
然后我就会叫起来
Then my face is like, "Uh-huh!"

707
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,190
小脚怪是存在的  吃瘪吧
Smallfoot exists, sucka. Whoa-hem.!

708
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,070
那是暴风雪吗
Is that a blizzard?

709
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,000
你没事吧
You okay?

710
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,410
这风暴真是太突然了  对吧
Wow, that storm came out of nowhere, didn't it?

711
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,630
别担心  我们在这里等着  这里温暖舒适
Don't worry. We'll wait it out in here. It's nice and warm.

712
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,550
不
Aah! No!

713
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,300
拜托不要死  拜托不要死  拜托不要死
Please don't die. Please don't die. Please don't die.

714
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,140
别担心  小脚怪  我会救你的
Don't worry, smallfoot. I'm gonna save you.

715
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,270
我会救你的  坚持住  坚持住
I'm gonna save you. Just hang on! Hang on! Hang on!

716
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,610
火
Fire.

717
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,480
多么温暖
So warm.

718
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,820
多么舒适
So nice.

719
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,900
等等  怎么...
Wait a minute. What's...

720
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,030
不  不  你不能
No, no, you can't...

721
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,040
怎么样  每一面都烘烤得舒舒服服
How's that? Nice and toasty all the way around.

722
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,830
怎么了
Oh, hey. What's wrong?

723
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,960
你饿了吗  我给你找了吃的
You hungry? I found your food.

724
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,960
不要
Please...

725
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,370
你还冷吗
You still cold?

726
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,420
我知道为什么  你根本没有毛
I can see why. You have, like, no fur.

727
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,500
你的茧快干了
Oh, your cocoon is almost dry.

728
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,040
我给你清出一块地方来
I'll clear off a space where you can

729
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,550
让你能好好躺着等风暴过去
just lie down until the storm passes, okay?

730
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,060
我是珀西・帕特森  这可能是我最后一段视频
Percy Patterson here in what might be my last broadcast ever.

731
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,390
我可能会被吃或者被烤或者被冻死
I might get eaten or roasted or frozen solid

732
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,390
或者这三者的恐怖结合
or some horrible combination of the three.

733
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,470
但是你们要知道
But know this.

734
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,730
知道知道我冒生命危险追寻一些非常了不起的东西
Know that I risked my life in pursuit of something extraordinary.

735
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:01,900
比我们更大[伟大]的东西
Something bigger than us.

736
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,820
字面意义上的更大
Literally, so much bigger.

737
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,360
太好了  你会动了  我快清理出一片区域
Oh, great! You're moving. I've almost finished clearing off...

738
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,610
我觉得他在说他要拿我当晚餐
I think he's saying he wants to have me for dinner.

739
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,340
好吧  好吧  好吧
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

740
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,750
怎么回事
Oh, what?

741
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,970
拜托  冻僵的蠢手指
Come on, you stupid frozen fingers!

742
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,010
好了
There we go.

743
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,550
布兰达  行行好
Brenda, give me my glory.

744
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,940
上传这段视频  然后派人来帮忙
Upload this video, then send help.

745
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,310
拜托能发  拜托能发  拜托能发
Please work! Please work! Please work!

746
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,140
太好了
Yes!

747
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,630
{\an8}连接中

748
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,670
{\an8}已连接

749
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,820
{\an8}上传时间
28小时

750
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,820
不
No!

751
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,370
这里还有别的东西
Something else is in here.

752
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,530
根据回声判断
Judging by the echo,

753
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:58,120
我估计距离大概为200米远
I'd estimate distance is approximately 200 meters.

754
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,120
估计错误
Estimation wrong.

755
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:18,720
我丈夫正在里面睡的正香
My husband is back there sound asleep!

756
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,770
-对不起  对不起  -还有孩子们
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Not to mention the children!

757
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,730
我花了好几个星期才把它们哄睡着
Took me weeks to get them to sleep!

758
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,240
我都没有孩子  但我能想象
I don't even have kids, but I can imagine

759
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,780
这绝对是一件非常困难的事
that is just a really hard thing to do.

760
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,740
我只有六个月的自由妈妈时间
All I get is six months of a little mommy time,

761
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,070
都被你毁了
and you are ruining it!

762
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,840
你就这么走进了我的洞穴  你都没擦干净你的脚
You just walk into my cave. You don't even wipe your feet!

763
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:42,590
-再一次非常抱歉  -最好真的抱歉
- Again, very, very sorry! - You better be sorry.

764
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,710
我不知道你是什么  或者你从哪里来
I don't know what you are or where you came from,

765
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,620
但你最好学学基本礼仪
but you better learn some manners!

766
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,290
你看到了吗
Did you see that?

767
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,630
她说"你会吵醒我的丈夫"
She was all like, "You're gonna wake my husband."

768
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,060
我说"你得赶紧离开这里"
And I was like, "You gotta get out of here."

769
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,560
然后你完全听懂了  我们在交流
And then you totally understood me. We were communicating.

770
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,680
真是太棒了
This is amazing!

771
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,690
别傻了  珀西
Don't be stupid, Percy.

772
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,650
不要去帮助那个凶猛的大雪怪
Do not go back to help the big, ferocious yeti.

773
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:09,900
不要这么做
Do not do it!

774
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,160
不过他的确刚刚从一头熊手里救下你
Although he did just save you from a bear.

775
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,950
现在真不是萌生良心的好时机
This is the wrong time to grow a conscience!

776
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:31,090
没事的  大家伙
It's okay, big fellow.

777
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,420
来把这东西拿下来
Let's get this thing off.

778
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,010
这样疼吗
Does this hurt?

779
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,560
抱歉  这样吗  这样呢
Sorry. This? How about this?

780
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,300
这样呢  这样呢  抱歉
This? This? Sorry.

781
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,430
-住手  -好了
- Stop it! - Got it.

782
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:41,060
好了  没事了  我没事了
Okay. It's okay. I'm okay.

783
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,740
风暴停了
Oh, the storm's lifted!

784
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:03,850
不如你和我一起
What do you say me and you

785
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,330
爬到山上  证明你们的存在
get up that mountain and prove you exist?

786
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:09,210
对  要打手势...
Oh, right. Hand signals. Um...

787
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:22,760
令人难以置信
This is unbelievable,

788
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:27,820
但我觉得雪怪是想要和我交流
but I think the yeti is actually trying to communicate with me.

789
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,940
我认为他想要我和他一起走
And I think he wants me to go with him.

790
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,190
这也许是我做过的最勇敢的事
This is either the bravest thing I've ever done

791
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:34,620
也许是最愚蠢的
or the stupidest.

792
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:37,120
希望是前者吧
Here's hoping it's the former.

793
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,160
我差点忘了
Oh, I almost forgot.

794
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,610
来  这样应该能让你暖和点
Here. These should keep you warm.

795
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,370
不不不
No, no, no.

796
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:44,670
其实感觉还真棒
Oh! That's actually quite nice.

797
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,650
我们快到了
We're almost there.

798
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,750
起来了  米果  该敲锣了
Up and at them, Migo. Time to ring the gong!

799
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:28,910
今天怎么这么累
Why is this so hard this morning?

800
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,840
发射
Launch!

801
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,130
米果
Migo?

802
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:36,920
米果  该敲...
Migo, time to ring the...

803
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,260
对  被驱逐了
Oh, yeah. Banished.

804
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,280
怎么...
Huh? What the...

805
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,210
两声锣响
Two gongs?

806
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:12,960
发生了什么
What just happened?

807
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,000
不要问  随他去吧
Don't ask. Just push it down.

808
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:17,970
随他去吧
Push it down.

809
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,130
我的头盔
My helmet?

810
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,850
放我下去  快点  趁我还没改变主意
Drop me! Quickly, before I change my mind.

811
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,510
你不能这么做  咪琪
You can't do this, Meech!

812
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,930
你是我们的社长
You're our leader!

813
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,520
所以我正应该这么做
Exactly why I should do it!

814
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,650
放我下去
Drop me!

815
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:34,890
好吧
Okay.

816
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,910
好可怕  真不敢相信米果下去了
This is terrifying. I cannot believe Migo did this.

817
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,820
所以也许  你并不应该去
Which is why maybe, you know, you shouldn't!

818
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,030
我只是想说  我接替你的位置也行
I just wanna say, I'm fine with it being you.

819
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,110
应该我去
I should go.

820
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,070
我很强壮  我一直在自我训练睁着眼睛睡觉
I'm strongest, and I've trained myself to sleep with my eyes open.

821
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,340
我现在就睡着了  你们都是我的梦
I'm asleep right now. You're all part of my dream.

822
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:52,540
他下去是因为我说服他下去的
He's down there because I convinced him to go!

823
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,960
他可能迷路了或者受伤了
And he might be lost or hurt.

824
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,500
-或者死了  -福林
- Or dead. - Fleem!

825
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,330
怎么了  现在我们就不追求真相了吗
Oh, what? Now we're not about the truth?

826
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,260
我们上次是因为索普来了才把他放了下去
Last time, we dropped him because Thorp showed up,

827
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,210
他可能还会来  所以我们能走了吗
which he might do again, so can we please go?

828
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,340
伙计们  伙计们
Guys! Guys!

829
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,170
我的脑内还在回响着他的声音
Oh, I can still hear his voice in my head.

830
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,760
-伙计们  -我的脑内也是
- Guys! - It's in my head, too.

831
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,970
米果  他在这里
Migo! He's here!

832
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:10,100
我知道  他永远都会在我们身边
I know. And he always will be.

833
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,480
不不不  他在这里
No, no, no. He's here!

834
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,770
这边
As in over there!

835
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:13,980
伙计们
Guys!

836
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,480
-米果  -米果
- Migo! - Migo!

837
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,690
神秘生物
Mystical creature!

838
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:18,850
不
Oh, no! Ahh!

839
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,660
我接住你了
I've got you!

840
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:22,660
米果
Migo!

841
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,950
我总算放心了
I am so relieved!

842
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,330
-看  我就说他还活着  -我的兄弟
- See? I told you he was alive! - My brother!

843
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:33,130
米果  米果
Oh, Migo! Oh, Migo.

844
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,130
伙计们  慢点  慢点  慢点
Whoa, whoa! Guys, easy. Easy, easy.

845
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,120
那是什么
What is that?

846
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:42,550
小脚怪论证社团  来见见你们的神秘生物
Smallfoot Evidentiary Society, meet your mystical creature!

847
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:58,020
我就知道是真的
I knew it was real.

848
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,070
没有人再会觉得我疯了
No one's gonna think I'm crazy anymore.

849
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,740
他好美
He's so beautiful!

850
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:04,320
好矮
And so short.

851
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,910
你成功了  米果  你真的成功了
You did it, Migo. You actually did it!

852
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,450
不  我们成功了  SES
No, We did it. The S.E.S.!

853
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:12,710
四个大脚野人
Wow! Four more Sasquatch.

854
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,210
一大群
It's a whole Sasquad.

855
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:19,040
恐惧我吧  渺小的生物  我是你们的神
Fear me, little creature. I am your god!

856
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:21,170
-福林  你在干什么  -树立统治权
- Fleem, what are you doing? - Establishing dominance.

857
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,340
不
No.

858
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,500
我们不统治
We don't dominate.

859
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,840
我们张开双臂欢迎他
We welcome him with open arms.

860
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,340
是我干的吗
Oh, did I just do that?

861
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,680
我很抱歉  你没事吧  你受伤了吗
I am so sorry! Are you okay? Are you hurt?

862
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,430
很抱歉  我爱你  我爱你
I'm so sorry. I love you. I love you.

863
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,600
我们得把这真相带回村庄
We gotta bring this truth to the village,

864
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,020
让他们小吃一惊
blow some tiny minds.

865
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,850
什么意思
What was that?

866
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:39,280
他们的脑子太小了
Their minds are really tiny.

867
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:40,350
关吉说得对
Gwangi's right.

868
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,820
我们来叫醒他们
Let's wake them up.

869
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:49,820
什么  米果回来了
What? Migo's back?

870
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,450
没错  打脸了吧
Yeah, that's right. In your face!

871
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:56,000
-我的脸  -大家伙儿  听我说
- Oh! My face! - Hey, listen! Everyone!

872
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,460
停下你们手中的活  跟着我
Stop what you're doing and follow us!

873
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,000
这将会是你们今天最棒的见闻
'Cause this is gonna be the best part of your day!

874
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,460
你们都听到米果说的了
You heard Migo. Everybody.

875
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,380
-没错  -米果
- That's right! - Migo?

876
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:03,420
说你呢  下来
Hey, you up there! Come on down!

877
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,340
来吧  孩子们  你也是  盖瑞  过来
Come on, kids. You, too, Garry. Get over here.

878
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,300
来吧  你们肯定会喜欢的
Let's go! You're gonna love it!

879
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,460
米果  欢迎回来
Hey, Migo, welcome back...

880
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:10,770
等等  你不是应该被驱逐了吗
Hold on, aren't you supposed to be banished?

881
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,340
-没错  -好吧
- Yep. - Ah, cool.

882
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:13,810
大家听好了  围过来
Everyone, listen up. Gather 'round.

883
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,260
我保证  你们绝对不会后悔的
I promise, you're gonna wanna see this.

884
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:18,220
各位雪怪
My fellow yetis,

885
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:21,480
我们人生中总会出现非常重要的时刻
there are moments in life that are imbued with such importance,

886
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,150
我们需要停下来  好好地
we must pause and look deeper

887
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:27,030
看看我们自己所处的位置
into the moment of the place in which we are

888
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:30,160
把握住这美好的时刻
to hold such beauteous gravitas

889
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,410
好好欣赏这...
and take in the beauty--

890
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:33,620
-我开始觉得无趣了  -直奔主题
- I'm losing interest! - Get to the point!

891
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,290
好吧  来吧
Yep, okay. Here we go.

892
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:38,790
各位雪怪  请看  小脚怪
Fellow yetis, behold, the smallfoot!

893
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:53,640
我真不敢相信我的双眼
I can't believe my eyes.

894
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,940
他们不是住在洞窟里的原始野兽
These aren't primitive beasts living in caves.

895
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:58,980
这是一个复杂的文明
This is a complex civilization.

896
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,730
你知道这对世界来说意味着什么吗
Do you know what this means for the world?

897
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:05,240
珀西・帕特森独家巨制
A Percy Patterson network special.

898
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,780
不客气  世界
You're welcome, world!

899
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:11,110
那么...
So...

900
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,830
这次又在热闹些什么呢
...what's all the excitement about this time?

901
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:17,490
米果找到了小脚怪
Migo found a smallfoot!

902
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,130
是一种可能
That's one guess.

903
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,830
但是  爸爸  你看看这双小脚
But, Dad, look at the small foot!

904
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,550
牦牛的蹄子不是也很小吗
Don't yaks have small feet?

905
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:27,090
让我把它带到宫殿里
Let me take it into the palace,

906
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:28,390
确认律石
consult the stones,

907
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:30,010
然后再决定这是什么
and determine what it is.

908
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:33,180
万一这真的是小脚怪呢  那说明律石错了吗
What if it is a smallfoot? Does that mean a stone is wrong?

909
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,520
-全都错了  -没错
- They're all wrong. - Yeah.

910
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:36,690
告诉我们真相
Tell us the truth!

911
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,470
盖瑞  深呼吸
Garry, just breathe.

912
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:41,430
大家不要惊慌
Everyone, please.

913
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,140
律石上说有问题该怎么做的
What do the stones tell us about questions?

914
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,460
我有好多问题
I have so many questions!

915
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,420
-它从哪里来  -它为什么是粉色的
- Where is it from? - Why is it pink?

916
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,090
-你怎么来到这里的  -它吃什么
- How did you get it here? - What does it eat?

917
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,040
它的脑袋这么小  怎么思考呢
How does it think with such a tiny little brain?

918
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,630
说实话  我和你们一样满肚子疑问
Honestly, I have just as many questions as you do.

919
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:11,260
-它的角在哪里  -那是它的耳朵吗
- Where is its horn? - Is that its ear?

920
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,340
它想来一口水果吗
Does it want a bite of fruit?

921
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,170
如果律石上说不可能  它怎么会在这里
How is it here if a stone says it can't be?

922
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:18,930
*世界比我们知道的大*
*It's all much bigger than we know*

923
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:20,010
-怎么会  -为什么
- How? - Why?

924
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,100
什么意思
What do you mean?

925
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,270
*它只是刚开始在我们面前展开*
*It's only just beginning to unfold*

926
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:25,100
-我好迷惑  -还有更多需要知道的吗
- I'm so confused. - There's more to know?

927
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,440
*让它都展开吧*
*So let it all unfold*

928
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,480
*我从来不知道还有更多需要知道的*
*I never knew there was more to know*

929
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,660
*这难道不棒吗*
*Isn't it all so amazing?*

930
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:35,660
*有个神秘的世界等待你去探寻*
*There's a world mysterious there for you to find*

931
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:38,410
*突然间有更多空间*
*Out of the blue, there was room to grow*

932
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:40,320
*这难道不疯狂吗*
*Isn't it all kind of crazy?*

933
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:43,830
*我们都很好奇  这没有什么不对*
*All we are is curious. There's nothing wrong with that*

934
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:47,790
*去探寻每一个角落*
*So go 'round every corner*

935
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:49,130
你管这叫艺术吗
You call that art?

936
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:51,760
*探索每一天天空*
*Search every part of the sky*

937
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,300
-他在干什么  -他真的会飞吗
- What is he doing? - Is he really gonna fly?

938
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,970
*充满惊奇的生活*
*'Cause a life that's full of wonder*

939
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,470
*才是美妙的生活*
*Is a wonderful life*

940
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:35,050
-花花  坐下  -到我这来
- Blossom, sit. - I got you.

941
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,510
坐下  坐下
Down. Down!

942
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,140
你看你起了个什么样的头
Do you see what you've started?

943
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,730
是啊  你看看他们
Yes! Do you? Look at them!

944
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:50,360
我们已经在恐惧中生活了太久  爸爸
We have been living in fear for too long, Dad.

945
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,320
我只是想要保护你的安全  咪琪
All I ever wanted to do was keep you safe, Meechee.

946
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:57,120
我所做的一切都是为了保护村庄和你
Everything I do, I do to protect the village and you.

947
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,370
我不需要你保护我  我需要你聆听我
I don't need you to protect me. I need you to listen to me.

948
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:01,870
我们所有人
To all of us,

949
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:03,490
特别是米果
especially Migo!

950
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:05,040
爸爸  他去到了云层下面
Dad, he went below the clouds.

951
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,580
他们都在和米果说话
They're talking to Migo

952
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,040
因为他有问题  他会听
because they have questions, and he's listening

953
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,290
而不是叫他们随他去吧
instead of telling them to just push them down.

954
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:13,570
但是  相信我  你是他们的村长
But, believe me, you are their leader,

955
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,670
他们希望那个人是你
and they wish it was you.

956
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,680
你去找米果谈谈他看到的一切吧
So just talk to Migo about what he saw.

957
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,680
拜托你
Please.

958
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,270
你说得对  我的确需要这么做
You're right. That's exactly what I need to do.

959
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:26,150
谢谢  我就知道你会想通的
Oh, thank you! I knew you'd come around.

960
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,440
我要去找小脚怪了  再见
I'm gonna go get the smallfoot! Bye!

961
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,230
这是发网  类似于一种头巾
That's a snood. It's like a sort of scarf.

962
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:35,860
这是一种纤维制品  最好别戴上去
That's a fiber supplement. I'd rather not go into it.

963
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:36,940
那是袜子
That's a sock.

964
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,570
是一种穿在脚和鞋子之间的布
It's a lining between your shoe and your foot.

965
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:41,400
你不应该这样...
That's not how you're supposed-- Ugh.

966
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:42,910
我穿了四天呢
Four days I had them on.

967
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:46,580
你能翻译无形智慧卷轴吗
Can you translate the Scroll of Invisible Wisdom?

968
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:51,540
是的  其实我正好需要这个
Yes. Actually, I do need this.

969
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:52,620
好吧
Okay.

970
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:56,640
那不是智慧
It is not wisdom

971
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:58,510
绝对也不是无形的
and definitely not invisible.

972
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:00,680
米果在哪里
Hey, where's Migo?

973
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:03,060
爸爸  爸爸
Hey, Dad! Dad!

974
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,560
这是不是最棒的一天
Oh, is this the best day ever or what?

975
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,300
爸爸
Dad?

976
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:10,890
怎么了  你的头盔呢
What's wrong? What happened to your helmet?

977
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:12,270
我没有敲锣
I missed the gong.

978
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:15,980
但是天空中的蜗牛还是来了
But the sky snail, it came up anyway.

979
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:20,070
所以又有一块石律是错的
Whoa! So another stone is wrong.

980
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:22,530
-真是太棒了  -棒
- This is amazing. - Amazing?

981
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:24,410
这有什么棒的
What's so amazing about it?

982
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:27,750
石律应该就是石律
The stones are supposed to be stones, you know?

983
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,870
坚固  可靠  真实
Sturdy, reliable, true.

984
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,460
现在蜗牛自己起床了
And now the snail is just rising on its own?

985
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,630
如果那真的是蜗牛的话
If it even is a snail.

986
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:36,670
咪琪认为那可能是一团发光的气体
Meechee thinks it might be a flaming ball of gas.

987
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:38,010
气体
Gas?

988
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,550
我天天用头撞那玩意唤醒一块气体球
I've been banging my head on that thing to wake up a gas ball?

989
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,720
一般我都是因为气体球才醒的[屁]
That's usually what wakes me up.

990
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,560
爸爸  我知道这些改变很可怕
Look, Dad, I know all of this change is scary.

991
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,550
但是也许这是一件好事
But maybe this is a good thing.

992
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,310
也许还有用你的脑袋敲锣
Maybe there's something even

993
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,060
更好的事可以做
better than banging your head against the gong.

994
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:55,990
但如果我不敲锣了  我就不是敲锣人了
But if I don't ring the gong, I'm not the gong ringer.

995
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,240
如果我不是敲锣人了
And if I'm not the gong ringer,

996
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:00,320
那我到底是什么
then what am I?

997
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,660
米果
Hey, Migo!

998
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:09,870
我爸爸想见你
My dad wants to see you.

999
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:11,910
守石人  真的吗
The Stonekeeper. Really?

1000
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,710
你肯定觉得很棒吧  因为他从来就不想见我
Which must be nice for you 'cause he never wants to see me. Heh.

1001
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:16,750
好吧
Okay.

1002
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,130
我为什么大声说出来了  好丢人
Why did I shout that out? That's so embarrassing.

1003
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,050
又搞砸了  索普
Ugh. Blew it again, Thorp.

1004
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,760
爸爸  我去去就回
Hey, Dad. I'll be back.

1005
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,590
爸爸
Dad?

1006
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:43,080
看看它们
Look at them.

1007
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:46,540
过去伟大的守石人
The great Stonekeepers of the past.

1008
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,040
每个人得到关于
Each one adding new stones

1009
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:52,040
对村庄最好的智慧时  都会加上新的律石
as they received wisdom about what was best for the village.

1010
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,290
-这一串看上去很重  -是的
- Robe looks heavy. - It is.

1011
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,330
只有坚实的后背才能承载
It requires a strong backbone.

1012
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:23,230
秘密台阶  好吧
Whoa. Secret stairs. Okay.

1013
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,040
你要带我去哪里
Where are you taking me?

1014
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:38,750
那么多问题
So many questions.

1015
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,140
我该给你一些答案了
Think it's about time I give you some answers.

1016
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:53,510
这是什么
What is this?

1017
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,690
米果
You see, Migo...

1018
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:58,650
*曾经雪怪是住在云层之下*
*There was a time when yetis lived beneath the clouds*

1019
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:00,480
*我们幸福生活茁壮成长*
*We were alive and we were thrivin'*

1020
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,070
*直到我们遇到了一群小脚怪*
*Till we came across a crowd of smallfoot*

1021
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:05,320
*没错  我们曾经住在那下面*
*That's right, we used to live down there*

1022
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:09,120
*但是下面的行为让我们无法饶恕*
*But there were actions we could not forgive down there*

1023
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:11,540
*虽然他们用不同的称呼*
*And though they used a different nomenclature*

1024
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,790
*什么人或人类  给我们展示他们本性*
*Man or human, they showed us human nature*

1025
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:17,710
*虽然我们好奇接近  但他们是危险种族*
*A dangerous species though we approached with wonder*

1026
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:21,170
*他们用长矛和冒烟的闪电攻击我们*
*They attacked with their spears and their smoking sticks of thunder*

1027
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:24,080
*他们叫我们山顶野人  说我们非常骇人*
*They called us Sasquatch, they called us abominable*

1028
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:27,380
*他们追逐我们至死不休*
*They chased us, pursued us their persistence indomitable*

1029
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,300
*我们只能逃走躲藏*
*We had no choice but to run and hide*

1030
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,890
*否则我们一族都将面临灭绝*
*Otherwise, we surmised we were facing genocide*

1031
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:36,060
*于是我们为了活命爬上了这座山*
*So we climbed this mountain just to stay alive*

1032
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:39,730
*我们知道小脚怪无法在这里生存*
*You see, we knew that up here smallfoot could not survive*

1033
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:42,610
*于是这里在石律上写下了第一条法规*
*So it was here the first law was written in stone*

1034
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:45,910
*这就是我们要知道的真相*
*It was named and proclaimed as a truth to be known*

1035
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:50,440
*我们的世界在一片无尽的云海之上*
*Our world is an island that floats on a sea of endless clouds*

1036
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:51,740
*以后就这样沿袭下去*
*That's how it would be*

1037
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:55,030
*然后我们写下更多法规  更多规矩*
*And then we wrote more laws, more rules to obey*

1038
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,790
*为了我们  只有这样*
*For the sake of us all It was the only way*

1039
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:01,500
*才能保护我们不遭到人类的伤害*
*to protect us from all of the human ravages*

1040
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:04,790
*人类造成的各种伤害*
*Heaped upon us by those human savages*

1041
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,800
{\an9}*现在你知道  现在你知道*
*Now you know Now you know, now you know*

1042
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:09,670
{\an9}*现在你知道  现在你知道*
*Now you know, now you know*

1043
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,390
*新的规则*
*And new rules apply*

1044
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:14,220
{\an9}*现在你知道  现在你知道*
*Now you know Now you know, now you know*

1045
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:17,430
{\an9}*所以最好还是撒谎  撒谎*
*So it's best just to let it lie, let it lie*

1046
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:20,230
{\an9}*现在你知道  现在你知道*
*Now you know Now you know, now you know*

1047
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:22,280
{\an9}*现在你知道  现在你知道*
*Now you know, now you know*

1048
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:23,850
*你无法否认*
*And you can't deny*

1049
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:27,150
{\an9}*现在你知道  现在你知道*
*Now you know Now you know, now you know*
Now you know, now you know, now you know

1050
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:31,330
{\an9}*所以最好还是撒谎  撒谎*
*So it's best just to let it lie, let it lie*

1051
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,400
但是我的小脚怪不是这样的
But my smallfoot, he's not like that.

1052
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:35,160
他们都是这样的
They're all like that.

1053
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,750
告诉我  你找到他时
Tell me, when you found him,

1054
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,580
他是张开双臂和你打招呼的吗
did he greet you with open arms?

1055
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,590
他们根本不在乎我们
They don't care about us.

1056
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:50,130
他们只在乎他们自己
They don't care about anything but themselves,

1057
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:52,090
所以如果我们还在乎我们的未来
which is why we must do the same,

1058
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,680
我们必须要做一样的事
if we care about our future.

1059
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,290
我们现在到云层下了
We're below the clouds.

1060
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:29,680
看上去像是云层  但是你再靠近点看
Or so it would seem, but look closer.

1061
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,130
这不是云层  是蒸汽
Those aren't clouds! It's steam.

1062
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,010
石头很有用
The stones are working.

1063
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,300
石头
The stones?

1064
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,720
*虽然每件工作  每个任务*
*Every job and every task*

1065
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,430
*看上去都毫无意义*
*As pointless as it seems*

1066
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,600
*所有的一切都是为了让这个重要的机器
*All of it ensures that this important machine*

1067
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:46,940
*一直运作转啊转*
*Keeps churning and turning and spinning around*

1068
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,860
*让下面看不到上面  上面看不到下面*
*So those below don't look up And those above don't look down*

1069
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,370
*他们还是会看*
*And they'll look*

1070
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,780
*因为就算他们听说过他们的暴行*
*'Cause even if they hear of these atrocities*

1071
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:57,490
*比恐惧更强的只有好奇心*
*The only thing stronger than fear is curiosity*

1072
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:59,660
{\an9}*现在你知道  现在你知道*
*Now you know Now you know, now you know*

1073
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:02,700
等等  所以这些石律都不是真的  都是谎言
Wait. So none of those stones are true? They're all lies?

1074
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:03,960
{\an8}*撒谎吧*
*Let it lie*

1075
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,330
善意的谎言  为了保护我们的世界
Good lies. To protect our world.

1076
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,960
但是他们需要真相
But they need to know the truth.

1077
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,300
是吗
Oh, do they?

1078
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:12,550
*你觉得你追求真相是一名勇士*
*You feel emboldened by your noble quest to find the truth*

1079
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:15,590
*而我只会对年轻人的无知而发笑*
*I chalk it up to the naive innocence of youth*

1080
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,930
*让我告诉你一个长大后会知道的秘密*
*So let me share a secret that you'll learn as you grow older*

1081
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:21,970
*是真是假全看旁人判断*
*What's true or not true is in the eye of the beholder*

1082
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,560
*你想要阻止我们族灭绝吗*
*So do you wanna prevent our own annihilation?*

1083
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:25,570
是的
Yes!

1084
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,440
*那我们唯一的目标就是控制信息外泄*
*Then our only goal should be to control the flow of information*

1085
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,820
*除非你想看小脚怪攻占村庄*
*Unless you want to see the smallfoot conquer and pillage*

1086
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:31,820
不
No!

1087
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:35,150
*那保护谎言就是保护村庄*
*Then protect the lie and you protect the village*

1088
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:37,620
我们的生命很危险  米果
Lives are at stake, Migo.

1089
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:41,160
你的朋友们  你的父亲  咪琪
Your friends, your father, Meechee.

1090
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,620
好吧  我想要知道
Okay. I want to know everything

1091
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,080
关于你和你世界的一切
there is to know about you and your world.

1092
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,670
她很好奇
She's curious.

1093
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:51,340
你知道俗话说"好奇心杀死雪怪"
And you know what they say. "Curiosity killed the yak."

1094
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,090
那你希望我怎么办
So what do you want me to do?

1095
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:56,010
告诉大家你说得关于小脚怪的事是谎言
Tell everyone you were lying about the smallfoot.

1096
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:59,590
但他们都看到了  他们不会相信我的
But they've already seen it. They're not gonna believe me.

1097
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,600
他们会相信的事绝对会出乎你的意料
You'd be surprised at what they'll believe.

1098
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,890
你觉得知识就是力量吗  米果
You think knowledge is power, Migo?

1099
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,860
{\an9}*现在你知道  现在你知道*
*Now you know Now you know, now you know*

1100
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:10,440
{\an9}*现在你知道  现在你知道*
*Now you know Now you know*

1101
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,950
问题是
Question is...

1102
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:15,650
{\an9}*现在你知道  现在你知道*
*Now you know Now you know, now you know*

1103
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:17,860
你准备用那力量来做什么
...what are you gonna do with that power?

1104
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:25,410
好吧  虽然还是不清楚
Okay. It's a little fuzzy,

1105
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:26,790
但我觉得我开始有点搞懂了
but I think I'm starting to get it.

1106
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:29,460
你的工作是让你讲的故事从空中
Your job is to tell stories that fly through the air

1107
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:30,920
奇迹般出现在其他小脚怪家里
in a series of pictures in rapid succession

1108
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,540
一系列迅速切过的图片上
that magically appear in other smallfoots' homes.

1109
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:35,180
电视  没错
TV. Right!

1110
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,090
那这个东西是什么
And what is this thing here?

1111
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:39,550
那是我家的屋顶
That's the roof of my home.

1112
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:40,930
-家  -家
- Home. - Home?

1113
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,350
我们说的是一件事吗
Are we saying the same thing?

1114
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:47,560
那是你最好的朋友吗
Oh, is that, like, your best friend?

1115
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,720
那是邪恶的银行家
That is evil banker man.

1116
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:51,440
他想要夺走我的家
He wants to take my home away

1117
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,520
因为一个叫"可变利率"的东西
because of something called a "Variable interest rate."

1118
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:58,280
显然我也不知道那是什么意思
Apparently, I don't know what it means either.

1119
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:01,580
这上面的空气真的很稀薄啊
The air is really thin up here, isn't it?

1120
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:04,820
那些是动物
Those are animals.

1121
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,330
调皮
Cheeky.

1122
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:14,510
重点就是  这就是我干这一行的原因
Anyway, the point is, this is why I do what I do, see?

1123
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:17,710
我也和你一样  对其他物种非常感兴趣
I was fascinated with other species, like you.

1124
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:21,800
事实上没有和你们一样的  你们太了不起了
Actually, nothing like you. You're quite extraordinary.

1125
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,160
但是最近  我开始
But lately, I started to

1126
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,640
只在乎有多少人在看
only care about how many people are watching,

1127
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,060
我有多火
how popular I am.

1128
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,430
真不想听到我自己大声承认...
Hearing myself say this out loud...

1129
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:34,140
雪怪语中的"可悲"是怎么说的
What's the yeti word for "Pathetic"?

1130
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:37,440
我九岁时  第一次看到了狮子
When I was nine, I saw my first lion.

1131
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,370
看上去就像这样
It looked like this, see?

1132
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:45,990
看上去一点都不像这样  这看上去像只肥狗
It looked nothing like this. That looks like a fat poodle.

1133
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:47,370
来  我直接给你看吧
Here, I'll just show you.

1134
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,960
那是什么东西
Okay. What is that thing?

1135
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,960
他们根本不在乎我们  我们的生命很危险  米果
They don't care about us. Lives are at stake, Migo.

1136
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,040
他们只在乎他们自己
They don't care about anything but themselves.

1137
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:00,220
善意的谎言
Good lies.

1138
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:02,430
我们必须要做一样的事  保护我们的世界
Which is why we must do the same. Protect our world.

1139
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:05,680
你的朋友们  你的父亲  咪琪
Your friends, your father, Meechee.

1140
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,230
不  不要那样
No, don't do that.

1141
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,400
你在干什么  你都搞乱了  住手  住手
What are you doing? You're ruining it! Stop! Stop it!

1142
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:11,310
红色上去  上去  现在动蓝色
Red one up! Up, up! Now, over to the blue one.

1143
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:13,020
蓝色  三个一排  太好了
Blue one. Three in a row! Yes!

1144
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,150
-咪琪  -忙着呢  米果
- Meechee? - Not now, Migo.

1145
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:16,450
好了  下来  下来  右边  紫色的
Ooh! Okay, down, down. Right side. Purple thingy.

1146
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,030
滑下来  滑下来
Slide it, slide it.

1147
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:20,070
好了  轰
Oh! There we go! Boom!

1148
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,650
米果  我把一个形状
Migo, I'm putting shapes

1149
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:24,900
放在另一个形状边就能消掉一行行
next to other shapes to make the rows disappear.

1150
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:28,290
这简直是在毫无意义地浪费时间  但我停不下来
It's pointless and a total waste of time, but I can't stop.

1151
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:33,120
{\an8}游戏结束

1152
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,330
那就是我们的最高分
There goes our high score.

1153
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:32,620
小脚怪
Smallfoot?

1154
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,250
你没事吧
Hey. Are you okay?

1155
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:38,760
有点困了
Getting a little woozy.

1156
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:42,640
我需要更多氧气  氧气
I'm going to need some more oxygen. Oxygen.

1157
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:44,260
我都记不起我的名字了
I can't remember my own name.

1158
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:46,760
这是什么
What's all this?

1159
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:49,470
我们在学习如何沟通
Oh, uh, we learned how to communicate!

1160
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,800
那是他的世界
That's his world...

1161
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:51,930
我觉得非常大
...and I think it's really big,

1162
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:53,560
下面还有更多小脚怪
and there are more smallfeet down there.

1163
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:54,850
非常多
Like, a lot more.

1164
01:02:56,890 --> 01:02:59,190
米果  我觉得有点不对劲
Migo, I think something's wrong.

1165
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:01,150
他看上去不大好
He doesn't look so good.

1166
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:03,030
他好冷  他的呼吸很微弱
He's cold and his breathing is off.

1167
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:05,290
我们知道小脚怪
You see, we knew that up here,

1168
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:06,700
无法在这里生存
smallfoot could not survive.

1169
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:09,000
我觉得我们应该把他送回家
I think we need to take him home.

1170
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,700
什么  不
What? No!

1171
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:14,250
为什么  万一他很难受呢  万一他需要帮助
No? Why not? What if he's really sick? What if he needs help?

1172
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:15,800
不要再问问题了
Just stop asking questions!

1173
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:17,830
不要再问问题
Stop asking questions?

1174
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:22,380
大家请注意
Attention, everyone!

1175
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:24,340
守石人有事情要宣布
The Stonekeeper has an announcement.

1176
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:26,680
怎么回事  你知道吗
What's going on? Do you know?

1177
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,010
你看上去好像你知道些什么
'Cause you look like you know something.

1178
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:29,600
别问了  拜托
Just stop. Please.

1179
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:33,730
今天是多么有意思的一天啊
What an interesting day it's been.

1180
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:37,110
充满了惊喜和问题的一天
A day full of excitement and questions.

1181
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:39,650
那么多问题
So many questions.

1182
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:43,650
我必须承认  今天发生的事甚至让我也萌生疑问
I must admit, the events of the day even had me asking a few.

1183
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:45,280
闻到了掩饰的气息
Uh-oh, I smell cover-up.

1184
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,110
于是我邀请米果和我一起
So I asked Migo to join me

1185
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:50,540
我问了他几个关于他的大发现的问题
so I could question him about his amazing discovery.

1186
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:53,410
然后我们一起达成了共识
And together, we've reached the same conclusion.

1187
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:55,160
米果  告诉他们我们都发现了什么
Migo, tell them what we learned.

1188
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:02,920
事实上  那个...
The thing is, see... Uh...

1189
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,010
是的  这...
Yeah, it's, uh...

1190
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:08,310
我要告诉你们的是...
What I was gonna tell you is, urn...

1191
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,230
这不是小脚怪
It's not a smallfoot.

1192
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:17,400
等等  什么
Wait. What?

1193
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:20,150
我错了  我弄混了
Yeah. I was wrong, I got confused,

1194
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:21,940
守石人发现了
and the Stonekeeper figured it out.

1195
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,320
这其实是一种牦牛
It's actually a type of yak.

1196
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,490
一种牦牛
A yak?

1197
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:26,700
米果发现了一种
Migo found a rare breed

1198
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:28,360
连我都不知道的新种
that even I didn't know about.

1199
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:31,360
一种红色小型无毛牦牛
A red-coated pygmy hairless yak.

1200
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,450
你知道这不是牦牛
You know this is not a yak.

1201
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:36,280
如你们所见  他们的存在在石律上
As you can see, its existence is confirmed

1202
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:37,830
有记载
in stone.

1203
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:42,750
发生了什么
What is happening?

1204
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:45,500
石律世世代代保护着我们
The stones have protected us for generations.

1205
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:47,140
但我们却一直忽视它们
But we've been ignoring them.

1206
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,010
今天都没有人去喂大山地猛犸象
No one's been feeding the great mountain mammoths today.

1207
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:51,340
他说得对
He's right.

1208
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,270
正因如此  我们在下沉
And because of that, we are sinking.

1209
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:54,850
我不想下沉
I don't wanna sink!

1210
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:57,510
盖瑞  你的害怕是正确的
Garry, you're right to be afraid.

1211
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,810
大家听听盖瑞说的话
Everyone, listen to Garry.

1212
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:01,190
我不想下沉到虚无里
I don't wanna sink into the nothing!

1213
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:03,900
这都是谎言  米果  我们看到你去了云层下面
These are lies, Migo. We saw you go below the clouds.

1214
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:06,170
我没有  我跌入云层中
I didn't. I fell into the clouds,

1215
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:08,360
我在一个洞穴中找到了他
and I found him inside of a cave.

1216
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,490
什么
What?

1217
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:12,450
别听他的  这全都是在掩饰
Don't listen to him. This is all part of a massive cover-up!

1218
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:14,360
-拜托  等等  -我们都处于一个大机器中
- Please, wait-- - We're all part of a big machine.

1219
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:15,450
哥们  不  拜托  停下
Dude, no. Come on, stop!

1220
01:05:15,530 --> 01:05:17,380
其实我觉得下面就应该有一个巨大的机器
In fact, I think it might be a big machine that's down there!

1221
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:19,000
别说了
You need to stop!

1222
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,290
-听起来的确像是机器  -我也觉得
- It does sound like a machine! - I thought so, too!

1223
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:21,450
-就是  -别说了
- You heard me! - Just stop!

1224
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:25,580
一个巨大的机器
A big machine.

1225
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:26,920
没错
Right!

1226
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,380
我们都听关吉和他的疯狂理论吧
Let's all listen to Gwangi and his whacked-out theories

1227
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,560
因为我们都知道关吉
because we all know that Gwangi is

1228
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:33,470
就是个疯子
just straight-up crazy.

1229
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:35,350
-什么  -别说他是疯子
- What? - Don't call him crazy.

1230
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:36,760
拜托  我们真的要听这些人说的话吗
Come on, are we really gonna listen to these guys?

1231
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:39,640
他们都是村里的怪人  我们都知道
They're the village weirdos, right? We all know that.

1232
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,770
他们只是想证明这些石律是错的
They're just trying to prove all the stones wrong.

1233
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:45,980
但是如果我们不遵从石律  就会发生很糟糕的事
But if we don't follow the stones, really bad things can happen.

1234
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:49,780
说得好  米果  这就是真相
Well said, Migo. That's the truth.

1235
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:51,440
真相
The truth?

1236
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:54,120
我觉得这里没人在乎那是什么
I don't think anybody around here cares what that is.

1237
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,710
伙计们  等等
Guys, wait.

1238
01:05:58,780 --> 01:05:59,960
米果  把他给我
Migo, give him to me.

1239
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,630
等等  你要做什么
Wait. What are you doing?

1240
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:05,460
不不不  他需要温暖  他无法呼吸
No, no, no! He needs warmth, and he can't breathe!

1241
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:07,710
-咪琪  -你为什么要这么做
- Meechee. - Why are you doing this?

1242
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,680
我们应该到里面再来讨论
This is something we should discuss inside.

1243
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:13,470
里面
Inside.

1244
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:17,930
好的  父亲
Yes, Father.

1245
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:20,400
咪琪  我们要谈谈
Meechee, we need to talk.

1246
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:21,940
我觉得你说得够多了
I think you've said enough.

1247
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,110
好了  大家伙儿
Okay, everyone.

1248
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:28,270
现在一切都可以恢复原样了
Now everything can go back to the way it was.

1249
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:31,070
大家都回去干活吧  这个村子可没法自给自足
Everyone, back to work. The village won't run itself.

1250
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:34,410
小脚怪  你要对他做什么
The smallfoot, what are you gonna do with him?

1251
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:37,460
我们要把他送回你找到他的洞穴里
We're taking him back to the cave where you found him.

1252
01:06:37,610 --> 01:06:39,290
但我不是在洞穴里找到他的
But I didn't find him in a cave.

1253
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:42,240
但你是这么说的  所以他们相信了你
But you said you did, so they believe you.

1254
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:44,590
你做了一件好事  米果
You've done a good thing, Migo.

1255
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:00,640
守石人  等等
Stonekeeper, wait!

1256
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,900
不
No!

1257
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:06,890
你已经做了你该做的事  米果
You've done your job, Migo.

1258
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:08,860
回家去吧
Go home.

1259
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:51,530
米果
Migo?

1260
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:54,820
怎么了  你在做什么
What's wrong? What are you doing?

1261
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,490
我只是在想15号石律
I was just thinking about Stone 15.

1262
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:00,660
"无知是福"
"Ignorance is bliss"?

1263
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:02,710
没错  这条说得不错
Yeah. That one's true.

1264
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:04,960
无知的确是福
Ignorance is bliss,

1265
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:06,790
至少曾经是
or at least it was.

1266
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:11,000
我当初不知道小雪怪  或者SES
I was pretty happy when I didn't know about the smallfoot

1267
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,500
或者咪琪
or the S.E.S.

1268
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:15,210
有多么迷人时  是多么快乐
or how amazing Meechee really is.

1269
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,690
而且如果我现在不知道他们恨我
And I'm pretty sure I'd be happier

1270
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:18,920
或者我欺骗并背叛了他们的话
not knowing that they hate me.

1271
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:22,390
我肯定会更开心一点
Or that I lied and betrayed them all.

1272
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:26,520
我真想念无知的时候
I miss being ignorant.

1273
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:31,440
我们还是就回归原来的样子
So let's just, you know, go back to the way things were,

1274
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,400
只有一件事变了
with one change.

1275
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:36,150
从现在起我要当敲锣人
I'll be the gong ringer from now on.

1276
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:38,820
也许用我的头去敲那玩意
Maybe banging my head into that thing

1277
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:41,410
能让我忘记这些感觉
will make all of these feelings go away.

1278
01:08:41,490 --> 01:08:44,490
没错  你可能会变得麻木  什么都感觉不到
Oh, yeah. You'll pretty much go numb. You won't feel a thing.

1279
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:47,290
很好  因为我感觉我是个混蛋
Good. Because I feel like such a jerk.

1280
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:54,630
好吧
Okay.

1281
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:57,010
你还记得我给你的建议吧
Now, you remember the advice I gave you, right?

1282
01:08:57,170 --> 01:09:00,770
首先  检查风向  一点风就能把你吹得偏离正轨
First, check the wind. Pretty easy to get blown off course.

1283
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:03,060
风向  没问题
Wind, check.

1284
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:05,890
然后你得瞄准你的目标
And you gotta true your aim.

1285
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:08,900
如果不瞄准  那肯定不会成功
You'll never succeed if your aim isn't true.

1286
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:11,110
目标  没问题
Aim, check.

1287
01:09:11,310 --> 01:09:12,480
别忘了
And don't forget.

1288
01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:14,350
即使你知道会很疼
Even though you know it's gonna hurt,

1289
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:16,900
你也得用脑袋径直撞上去
you gotta hit it head-on.

1290
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:25,080
他在里面
He's in there.

1291
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,120
她也在里面
She's in there.

1292
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,370
但是
But...

1293
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:31,170
你已经叫醒了村民们  儿子
You already woke the village, son.

1294
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,500
别让他们再睡回去了
Now, go make sure they stay awake.

1295
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,250
我爱你  爸爸
I love you, Dad.

1296
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:39,920
我也爱你  儿子
I love you, too, son.

1297
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,720
来  说出那个词吧
Now, say the word.

1298
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:44,430
发射
Launch!

1299
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,150
咪琪  我很...
Meechee, I am so...

1300
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,030
不
Oh, no.

1301
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:03,700
咪琪
Meechee?

1302
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:05,030
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

1303
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:17,040
咪琪
Meechee.

1304
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:18,170
小脚怪在哪里
Where's the smallfoot?

1305
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,800
坚持住  小家伙  你马上到家了
Hold on, little guy, okay? You're almost home.

1306
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,390
咪琪带走了小脚怪
Yeah, uh, so Meechee took the smallfoot.

1307
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,070
她说我有愤怒管理问题
And, uh, convinced me I have a lot of anger issues

1308
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:43,070
因为什么恋父情结
because of something called a father complex.

1309
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:46,280
我不知道  就是因为小时候没有被抱够
I don't know. Something about not getting enough hugs as a kid.

1310
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:50,580
我现在在进行非常认真的治疗  爸爸
Really doing some serious processing right now, Dad.

1311
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,790
我都做了什么
What have I done?

1312
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,590
开门
Open the door!

1313
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:00,130
伙计们
Guys!

1314
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:03,220
伙计们  你们得帮帮我
Guys! You have to help me!

1315
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,340
咪琪带着小脚怪去云层下了
Meechee's taken the smallfoot below the clouds!

1316
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,350
听着  对不起  我说的那些话都不是故意的
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean what I said.

1317
01:11:10,430 --> 01:11:13,060
等我们找到咪琪  我都能解释
I can explain everything, after we find Meechee.

1318
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:15,320
她有危险  你们要相信我
She's in danger. You have to believe me!

1319
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:19,700
我们为什么要相信你  你撒谎  朋友不会撒谎
Why should we believe you? You lied. Friends don't do that.

1320
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:21,110
或者背后捅刀
Or stab you in the back

1321
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:23,820
在所有村民面前说你是疯子
and call you crazy in front of the whole village.

1322
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,990
你就像我一样  我本来期待你能更好的
You acted like me. I expect more from you.

1323
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,830
你们说的对  我撒谎了
You're right. I lied.

1324
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:35,600
你们一直都在追寻真相
You know, you've always searched for the truth.

1325
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,960
不管别人怎么说
No matter what anybody said.

1326
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,120
他们笑话你  他们骂你们[叫你们名字]
They laughed at you. They called you names.

1327
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:40,500
等等  什么名字
Wait. What names?

1328
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:43,590
但你从来不会因为恐惧而停下步伐
But you never let fear get in the way.

1329
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:47,720
我也应该那样做的
That's what I should have done.

1330
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,440
所以我现在就要这么做
And it's what I'm gonna do now.

1331
01:11:56,810 --> 01:11:58,780
米果
ALL: Migo!

1332
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:03,190
等等  什么名字
Wait! What names?

1333
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:17,880
咪琪  你在哪里
Oh, Meechee, where are you?

1334
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:29,350
-蔻卡  -你好
- Kolka! - Hi!

1335
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:31,640
等等  如果你下来了  那说明...
Hi! Wait. If you're here, that means...

1336
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,520
天  真是掉了好久
Man! That is a long way down!

1337
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:40,690
伙计们
Guys!

1338
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,610
你们来了
You came!

1339
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:47,030
我们当然来了  为了咪琪
Of course, we came. For Meechee.

1340
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:50,450
当然了  我知道
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

1341
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:53,360
以及一点点为你  不过主要是咪琪
And a little bit for you. But mostly Meechee.

1342
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:55,750
谢谢你们  甚至连你  福林
Thank you. Even you, Fleem.

1343
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:56,870
等等  福林在哪里
Wait. Where's Fleem?

1344
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:59,130
好吧  分析利弊
Okay, pros and cons.

1345
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,420
利  米果需要你
Pro, Migo needs you.

1346
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,500
弊  如果你死了  对他来说就没用了
Con, you're useless to him if you're dead.

1347
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,340
弊一比利零  好的  利
Cons, one. Pros, zero. Okay. Pro.

1348
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,550
没错  福林真蠢
Yeah, Fleem sucks.

1349
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:09,470
我们等不了了
We can't wait.

1350
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:12,260
我们得赶紧赶在还没人发现咪琪之前找到她
We have to find Meechee right now before someone else does.

1351
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:17,520
真大
It's so big.

1352
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,770
我们怎么知道她落到了这里
How do we even know she landed here?

1353
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:24,240
好了  小家伙
Okay, little guy.

1354
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,900

还没死  还能走
Not dead. Raring to go.

1366

知道我冒生命危险
...know that I risked my life

1367
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,790
追寻一些非常了不起的东西

比我们更大的东西

Everyone wants you. Haven't you checked your messages?

1375
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:33,550
追寻一些非常了不起的东西
...my life in pursuit of something extraordinary.

1376

等等  雪怪到这里来了
Wait. The yeti is here?

1388
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,010
真不敢相信眼前的一切
I can't believe what I'm looking at.

1389

这真是太美了
This is incredible!

1390
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,220

1403
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:12,490
伙计们  我到处找过了  咪琪不在
Guys, I've looked everywhere. Meechee's not here.

1404
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:13,940
我觉得我找到她了

1405
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:18,400
真是太美了
Oh, this is amazing!

1406
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:29,460

1407
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:30,790
实在是太亮了
Okay, that's really bright.

1408
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:35,920
怎么回事
What is going on?

1409
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:44,900
你们为什么要这么做
Why are you doing this?

1410
01:16:57,230 --> 01:16:59,110
咪琪  我们来了  没事了
Meechee! We're here. It's okay.

1411
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,620
谢谢
Thank you.

1412
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:02,410
其实有事  我们现在面对最大的危机
Actually, it's not okay. We're in the worst place ever.

1413
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:03,610
但我们现在在一起
But we're together!

1414
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:04,540
-太好了  -耶
- Yes. - Yay!

1415
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:05,700
等等  福林在哪里
Wait. Where's Fleem?

1416
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:09,380
利10比弊65  太折磨人了
Pros, 10. Cons, 65. Oh, this is torture!

1417
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:11,340
-福林太可悲了  -没错
- Fleem's pathetic. - Yeah.

1418
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:12,630
-你受伤了吗  -我没事
- Are you hurt? - I'm okay.

1419
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:15,040
但是他们为什么突然都要来抓我
But why did they just turn on me like that?

1420
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:16,880
因为他们是可怕的生物
Because they're terrible creatures.

1421
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,340
你  你为什么在这里
You! Why are you here?

1422
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,970
-你很生气  -不然呢
- You're angry. - You think?

1423
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:22,550
咪琪  我非常  非常抱歉
Meechee, I'm so, so sorry.

1424
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:25,350
但是相信我  我那么说是为了保护你
But believe me, I said what I said to protect you.

1425
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:27,260
保护我  撒谎吗
Protect me? By lying?

1426
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:28,310
她说得有道理  米果
She's got a point there, Migo.

1427
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:31,350
你不是一直也在骗你爸爸吗  SES的秘密社长
Haven't you been lying to your dad, secret leader of the S.E.S.?

1428
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,480
他说得有道理  咪琪
He's got a point there, Meech.

1429
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,860
这完全不一样
This is completely different.

1430
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:36,990
再说了  你到底觉得你在保护我不受什么伤害
Besides, what did you think you were protecting me from anyway?

1431
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:38,570
不受那个
From that.

1432
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:48,870
这就是你爸爸给我看的  所以我才撒谎
This is what your dad showed me. This is why I lied.

1433
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:50,870
他们是怪物
They're monsters.

1434
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:59,140
不  他们觉得我们是怪物
No, they think we're monsters.

1435
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:02,590
伙计们  他们越来越近了
Guys, guys! Psst! They're getting closer.

1436
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:07,730
他们会找到我们的  我们怎么办
They're gonna find us. What are we gonna do?

1437
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:08,900
我们得赶紧离开
We gotta go. Now.

1438
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:11,150
他们真的全是坏人吗
Are they really all bad?

1439
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:14,030
我不知道
I don't know.

1440
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:15,860
但是我们不能傻傻地在这里等
But we can't wait around here to find out.

1441
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:56,150
他们在那里
Where are they?

1442
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:57,570
我发誓他们到这边来了
I swear they came this way.

1443
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:00,950
找到他们了
Whoa! Found them!

1444
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:02,400
不  你去哪里
Oh, no! Where are you going?

1445
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:04,320
我必须赶在他们之前找到他们
They're not gonna get them before I do!

1446
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:05,870
珀西
Percy!

1447
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:08,200
我们走  快点
Let's go. Come on.

1448
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:09,620
下来简单上去难
Getting down here was easier.

1449
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:29,430
不  米果  我们被困住了
Oh, no! Migo, we're trapped!

1450
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,010
不要被光照到
Stay out of the light!

1451
01:19:44,730 --> 01:19:46,360
整条绳子
The whole robe.

1452
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,840
我就说这些石律是保护我们的
I told you the stones were here to protect us.

1453
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:58,960
爸爸
Daddy!

1454
01:19:59,040 --> 01:19:59,960
咪琪
Meechee!

1455
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:02,010
你来找我了
You came for me.

1456
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:04,590
我当然要来了  我聆听了
Of course, I came. I listened.

1457
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:07,420
谢谢你
Thank you.

1458
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:10,560
那是什么
What are those things?

1459
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:18,900
米果  走吧  我们能逃走的
Migo, come on! We can make it.

1460
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:22,490
-快走  -你在干什么
- Go! - What are you doing?

1461
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:23,900
不能让他们跟到我们的家园
We can't let them follow us home.

1462
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:25,610
-米果  -快走
- Migo! - Just go!

1463
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:27,030

1466
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:18,330
朋友  对吗
Friends, right?

1467
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:21,250
我希望你理解我为什么要这么做
I hope you understand why I have to do this.

1468
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:25,210
不
No!

1469
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:29,210
不  他们抓住他了
Oh, no! They got him!

1470
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:31,260

不
No!

1473
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:19,180
该死  你们抓到我了
Oh, darn! You got me.

1474
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:21,100
你觉得这是什么好笑的恶作剧吗
Do you think this is some kind of joke?

1475
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,270
那得看情况了  你们觉得好笑吗
That depends. Did you think it was funny?

1476
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:25,530
只是宣传的噱头
Just a publicity stunt for ratings.

1477
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,450
混蛋
Loser.

1478
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:30,070
那不是米果  那米果在哪里
That's not Migo! So where's Migo?

1479
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:31,490
他打了我
He shot me.

1480
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:35,040
-米果  -你的小脚怪打中了你
- Migo! - You smallfoot shot me.

1481
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:37,120
我的脸麻了
I can't feel my face!

1482
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,160
等等  那他是坏人了
Wait. So he is bad?

1483
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,040
不  他不坏
No, no, he's not bad.

1484
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:43,250
我觉得他打我是为了救我
I think he shot me to save me.

1485
01:22:43,410 --> 01:22:46,260
没错  你说得对  他救了你
Yeah. You're right. He did.

1486
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:47,840
他救了我们所有人
He saved all of us.

1487
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,470
看来我的名气是黄了

1488
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:54,760
没错  但是你得到了更棒的

Huh. Where was that hiding?

1491
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:01,140
谢谢你  布兰达
Thank you, Brenda.

1492
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:04,770
你因为扰乱秩序  损坏公共财物
You're under arrest for disturbing the peace,

1493
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:06,600
违反规定
destruction of public property,

1494
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:08,190
燃放大量烟花  网络诈骗
discharging fireworks within the city limits...

1495
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:09,200
等等
Wait. Hang on.

1496
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:10,940
鬼鬼祟祟  奇装怪服
...internet fraud, loitering...

1497
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:12,360
而被捕了
...looking weird.

1498
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:39,260
我爱那个小家伙  我也爱你们
I love that little guy. I love you guys, too.

1499
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:44,480
你是那么棒  那么聪明
And you are so awesome and smart,

1500
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:47,480
我先你  我向你
and I'm meet you. I mish you.

1501
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:49,650
我香你
I mush you.

1502
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,150
我也香你  米果
I mush you, too, Migo.

1503
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:55,740
好了  我们先回家吧
Okay, everyone, let's go home.

1504
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:05,960
好了  我错过了什么
Okay, what'd I miss?

1505
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:17,340
这是我们的过去  这些是我们的祖先
This is our history. And these are our ancestors.

1506
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:19,100
曾经  雪怪都是住在
There was a time when yetis lived

1507
01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:20,550
云层之下的
beneath the clouds.

1508
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:23,100
我们搬到了这个小脚怪无法生存的高度
We came up here where the smallfoot couldn't survive.

1509
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:24,280
我本来以为
You see, I thought the

1510
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:26,520
小脚怪是我的敌人  但他却救了我们
smallfoot was my enemy. And then he saved me.

1511
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:29,020
我知道我之前说那不是小脚怪
And I know that I said it wasn't a smallfoot,

1512
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:30,650
但那不是真的
but that wasn't true.

1513
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,900
我很抱歉我骗了你们
And I'm sorry that I lied to you.

1514
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:38,780
小脚怪是真的  他们住在云层下
The smallfoot is real, and they live below the clouds.

1515
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:40,240
那些云是我们创造出来的
Clouds we make.

1516
01:24:42,570 --> 01:24:47,040
这是我们的祖先决定这么做的原因
And this is why our ancestors decided to do that.

1517
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:49,000
那是真的  你们看
That's the truth. See?

1518
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:52,920
这很复杂  也很可怕
It's complicated, and it can be scary,

1519
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:54,680
但总比活在一个谎言中好
but it's better than living a lie.

1520
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,050
好太多了
Like, way better.

1521
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,060
那我们不是从伟大的天之牦牛屁股中掉下来的
So we didn't fall out of the butt of the great sky yak?

1522
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:04,310
可能不是
Probably not.

1523
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:05,640
那我们是从谁的屁股上掉下来的
Whose butt did we fall out of?

1524
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,350
-我们回头再聊吧  -明白了
- You know what? We'll circle back. - Got it.

1525
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:09,310
现在你们知道了
So now you know.

1526
01:25:09,390 --> 01:25:11,610
我们觉得他们是怪物  他们觉得我们才是
We think they're monsters, and they think we are.

1527
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:15,030
如果我们躲起来  这一切都不会改变
And that is not gonna change by us hiding.

1528
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:17,190
我们需要沟通
We have to communicate.

1529
01:25:17,690 --> 01:25:19,820
所以现在得由我们来决定想要怎么做了
So it's up to us to decide what we wanna do.

1530
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:27,900
{\an9}*是时候了  该做些*
*It's time. Time to do*

1531
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:32,480

*Something drastic, Something new*

1532
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:36,810
*此时  此地*
*Right here snd right now*

1533
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:41,360
{\an9}*我们得想办法*
*We need to find a way somehow*

1534
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:47,330
{\an9}*该伸出手  拉近距离*
*It's about reaching out closing up the distance*

1535
01:26:47,490 --> 01:26:51,840
{\an9}*不要互相憎恨  庆祝我们的不同*
*Instead of hate, celebrate all the ways we're different*

1536
01:26:52,330 --> 01:26:56,710
{\an9}*我是乐观主义  没错我相信*
*I am optimistic, yes, I do believe*

1537
01:26:56,870 --> 01:27:00,130
{\an9}*我们能让这个世界变得更好*
*We have the power to make this world a better place*

1538
01:27:00,630 --> 01:27:05,510
{\an9}*但是如果想要改变  你我必须齐心*
*But if it's ever gonna change we gotta come together, me and you*

1539
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,810
{\an9}*互相敞开心扉*
*In a mo-oh-oh, oh-oh A moment of truth*

1540
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:11,810
{\an9}*如果想要改变
*If it's ever gonna change*

1541
01:27:11,890 --> 01:27:15,190
{\an9}*你我必须齐心*
*We gotta come together, me and you*

1542
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:19,030
{\an9}*互相敞开心扉*
*In a mo-oh-oh, oh-oh A moment of truth*

1543
01:27:26,990 --> 01:27:28,280
我没有疯
I'm not crazy!

1544
01:27:40,830 --> 01:27:43,760
利  如果你下去  你会遇到很多人
Pro, if you go down there, you'll meet lots of people.

1545
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,340
弊  你其实不喜欢很多人
Con, uh, you're not really a people person.

1546
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:47,550
这太折磨人了
Oh, this is torture!

1547
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,300
好吧  三  二...
Okay, in three, two...

1548
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:15,680

1549
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:17,980
