{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's not possible!

364
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,330
只是青春期
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's just puberty.

365
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,200
那是只正常蜘蛛  我是个正常孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's a normal spider and I'm a normal kid!

366
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,640
厉害
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}All right!

367
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,830
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}那天晚些时候

368
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,030
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}迈尔斯寻找着答案

369
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,850
我得告诉谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I gotta tell someone.

370
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,490
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}收藏  爸爸妈妈

371
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,670
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}爸爸

372
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,500
好吧  你在发疯  迈尔斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, you're being crazy, Miles.

373
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,540
你是在发疯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're being crazy.

374
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,840
找到那只蜘蛛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Find the spider.

375
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,450
你就会明白了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You'll see.

376
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,660
是只普通蜘蛛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's a normal spider.

377
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:51,870
这只蜘蛛都正常到无聊了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's, like, boring how normal this spider is.

378
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,880
我为什么会遇到这种事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why is this happening to me?

379
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,590
等等  我在做什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Slow down! What am I doing?

380
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,090
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}炼金术公司

381
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,730
这边
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Way over there.

382
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,890
你跟我一样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're like me.

383
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,730
迈尔斯  小心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Miles. Look out.

384
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,430
我不想做个英雄
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't wanna be a hero.

385
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,500
迈尔斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Miles.

386
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,270
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}小心

387
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,670
诺曼  听我说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Norman, listen to me.

388
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,410
蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Spider-Man?

389
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,350
我不能允许你打开通往另一个维度的传送门
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I cannot let you open a portal to another dimension.

390
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,450
这不符合布鲁克林的分区法
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Brooklyn is not zoned for that.

391
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,590
这我说了不算
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's not up to me.

392
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,320
那是绿魔吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Is that Green Goblin?!

393
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,860
你为什么不肯放弃
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why won't you quit?!

394
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,790
我想我是希望布鲁克林不被吸入黑洞
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I guess I like Brooklyn not being sucked into a black hole.

395
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,490
我还是走吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I think I'm gonna go.

396
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,430
斯塔顿岛我不太介意  但布鲁克林不行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Staten Island, maybe. Not Brooklyn.

397
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,570
不要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No! No!

398
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,300
又什么啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What now?

399
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,730
这什么地方
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What is this place?

400
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,560
你知道你鞋带没系好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Did you know your shoes are untied?

401
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,700
这是件连体衣
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This is a onesie,

402
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,630
所以我没这种问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}so I don't really have to worry about it.

403
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,670
我以为我是唯一一个  你跟我一样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I thought I was the only one. You're like me.

404
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,110
但我不想要这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't wanna be.

405
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,010
我觉得你是没选择的  孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't think you have a choice, kiddo.

406
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,580
你现在心里肯定很乱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Got a lot going through your head, I'm sure.

407
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,880
是啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

408
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,420
你会没事的  我可以帮你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're gonna be fine. I can help you.

409
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,790
如果你留下  我会教你怎么做
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}If you stick around, I can show you the ropes.

410
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,120
好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

411
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,460
我得先赶紧去摧毁这台大机器
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I just need to destroy this big machine real quick

412
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,530
以免时空连续性崩塌
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}before the space-time continuum collapses.

413
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,500
待着别动
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't move.

414
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,100
回见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}See you in a bit.

415
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,480
他怎么做到的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How does he do that?

416
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,020
这里吗  不  是这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Is it here? No, no, it's here.

417
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,450
好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}All right, folks.

418
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,590
我总插反
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I always get this wrong.

419
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,820
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}炼金术公司

420
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,990
糟糕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, boy.

421
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:05,960
徘徊者
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Prowler.

422
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,870
哥们  我正忙着呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Man, I was in the middle of something.

423
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,040
我好累啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I am so tired.

424
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,910
你是生我气了吗  你似乎是生我气了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Are you mad at me? I feel like you're mad at me.

425
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,590
就这点本事吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That all you got?

426
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,690
恶心死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Aw, so gross.

427
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,820
我该上去帮他的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I should go up there and help him.

428
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,590
我骗谁呢  我才不该那么做呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who am I kidding? I should not do that.

429
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,070
小心  蜘蛛侠来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Watch out. Here comes the Spider-Man.

430
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,070
喜欢我的新玩具吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You like my new toy?

431
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:56,510
花了好多钱  但反正那东西死了也用不着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Cost me a fortune, but, hey, can't take it with you, right?

432
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,780
你大老远跑来看测试
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You came all this way. Watch the test.

433
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,210
流光溢彩的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's a hell of a freaking light show.

434
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,150
你肯定喜欢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're gonna love this.

435
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,550
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}探针启动

436
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,060
不  别这么做  停下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No! No, don't do this! Stop!

437
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,530
你不知道会有什么结果  你会害死所有人的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You don't know what it can do! You'll kill us all!

438
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,040
多个维度打开了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I see multiple dimensions opening!

439
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:35,010
三  四  五个不同的维度
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That was three, four and five separate dimensions.

440
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,020
但状态不稳定  我们该停下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's unstable! We should stop.

441
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,000
诺曼  你对头部创伤怎么看
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Norm, what's your take on head trauma?

442
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,840
我警告你了  伙计
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I tried to warn you, pal.

443
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,050
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}警告

444
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,690
绿魔  不  把他拿开
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Goblin, no! Get him outta there!

445
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,800
威尔森  你在哪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Wilson! Where are we?

446
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,570
好奇怪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Really weird.

447
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,940
威尔森
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Wilson!

448
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,940
你没事吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Are you okay?

449
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,970
我没事  我就是在休息
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm just resting.

450
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,640
-你能起来吗  -嗯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Can't you get up? - Yeah.

451
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,840
嗯  我总能起来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, I always get up.

452
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,680
咳嗽可能不是好现象
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The coughing's probably not a good sign.

453
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,720
找到他  快
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Find him. Now.

454
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,020
听着  我们得合作  我们时间不多了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Listen, we gotta team up here. We don't have that much time.

455
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,890
这把覆写钥匙是中止对撞机的唯一办法
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This override key is the only way to stop the collider.

456
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:26,590
飞上去  插入钥匙  按下按钮  把它炸飞
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Swing up there, use this key, push the button and blow it up.

457
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,930
你得把脸遮住
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You need to hide your face.

458
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,160
不要把你的身份告诉别人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You don't tell anyone who you are.

459
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:33,230
绝不能让人知道  他控制了所有人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No one can know. He's got everyone in his pocket.

460
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,100
-什么  -如果他再次开启机器
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What? - If he turns the machine on again,

461
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,040
你所知的一切都会消失
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}everything you know will disappear.

462
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,970
你的家人  所有人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Your family, everyone.

463
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,370
每一个人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Everyone.

464
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,780
向我保证你会做到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Promise me you'll do this.

465
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,650
我保证
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I promise.

466
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,620
去吧  摧毁对撞机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Go. Destroy the collider.

467
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,090
我会去找你的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'll come and find you.

468
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,990
没事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's gonna be okay.

469
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
墓石
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Tombstone.

470
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,000
测试到此为止
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We're done with tests.

471
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:12,970
准备好再次启动它  尽快
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Get that thing ready to go again. And soon.

472
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,940
跑快点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Run faster!

473
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,680
这些人真没用
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}These guys are weak.

474
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,410
我倒想说很高兴再见到你  蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'd say it's nice to see you again, Spider-Man,

475
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,780
但我不高兴
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but it's not.

476
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,280
金并  生意好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, Kingpin. How's business?

477
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,880
好极了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Boomin'.

478
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:27,220
好啊  这可不行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Nice. Aw, that's a no-no.

479
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,820
这会在布鲁克林下面打开黑洞的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This might open a black hole under Brooklyn.

480
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,260
这样的险不值得冒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It can't be worth the risk.

481
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,100
并不总是为了钱  蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's not always about the money, Spider-Man.

482
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,930
你不想知道我在那里看到了什么吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't you wanna know what I saw in there?

483
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,010
等等
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Wait.

00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,710
你能想象吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Could you imagine?

607
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:45,880
一只海马  遇见另一只海马
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}A seahorse seeing another seahorse

608
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,780
然后一直在一起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and then making it work?

609
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,720
她想要孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}She wanted kids and...

610
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,550
这把我吓坏了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And it scared me.

611
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:52,420
{\an8\bord0\fs18\b1}呼叫玛丽·简

612
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,420
{\an8\bord0\fs18\b1}呼叫结束

613
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,520
我确信我伤了她的心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm pretty sure I broke her heart.

614
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,890
快进  我在我的公寓里做着俯卧撑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Flash-forward: I'm in my apartment doing push-ups,

615
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,930
做着仰卧起坐  正健着身
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}doing ab crunches, getting strong,

616
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,300
然后就发生了这件怪事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}when this weird thing happened.

617
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,630
我必须说一句  我身上经常发生怪事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I gotta say, weird things happen to me a lot.

618
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,600
但这次是真的诡异
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But this was real weird.

619
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,050
你瞧  我依旧在纽约  但一切都不一样了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You see, I was in New York, but things were different.

620
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,750
而且  我死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Also, I was dead.

621
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:04,090
{\an8\bord0\fs18\b1}纽约英雄  蜘蛛侠  被发现死亡  享年26岁

622
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,420
还变成了金发
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And blond.

623
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,660
几乎是一副完美的样子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I was kind of perfect.

624
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:09,460
简直就像是照镜子一样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It was like looking in a mirror.

625
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,930
我有种感觉  那个把我拽到这里的东西
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I have a feeling that the thing that brought me here

626
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:15,830
就是害死他的东西
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}was the thing that got him killed.

627
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,870
你想知道接下来发生了什么吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You wanna know what happened next?

628
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,410
我也想知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Me, too.

629
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:24,880
你是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who are you?

630
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,850
你在那边干什么呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What are you doin' over there?

631
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,310
不许动  纽约警局
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Freeze! P.D.N.Y.

632
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,390
站住
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Stop!

633
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,420
你是在逗我吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Are you kidding me right now?

634
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,890
站住  站住
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Stop! Stop!

635
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,590
跟我走  跟我走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I gotcha. I gotcha.

636
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,400
小子  放下尸体
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, kid. Drop the body.

637
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,530
-小子  到这边来  -快过来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Hey, kid. Get over here! - Come on, now!

638
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:51,640
再见  警官们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}See you, officers!

639
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,910
拜托
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Aw, come on.

640
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,010
-小子  -小子  快过来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Hey, kid. - Kid, come on, now!

641
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,720
举起手  小子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Put 'em up, son!

642
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,120
再见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Adiós?

643
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:10,800
{\an8\bord0\fs18\b1}彼得·帕克

644
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,930
救命  让列车停下来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Help! Somebody stop that train!

645
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,110
搞什么...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What the...?

646
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,490
抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Sorry.

647
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:45,430
我要死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm gonna die!

648
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,900
看起来像是一个小孩扮成蜘蛛侠的样子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Looks like a child dressed like Spider-Man

649
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,000
拖着一个流浪汉的尸体吊在列车后面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}dragging a homeless corpse behind a train.

650
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,540
太好了  我没要了你的命
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yes! I didn't kill you.

651
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,540
-你是谁  -你又是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Who are you? - Who are you?

652
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,710
你为什么想要杀了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why are you trying to kill me?

653
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,480
我没有  我是想救你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm not. I'm trying to save you.

654
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:24,030
麻烦大家绕一下好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, maybe you guys can go around?

655
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:27,670
好的  谢谢你  纽约
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}All right. Thanks, New York.

656
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,540
那是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What was that?

657
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,080
小孩电击了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Kid electrocuted me

658
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,950
用他的手
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}with his hands.

659
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,750
-你跟我一样  -我有问题问你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- You're like me. - I got some questions.

660
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,090
你为什么长得像彼得·帕克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why do you look like Peter Parker?

661
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,100
因为我就是彼得·帕克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Because I am Peter Parker.

662
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,970
那你为什么没死  还有你的头发为什么变了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Then why aren't you dead? And why is your hair different?

663
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:06,540
你为什么变老了  连体型也不一样了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why are you older? And why is your body a different shape?

664
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,770
你是说我胖吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Pretty sure you just called me fat.

665
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,240
不不  只是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, no, just...

666
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,740
听着  你看上去也没有多型嘛  小子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, listen. You don't look so hot either, kid.

667
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,880
大部分超级英雄都不会穿自己的周边
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Most superheroes don't wear their own merch.

668
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,010
-你是鬼魂吗  -不是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Are you a ghost? - No.

669
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,140
-你是僵尸吗  -闭嘴
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Are you a zombie? - Stop it.

670
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,670
-那是我变成了僵尸吗  -猜得太离谱了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Am I a zombie? - You're not even close.

671
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,090
你是从另一个维度来的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Are you from another dimension?

672
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:18,690
比如一个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Like a parallel universe

673
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,220
和这个宇宙差不多但又不同的平行宇宙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}where things are like this universe but different?

674
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,090
而你是那个宇宙的蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And you're Spider-Man in that universe?

675
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,990
但不知怎么的来了这个宇宙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But somehow traveled to this universe,

676
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,160
而你不清楚原因
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but you don't know how?

677
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,790
你那真的只是随口一猜吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That was really just a guess?

678
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,660
我们在物理课上学过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We learned about it in physics.

679
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,700
-量子力学  -这简直是太棒了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Quantum theory. - This is amazing!

680
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,770
你可以像彼得承诺的那样教我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You can teach me like Peter said he would.

681
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:34,870
他死之前承诺的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Before he died.

682
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,130
-没错  -可不是嘛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Yeah. Exactly. - Yeah, right.

683
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,900
听着  我向他保证过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, I made a promise to him.

684
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,600
这是第一课  小子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Here's lesson number one, kid.

685
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:42,710
别光注意嘴  要注意手
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't watch the mouth. Watch the hands.

686
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,180
彼得  认真的...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Peter, seriously...

687
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,220
相信我  小子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Trust me, kid.

688
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,550
这一切都会让你成为更好的蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This'll all make you a better Spider-Man.

689
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,260
你还好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, are you okay?

690
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,660
不  我不好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, I'm not.

691
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,060
你的身体出什么问题了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What's going on with your body?

692
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,960
我觉得我的原子不太乐意
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't think my atoms are real jazzed

693
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,730
来到这个错误的维度
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}about being in the wrong dimension.

694
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:14,310
听着  我不想找份当蜘蛛侠教练的兼职
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, I'm not looking for a side gig as a Spider-Man coach.

695
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:16,610
我在我那个维度有好多事要做
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I got a lot going on in my dimension.

696
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,710
能力越大  责任...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"With great power comes great..."

697
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,310
你敢把这句话说完试试
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't you dare finish that sentence.

698
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:22,080
不许说  我受够了这句话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't do it! I'm sick of it.

699
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,850
想听我的建议吗  回去做个普通孩子吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Want my advice? Go back to being a regular kid.

700
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,020
我没有选择
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't have a choice!

701
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,590
金并有台超级对撞机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Kingpin's got a supercollider.

702
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,020
他想杀了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's tryin' to kill me.

703
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:35,090
-你刚刚说了什么  -金并想要杀了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What did you just say? - Kingpin's tryin' to kill me.

704
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,190
谁关心那个呀  那台对撞机在哪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who cares about that. Where's the collider?

705
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,060
布鲁克林  菲斯克大厦底下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Brooklyn. Under Fisk Tower.

706
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,230
-再见  -你要去哪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Goodbye. - Where you going?

707
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:40,850
等机器再次启动的时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}When it runs again,

708
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:41,950
我就跳进去回到我的世界
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'll jump in and get back to my life.

709
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,330
你不能让他们启动机器
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You can't let them run it.

710
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,900
我应该把它毁了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm supposed to destroy it

711
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,970
这样它就再也没法启动  不然所有人都会死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}so it never runs again or everyone's gonna die.

712
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:50,640
"不然所有人都会死"  他们总是这么说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"Or everyone's gonna die." That is what they always say.

713
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,650
但在所有人死之前总有那么一点时间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But there's always a little bit of time before everybody dies

714
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,010
那时就该我上场了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and that's when I do my best work.

715
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,710
你难道不需要这个吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Aren't you gonna need this?

716
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,320
你有个小装置  拿来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Aw, you have a goober. Give it.

717
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,790
等等  不行  别急  他称之为覆写钥匙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Wait, no. Not so fast. He called it an override key.

718
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,720
总是有这么一把绕路钥匙  病毒钥匙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}There's always a bypass key, a virus key,

719
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,380
随便一把什么钥匙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}a who-cares key.

720
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,860
我总是记不住
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I can never remember,

721
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,090
所以把它们统称为小装置  拿来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}so I always call it a goober. Give it.

722
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:08,830
我需要用它去毁灭对撞机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I need it to destroy the collider.

723
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,230
我需要用它回家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I need it to go home.

724
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,830
不  我会把它吞下去的  别耍我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No! I'll swallow it. Don't play with me.

725
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,970
-什么  -我说...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What? - I said...

726
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:16,370
对撞机创造了一个传送门把我带到了这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The collider created a portal that brought me here.

727
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:18,000
而我得...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I have to get...

728
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,450
你是把它弄坏了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Did you break this?

729
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:22,140
没有  它自己坏了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, it broke.

730
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,770
我不记得发生了什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't remember what happened.

731
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,310
瞧  这就是为什么我不要孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}See, this is why I never had kids.

732
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:26,880
我们不能再做一把吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Can't we make another one?

733
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,200
不  我们什么也做不了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No. We can't do anything.

734
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,980
拜你所赐  我得去炼金术公司
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thanks to you, I have to re-steal

735
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,880
把你的蜘蛛侠偷过的东西再偷一次
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}what your guy stole from Alchemax

736
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:34,750
然后重新做一把
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and make another one of these.

737
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,790
如果在你离开之后我不把对撞机关掉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}If I don't turn off the collider after you leave,

738
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,070
这座城市里的每一个人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}everyone in this city,

739
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,590
我爸妈  我叔叔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}my parents, my uncle

740
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,160
还有上百万其他人都会死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and millions of others, will die.

741
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,830
你就打算这样一走了之
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And you're just gonna go home

742
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:45,130
把我留在这里让我自己处理这件事吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and leave me here to figure this out for myself?

743
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:48,100
-你觉得可以  蜘蛛侠  -嗯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- You good with that, Spider-Man? - Yeah.

744
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:59,340
你在干什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What are you doing?

745
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:03,710
让你产生罪恶感  起作用了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Making you feel guilty. Is it working?

746
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,980
怎么可能...  没有  你看看我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How could it...? No. Look at me.

747
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,750
看着像是起作用了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Does it look like it's working?

748
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:11,290
不  不  没有...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No. No, it's not...

749
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:17,930
不  不  不  不能让他赢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No! No! No! Do not let him win!

750
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,370
行吧  小子  你赢了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}All right, kid. You win.

751
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:22,870
来吧  我们一秒都不能浪费
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Come on, we don't have a second to lose.

752
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:25,700
我爱这个汉堡  太好吃了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I love this burger. So delicious.

753
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:27,670
这是我吃过的最好吃的汉堡之一
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}One of the best burgers I've ever had.

754
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,340
在我那个宇宙  这地方六年前倒闭了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}In my universe, this place closed six years ago.

755
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,210
我不知道为什么  真的想不通
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't know why. I really don't.

756
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,950
你有带钱吧  我现在手头不是很宽裕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You have money, right? I'm not very liquid right now.

757
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,750
-我们能集中注意力吗  -当然
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Can we focus? - Mm-hm. Sure.

758
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,290
-另一个彼得...  -你的还吃吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- The other Peter... - You gonna eat that?

759
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,720
我听着呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm listening.

760
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:48,230
另一个彼得答应要教我怎么做
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The other Peter said he was gonna be showing me the ropes.

761
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,960
你现在有什么蜘蛛侠小贴士可以告诉我吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You got any Spider-Man tips you can tell me now?

762
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,960
嗯  我有一堆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, I got plenty.

763
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,400
给面具消毒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Disinfect the mask.

764
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,870
在紧身衣里撒点爽身粉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're gonna wanna use baby powder in the suit,

765
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:57,070
关节处多撒点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}heavy on the joints.

766
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,240
你可不想磨破吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You don't want any chafing, right?

767
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,740
-还有吗  -没有了  以上就是全部的了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Anything else? - Nope, that was everything.

768
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,440
我觉得你会是个糟糕的老师
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I think you're gonna be a bad teacher.

769
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,980
查查炼金术公司在哪里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look up where Alchemax is.

770
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:09,350
"纽约哈德森谷里的一座私人科技园"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"A private technological campus in Hudson Valley, New York."

771
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:12,120
你可以在过去的路上教我怎么荡
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You can teach me to swing on the way there.

772
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,790
我才不要一路荡去哈德森谷呢  迈尔斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm not swinging to the Hudson Valley, Miles.

773
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:19,730
特别是在饱餐了一顿汉堡早餐之后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Not after a hearty burger breakfast.

774
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:22,030
省点腿力  你等下会感谢我的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Keep your legs fresh. You're gonna thank me later.

775
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,200
♪I can see a new horizon♪

776
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,030
♪Underneath the blazing sky♪

777
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,200
♪I'll be where the eagle's flying higher...♪

778
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:33,370
-不要披披风  -我觉得很酷
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- And it's a no on the cape. - I think it's cool.

779
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:35,110
脱掉  那样太不礼貌了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Take that off. It's disrespectful.

780
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:37,080
蜘蛛侠不披披风
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Spider-Man doesn't wear a cape.

781
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,080
{\an8\bord0\fs18\b1}炼金术公司

782
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,180
所以我们要如何追溯彼得的脚步
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So how do we retrace Peter's steps?

783
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,150
问得好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's a good question.

784
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:44,990
如果我是我的话  我会怎么做
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What would I do if I were me?

785
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,150
有了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Got it.

786
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:49,150
第一步  我溜进实验室
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Step One: I infiltrate the lab.

787
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,120
二  找到首席科学家的电脑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Two: Find the head scientist's computer.

788
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,330
那个推自行车的女士就是首席科学家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That lady with the bike is the head scientist.

789
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:55,170
-我在学校放的纪录片里见过她  -棒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- I saw her in this documentary at school. - Cool!

790
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,830
第三步  我再次检查我的衣服穿没穿好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Step Three: I reexamine my personal biases.

791
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,060
第四步  我黑进电脑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Step Four: I hack the computer.

792
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:00,400
那其实不算黑进去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's not technically hacking.

793
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,430
现在不是时候  等等  我的思绪一下断了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Not now. Hold on. I just lost my train of thought.

794
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,370
第五步  下载那个重要的东西
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Step Five: Download the important stuff.

795
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,170
我一眼就能看出来哪个重要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'll know it when I see it.

796
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:09,040
第六步  我从餐厅拿个百吉饼然后开跑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Step Six: I grab a bagel from the cafeteria and run.

797
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,810
那我要干什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So, what am I doing?

798
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,940
第七步  你留在这里放哨  这非常重要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Step Seven: You stay here. You're lookout. Very important.

799
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:16,550
听着老兄  你必须教我怎么做蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, man. You gotta teach me how to do Spider-Man stuff

800
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,150
不然我没办法帮上忙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}or I won't be able to help.

801
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:22,250
好好看好好学  小子  我晚点考你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Watch and learn, kid! I'll quiz ya later!

802
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,530
我为什么会和这个差劲的潦倒失业老蜘蛛侠困在一起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why did I get stuck with the janky, old, broke hobo Spider-Man?!

803
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,930
那倒是新鲜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's new.

804
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,240
金并
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Kingpin.

805
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,440
我在干什么  我在干什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What am I doing? What am I doing?

806
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,380
我在干什么  我在干什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What am I doing? What am I doing?

807
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:08,000
彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Peter!

808
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,830
彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Peter!

809
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,200
彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Peter!

810
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:13,310
-你在这里干什么  -金并来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What are you doing here? - Kingpin's here.

811
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:14,840
过去点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Just move over.

812
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,540
你踩到我的脚了  到外面去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're steppin' on my foot. Go back outside.

813
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:20,040
不行  我不能袖手旁观
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No! I can't sit there and let Spider-Man die

814
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,510
眼睁睁看着蜘蛛侠去死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}without doing anything about it.

815
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,020
我不要再经历一遍了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm not doing that again.

816
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:25,620
怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What?

817
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:29,590
我工作时遇到的大部分人都想杀了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Most people I meet in the workplace try to kill me, so...

818
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:31,260
换成你这样的也不错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}you're a nice change of pace.

819
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,560
菲斯克先生  看看这个数据
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Mr. Fisk! Look at this data.

820
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,460
我知道你并不能真正理解
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I know you can't really understand it,

821
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,130
但这些数据都很不错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but these are really good numbers.

822
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:40,970
我记住密码了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I got the password.

823
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:43,400
菲斯克先生  如果我们这周再次启动
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Mr. Fisk. If we fire again this week

824
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,040
可能会在布鲁克林下面出现一个黑洞
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}there could be a black hole under Brooklyn.

825
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,570
你看到这个了吗  还有这个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You see this? And this?

826
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:51,440
这是多维空间开始相互挤压
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This is multiple dimensions beginning to crash into each other.

827
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,610
这是挺标准的蜘蛛侠冒险
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This is pretty standard Spider-Man stakes.

828
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:55,380
你会习惯的  看着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You get used to it. Watch this.

829
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,220
他会说  "你有24小时"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's gonna say, "You've got 24 hours."

830
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:59,520
你有24小时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You've got 24 hours.

831
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,620
这意味着在时空连续区
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What this means is there could be a rupture

832
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,120
可能出现断裂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}in the space-time continuum.

833
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,360
那可糟糕了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's bad.

834
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,960
实际上  她说的每一句话都很糟糕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Actually, everything she said was bad.

835
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,960
我刚刚撒谎了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I was lying before.

836
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,310
好吧  等等  让我再给你一些数据
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay. Hold on. Let me get you some more data.

837
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:22,970
-你在干什么  伙计  -我动不了了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What are you doing, bud? - I can't move.

838
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,480
好了  放松你的手指
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, relax your fingers.

839
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,510
我们没时间了  放手吧  活在当下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We don't have time. Just let go. Be in the moment.

840
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,610
我正在当下呢  是个糟糕的当下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I am in the moment. It's a terrible moment.

841
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,280
-我不是想拒绝  -别再找借口了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- I'm not refusing. - No more excuses.

842
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:33,950
我只是需要多一点时间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I just need more time.

843
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:36,050
他们就在门外  他们会看见你的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They're right there. They're gonna see you.

844
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,990
迈尔斯  别粘着了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Miles, you gotta unstick.

845
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:39,920
你平时是怎么放松的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What do you do to relax?

846
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:43,030
放松  好吧好吧好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Relax. Okay, okay, okay.

847
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:46,160
更不用说  我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Needless to say, I...

848
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:48,200
我的老天爷
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, for crying out loud.

849
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,970
就此打住吧  宝贝  我整个一团糟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck.

850
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:55,340
你也一团糟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're a wreck, ooh...

851
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:00,050
青少年最可怕了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Teenagers: just the worst.

852
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,680
-迈尔斯  你去哪了  -我就在这呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Miles, where did you go? - I'm right here.

853
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,120
-哪里  我看不见你  -我就在你面前
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Where? I can't see ya. - I'm right in front of you.

854
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,650
-蜘蛛侠能隐形吗  -在我的宇宙不能
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Can Spider-Man turn invisible? - Not in my universe.

855
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,560
你刚刚戳中我的眼睛了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You just poked me in my eye!

856
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,330
这太不可思议了  像是某种打或逃机制
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This is incredible. Some kind of fight or flight thing.

857
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:16,260
那是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What's that?

858
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:21,600
记住密码  大写的DGFAMPESAND
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Remember this password. D-G-F-A-M-P-E-S-A-N-D...

859
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,600
慢点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Slow down!

860
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,040
4$3587653454535
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}-4-$-3-5-8-7-6-5-3-4-5-4-5-3-5.

861
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,340
-我得拿笔记下来  -下载电路图
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- I need to write it down! - Download the schematic.

862
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,910
-我要怎么做  -我要使出美男计了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- How do I do that? - While I turn on the charm.

863
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,150
蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Spider-Man?

864
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:36,750
刚才没看见你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Didn't see you there.

865
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:40,320
我现在有点惊慌失措
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, I'm kinda freaking out right now.

866
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,150
你应该死了才对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, you're supposed to be dead.

867
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,460
没想到吧  好了  这可不行  我们不喜欢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Surprise! Okay. That's a no-no. We don't like that.

868
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,230
太迷人了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This is fascinating.

869
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:48,990
好了  这是我的脸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, that's my face.

870
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,230
完全不同的彼得·帕克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}An entirely different Peter Parker.

871
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:54,060
有点小肚腩  也许是因为时空扭曲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Little bit of a gut, perhaps from dimensional warping.

872
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:56,600
对对对  我扭曲之前苗条多了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah. I was way flatter before I warped.

873
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,470
穿过多重宇宙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Travel through the multiverse

874
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:00,470
似乎恶化了...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}appears to have deteriorated the...

875
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:02,540
剩下的几位是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What was the rest?!

876
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,540
你多大了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, how old are you?

877
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:08,180
你看起来可不像35岁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}'Cause you don't look a day over 35.

878
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,750
他们说我疯了  他们说我疯了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They said I was crazy! They said I was crazy!

879
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,650
你就得让他们看看  你没疯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You showed 'em you're not crazy.

880
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,390
这可能会有点疼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This might pinch a little.

881
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,360
我知道  我只是必须取些样本
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I know. I just need to get these samples.

882
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,590
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay.

883
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:22,390
整理一下桌面好吗  女士
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Organize your desktop, lady.

884
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,370
细胞完全衰退
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Just complete cellular decay.

885
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,330
我从没见过这样的案例
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I've never seen anything like this.

886
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:29,570
你在搞什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What are you doing?

887
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,500
我把整台电脑一起搬走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm just taking the whole thing.

888
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,300
很显然你出了故障
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And obviously you've been glitching.

889
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:36,440
"故障"  不  你为什么这么说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"Glitchin'"? No. Why would you even say that?

890
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,380
如果你在这个维度待得太久
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}If you stay in this dimension too long,

891
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,040
你的身体将会瓦解
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}your body's gonna disintegrate.

892
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:42,050
你知道那会有多痛苦吗  彼得·帕克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Do you know how painful that would be, Peter Parker?

893
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,050
不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't know.

894
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:45,150
你无法想象
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You can't imagine.

895
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:48,990
而我  已经等不及想看了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I, for one, can't wait to watch.

896
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,490
你说你叫什么来着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What did you say your name was?

897
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:54,360
奥利维亚·奥克塔维斯博士
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Dr. Olivia Octavius.

898
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:04,840
我大胆猜下  你的朋友是叫你章鱼博士吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Can I assume that your friends call you Doc Ock?

899
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,270
我的朋友叫我小维
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}My friends actually call me Liv.

900
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:09,710
我的敌人才叫我章鱼博士
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}My enemies call me Doc Ock.

901
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,280
有我呢  跑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I got this! Run!

902
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,340
你在跟谁说话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who are you talking to?

903
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:18,220
-有我呢  -"有我呢"  彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- I got it! - Oh, you "Got it," Peter?

904
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,660
我能解决  伙计
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I got it handled, buddy!

905
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,160
一切都好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Everything is fine!

906
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,300
-好吧  这有点不妙  -你话真多
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Okay, this is a little bit bad. - You're chatty.

907
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,170
得走了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Gotta go.

908
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:37,470
我就是从这一刻开始落下风
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This is the moment that I'm losin' the fight.

909
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,670
我告诉你个好消息吧  我们不需要显示器
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Let me tell you the good news. We don't need the monitor.

910
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,180
彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Peter!

911
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:48,850
你没告诉我你有个隐形的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You didn't tell me you had an invisible friend!

912
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:50,780
你能把它还给我吗  年轻人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Could you give me that back, young man?

913
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,780
彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Peter!

914
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:55,220
这是专有物品
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's proprietary.

915
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,360
-现在是隐身的完美时机  -是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- This'd be a good time to turn invisible. - Yep.

916
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,560
好吧  不隐形了  选个百吉饼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, not gonna turn invisible. Selecting a bagel.

917
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:09,270
举止正常点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Act super normal.

918
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:10,400
蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Spider-Man?

919
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,600
说来有趣
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You know, that's funny,

920
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,300
这话我经常听到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I get that a lot.

921
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:15,540
-蜘蛛侠  -举起手来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Spider-Man? - Hey! Hands up!

922
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:16,840
-我们来换个手  -什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Now we do a switchy-switchy. - What?

923
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,240
回来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Get back here!

924
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,440
你们以为自己能去哪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Where do you think you're going?

925
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:21,480
-他拿了百吉饼  -该荡起来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- He took a bagel! - Time to swing,

926
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,850
-就像我教你的那样  -你什么时候教我了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- just like I taught ya. - When did you teach me that?

927
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:26,450
我没有  就是团队建设的一个小笑话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I didn't. It's a little joke for team-building.

928
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,420
-好了  准备好了吗  -当然没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- All right, you ready? - Of course I'm not ready!

929
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:33,660
我还办不到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I can't do this yet!

930
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,730
大家都知道学习的最好时机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Everybody knows that the best way to learn

931
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:37,770
就是经历生死攸关的考验的时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}is under intense life-threatening pressure.

932
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,740
快点  快点  快点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Come on, come on, come on.

933
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:55,610
你在下面做什么呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What are you doing down there?

934
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,520
我跑得比荡得快
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I run better than I swing.

935
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,620
你必须荡起来  不然他们会抓到你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You gotta swing or they'll catch you.

936
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,890
你不是一直想荡吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This is what you wanted.

937
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:17,470
快回来  小朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Come back, little boy.

938
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,840
用臀部发力  想粘哪儿就看哪儿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Aim with your hips! Look where you want it to hit.

939
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,310
挺起胸膛  别忘了带动身体
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Square your shoulders. Don't forget to follow through!

940
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:23,770
重心在后脚时不要发射
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't shoot off your back foot.

941
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:26,480
-太多了记不过来  -那就别听我的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- That's too many things! - Then stop listening to me!

942
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,550
这是你今天给出的最好建议
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's the best idea you've had all day!

943
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,160
干得好  迈尔斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Nice, Miles!

944
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,290
好  你掌握了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Good. You're doin' it.

945
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,900
点两下放手  然后再喷丝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Double tap to release and thwip it out again.

946
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,770
喷丝  放手
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thwip and release.

947
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:52,000
-喷丝  放手  喷丝  -放手
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- And thwip. Release. Thwip. - And release.

948
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,770
你很有天赋  喷丝  放手
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're a natural. Thwip. Release.

949
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:56,510
-掌握节奏了吗  -喷丝  放手
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Feel the rhythm? - Thwip. And release!

950
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:57,710
很好  迈尔斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Good, Miles.

951
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:59,810
不得不说  你教得很棒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I gotta say, you're amazing, man.

952
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:01,350
我们是个小团队了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We're a little team!

953
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,310
我是宝刀未老的老师
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Me as the teacher who could still do it.

954
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,350
你是初出茅庐的学徒  只是还没那么熟练
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You as the student who can do it, just not as good.

955
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:09,190
我为我们骄傲  你有什么想对我说的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm proud of us. Is there something you want to say to me?

956
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,290
彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Peter!

957
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:26,500
-搞什么  -谁干的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What the...? - Who did that?

958
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:54,400
伙计们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, guys.

959
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,530
格温达
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Gwanda?

960
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,330
事实上是格温
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's Gwen, actually.

961
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:00,310
你认识她  太好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, you know her. Very cool.

962
00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:02,070
我是从另一个维度来的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm from another dimension.

963
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,310
与你们都不同的维度
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, another-another dimension.

964
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:07,980
{\an8\bord0\fs18\b1}蜘蛛侠格温

965
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:07,980
好了  伙计们  最后再从头说一遍
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}All right, people. Let's start at the beginning one last time.

966
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,710
我叫格温·史黛西
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}My name is Gwen Stacy.

967
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,550
我被一只放射性蜘蛛咬了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I was bitten by a radioactive spider.

968
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:14,350
过去两年来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And for the last two years,

969
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:17,620
我一直是唯一的蜘蛛女
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I've been the one and only Spider-Woman.

970
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,560
剩下的你们都清楚了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You guys know the rest.

971
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,030
我加入了乐队
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I joined a band.

972
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:24,530
救了我爸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Saved my dad.

973
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:30,330
我没能救下我最好的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I couldn't save my best friend,

974
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:31,800
彼得·帕克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Peter Parker,

975
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:35,710
现在我要拯救其他人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}so now I save everyone else.

976
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:38,640
我不再交朋友了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I don't do friends anymore,

977
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,280
只是为了能全神贯注
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}just to avoid any distractions.

978
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:45,980
有一天  怪事发生了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And one day this weird thing happened.

979
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:49,060
真的很奇怪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I mean, like, really weird.

980
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:57,330
我被炸进了上一周
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I was blown into last week.

981
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:02,870
一点不夸张
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Literally.

982
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:06,500
我着陆在纽约  但不是我生活的纽约
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I landed in New York, but not my New York.

983
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:09,470
还好他们走运
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Lucky for these folks,

984
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,740
蜘蛛侠及时到场拯救了大家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Spider-Man was there to save the day.

985
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,910
我的蜘蛛通感告诉我前往愿景学院
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}My Spider-sense told me to head to Visions Academy.

986
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:16,910
你们来得早了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}...you guys are early.

987
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,950
当时不明白为什么  直到遇见你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Wasn't sure why until I met you.

988
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:23,120
你喜欢你的发型
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I like your haircut.

989
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,020
你没资格再跟我提这茬
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You don't get to like my haircut.

990
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,520
我们走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Let's go.

991
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:27,860
还有多少跟我们一样的蜘蛛人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How many more Spider-People are there?

992
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:29,030
等漫展再说吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Save it for Comic-Con.

993
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:31,130
漫展是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What's Comic-Con?

994
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,680
你死定了  蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're dead, Spider-Man.

995
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,880
威尔逊  你在做什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Wilson! What are you doing?

996
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:53,050
凡妮莎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Vanessa.

997
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,420
理查德  我们走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Richard, come on.

998
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:59,860
凡妮莎  理查德
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Vanessa! Richard!

999
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:01,490
不
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No!

1000
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:04,060
别回头  宝贝  没事的  没事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't look back, honey. It's okay. It's okay.

1001
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,850
我杀了蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I killed Spider-Man.

1002
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:26,920
为什么又看到了两个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why did I just see two more?

1003
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,190
事实上有三个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}There's three, actually.

1004
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:32,220
不  这是好事  这非常好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, this is good. This is very, very good.

1005
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:33,920
这意味着你能得偿所愿了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This means you get what you want.

1006
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:37,090
意味着我的对撞机好用
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It means my collider works.

1007
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:40,560
我们只要杀死几只臭蜘蛛就行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}All we have to do is kill a couple of Spiders.

1008
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:43,230
对撞机会让你的家人复活的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And the collider will bring your family back.

1009
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,840
想要多少都行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}As many families as you want.

1010
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:57,780
明天  在我的对撞机集合
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Tomorrow, at my collider.

1011
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,850
我们的对撞机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Our collider.

1012
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:04,620
他弄坏的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He broke this?

1013
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:07,160
对  他其实挺不好意思的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah. He's actually really embarrassed about it, so...

1014
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,260
所以别跟外人说  好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}just keep it between us, okay?

1015
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,500
我知道哪儿能做个新的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I know where we can make a new one.

1016
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,700
我们这次不会再让他把它弄坏了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And we won't let him break it this time.

1017
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,910
你朋友的事我很遗憾
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm sorry about your friend.

1018
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:21,810
谢了  迈尔斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thanks, Miles.

1019
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,840
我知道这有多难受
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I know how hard this is.

1020
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:28,550
必须自己琢磨明白这些事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}To have to figure this stuff out on your own.

1021
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:31,720
知道自己不是唯一一个蜘蛛侠  其实感觉还不错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's kinda nice not being the only Spider-person around.

1022
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,120
是啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

1023
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:36,950
你什么时候想再开始交朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}If you ever decide to do friends again,

1024
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,690
我永远都等着你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I could always open up a slot.

1025
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:42,860
我会让你知道的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'll keep you posted.

1026
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,900
好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Cool.

1027
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,540
我们也许应该离开
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We should probably go.

1028
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,870
彼得  我们都到门口了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Peter, we're literally on the doorstep.

1029
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:54,540
{\an8\bord0\fs18\b1}皇后区某处

1030
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:55,770
坏主意  这是个坏主意
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Bad idea. This is a bad idea.

1031
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:57,310
放松点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Just relax.

1032
00:58:57,310 --> 00:58:59,110
你们很贴心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You guys are all very sweet,

1033
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:01,580
但今天不接待粉丝了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but no more fans today, please.

1034
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,580
我还没准备好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm not ready for this.

1035
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,830
彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Peter?

1036
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:16,690
梅姨
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, Aunt May.

1037
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,730
这可能听上去很疯狂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So this is gonna sound crazy,

1038
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:21,200
但我很确定  我来自...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but I'm pretty sure that I'm from an...

1039
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,200
另一个维度
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}An alternate dimension.

1040
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,500
对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

1041
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:27,870
你看上去很累  彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You look tired, Peter.

1042
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:30,070
我确实很累
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, I am tired.

1043
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,240
-老了  厚实了  -对  这话我听过了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- And older. And thicker. - Yeah. I've heard that already.

1044
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:35,780
天呐  那是运动裤吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, jeez. Are those sweatpants?

1045
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,020
对  就是运动裤
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yup, that's what they are.

1046
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:42,290
我当时在场  彼得被杀的时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I was there, when it all happened.

1047
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,350
我很遗憾
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I am so sorry.

1048
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,620
你来自哪个维度
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And what dimension are you from?

1049
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:48,690
布鲁克林
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Brooklyn.

1050
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:51,960
彼得有没有地方让我们再做一个这个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Did Peter have a place where we could make another one of these?

1051
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,770
一个小装置
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}A goober.

1052
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,230
跟我来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Follow me.

1053
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:01,640
我也有个这地方
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, yeah, I got one of these, too.

1054
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,910
一个小破棚子  放我的蜘蛛侠装备
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}A little, old shed where I keep my Spider-gear.

1055
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,290
这地方太浮夸了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, this place is pretentious.

1056
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,700
老兄  你的棚子也这样吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Dude. Was yours anything like this?

1057
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:35,010
我的跟这很像
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Mine was like this,

1058
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:37,070
但没有越野车  飞机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but take away the jeep, the plane.

1059
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:40,880
比这小得多  想象这里是个沙发床
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Imagine it way smaller. Imagine a futon.

1060
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,250
我可怜这家伙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I feel sad for this guy.

1061
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:58,330
彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, Peter.

1062
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:01,830
我觉得这是个斗篷
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I think this is a cape.

1063
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:21,390
彼得一直清楚这份工作有多危险
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Peter knew how dangerous the job was.

1064
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:24,150
但他觉得  唯一一个能阻止这家伙的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But he figured the only one who could stop this guy

1065
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,890
就是蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}was Spider-Man.

1066
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,330
金并知道我们要来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Kingpin knows we're coming.

1067
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:31,290
我们会寡不敌众的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We're going to be outnumbered.

1068
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,700
别太早下结论
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't be so sure.

1069
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,740
你们可能需要这些
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You might need these.

1070
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:43,240
你以为只有你们想到要来这儿吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You think you're the only people who thought to come here?

1071
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:47,240
伙计们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, fellas.

1072
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:48,950
他是黑白画风吗

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He has a...

1187
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,970
他喜欢你  而且...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He has a soft spot for you, and...

1188
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:45,080
我们一直没有他的消息
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and we haven't heard from him.

1189
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:48,610
你知道如果不重要  我不会联系你的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And you know I wouldn't reach out if this wasn't important.

1190
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:50,450
祝你顺利
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hope you're good.

1191
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,020
亲爱的亚伦叔叔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Dear Uncle Aaron.

1192
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:57,260
我得去做件事  但我不知道能不能做到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I gotta do something, and I don't know if I can do it.

1193
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:01,690
我很害怕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm scared, man.

1194
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:05,970
我只是厌倦了让所有人失望
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm just tired of lettin' everybody down.

1195
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:11,340

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're the only one I can talk to.

1196
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:15,370
如果你在这里就好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I just wish you were here.

1197
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:12,260

01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:36,450
我要那个小装置
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I need the goober.

1306
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,290
别逼我动手抢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Please don't make me take it from you.

1307
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:39,460
这不公平
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's not fair!

1308
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:41,320
你得告诉他们我可以的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You gotta tell them I can do this.

1309
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:42,930
这不是他们的决定
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It wasn't their decision.

1310
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,090
我要让金并血债血偿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I gotta make Kingpin pay!

1311
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:49,970
你必须让我来逼他血债血偿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You have to let me make him pay!

1312
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:51,500
迈尔斯  你会害死你自己的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Miles, you're gonna get yourself killed.

1313
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,170
但我准备好了  我保证
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But I'm ready. I promise!

1314
01:18:56,210 --> 01:18:58,270
那现在就用毒液攻击我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Then venom-strike me right now.

1315
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:03,050
或者我叫你隐身你就隐身  这样才能过我这关
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Or turn invisible on command so you can get past me.

1316
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:17,030
我明白你有多想做这件事  孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, I know how much you want this, kid.

1317
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:18,900
可怜的小家伙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Poor little guy.

1318
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:24,770
但你还没准备好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But you don't have it yet.

1319
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:31,440
很抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm sorry.

1320
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:35,110
我什么时候能知道自己准备好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}When will I know I'm ready?

1321
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:39,410
你没法知道  那是一次信心的飞跃
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You won't. It's a leap of faith.

1322
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:41,520
就这样  迈尔斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's all it is, Miles.

1323

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Miles, it's your dad.

拜托开开门
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Please open the door.

1327
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:36,210
迈尔斯  我能看见你的影子动来动去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Miles, I can see your shadow movin' around.

1328
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:42,210
好吧  我明白  你还是不睬我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, okay, I get it. I get it. You're still ignoring me.

1329
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:44,480
我们能聊聊吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, can we talk for a minute?

1330
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:48,120
出事了...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Something...

1331

那谁出事了...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Something happened to...

1332
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:58,260
有时候人们会渐行渐远  迈尔斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, sometimes people drift apart, Miles.

1333
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:03,900
我不希望我们之间也是如此  好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I don't want that to happen to us, okay?

1334
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,200
我知道我没有在你需要时  做该做的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I know I don't always do what you need me to do

1335
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,540
说该说的话  但我...

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Peter, you don't have to stay behind. I can do it.

1425
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:07,590
我没事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's okay.

1426
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:09,760
我已经决定了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I've made up my mind.

1427
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,360
我会把小装置插进去  控制射线
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'll put the goober in and take over the beam.

1428
01:28:16,370 --> 01:28:19,440
等你们都回去之后  我就炸了它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}After you're gone, I'll blow it up.

1429
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:20,540
祝你们好运  伙计们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Good luck, guys.

1430
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:25,940
他们知道我们在这
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They know we're here.

1431
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:36,520
很高兴再次遇见你  彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Nice to see you again, Peter.

1432
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,630
我来掩护你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I got you covered!

1433
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:46,560
这群人真碍事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}These guys are the pits.

1434
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:55,740
怎么老是这么麻烦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why is this always difficult?

1435
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:58,370
你要去哪啊  彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Where you going, Peter?

1436
01:28:58,380 --> 01:28:59,940
有什么遗言吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Any last words?

1437
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:02,980
给我一点时间好好想想  你有笔吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Can I get a minute to think about it? You have a pen?

1438
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:05,480
再见了  彼得·帕克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Goodbye, Peter Parker.

1439
01:29:15,730 --> 01:29:17,360
是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who did that?!

1440
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,870
-迈尔斯  -蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Miles? - Spider-Man?

1441
01:29:25,870 --> 01:29:28,870
迈尔斯  你可以控制自己了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Wow, Miles. You're doing it on command!

1442
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:30,410
也该是时候了  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's about time, right?

1443
01:29:30,410 --> 01:29:31,900
-迈尔斯  -看看谁来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Miles! - Look who's here!

1444
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:32,780
你做到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You figured it out.

1445
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:34,510
我爱你  我真为你感到骄傲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I love you! I am so proud of you!

1446
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:37,480
我好像想要孩子了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Do I want kids?

1447
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:39,520
对了  差点把她忘了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, yeah, I forgot about her.

1448
01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:42,950
情况看起来不太乐观啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, that doesn't look promising.

1449
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:44,720
谁说不是呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, it doesn't.

1450
01:29:50,630 --> 01:29:53,130
我找到基因匹配了  等等
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I've got genetic matches. Hold on.

1451
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:54,530
太冒险了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's too risky.

1452
01:29:54,530 --> 01:29:55,930
闭嘴  快打开
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Shut up and turn it up.

1453
01:29:55,930 --> 01:29:57,800
-注意左边  -右边
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- On your left! - On your right!

1454
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:00,170
五点钟方向  三点钟方向  两点钟方向
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I got five o'clock! Three o'clock! Two o'clock!

1455
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:02,640
所有方向
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Every direction!

1456
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:06,840
快去找避难处  我马上过去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Get to a shelter. I'll be right there.

1457
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:10,620
我给学校打电话了  但是打不通
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I tried the school, but I can't get through.

1458
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:26,060
伙计们  你们看到了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Guys, are you seeing this?

1459
01:30:27,670 --> 01:30:29,800
看起来我们的维度正在向我们涌来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Looks like our dimensions are coming to us.

1460
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:32,170
但是还挺帅的  是吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Does look cool though, right?

1461
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:34,110
我们要回到上面去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We gotta get back up there.

1462
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:37,840
你就只有这点本事吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Is that all you got?

1463
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,840
你会打架还是只会耍嘴皮子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You gonna fight or you just bumping gums?

1464
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,640
你个作妖的老王八
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You hard-boiled turtle slapper!

1465
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:06,700
你是什么玩意儿  愚蠢的卡通人物吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What are you, some kind of silly cartoon?

1466
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:08,870
你对卡通人物有什么意见吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You got a problem with cartoons?

1467
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,150
受死吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Blammo!

1468
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:25,090
还敢小看卡通人物吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Did that feel like a cartoon?

1469
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:39,810
格温
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Gwen!

1470
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:49,950
我喜欢你的战服
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I like your suit.

1471
01:31:49,950 --> 01:31:51,650
谢谢  我自己做的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thanks. I made it myself.

1472
01:31:51,650 --> 01:31:55,450
真有爱  伙计们  抓稳了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That was adorable, team! Now, hold on tight!

1473
01:32:09,030 --> 01:32:11,600
做好准备  这将是一场恶战
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Buckle up, guys. This is gonna take a while.

1474
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:16,970
好吧  当我没说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}All right. Never mind.

1475
01:32:16,970 --> 01:32:18,140
让我们做个了断吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Let's end this thing.

1476
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:19,570
伙计们  交给我吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Guys, I got it.

1477
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:21,180
我来吧  它还在我这
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'll go. I'm the one with the goo...

1478
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:24,050
你一定在逗我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

1479
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:27,250
别光注意嘴  要注意手
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't watch the mouth. Watch the hands.

1480
01:32:31,890 --> 01:32:33,060
-迈尔斯  -小心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Miles! - Be careful!

1481
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,070
太爽了吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That was crazy.

1482
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:50,000
这是我们的教学成果  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We taught him that, right?

1483
01:32:50,010 --> 01:32:52,780
不是我教的  也肯定不是你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I didn't teach him that. And you definitely didn't.

1484
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,060
你还好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You okay?

1485
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:15,100
走吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Come on.

1486
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:24,710
伙计们  我控制住射线了  你们快上来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Guys, I got control of the beam! Get up here!

1487
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:29,780
警告  量子极性正在逆转
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Alert! Quantum polarity has been reversed.

1488
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,650
看来就是现在了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Guess this is it.

1489
01:33:36,650 --> 01:33:40,060
知道我们不孤单  真好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, nice to know we're not alone.

1490
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:43,830
-对吧  -是呀
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Right? - Yeah.

1491
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:46,260
传送门打开了  你先走  佩妮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I got the portal open. You first, Peni.

1492
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:48,360
谢谢你  迈尔斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thank you, Miles.

1493
01:33:48,370 --> 01:33:50,600
我们俩都感谢你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}From both of us.

1494
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:56,940
我爱你们所有人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I, uh, love you all.

1495
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:59,870
我把这个魔方带走了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm taking this cube thing with me.

1496
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:01,940
虽然我还不明白
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't understand it.

1497
01:34:01,950 --> 01:34:03,580
但是我一定能搞懂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But I will.

1498
01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:09,050
我想把这个送给你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I want you to have this.

1499
01:34:09,050 --> 01:34:10,890
放进口袋里应该很合适
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It'll fit in your pocket.

1500
01:34:12,290 --> 01:34:14,260
完结了  伙计们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's all, folks.

1501
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:17,130
他可以这么说吗  不算侵权吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Is he allowed to say that, legally?

1502
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:22,860
我现在能说我喜欢你的发型了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Do I get to like the hairdo now?

1503
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,070
你知道我比你大吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You know I'm older than you.

1504
01:34:26,070 --> 01:34:29,410
虽然只有十五个月  但是对我来说还挺重要的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}15 months, but it's pretty significant if you ask me.

1505
01:34:29,410 --> 01:34:33,210
爱因斯坦说过时间是相对的  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, Einstein said time was relative, right?

1506
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:35,980
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Nice.

1507
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:39,980
我们是朋友吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Friends?

1508
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:42,920
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Friends.

1509
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:43,990
太好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Cool.

1510
01:34:43,990 --> 01:34:46,020
再见了  蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}See you around, Spider-Man.

1511
01:34:56,970 --> 01:34:58,070
该你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Your turn.

1512
01:34:59,170 --> 01:35:02,040
对  对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, yeah. Right.

1513
01:35:05,410 --> 01:35:07,840
你们哪也去不了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're not going anywhere!

1514
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:10,310
我来拖住他  你把设备关掉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'll hold him off. You shut this down.

1515
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:12,010
彼得  这和计划不一样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Peter, that wasn't the deal!

1516
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:15,290
按绿色的键  不用等我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Push the green button! Do not wait for me!

1517
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,490
-你在干什么  -彼得  你要回去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What are you doing? - Peter, you gotta go home!

1518
01:35:21,490 --> 01:35:24,460
这家伙会杀了你的  我不能让蜘蛛侠牺牲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This guy could kill you! I can't let Spider-Man die.

1519
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:26,200
我也不能
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Neither can I.

1520
01:35:28,370 --> 01:35:29,830
没事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's okay.

1521
01:35:30,730 --> 01:35:32,200
是没事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, it is okay.

1522
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:38,910
你要回去  伙计
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You gotta go home, man.

1523
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:43,110
我怎么知道我会不会再搞砸一次
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How do I know I'm not gonna mess it up again?

1524
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:44,310
你不会的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You won't.

1525
01:35:45,820 --> 01:35:47,280
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Right.

1526
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:49,220
这是一次信心的飞跃
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's a leap of faith.

1527
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,330
不错嘛  小子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Not bad, kid.

1528
01:36:09,510 --> 01:36:10,810
金并
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Kingpin!

1529
01:36:24,350 --> 01:36:25,550
不行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Nope!

1530
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:27,790
抱歉  这可是作弊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Sorry! That's cheating.

1531
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:31,060
再见啦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Adiós.

1532
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:41,410
我得到按钮那边去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I gotta get to that button.

1533
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:47,910
不
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, no.

1534
01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:50,250
单枪匹马可不容易吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Not so easy doing it on your own, is it?

1535
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:56,520
我已经迫不及待再杀一个蜘蛛侠了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I can't wait to kill one more Spider-Man.

1536
01:36:59,890 --> 01:37:01,960
-我在哪  -什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Where am I? - What?

1537
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:03,560
威尔逊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Wilson?

1538
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:06,600
-难道这就是你想要的吗  -你在干什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Is this what you want, man? - What are you doing?

1539
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:09,030
凡妮莎  凡妮莎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Vanessa. Vanessa.

1540
01:37:09,030 --> 01:37:11,530
-我们怎么在这  -我不知道  理查德
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What are we doing here? - I don't know, Richard.

1541
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:12,840
是我啊  你们认识我的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's me. You know me.

1542
01:37:13,970 --> 01:37:15,540
我们这就走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We're leaving now.

1543
01:37:15,540 --> 01:37:17,870
别走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't go.

1544
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:19,340
别离开我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Stay with me.

1545
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:21,080
求求你们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Please!

1546
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:29,220
你不能阻止我的计划  绝对不行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're not stopping this. Not today.

1547
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:31,860
我就要阻止你  现在就要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I am stopping this. Right now!

1548
01:37:40,030 --> 01:37:42,270
我需要后援
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I need backup.

1549
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:21,170
加油啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Come on.

1550
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:32,120
真正的蜘蛛侠都不能打败我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The real Spider-Man couldn't even beat me.

1551
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:36,220
你算什么东西
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're nothing!

1552
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:44,500
你夺走了我的家庭
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You took my family.

1553
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:52,440
我要让你也家破人亡
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And now I'm gonna make sure you never see yours again.

1554
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:13,960
站起来  蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Get up, Spider-Man.

1555
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:18,930
站起来  挺住
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Get up! Come on!

1556
01:39:25,470 --> 01:39:29,010
站起来  坚持住啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Come on. Come on. Come on.

1557
01:39:40,150 --> 01:39:43,320
我的家人会一直支持我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'll always have my family.

1558
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:45,060
你听说过肩咚吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You ever hear of the shoulder touch?

1559
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:47,260
什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What?

1560
01:40:02,170 --> 01:40:06,380
金并  帮我按下绿色的按钮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, Kingpin! Push the green button for me!

1561
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:58,350
迈尔斯  迈尔斯  你还好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Miles? Miles? Are you okay?

1562
01:41:58,350 --> 01:41:59,460
我没事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, I'm okay.

1563
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:01,690
你可能在忙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're probably busy...

1564
01:42:01,690 --> 01:42:03,730
没有没有  我可以说话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No! I can talk, I can talk.

1565
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:07,600
我之前去找你  是因为
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, so I came by earlier because...

1566
01:42:08,830 --> 01:42:11,270
-你叔叔...  -我知道的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Your uncle... - I know, Dad.

1567
01:42:12,570 --> 01:42:14,140
我很抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I am so sorry.

1568
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:16,200
没事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

1569
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:17,670
你知道凶手是谁吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Do you know who did it?

1570
01:42:17,670 --> 01:42:19,510
我以为我知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I thought I did.

1571
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:21,640
但是我想错了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But I was wrong.

1572
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:25,210
迈尔斯  我在你房间外面说的话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, Miles, what I said at the door,

1573
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:26,580
不只是说说而已
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}it wasn't just talk.

1574
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:33,360
我是这么想的  我们可以找一面合适的墙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, you know, I was thinking maybe we could find a nice wall,

1575
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:36,490
-非公产  警局的墙就可以  -好了  爸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- privately owned, like at the police station, - Ok, dad.

1576
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:42,700
-好  -你可以尽情发挥你的才艺
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Alright. - and you could "throw up" some of your art.

1577
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:45,230
天  我真是太不擅长了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Man, I'm bad at this.

1578
01:42:45,230 --> 01:42:48,370
迈尔斯  迈尔斯  你还在吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, Miles. Miles? You there?

1579
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:51,310
这什么鬼信号
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, come on, man. C-Mobile!

1580
01:42:51,310 --> 01:42:54,210
-警官  -蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Officer. - Spider-Man!

1581
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:56,510
听着  刚才真的是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Listen, down there, that was...

1582
01:42:56,510 --> 01:42:58,250
我欠你...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, I owe you...

1583
01:42:58,250 --> 01:43:00,450
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay!

1584
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:10,320
我很期待跟你共事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I look forward to workin' with you.

1585
01:43:10,330 --> 01:43:12,760
我也是吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, me, too. I guess.

1586
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:15,930
虽然我不赞同你的方式
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't approve of your methods,

1587
01:43:15,930 --> 01:43:19,400
但是我们要求同存异嘛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but we're just gonna have to agree to disagree.

1588
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:22,370
感谢你今晚的勇敢举动
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thank you for your bravery tonight.

1589
01:43:22,370 --> 01:43:23,610
我爱你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I love you.

1590
01:43:23,610 --> 01:43:25,210
等等  你说什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Wait, what?

1591
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:26,340
看你身后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And look behind you!

1592
01:43:33,210 --> 01:43:34,340
{\an8\bord0\fs18\b1}你的友善街坊蜘蛛侠敬上

1593
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:39,520
好吧  太酷了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}All right. Cool. Yeah.

1594
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,920
谢谢你  蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thanks, Spider-Man.

1595
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:42,760
蜘蛛侠  乐意为您效劳  谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Spider-Man, a su servicio. Thank you.

1596
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:44,390
伙计  你好吗  小伙子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, man. What's up, little man?

1597
01:43:44,390 --> 01:43:45,590
新任蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}New Spider-Man.

1598
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:46,860
没错没错  我是新任蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah. Yeah, I'm the new Spider-Man.

1599
01:43:46,860 --> 01:43:48,430
看好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Check it out.

1600
01:43:49,770 --> 01:43:52,430
刚才那是计划好的动作
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That was part of the move.

1601
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:55,500
好了  我们再最后说一次
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, let's do this one last time, yeah?

1602
01:43:55,510 --> 01:43:57,000
这次是真的最后一次了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}For real this time. This is it.

1603
01:43:57,010 --> 01:43:58,670
我叫迈尔斯·莫拉莱斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}My name is Miles Morales.

1604
01:43:58,670 --> 01:44:00,780
我被一只放射性蜘蛛咬了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I was bitten by a radioactive spider.

1605
01:44:00,780 --> 01:44:02,410
两天了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And for like two days,

1606
01:44:02,410 --> 01:44:04,410
我做独一无二的蜘蛛侠已经两天了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I've been the one and only Spider-Man.

1607
01:44:04,410 --> 01:44:05,910
其他的你应该都知道了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I think you know the rest.

1608
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:07,380
我完成了论文
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I finished my essay.

1609
01:44:08,420 --> 01:44:10,520
救了好多人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Saved a bunch of people.

1610
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:13,890
被无人机撞
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Got hit by a drone.

1611
01:44:13,890 --> 01:44:15,590
跟我爸一起完成了这个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I did this with my dad.

1612
01:44:15,490 --> 01:44:16,830
{\an8\bord0\fs18\b1}亚伦叔叔  在力量中安息吧

1613
01:44:16,930 --> 01:44:19,200
终于见到了我的室友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Met my roommate. Finally.

1614
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:24,330
在我爸永远找不到的地方贴贴纸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Slapped a sticker where my dad's never gonna find it.

1615
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:26,000
当我感到孤单的时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And when I feel alone,

1616
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,670
比如我觉得没人理解我的时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}like no one understands what I'm going through,

1617
01:44:30,310 --> 01:44:32,310
我会想起那些理解我的朋友们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I remember my friends who get it.

1618
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:41,480
我原来从没想过  这些事我竟然能做到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I never thought I'd be able to do any of this stuff.

1619
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:42,990
但是我做到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But I can.

1620
01:44:44,590 --> 01:44:46,490
谁都可以戴面具
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Anyone can wear the mask.

1621
01:44:47,820 --> 01:44:49,990
你也可以戴面具
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You could wear the mask.

1622
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:54,930
如果你以前不知道  我希望你现在知道了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}If you didn't know that before, I hope you do now.

1623
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:04,740
因为我是蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}'Cause I'm Spider-Man.

1624
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:09,510
而且不是唯一一个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I'm not the only one.

1625
01:45:09,510 --> 01:45:11,050
一定不是

{\an8\bord0\fs18\b1}与此同时  纽约

1836
01:55:31,940 --> 01:55:32,970
你迟到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're a bit late.

1837
01:55:32,970 --> 01:55:34,370
我们又没有分身术
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We can't all be everywhere at once.

1838
01:55:34,370 --> 01:55:36,000
至少发个短信告诉我一下吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Little text might've been nice.

1839
01:55:36,010 --> 01:55:37,970
我才离开了不到两个小时  怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I was gone for less than two hours. What happened?

1840
01:55:37,970 --> 01:55:40,040
我知道这看起来像是什么情况
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay. I know what it looks like.

1841
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:42,510
-但是有个好消息  -说吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- But here's the good news. - Oh, here we go.

1842
01:55:42,510 --> 01:55:44,450
平行宇宙依然存在
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The multiverse didn't collapse.

1843
01:55:44,450 --> 01:55:46,210
-太棒了  -虽然有点小冒险
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Oh, cool! - Little touch and go.

1844
01:55:46,220 --> 01:55:47,710
但是我们做到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But it worked out.

1845
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:49,150
太好了  小装置做好了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Great story. Did you finish the goober?

1846
01:55:49,150 --> 01:55:50,580
这不是什么小装置  是小发明
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's not a goober. It's a gizmo.

1847
01:55:50,590 --> 01:55:52,120
你一定要把我叫出来吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Do you always have to call me out?

1848
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:53,320
让我感觉很烦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's just really frustrating and bums me out.

1849
01:55:53,320 --> 01:55:54,660
别太激动  米圭尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't get excited, Miguel.

1850
01:55:54,660 --> 01:55:56,160
-这只是原型机  -我不激动
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- It's just a prototype. - Not excited.

1851
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:57,420
但是你可以成为第一个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But you could be the first person

1852
01:55:57,430 --> 01:55:59,390
自主穿越平行宇宙的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}to make an autonomous multiverse jump.

1853
01:55:59,390 --> 01:56:00,700
也可能是最后一个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Or the last.

1854
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:02,530
我们就这么赌一把
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So we're just gonna roll the dice on this?

1855
01:56:02,530 --> 01:56:05,400
你怎么看  哥们  你想先去哪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So, what you do you say, pal? Where you want to go first?

1856
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:08,340
我们最后一次从头开始吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Let's start at the beginning one last time.

1857
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:10,570
1967年  地球
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Earth '67.

1858
01:56:10,750 --> 01:56:13,750
{\an8\bord0\fs18\b1}1967年  地球

1859
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:14,640
搞什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What the...?

1860
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:16,280
我是蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm Spider-Man.

1861
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:17,650
-你应该跟我来  -你到底是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- I need you to come with me. - Who the heck are you?

1862
01:56:17,650 --> 01:56:20,180
我刚刚不是说了吗  听着  我来自未来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I just told you... Listen. I'm from the future.

1863
01:56:20,180 --> 01:56:22,450
-你竟敢这么指着我  -你先指我的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- How dare you point at me! - You were pointing first.

1864
01:56:22,450 --> 01:56:24,990
-指着别人很失礼  -你太失礼了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- It's rude to point. - You're being very rude.

1865
01:56:24,990 --> 01:56:27,020
哪一个先指的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Which one pointed first?

1866
01:56:27,020 --> 01:56:28,990
显然是蜘蛛侠先指的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Spider-Man pointed first. Obviously.

1867
01:56:28,990 --> 01:56:30,690
-你现在就在指着我  -我没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- You're pointing at me right now. - I'm not pointing.

1868
01:56:30,690 --> 01:56:32,430
你看看你自己  看看你的手指头
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look at you! Look at your finger.

1869
01:56:32,430 --> 01:56:33,730
我是在给你看  你在指我  这不一样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm pointing out your pointing, which is different.

1870
01:56:33,730 --> 01:56:35,360
你没看到我在指你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You haven't seen pointing.

1871
01:56:35,370 --> 01:56:37,570
你现在这样还怪我指着你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're accusing me of pointing while you're...!

1872
01:56:37,570 --> 01:56:40,940
{\an8\bord0\fs18\b1}全剧终
