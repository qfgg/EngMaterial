但她永远不会成为我们中的一员
But she'll never be one of us.

134
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,670
当然不会  亲爱的
Of course not, dear.

135

她有良知
She has a soul.

你姐姐在哪
Where the hell's your sister?

137
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,800
肯定是菲奇的错
I'm sure it's Fitch's fault.

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,220
他是个废物  但他是我们中的一员
He's useless. But he's one of us.

145
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,540
谢谢夸奖  是我母亲的
Thank you. It was my mother's.

146
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,250
你抽烟吗
Do you smoke?

147
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,710
不抽
Oh, no.

148
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,000
紧张吗
Nervous?

149
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,130
因为你的血统不够高贵吗
Because your blood isn't blue enough?

150
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,340
他们也这样说过我
They said the same thing about me.

151
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,090
真的吗
They did?

152
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,680
抬头挺胸别理他们
Stand tall and fuck 'em.

153
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,640
最重要的是亚历克斯的想法
The only thing that matters is what Alex thinks.

154
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,190
而他的想法我们都知道
And that we know.

155
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,700
-我爱你  -我爱你
- I love you. - I love you.

156
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,950
我沾东西了吗
I have something?

157
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,360
见鬼
Oh, shit.

158
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,490
你还记得今天发生了什么吗
Do you remember anything that happened today?

159
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,970

It's a goddamn blur.

160
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,870
但我非常确定...
But I'm pretty sure...

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,430
-我们结婚了吗  -我们结婚了
- Did we get married? - We got married.

162
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,330
你是我老婆吗
Are you my wife?

163
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,430
-我靠  我靠  -是的  你是我老公
- Holy shit. Holy fucking shit. - Yes. You're my husband!

164
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,600
我的天  靠  宝贝
Oh, my God. Shit. Oh, babe.

165
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,810
宝贝
Babe.

166
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:51,980
穿着这个真麻烦
It's hard with this thing.

167
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,810
-我知道  听着  -抱着我
- I know. Listen. - Hold me.

168
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:53,890
我得告诉你...
I have to tell you something...

169
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,970
闭嘴  把裤子脱了
Shut up. Take your pants off.

170
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,390
不  我得告诉你一件事
No, I have to tell you something.

171
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,100
-格蕾丝  亲爱的  -我要帮你脱了
- Grace, honey. - I'm taking 'em off.

172
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,530
我操  操  有人
Holy shit! Holy shit. Someone's here.

173
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:04,980
什么
What?

174
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,110
天啊  海琳姑妈  能让我们单独待一会吗
Jesus, Aunt Helene! Can you give us a minute?

175
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,620
你们得藏得更好点才行
You'll have to hide better than that.

176
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,570
我们没他妈藏  明摆着的
We're not fucking hiding, obviously.

177
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,320
大家都等着呢
Everyone is waiting.

178
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,160
知道了  我们马上就下去
Yeah, we'll be down in a few minutes.

179
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,420
-抱歉  宝贝  -刚才那是什么鬼
- I'm sorry, honey. - What the hell was that?

180
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:24,760
那是我姑妈海琳
That's my aunt Helene.

181
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,060
她...她不太懂什么叫界限
She has, um... well, she has boundary issues.

182
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,670
看出来了
Yeah.

183
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,340
你们当然会有暗门
Of course you have a secret door.

184
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,840
这是仆人的过道
It's a servant's corridor.

185
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,760
贯穿整栋房子
They run all through the house.

186
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,430
抱歉  谁在等着呢
Sorry, who's waiting?

187
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,270
我刚才就是想跟你说这事
That's what I was trying to tell you. Um...

188
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,450
是这样  午夜的时候你得玩个游戏
So, at midnight you have to play a game.

189
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,620
这是有新人加入我们家时的传统
It's just something we do when someone new joins the family.

190
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,830
-游戏  -是的
- A game? - Yeah.

191
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,250
什么游戏
What game?

192
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,120
我不知道  就是  你要抽一张牌
I don't know. Uh, you draw a card.

193
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,470
据我所知可能是双陆棋  槌球  跳棋
Could be backgammon, croquet, checkers, for all I know.

194
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,730
我知道  我懂  挺傻的
I know. I know. It's stupid.

195
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,800
有点怪
It's a little weird.

196
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,180
为什么要玩游戏
Why, exactly?

197
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,840
可能因为我们是靠游戏发家的吧
I guess, because we made our money in games,

198
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,440
这是加入仪式的一部分
it's part of the initiation.

199
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,390
-我需要赢吗  -不  你只是得参加
- Do I have to win? - No. You just... you just have to play.

200
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,390
-然后...  -然后你...
- And then... - And then you...

201
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,700
你就正式成为家里的一员了
you are officially part of the family.

202
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,980
说真的  这对他们来说比婚礼还重要
Honestly, it means more to them than the wedding itself.

203
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,030
-就这事吗  -是的  就这事
- That's it? - Yeah, that's it.

204
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,820
我知道很荒唐
I know it's ridiculous.

205
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,630
只是一种奇怪的家族仪式
It's just a weird family ritual.

206
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,410
我们只要做一次就行  好吗
And we only have to do it once. All right?

207
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,370
好吧
Okay.

208
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,250
-好  -好
- Yeah. - Okay.

209
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,250
如果这能让你的家人接受我
If it gets your family to accept me,

210
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,510
我会好好下一把跳棋
I will play the shit out... of checkers.

211
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,840
-我很擅长的  -好
- I'm really good at it. - Okay.

212
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,320
好吧  你去帮我拖个十分钟
Okay. You go buy me ten minutes

213
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,740
我得摆出玩游戏的架势
'cause I gotta put on... my game face.

214
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,070
我看懂了  非常棒
I see what you did there. Very good.

215
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:08,310
好  那我在楼下等你  音乐室
Okay. So, uh, I'll meet you downstairs. Music room.

216
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,330
当然  家里有音乐室简直太正常了
Yes. A totally normal room to have in a house.

217
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,360
反正...就在楼下
Just... It is just downstairs.

218
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,610
右手边第二个房间
It's your second door on the right.

219
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,320
好的
Okay.

220
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,880
我就知道能在这里找到你
I thought I might find you here.

221
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,680
勒贝尔先生今天一定会与我们同在
I'm sure Mr. Le Bail is with us today.

222
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,270
你跟她说了多少
So, how much have you told her?

223
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,610
什么也没说  我不会说的
Nothing. And I never will.

224
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,190
明天我们就走了
Tomorrow we're gone.

225
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,370
如果她抽出了那张牌
If she pulls that card,

226
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,150
你准备好做必要之事了吗
are you prepared to do what's necessary?

227
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,670
{\an8}家族仪式  秘密议会  勒贝尔的险招

228
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,350

抱歉  不管你想说什么  请继续
Excuse me, whatever you wanna say, get on with it please.

230
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:19,050
你最好快点  午夜之前赶过来
You better hurry your ass up and get here before midnight.

231
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,840
收到消息给我回电话
Call me when you get this message.

232
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,810
多拉  再来两杯  谢谢
Dora, two more, please.

233
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,870
格蕾丝  亲爱的
Grace, darling.

234
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,080
-你的誓言写得真美  -谢谢
- Your vows were beautiful. - Oh. Thank you.

235
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,280
亚历克斯没告诉我们你是在寄养家庭长大的
Alex didn't tell us you were brought up in foster homes.

236
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,030
其实他现在什么也不告诉我们了  喝香槟吗
Not that he tells us anything these days. Champagne?

237
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,370
好的  谢谢
Thank you. Thanks.

238
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,410
我的养父母是很好的人
My foster parents were great people.

239
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,220
你懂的  他们尽了全力给我最好的
And, you know, they did what they could.

240
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,960
但那终究不能长久
But it was always temporary.

241
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,500
我总是梦想着能拥有一个家庭
I always sort of dreamed of having a... a family.

242
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,560
我知道亚历克斯一定很乐意一直未婚同居下去
I mean, I'm sure Alex would've loved living in sin forever.

243
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,300
我毫不怀疑
I don't doubt it.

244
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,260
但他  他真的理解
But he, um, he really understood

245
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,140
我有多看重...
how important it was for me to...

246
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:12,190
最终拥有一个真正的  永远的家庭
finally have a real, permanent family.

247
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,560
我只是不想让你们失望
And I just don't wanna let you down.

248
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:19,190
格蕾丝  我第一次见你时就跟托尼说过
Grace. When I first saw you, I said to Tony:

249
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,400
"咱们总算有个孩子带回来一个像样的"
"Finally. One of our children has brought home a good one."

250
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,000
你不知道我们有多感激
And you don't know how grateful we are

251
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,370
你把亚历克斯带回了我们身边
that you brought Alex back to us.

252
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,210
但是拜托
But please...

253
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,580
试着让他回到我们身边
try to bring him back into the fold.

254
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,050
我们是他的家人
We're his family.

255
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,710
我保证
I promise.

256
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,800
亲爱的
Sweetheart.

257
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,010
我就知道你会的
I knew you would.

258
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,980
妈  我先把她拐走一会  好吗
Mom, I'm just gonna steal her away. Okay?

259
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,320
她跟你说了什么
What'd she say to you?

260
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,330
她人真好
She's so sweet.

261
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,400
她说什么了吗
Did she say anything?

262
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,790
没有
No. No.

263
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,280
好吧
All right.

264
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,120
你没事吧  出什么事了吗
Are you okay? Did something happen?

265
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,240
没事  没有
Yeah, no.

266
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,910
我只是  我不太舒服
I just, I don't feel very well.

267
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,140
要是你想躺一会
Well, if you wanna lie down,

268
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,390
我们明天再玩那游戏不行吗
can't we just play the game tomorrow?

269
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,890
-不  不行  必须是今晚  -举起手来
- No, no, it has to be tonight. - Hands up!

270
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:21,350

00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,760
-爸爸  -你尽管继续玩  伙计

00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,190
你太紧张了
You're so tense.

276
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,740
-勒贝尔会抓到你的  -混蛋
- Le Bail's gonna get you. - Asshole.

277
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,990
杀  杀  勒贝尔先生
Kill, kill! Mr. Le Bail!

278

今早  我们平时用的包机
We couldn't get our regular charter

286
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,240
没法离开戴高乐机场
out of de Gaulle this morning.

287
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,340
我可受不了再乘民航了  你懂吧
And I cannot fly commercial anymore, right?

288
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,910
-民航太糟了  你懂的  -格蕾丝

Have a seat.

312
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,440
你喜欢玩游戏吗
Do you like to play games?

313
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,650
那得看是什么游戏了
I guess it depends on what we're playing.

314
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,410
我们马上就会知道了
Well, we'll know in a moment.

315
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:57,700
我想你已经注意到了  我们家很看重传统
I gather you've noticed our family is big on tradition.

316
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,680
现在  现在到了你跟我们
And now, well, now the time has come

317
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,040
一起遵守这些传统的时候了
for you to join us in those traditions.

318
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,630
要讲故事了
Story time.

319
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,890
你可能知道  我的曾祖父  维克多
As you may know, my great-grandfather, Victor,

320
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:13,360
在内战期间开了一家不起眼的印刷店
set up a modest printing shop during the Civil War,

321
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,890
制作纸牌
manufacturing playing cards.

322
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,650
一代人以后
A generation later,

323
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:20,930
我的祖父把生意扩大到了体育用品和桌上游戏
my grandfather expanded into sporting goods and board games.

324
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,620
在我的领导下  勒多马斯家族游戏
Under my leadership, Le Domas Family Games

325
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,200
获得了四支职业体育团队的加盟
acquired four professional sports teams

326
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,280
更上了一层楼
and reached, well, even greater heights.

327
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,420
有人可能说这只是运气
Some may call it luck,

328
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,280
但运气不足以形容我们
but, well, it's a little more than that.

329
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,990
我们简直是被眷顾的
You know, it's almost as if someone's watching over us.

330
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,870
这一切都归功于一位极其慷慨的捐助者
It all began with a very generous benefactor.

331
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,500
以及这个盒子
And this box.

332
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,670
曾祖父原本是商船上的一名水手
You see, originally, Great-Grandfather was a merchant seaman.

333
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,270
生活很艰难
It was a hard life.

334
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,800
和很多人一样  他不想止步于此
And, like so many, he wanted more.

335
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,900
一次他出海航行的时候
On one of his many excursions abroad,

336
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,060
曾祖父遇到了勒贝尔先生
Great-Grandfather came to meet a Mr. Le Bail.

337
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,940
他是  他是船上的一名乘客
He was a... He was a passenger aboard the ship.

338
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,570
算是个收藏家
A collector, of sorts.

339
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,290
他会买下异国文物然后转卖给美国的富人
Purchasing exotic antiquities to resell to wealthy Americans.

340
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:13,210
当他们发现彼此都热衷于赌局时
After discovering a mutual passion for games of chance,

341
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,780
他们花了很多时间打牌
they passed a great many hours playing cards.

342
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:20,580
勒贝尔先生的其中一样收藏品就是
And among Mr. Le Bail's possessions was...

343
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,120
那个盒子
that box.

344
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:23,980
一天晚上
And one evening,

345
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,000
在喝了太多朗姆酒以后
after indulging in more than their fair ration of rum...

346
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,290
勒贝尔先生下了一个赌注
Mr. Le Bail proposed a wager.

347
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:34,060
如果曾祖父能在靠岸前
If Great-Grandfather could solve the mystery of the box

348
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,560
解开这个盒子的谜题
before arriving at port,

349
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,510
勒贝尔先生就会资助祖父想做的任何生意
Mr. Le Bail would finance any endeavor of Grandfather's choosing.

350
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:40,640
于是
Well...

351
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,780
曾祖父在海上花了很长时间
Great-Grandfather whiled away

352
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,490
研究这个盒子
the long hours at sea studying the box.

353
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,480
直到最后...
Until finally...

354
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,780
从那时起
And since that time...

355
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,040
每当有新人
whenever the Le Domases are presented

356
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,080
要加入勒多马斯家族的时候
with a new addition to the family...

357
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,620
我们就会在盒子里放一张空白的纸牌
we place a blank playing card into the box.

358
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:14,550
我们的新人则有抽牌的特权
Our initiate then has the privilege of drawing the card,

359
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:19,180
然后勒贝尔先生会告诉我们该玩哪种游戏
and Mr. Le Bail will tell us which game to play.

360
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,140
我抽到了象棋
I got chess.

361
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,970
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}玩法类似抽鬼牌

362
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,970
我抽到了老姑娘
I got Old Maid.

363
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,100
说真的  老姑娘是个什么玩意儿
Seriously, what the fuck is Old Maid?

364
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,890
菲奇
Fitch...

365
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,650
我只要抽牌就行了吗
So I just take out the card?

366
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,740
亲爱的  轮到你了
My dear, it is your turn.

367
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,380
上面写的什么  孩子
What does it say, girl?

368
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,050
上面写的
It says...

369
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,810
捉迷藏
It says, "hide and seek."

370
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,340
我们真的要玩这个吗
Are we really gonna play that?

371
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,270
有问题吗
Everything okay?

372
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:17,190
没事  没事  这是游戏规则
Yeah. Yeah. Those are the rules.

373
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,240
就玩捉迷藏  对吗  爸爸
Hide and seek, right, Dad?

374
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,990
是的  没错
Yes, indeed.

375
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,540
这是游戏规则
Those are the rules.

376
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:31,370
好吧  那谁捉谁藏呢
Okay, so, uh, who... who hides and who seeks?

377
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:35,170
鉴于你是新人  亲爱的
Well, it's your initiation, my dear.

378
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,800
你来藏
You get to be the one to, uh, to hide.

379
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,170
当然
Of course.

380
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,470
会很好玩的  亲爱的
This is gonna be fun, honey.

381
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,190
到我房间去等我  好吗
Yeah, just come meet me in my room, okay?

382
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,680
-不  我想认真玩  -我知道
- No, I wanna play for real. This is so weird. - No, no. I know.

383
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:50,060
那么  敬...勒贝尔先生
So, to Mister... Le Bail.

384
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,770
敬勒贝尔先生
To Mr. Le Bail.

385

-敬勒贝尔先生  -敬勒贝尔先生
- To Mr. Le Bail. - To Mr. Le Bail.

386
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,570
规则很简单
The rules are simple.

387
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,780
你可以躲在房子里的任何地方
You can hide anywhere inside the house.

388
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:09,080
我们会数到一百  然后试图...找到你
We then count to 100 and try to, um... well, find you.

389
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,850
你们不觉得这对我不太公平吗
Well, don't you think you have a little bit of an advantage?

390
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,420
不不  我们从不用摄像头
No, no. We never use the cameras.

391
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,870
我们一直都是
We always play the games

392
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,050
像在曾祖父那个年代一样玩游戏
as they would've been played in Great-Grandfather's time.

393
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,170
一直都是
Always.

394
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,900
我是不可能赢的  对吗
So, there's no way for me to win, right?

395
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,210
你可以一直躲到黎明
Well, you could, I mean, stay hidden till dawn.

396
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,460
-不了  谢谢  -不用
- No, thank you. - No.

397
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,590
你一离开这里
We're gonna start the count

398
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,270
我们就会开始计数  好吗
just as soon as you leave, okay?

399
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,330
好
Okay.

00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,560
这游戏没有一般可言
There is nothing usual about this.

460
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,270
我加入这个家族以来也只玩过一次
It's only happened once since I joined the family.

461
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,410
你们都默认我会用这玩意儿吗
Am I really supposed to know how to use this thing?

462
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,600
这样吧
You know what?

463
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,080
我要去休息一下
I'm just gonna make a quick pit stop.

464
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,710
我一紧张就闹肚子
I've got a nervous stomach.

465
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,840
你知道我从来都看不上你  对吧
You know I've never liked you, right?

466
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,690
好吧
All right.

467
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,750
我受够了
That's enough of this.

468
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,740
妈的
Shit.

469
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,370
妈的
Shit.

470
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,460
妈的
Oh, shit.

471
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,290
乔治
Georgie.

472
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,340
乔治
Georgie.

473
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,130
-对不起  -天呐
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Jesus.

474
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,300
-我差点吓尿了  -我知道
- I nearly pissed myself. - I know.

475
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,930
-你得仔细听我说  -乔治
- You need to listen to me very carefully. - Georgie.

476
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:28,110
-嘘  跟我来  -等下  我们在干什么
- Shh. Come with me. - Wait. What are we doing?

477
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:33,130
-蹲下  把你的裙子拽过来  -行  天呐
- Get down. Grab your dress, grab your dress. - Okay. Jesus.

478
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,990
乔治  我知道你在这儿
Georgie, I know you're in here.

479
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,130
乔...
Georg...

480
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,750
在这儿  她在这儿  快过来
Over here! Over here, over here!

481
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,050
各位  我找到她了
Guys, I found her!

482
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,170
我做到了
I did it!

483
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,990
爸爸  我做到了  快看
Dad! Daddy, I did it! Look!

484
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,690
爸爸  快来看我...
Daddy, come see what I mean...

485
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:18,340
糟了  糟了
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

486
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,090
老天啊
Jesus Christ.

487
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,970
这是克莱拉
This is Clara.

488
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,460
她看起来像是穿着巨大的
Does she look like she's wearing a giant,

489
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,740
白色婚纱吗  艾米丽
white wedding dress, Emilie?

490
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,490
你为什么直接爆头  亲爱的
Why did you shoot her in the face, sweetheart?

491
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,270
你本该打残她
You're supposed to maim her.

492
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,770
为了仪式她得活着
She needs to be alive for the ritual.

493
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:34,780
我也不知道
I don't know.

494
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,640
-我听到了枪响  -是啊
- I heard a shot. - Yeah.

495
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,410
如果她死了  这算数吗
Well, if she dies, does this count?

496
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:43,910
当然不算  必须得是新娘
Of course it does not count. It must be the bride.

497
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,390
那我们现在怎么办
Well, what do we do now?

498
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,230
我不知道  让我想想
Well, I don't know. I'm... I'm thinking.

499
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,290
克莱拉
Clara, hey.

500
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:53,500
会没事的
It's gonna be okay.

501
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,510
丹尼尔  你能不能...
Daniel, could you?

502
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:57,940
好了  我们去走走
Come on, let's take a walk.

503
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,980
她会死的  各位
She's gonna die, guys.

504
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,530
走吧
Walk it off.

505
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,740
我们要怎么处理她
So, what do we do with her?

506
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,610
把她挪走  不能让格蕾丝看到
Move her. We don't want Grace to see.

507
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,370
把提灯给我
Give me the fucking lanterns.

508
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,330
好了  选吧
Okay. Call it.

509
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,080
-正面  -你选对了
- Heads. - Heads it is.

510
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,050
-你来抬腿  -好的
- You get the legs. - Okay.

511
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,680
慢着
Hold on.

512
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,340
要滑下去了  好了  好  走吧
It's slipping. Yeah, good. Oh, good. Okay. Go.

513
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:28,490
我最喜欢她了
She was my favorite.

514
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,710
在这等着  别动
Wait here. Don't move.

515
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,980
好了  亲爱的  你得站起来
Okay, sweetie, you gotta get up.

516
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,520
我们得赶紧把你弄出去
We gotta get you out of here right now.

517
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,980
来  站起来  就这样
Okay. Stand up, here we go.

518
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,230
拿好你的手机  带上钥匙
Okay. Okay, grab... grab your phone. Grab the keys.

519
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,600
操  糟了
Fuck. Shit.

520
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,580
一定是斯蒂文斯把手机拿走了...
Okay. Stevens must've taken the phone, so...

521
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,120
-亚历克斯  怎么回事  -你得逃跑  懂吗
- Alex, what the fuck? - You're gonna have to run, okay?

522
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,010
捉迷藏  你抽到了唯一一张坏牌
Hide and seek. You pulled the one bad card.

523
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,910
他们认为...他们必须得在日出前杀了你
They think... They think they have to kill you before sunrise.

524
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,540
-你说什么  -跟我来
- What the fuck? - Follow me.

525
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,140
等一下
One sec!

526
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,740
我忘拿枪了
I forgot my gun.

527
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,130
好了
Okay.

528
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,260
你给我听好  不能再搞砸了
Okay, girl, no more fuckups.

529
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,650
你是个赢家  明白吗
You're a winner. You got that?

530
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,650
-你拿上鞋了吗  -亚历克斯
- Okay, you have your shoes? - Alex.

531
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,440
亲爱的  我需要你穿上鞋
Honey, I need you to put on your shoes.

532
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,860
不行  亚历克斯  这他妈是怎么回事
No, Alex, Alex, what the fuck is going on?

533
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,280
我需要你穿上鞋  快穿
I need you to put your shoes on. Right now.

534
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,990
就这样  好的
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

535
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:44,420
好了
Okay.

536
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,350
他们认为如果他们不杀了你
They think that if they don't kill you,

537
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,820
噩运就会降临整个家族
something very bad will happen to the family.

538
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:55,380
我必须配合演戏才能把你救出来
Now... I had to play along so that I can get you out.

539
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,230
但是目前整栋房子封锁了
But the house is on lock down right now,

540
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,910
所以要逃出去不太好办
so it's gonna be really tricky.

541
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:02,610
你本就知道如果我抽到那张牌会发生什么
You knew what would happen if I pulled that card.

542
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,730
我没想到他们会动真格
I didn't think they'd actually go through with it.

543
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:04,220
你早就知道
You fucking knew!

544
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,020
从未有人抽到那张牌  这情形从未发生过
No one ever pulls that. It never fucking happens.

545
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,240
-但你早就知道有这回事  -我完全没料到
- Yeah, but you knew about it! - No, no, I didn't.

546
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,870
-我是理查德·巴比斯  -我是查理
- I'm Richard Babis. - And I'm Charlie.

547
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,210
今天的主题叫作
And today's segment is called

548
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,590
"认识你的弩弓"
"Getting to know your crossbow."

549
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,340
该死  我真的...以为不会出事
Oh, fuck. I really... I thought it was safe.

550
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:29,010
但如果我不让你抽牌的话  那么...
But if I didn't pull a card at all, then...

551
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,260
那么你的神经病家人就不会试图...
Then your crazy family wouldn't be trying to...

552
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,320
天呐  他们会杀了我的
Oh, my God, they're gonna kill me.

553
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,860
不  那么我俩都会死
No, then we'd both be dead.

554
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,510
嫁入这个家门  就必须玩这个游戏
When you marry into this family you have to play a game.

555
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,730
如果你不玩  你就会死
And if you don't, you die.

556
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,850
我知道这听起来很疯狂
I know that sounds crazy,

557
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:43,390
但是你必须相信我  这是真的
but you have to believe me, it is real.

558
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,820
我的叔公就因此丧命
It happened to my great-uncle.

559
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,900
他结婚了  没玩游戏  次日清晨他就死了
He got married, he didn't play a game, next morning he died.

560
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,690
他的妻子也死了
His wife too.

561
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,090
同样的事也发生在了我堂姐瑞秋身上
Same thing happened to my cousin Rachel.

562
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,110
以及一群我从未见过的人身上
Same thing happened to a bunch of people that I never even met before.

563
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,200
你只能...
You just...

564
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,050
你必须玩游戏
You have to play.

565
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:03,820
你说过你的家庭...很操蛋
You said your family was... fucked-up,

566
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,770
-没错  -可你没提过他们是变态杀人魔啊
- I know. - but you didn't say psycho killers.

567
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:11,640
你...你娶了我进门  却没提醒我
You... you brought me here, you didn't warn me.

568
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,630
是你想结婚的
You wanted to get married.

569
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,280
-所以是我的错吗  -不是  对不起  我错了
- So it's my fucking fault? - No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

570
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,820
-你认真的吗  -嘘
- Are you fucking serious? - Shh.

571
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,930
-我们本可以私奔  -我知道
- We could've eloped. - I know.

572
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,820
-我们本可以...  -不行  有规则的
- We could've... - No, no. There are rules.

573
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,150
不能私奔
You can't just elope.

574
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,750
必须在这里举行婚礼
You... you have to have the wedding here,

575
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,060
还得玩那该死的游戏
and you have to play the fucking game.

576
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,600
你都没跟我说
You didn't even fucking talk to me.

577
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,270
你本可以告诉我  我们本可以...
You could've told me. We could've...just...

578
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,450
如果我事先告诉你  你就会离开我
If I told you, you would've left.

579
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,410
如果我不求婚  你也会离开我
And if I didn't propose, you would've left.

580
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,200
你是我的一切  我向你保证
You're everything to me, and I promise you

581
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,390
我会帮你离开这里  好吗
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

582
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:54,090
好吗  听我说
All right? So just listen to me.

583
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:56,130
你要沿着这条走廊一直走
You just need to go straight down this hallway

584
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,230
直至你走到仆人厨房
until you get to the service kitchen.

585
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,080
我去警卫室
I'm gonna go down to the security room.

586
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,080
我会把所有的门锁都打开
I'm gonna unlock all the doors. I'm gonna unlock all the doors.

587
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,980
-不  你不许离开我  -然后你赶紧逃走
- No. Don't fucking leave me. - Then you just fucking run.

588
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,470
我必须这么做  亲爱的  我没得选
I have to. Honey, I have to.

589
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,900
一直待在过道里  直到你走到厨...
Just... just stay inside the walls until you get to the kit...

590
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,090

Straight and then, um, kitchen.

走到厨房  很好
To the kitchen. Good. Good.

看到她了吗
Any sign of her?

600
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,260
没有  指不定她藏到哪了
No. She could be anywhere.

601
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,040
找到她了
Found her.

602
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,880
我的天
Jesus! Fuck!

603
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,250
该死
Goddammit!

604
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:07,190
艾米丽  你得瞄准重心打
Emilie, aim for the center of gravity!

605
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,980
我不知道我在干什么
I don't know what I'm doing!

606
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,300
我只是来拿酒喝
I just came to get a drink.

607
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,520
我必须得喊其他人过来
I have to call the others.

608
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,440
不  你不用
No, you don't.

609
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,960
不要
No.

610
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,320
你可以帮我  求你了
You can help me. Please.

611
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,840
你不会有好下场的
This doesn't end well for you.

612
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:23,190
我只是不想成为那个把你送上祭台的人
I just don't wanna be the one to serve you up.

613
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,300
丹尼尔  我求求你了
Daniel, I'm begging you.

614
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,010
对于这一切我深感抱歉
I'm really sorry about all this.

615
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,530
人们说得对  富人们确实不同
It's true what they say: The rich really are different.

616
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:41,280
我让你十秒钟
I'll give you a ten-second head start.

617
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,190
丹尼尔
Daniel.

618
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,820
一
One, one thousand.

619
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:02,370
二
Two, one thousand.

620
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,030
二点五
Two and a half, one thousand.

621
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,730
她在书房里
She's in the study!

622
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,120
不要把武器对准自己
Point the weapon away from you.

623
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,680
你把她跟丢了吗
You lost her?

624
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,050
没错
Indeed.

625
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,890
你太可悲了
You're pathetic.

626
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:34,870
没错
Indeed.

627
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,420
你能至少假装在乎吗
Could you at least pretend to care?

628
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,270
我相信无论有没有我的帮助
I'm sure you'll find her and kill her

629
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,450
你们都会找到她  并杀了她
with or without my help.

630
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,250
不过我确实想到了一件事
You know, something did occur to me, though.

631
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,430
亚历克斯瞒着格蕾丝也许是错误的
Alex may have been wrong to keep Grace in the dark...

632
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,250
但你还记得当年我告诉你真相时
but do you remember how you reacted

633
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,180
你有什么反应吗
when I told you about this?

634
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,460
你他妈连眼睛都没眨一下
You didn't fucking blink.

635
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:02,380
你迫不及待地要出卖你的灵魂
I mean, you couldn't wait to sign your soul away.

636
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,730
你知道我的出身
You know where I came from

637
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,150
还有我之前的人生是什么样子
and what my life was like before.

638
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,330
我宁愿死也不想失去这一切
I'd rather be dead than lose all of this.

639
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,620
小心愿望成真
Well... from your lips.

640
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,970
-她在哪里  -恐怕她刚刚跑了
- Where is she? - I'm afraid you just missed her.

641
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,950
托尼  亚历克斯溜出来了  我很抱歉
Tony, Alex got out. I'm so sorry.

642
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:31,910
该死
Goddammit.

643
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,000
现在是谁不靠谱
Who's the fuckup now, right?

644
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,430
还是我吗
Still me?

645
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,710
找到她了吗  游戏结束了吗
Did you find her? Is it over?

646
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,530
不  还没结束
No, it's not over.

647
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,340
现在她知道这是怎么回事了
And now she knows what's going on.

648
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,120
不过艾米丽朝克莱拉脸上开了一枪
But Emilie shot Clara in the face.

649
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,420
她死了  只是个小插曲
So she's dead. That's just a side note.

650
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,910
克莱拉死了吗
Clara's dead?

651
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,020
我最喜欢她了
She was my favorite.

652
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,370
糟糕  我忘记拿我的枪了
Cock! I forgot my gun.

653
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,980
爸爸  我忘记拿枪了  我太差劲了
Daddy, I forgot my gun. I suck.

654
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,530
-没关系  -我太差劲了
- It's okay. - I suck!

655
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,440
你不差劲  亲爱的
You don't suck, sweetheart.

656
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,570
给你  亲爱的  用我的吧
Here, hon, why don't you just use mine.

657
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,570
勒多马斯先生  我刚看到她跑过去...
Mr. Le Domas, Mr. Le Domas, I just saw her running...

658
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:09,120
-天啊  -天啊
- Oh, my God! - Oh, my God.

659
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:14,270
-好吧  -为什么我总是这样
- Okay, now... - Why does this always happen to me?

660
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,800
-够了  -冷静
- Come on! - Okay. Calm down.

661
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,690
宝贝
Baby.

662
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,990
-没事  亲爱的  走吧  -别生气
- Yeah, okay, that's okay, honey. Come on. - Don't be mad.

663
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:23,180
去散散步  给你弄块大麻点心
Let's go take a walk, find you an edible,

664
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,640
帮你缓缓
even you out a little bit.

665
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:28,580
让另一个还活着的仆人来收拾一下吧
Maybe we'll find the other one that's still alive to clean that shit up.

666
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,370
等等
So, wait.

667
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,540
仆人算数吗
Does the help count?

668
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,660
不算
No!

669
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,180
为什么大家一直这么问
Why does everyone keep asking that?

670
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,290
我们必须...
We must...

671
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:47,840
我们必须...
We must...

672
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,580
见鬼了
What the fuck!

673
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,820
我们必须在黎明前杀死新娘
We must kill the bride by dawn.

674
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,910
我们完蛋了  彻底完蛋了
We're fucked. I mean, we are so fucked.

675
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:07,140
冷静点  先解决问题
Calm down. Work the problem.

676
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,900
我们应该用监控摄像头
We should use the security cameras.

677
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,050
你不尊重传统
You have no respect for tradition.

678
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:12,770
不  她说得对
No, she's right.

679
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:13,960
要是曾祖父有摄像头
Don't you think Great-Grandfather

680
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,350
难道他不会用吗
would've used the security cameras if he had them?

681
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,280
他在摄像头问世前出生又不是传统
I mean, it's not tradition that he was born before cameras.

682
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,810
这太愚蠢了
That's... that's stupid.

683
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,840
没错
Exactly.

684
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,450
时代改变了
Times change.

685
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,920
说起这个  我能用本世纪制造的武器吗
Speaking of which, may I please use a weapon made this century?

686
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,730
-我的包里有一把枪  -是吗
- I have a gun in my purse. - You do?

687
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,820
不  不  我们得用曾祖父的武器
No. No. We use Great-Grandfather's.

688
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,700
这是传统
That's tradition.

689
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,660
你们总是挑来拣去
You pick and choose. Pick and choose.

690
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,020
至少你没让我们戴那些愚蠢的面具
At least you're not making us wear those fucking masks.

691
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,960
没错  那是爸爸的主意
Oh, no. That was Dad's idea.

692
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,490
八十年代的风格
It was the '80s.

693
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:43,530
-必须保持对传统的敬畏  -够了  姐姐
- Our reverence must not wane. - Goddammit, Sis!

694
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,020
我们要是不找到她
If we don't find her

695
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,240
在黎明前举行仪式  我们都会死
and perform the ritual before dawn, we're all dead.

696
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,340
托尼  带上丹尼尔去打开摄像头
Tony, take Daniel and turn on the cameras.

697
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:54,560
其他人分头行动  找找亚历克斯
Everyone else fan out, and somebody find Alex.

698
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,580
天啊
Jesus.

699
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,890
操  操
Fucking shit. Fuck.

700
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,560
快  亚历克斯
Come on, Alex.

701
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,120
监控  监控
Monitors. Monitors.

702
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,840
好了
Okay.

703
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,420
糟糕
Oh, shit.

704
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,310
靠  靠  靠  靠
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

705
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,940
你姑姑总是执着于细节
Your aunt always gets lost in the details.

706
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,800
谁在乎我们怎么找到她
Who gives a shit how we find her?

707
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,290
我完全同意
I agree completely.

708
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,010
-看来不止是我们这么想  -什么
- Looks like we're not the only ones. - What?

709
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,850
有人打开摄像头了
Someone turned on the cameras.

710
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:11,170
是亚历克斯
Alex.

711
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,290
开门  快开门
Open doors. Open fucking doors.

712
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,350
我操
Oh, fuck.

713
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,640
让开
Move.

714
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:15,890
恐怕我做不到
I'm afraid I can't do that.

715
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:26,290
那些弹药只是展品
The ammunition is display only.

716
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,190
你以为我真的那么愚蠢...
Now, did you really think I would be stupid enough to...

717
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,260
干得好
Fuck yeah!

718
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,020
开门  亚历克斯
Open the door, Alex!

719
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,630
她在这里
She's in here!

720
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:45,030
快他妈开门
Open the goddamn door!

721
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,920
该死  亚历克斯
Goddammit, Alex!

722
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,960
开门
Open this door!

723
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,740
不  不
No, no. Hey, no!

724
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:01,650
你要是不帮我们  就滚蛋
If you're not gonna help us, get the hell out.

725
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,410
你他妈别伤害她
You fucking leave her alone!

726
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:06,790
明白了吗
You understand me?

727
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,810
-亚历克斯  -她是我妻子
- Alex! - That's my wife!

728
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,980
亚历克斯
Alex.

729
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:14,570
亚历克斯  你不必这么做
Alex, you don't have to do this.

730
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,160
亚历克斯
Alex.

731
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:19,380
好
Okay.

732
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,750
天啊  天啊
Oh, God. Oh, God.

733
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,490
我明白
I know, I know.

734
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,360
-我明白  -你得帮我  你得帮我
- I know. - You gotta help me. You gotta help me.

735
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:32,810
-她是我的一切  -我明白
- She's everything to me. - I know.

736
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:33,580
我们会救她出去
We'll get her out.

737
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:35,940
-谢谢你  拜托  -我保证
- Okay, thank you. Please. - I promise.

738
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,070
你是哪边的
Whose side are you on?

739
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,850
我分散了他的注意力  不是吗
I distracted him, didn't I?

740
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:48,870
选吧
Call it.

741
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:51,110
谁他妈在乎
Fucking who cares?

742
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:53,400
反面  你搬头
Tails. You take the head.

743
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,640
该死
Goddammit.

744
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,530
-等等  我得拿上我的枪  -回来再拿吧
- Wait, wait. I gotta get my gun. - Just come back for it.

745
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:05,930
快点
Move your ass!

746
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,410
我搬的部分比较重  父亲
I'm carrying the heavy part, Father.

747
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:11,550
多年的酗酒和吸毒已经造成了苦果
Years of alcohol and drug abuse have taken a toll.

748
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,310
-天啊  -天啊
- Oh, my God. - Oh, my God.

749
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,960
-我不明白是怎么回事  -没事
- I don't understand what's going on. - Okay. Okay.

750
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,310
你要保持安静  好吗
I need you to be quiet, okay?

751
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:26,060
我根本不是女仆
Look, I'm not even a maid.

752
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:28,350
勒多马斯先生只是喜欢我的舞姿
Mr. Le Domas, he just likes the way I dance.

753
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:29,540
我们换一下位置
Okay, let's swap places.

754
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,100
他们在找我  不是找你
Yeah, cause they're looking for me, they're not looking for you.

755
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,730
快  快
So, come on. Come on.

756
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:34,260
-拜托  -她在这里
- Please. - She's over here!

757
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:37,200
-她在这里  在这里  -不  不
- She's here! She's over here! - No, no, no, no.

758
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,740
天啊  天啊
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

759
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,330
救我  拜托
Help me, please.

760
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:46,530
-靠  -拜托
- Shit. - Please.

761
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:55,390
靠
Shit.

762
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,520
托尼
Tony.

763
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,310
你在干什么
What are you doing?

764
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:20,640
我们想让他回归家族
We're trying to bring him back to us.

765
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,440
先生
Sir.

766
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:25,370
天啊
Oh, man.

767
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,310
我没能修复安全系统
I was unable to repair the security system.

768
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:31,600
门窗现在都开着
The doors and windows remain unlocked.

769
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,660
恐怕多拉被压扁了  先生
And I'm afraid that Dora has been crushed, sir.

770
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:38,260
在升降机里
By the dumbwaiter.

771
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,170
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}《无人生还》是著名英国推理小说作家
阿加莎·克里斯蒂的名作

772
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,170
无人生还
And then there were none.

773
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:41,640
老天啊
Jesus Christ.

774
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,160
她要干掉我们所有人
She's taking us all out.

775
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,190
-她是怎么做到的  -亲爱的
- How's she doing this? - Sweetheart.

776
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,760
这没道理  贝基
It doesn't make sense, Becky.

777
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:50,830
-她只是个金发小妞  我不...  -托尼
- She's a little blonde twig, and I don't... - Tony.

778
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:54,940
你休息一会儿
Take a minute.

779
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,880
就一小会儿
But just a minute.

780
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,690
我们不能让她跑出去  我们得守住门
We can't let her get out. We've got to guard the doors.

781
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:05,860
他迷失了自我
He lost his way.

782
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:11,070
你根本不应该让他离开我们
You should never have let him leave us.

783
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:12,440
你说什么
Excuse me?

784
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,940
他和我一直都很相似
He and I have always been so much alike.

785
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:16,900
我知道那姑娘会抽出那张牌
I knew the girl would draw that card,

786
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,110
他会面临和我一样的选择
and that he would face the same choice I faced.

787
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:20,350
鬼扯
Horse shit.

788
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,640
没人料得到今晚会这样
None of us expected to be doing this tonight.

789
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,450
我早上八点还要打高尔夫呢
I got a tee time at eight.

790
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:25,650
而且你可能没注意到
And, in case you didn't notice,

791
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,150
这对他来说根本算不上选择
it wasn't much of a choice for him.

792
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:29,790
他一开始就在帮她
He's been helping her from the get-go.

793
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,170
-他恨我们  -不
- He hates us. - No.

794
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,030
他只是害怕真实的自己
He's simply afraid of who he truly is.

795
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:36,840
如同我过去一样
Like I was.

796
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,520
你根本想象不出那天晚上
You'll never know how it felt that night

797
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,590
我得知我唯一爱过的男人必须死的感受
to be told that the only man that I'd ever loved had to die.

798
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:45,400
但我不应该反抗的
But I should not have fought it.

799
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,990
我应该亲手杀了查尔斯的
I should have killed Charles myself.

800
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,820
亚历克斯还来得及做正确的事
There's still time for Alex to do the right thing.

801
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:53,220
他只需要接受真相
He only has to accept the truth.

802
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,110
什么真相
What truth is that?

803
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:01,000
他生来是为了领导家族  而非逃离家族
That he is meant to lead this family, not run from it.

804
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,990
他一开始就讨厌我们的契约
He's hated our pact from the very start.

805
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:05,760
他是有良心的那个儿子  你还记得吗
He's the good son. Do you remember that?

806
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,850
那为什么我们中只有他
Then why is he the only one of us

807
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:11,080
见过椅子上坐的勒贝尔先生
who has ever seen Mr. Le Bail in his chair?

808
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,190
天呐  他当时才五岁
Good God. He was five.

809
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:15,010
他可能是做梦梦到的
He was probably, I don't know, dreaming it.

810
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,810
或者是编的
Or maybe he made it up.

811
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,120
你非这么说也行
Well, if you say so.

812
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:00,060
{\an8}搜索
恶魔契约是真的还是胡扯

813
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,550
{\an8}来自基普的新信息

814
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,130
{\an8}干什么呢  老铁

815
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:04,750
"干什么呢  老铁"
"What up, dawg?"

816
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,430
蠢货
Idiot.

817
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:10,890
{\an8}没什么  家务事

818
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:08,140
没什么
Not much.

819
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,530
家务事
Family shit.

820
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:43,480
乔治
Georgie?

821
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:47,210
感谢老天  好
Oh, thank God. Okay.

822
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:50,190
好  我知道这真的非常非常吓人
Okay, listen, I know this is really, really scary, but...

823
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,480
操
Fuck.

824
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,020
见鬼
Shit.

825
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:00,710
操
Fuck.

826
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,930
操
Fuck.

827
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:54,910
你这小混蛋
You little fucker!

828
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,730
我逮住你了
I got you.

829
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:20,390
我逮住你了  贱人
I got you, bitch.

830
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:26,730
操
Fuck!

831
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:35,390
她在外面  正在跑向北边的栅栏
She's outside, running towards the north fence.

832
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:37,170
我去找其他人
I'll get the others.

833
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:22,610
救命
Help me!

834
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:24,910
救救我
Please help!

835
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,230
救命  救救我
Help. Please help me.

836
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:40,790
救命
Help!

837
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:52,590
操  操  操
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

838
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,450
救命  等等  停车
Help! Wait, stop.

839
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:58,940
救救我
Please, please help me.

840
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:01,090
谢天谢地  谢谢  谢谢
Oh, thank God. Thank you, thank you.

841
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:02,820
-从路上滚开  -等一下
- Get the fuck out of the road. - Please wait.

842
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:08,510
你他妈什么毛病
What the fuck is wrong with you?

843
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,160
你这禽兽
You fucking animal.

844
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:13,120
你这混蛋  人渣
You piece of shit, little, tiny dick-licker,

845
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,460
败类  操
fucking asshole, fucking I...

846
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:23,040
该死的有钱人
Fucking rich people.

847
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:28,920
操
Fuck.

848
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,600
她肯定是逃进林子里去了
She must've gone into the woods.

849
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,240
不过别担心  先生  她跑不远
But don't worry, sir, she won't get far.

850
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,640
我会找到她的
I'll find her.

851
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:00,080
明天我就会修好栅栏
And I'll fix the fence tomorrow.

852
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:01,750
好吧
Well...

853
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,140
她出去了
she's out.

854
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,450
今晚很尽兴
This was fun.

855
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,410
怎么样
What do you say we, uh,

856
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:16,510
我们明天早午餐时平分掉贺礼如何
divvy up the wedding gifts at brunch tomorrow?

857
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:20,700
你以为这是玩游戏吗
Do you think that this is a fucking game?

858
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:22,800
对啊
Yes.

859
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:25,360
还记得这是捉迷藏吗
Hide and seek, remember?

860
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:29,580
你知道要是她活到黎明
Do you realize that if she lives till dawn,

861
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,510
我们都得死吗
that we're all gonna die?

862
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:36,860
你们都还记得范霍恩一家的下场吧
You all remember what happened to the Van Horns, right?

863
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:39,630
他们不是死于房屋起火吗
Didn't they just die in a house fire?

864
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:41,950
新闻是这么报道的  但他们...
Yeah, that's what the press told you, but they...

865
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,710
你不会想知道他们实际上怎么死的  相信我
You don't wanna know how they really died. Trust me.

866
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,670
可不能得罪勒贝尔先生
No, you don't fuck Mr. Le Bail.

867
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:49,720
否则勒贝尔先生会让你好看
Mr. Le Bail fucks you.

868
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:53,010
你就不能协商个更好的契约吗  维克
You couldn't have negotiated better terms, huh, Vic?

869
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:54,280
你就不能
You couldn't have, uh...

870
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,520
比方说  砍砍价
I don't know, maybe talked him down

871
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,760
砍掉整个屠杀条款吗
on the whole eradication clause?

872
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:00,220
这都怪你  混球
Well, here's to you, fucker,

873
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:02,880
因为我们现在大事不好了
because now we are all fucking fucked!

874
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,270
你已经说清楚了  亲爱的  谢谢
I think you made your point, sweetheart, thank you.

875
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:07,170
真他妈的
Holy dick.

876
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:09,860
去等斯蒂文斯  他可能需要你们帮忙
Go wait for Stevens. He might need your help.

877
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:12,350
不是你们俩  你们别碍事
Not you two. I want you out of the way.

878
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:14,470
把女仆的尸体运到羊圈去
Take the maids to the goat pit.

879
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:17,660
还有  甜心  尽量别杀人了
And, pumpkin, try not to kill anyone else.

880
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,080
败类负责清洁工作
Cleanup duty for the fuckups.

881
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,100
-不  爸爸  -去吧  小艾
- No. Daddy. - Come on, Em.

882
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,520
听你妈妈的
Listen to your mother.

883
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,020
我们什么时候溜之大吉
So, at what point do we just cut and run?

884
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:30,280
是吧
Right?

885
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:32,240
拜托  是吧
I mean, come on. Right?

886
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,850
去死
Fuck you.

887
01:01:58,430 --> 01:01:59,930
丹尼尔
Daniel!

888
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:02,360
丹尼尔  帮帮我
Daniel, help!

889
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:25,760
格蕾丝
Grace.

890
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,620
格蕾丝
Grace.

891
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:35,420
她为什么非得抽出"捉迷藏"
Why did she have to pull "Hide and seek"?

892
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,260
你说这是真的吗
Do you think it's real?

893
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:37,620
什么  是说我们不杀了她
What? That we'll implode

894
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:40,580
就会自爆或者自燃而死之类的吗
or burst into flames, or whatever, if we don't kill her?

895
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:42,600
我不知道  你能...
I don't know. Can you...

896
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:45,150
行  我来
All right, I'll...

897
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:48,520
-我需要  我需要你帮我  -不行  你吐的话我也会吐
- I need, I need you to... - I can't. If you barf, I'll barf.

898
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:55,880
一  二  三
One, two, three.

899
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,090
三
Three.

900
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,020
但是上次他们玩捉迷藏时
But you were with them

901
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:02,990
你也和他们一起玩了  是不是
the last time they played hide and seek, weren't you?

902
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:04,190
你当时是六岁还是七岁
Were you six, seven?

903
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:05,570
你还记得什么吗
Do you remember anything?

904
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:07,140
我记得一清二楚
I remember all of it.

905
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:09,170
亚历克斯当时也在
Alex was with me too.

906
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:10,310
我尽力保护他了
I tried to protect him.

907
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:12,450
我不知道他看见或者记住了什么
I don't know what he saw or what he remembers.

908
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:14,280
你总是照顾他
You always looked out for him.

909
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,330
要是那样  我就不会让他娶格蕾丝
If that were true, I wouldn't have let him marry Grace.

910
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,470
他值得更好的兄弟
He deserved a better brother.

911
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:28,070
而我们都该死
And we all deserve to die.

912
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:31,520
我的孩子们不该死
My kids don't.

913
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:35,270
妈妈
Mommy?

914
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,590
宝贝  乔治
Honey! Georgie.

915
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:40,210
你还好吗  你在外面做什么
Are you okay? What are you doing out here?

916
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:41,950
我...
I...

917
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:45,270
我跟着那位女士过来的
I followed that lady down here,

918
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:47,700
然后用我找到的枪击中了她
and I shot her with that gun I found.

919
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,190
你为什么那么做
Why would you do that?

920
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:50,400
大家都是那么做的
That's what everyone else was trying to do.

921
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,820
宝贝
Sweetie.

922
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,670
我真为你骄傲
I am so proud of you.

923
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,500
见鬼
Shit.

924
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:37,770
过来  格蕾丝
Come here, Grace!

925
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,530
该死的混账
Fucking asshole!

926
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,750

01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:18,680
贾斯汀  快他妈报警
Justin, just call the fucking police.

939
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:22,720
女士  这边显示这辆车被报失窃了
Ma'am, it says here that the car was reported stolen.

940
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:24,790
对不起  但我必须把车停下
I'm sorry, but I have to shut it down.

941
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:25,550
不  什么
No, what?

942
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:28,460
不  搞什么  你他妈在开玩笑吗
No, what the fuck? Are you fucking kidding me?

943
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:29,780
这是公司的规定  女士
It's company policy, ma'am.

944
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:31,550
-我无能为力  -不  不  求你了  贾斯汀
- There's nothing I can do. - No, no, no, please. Justin.

945
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:33,480
待在车里  女士  警察在路上了
Just stay with the vehicle, ma'am. Police are on their way.

946
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,120
快他妈启动啊
Just start the fucking car!

947
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:37,800
-好吧  不必飙脏话  -快启动  贾斯汀
- 'Kay, there's no need for profanity. - Start the car, Justin!

948
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,920
天啊  我也无能为力  束手无策
Jesus, there's nothing I can do. My hands are tied.

949
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:49,560
贾斯汀
Justin.

950
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:52,060
喂  贾斯汀
Hello? Justin!

951
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:54,060
还有什么我可以帮你的吗
Is there anything else I can help you with?

952
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:55,960
有  你吃屎去吧  贾斯汀
Yeah, you can go fuck yourself, Justin!

953
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,390

01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:04,050
好吧  没事  没事  没事
Okay. You're okay, you're okay, you're okay.

955
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:05,300
警察在路上了
Police are on the way.

956
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,430
警察在路上了  一切都会...
Police are on their way. Everything's gonna be...

957
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,570
晚安  格蕾丝
Good night, Grace.

958
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:39,500
亚历克斯  是你吗
Alex, is that you?

959
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,920
你现在安全了
Hey, you're safe now.

960
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:44,510
我们要走了
We're leaving.

961
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:01,170
你们在哪
Where are you?

962
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:03,320
我们要到后门了  先生
We're approaching the rear gate, sir.

963
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,200
我们马上就到
We'll be there shortly.

964
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:09,490
好  回到正题
All right. We are back in business.

965
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:33,720
托尼
Tony.

966
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:45,650
斯蒂文斯  小心后面
Hey, Stevens! Look behind you.

967
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:47,280
斯蒂文斯
Stevens!

968
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,740
音乐开小声点  白痴
Turn down the fucking music, you idiot!

969
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,710
不
Oh, no.

970
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:21,340
{\an8}通话中断

971
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,020
见鬼
Oh, fuck.

972
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:25,190
操
Fuck!

973
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:56,220
似曾相识啊
Déjà vu.

974
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:01,980
有意思  我来这里是为了逃避疯狂
It's funny, I... came out here to escape the madness.

975
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:06,860
感谢用一场车祸打扰我的宁静
Thanks for crashing a car into my tranquility.

976
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:10,360
丹尼尔
Daniel.

977
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:15,030
你并不想杀我  你不想让我死
You don't wanna kill me. You don't want me to die.

978
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:17,290
对  我不想
No, I don't.

979
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:18,910
我喜欢你  格蕾丝
I like you, Grace.

980
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:22,540
那就放我走  好吗
So let me go. Okay?

981
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:29,880
我没骨气
I'm weak.

982
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:34,720
你是个好人
You're a good guy.

983
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,700
你真的是个大好人
You're a really, really, really good guy.

984
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:40,020
还有亚历克斯  亚历克斯爱你
And Alex, Alex loves you.

985
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,640
你也爱他
And you love him.

986
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:49,980
你要是动手了  他不会原谅你的
He's not gonna forgive you if you do this.

987
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:52,570
或许是吧
Maybe not.

988
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:54,700
但至少他能活下来
But at least he'll be alive.

989
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:59,490
我不能让我全家人因为你而死掉
I can't let my entire family die because of you.

990
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:01,250
真是疯了
It's insane.

991
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:04,040
你没意识到这有多荒唐吗
Can't you see it's insane?

992
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:07,500
谁都不会死  谁都不会  都不会死
No one's gonna die... No one, no one is gonna die.

993
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:10,000
而你可以做些什么
And you can do something about it.

994
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,800
那都是胡扯
It's bullshit!

995
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:13,130
不
No.

996
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,890
我不是你想象的那样
I am not who you think I am.

997
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,260
亚历克斯才是脱身的那个人
Alex is the one who got out.

998
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:22,640
能救你的也只有他
If anyone was gonna save you, it would've been him.

999
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,440
现在你可以出来了
You can come out now.

1000
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:39,330
怎么  你知道我在这
What, you knew I was here?

1001
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:42,370
我醉了  又没瞎
I'm drunk, I'm not blind.

1002
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:46,020
我们得快点了  还有不到一小时就黎明了
We gotta move. Less than an hour till dawn.

1003
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:48,380
我们还得给她为仪式做好准备
And we still need to prepare her for the ritual.

1004
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:10,270
格蕾丝在哪
Where's Grace?

1005
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,440
她身体不适
She's indisposed.

1006
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:20,950
你不会真以为我会坐视不理吧
You didn't think I was just gonna let it happen, did you?

1007
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:28,500
对于家人  只能保持乐观
With family, one hopes for the best.

1008
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:30,880
问题是
The thing is...

1009
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:35,010
我喜欢她
I like her.

1010
01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:38,760
我不想这么做
I don't wanna do this.

1011
01:12:39,570 --> 01:12:43,810
但我们必须保护家族
But we have to protect the family.

1012
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:46,100
如果她死了
If she dies...

1013
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,190
我会杀了你
I'll kill you.

1014
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:53,820
好吧
Well...

1015
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,030
那看来我难逃一死了
then I suppose I'm dead either way.

1016
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,090
是  或许那都是胡说八道  什么都不会发生
Yeah, and maybe it's a crock of shit and nothing will happen.

1017
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:01,320
别闹了
Oh, please.

1018
01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:03,490
如果你真这么想
If you believed that,

1019
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:06,620
你根本就不会让她去抽牌
you wouldn't have let her draw a card at all.

1020
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:17,970
你为什么离开我们  亚历克斯
Why did you leave us, Alex?

1021
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:21,970
我不知道  妈
I don't know, Mom.

1022
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,720
我不知道  或许是在某个晚上
I don't know. Maybe one night when I was

1023
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:27,030
我念着咒语给羊割喉的时候
chanting and slicing the throat of a goat,

1024
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:30,390
突然意识到这么做不太正常吧
it occurred to me that that wasn't a completely normal thing to do.

1025
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:36,400
但这才是最让我害怕的
But, and this is what scared me the most...

1026
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,110
曾经感觉是正常的
it felt normal.

1027
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,370
确实是
It did.

1028
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:47,620
然后我意识到如果家人说没关系
And I realized that you'll do pretty much anything...

1029
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,250
那你什么事都能做得出来
if your family says it's okay.

1030
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,880
然后我遇到了格蕾丝
And then I met Grace.

1031
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:01,260
她与你们所有人截然相反
She's the opposite of all of you.

1032
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,100
她是好人
She's good.

1033
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:11,160
她让我觉得我也可以变好
And she made me feel like I could be good too.

1034
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,900
所以如果在你们和她之间选
So, if it comes down to you or her,

1035
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,900
我会选她
I choose her.

1036
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,200
我不信你说的话
I don't believe you.

1037
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:27,050
我觉得你也不相信
And I don't think that you believe

1038
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:29,830
一个你才认识一年半的女孩
that a girl that you've known for a year and a half...

1039
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:34,080
会比我更了解你
knows you better than I do.

1040
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:56,610
我们家有个很特别的朋友  勒贝尔先生
Our family has a very special friend named Mr. Le Bail.

1041
01:14:57,330 --> 01:15:01,990
勒贝尔先生让我们拥有了今天这一切美好的事物
Mr. Le Bail is the reason we have all the nice things we have.

1042
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:08,740
但勒贝尔先生有时也需要我们的回报
But sometimes Mr. Le Bail wants something from us in return.

1043
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:10,700
你可以的  菲奇
You got this, Fitch.

1044
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:12,970
你可以的  菲奇
You got this, Fitch!

1045
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:14,810
别怂  菲奇
Don't be a bitch, Fitch.

1046
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:16,180
别怂  菲奇
Don't be a bitch, Fitch.

1047
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:17,590
你可以的  怂炮
You got this, bitch.

1048
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:24,300
我知道今晚没有按计划进行
I know tonight didn't go as planned.

1049
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:27,760
但我会弥补的  勒贝尔先生
But I'll make it right, Mr. Le Bail.

1050
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,270
请拭目以待
You'll see.

1051
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:59,190
我们今晚在祖先面前
We renew our pledge this night,

1052
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:02,190
献上鲜活的血肉
as our ancestors before us...

1053
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:06,240
重新宣誓
with this offering of living flesh and blood.

1054
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:17,710
万岁
Hail...

1055
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,380
弟弟
Brother!

1056
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:36,950
有毒
Poisoned!

1057
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:38,700
你这个混蛋
You son of a bitch!

1058
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,020
天啊
Oh, God.

1059
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:47,630
你给我们喝了什么
What did you give us?

1060
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:49,030
我们在女仆们身上倒的东西
Stuff we poured on the maids.

1061
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:50,700
白瓶子  红瓶盖
White bottle, little red cap.

1062
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:52,660
盐酸
Hydrochloric acid!

1063
