19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,080
有时候  我觉得我被诅咒了
Sometimes, I think I'm cursed.

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,070
因为一些在我出生之前发生的事
Because of something that happened before I was even born.

21
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,060
很久以前  有这么一家人
See, a long time ago, there was this family.

22
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,310
爸爸是一个音乐家
The papa, he was a musician.

23
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,060
他和他的家人一起唱歌跳舞  过得很幸福
He and his family would sing and dance and count their blessings.

24
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,000
可是爸爸有个梦想  要唱歌给全世界听
But he also had a dream. To play for the world.

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,780
有一天
And one day,

26
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:41,190
他背着他的吉他离开了  再也没有回来
he left with his guitar and never returned.

27
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,390
而妈妈
And the mama...

28
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,870
她没时间为爸爸的离开而伤心难过
She didn't have time to cry over that walk-away musician.

29
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,100
抛弃了生命中所有的音乐后
After banishing all music from her life

30
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,440
她想了个办法继续养活自己的女儿
she found a way to provide for her daughter.

31
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,290
她卷起了袖子  学习怎么做鞋子
She rolled up her sleeves and she learned to make shoes.

32
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,260
她明明可以学做糖果
She could have made candy,

33
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,290
或者烟花  或者给摔跤手穿的闪亮裤子
or fireworks, or sparkly underwear for wrestlers,

34
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,340
但是不  她偏偏选了鞋子
but no, she chose shoes.

35
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,870
后来她教女儿怎么做鞋子
Then she taught her daughter to make shoes.

36
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,810
然后又教会了她的女婿
And later, she taught her son-in-law.

37
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,050
她的孙辈也不例外
Then her grandkids got roped in.

38
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,310
随着家族日渐壮大  生意也越做越大
As her family grew, so did the business.

39
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,560
音乐曾经让她的家族分崩离析
Music had torn her family apart.

40
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,510
但是鞋子又帮她建家立业
But shoes held them all together.

41
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,790
那个女人
You see, that woman

42
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,790
就是我的曾曾奶奶  伊美黛
was my great-great-grandmother, Mama Imelda.

43
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,350
我出生之前很久她就死了
She died way before I was born.

44
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,820
但是每年亡灵节  我们家
But my family still tells her story

45
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,580
还是会讲她的故事
every year on Dia de los Muertos...

46
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
这是纪念逝者的节日
the Day of the Dead.

47
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,370
她的小女儿
And her little girl,

48
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,200
就是我的曾祖母  可可曾奶奶
she's my great-grandmother, Mama Coco.

49
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,160
你好  可可曾奶奶
Hola, Mama Coco.

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,480
你好吗  胡里奥
How are you, Julio?

51
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,500
其实我的名字叫米格尔
Actually, my name is Miguel.

52
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,410
可可曾奶奶记性不太好了
Mama Coco has trouble remembering things.

53
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,390
但是我还是很喜欢和她聊天
But it's good to talk to her anyway.

54
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,580
我几乎所有事都和她说
So, I tell her pretty much everything.

55
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,020
我以前这样跑步
I used to run like this.

56
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,780
但现在我这样跑步快多了
But now I run like this which is way faster.

57
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,720
胜利者是  超级无敌的可可曾奶奶
And the winner is Luchadora Coco!

58
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,390
我这边有个酒窝  这边没有
I have a dimple on this side, but not on this side.

59
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,010
有酒窝没酒窝  有酒窝没酒窝
Dimple, no dimple. Dimple, no dimple.

60
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,460
米格尔  好好吃你的
Miguel, eat your food.

61
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,260
我的奶奶  她是可可曾奶奶的女儿
My abuelita, she's Mama Coco's daughter.

62
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,370
你太瘦了  孩子  多吃点
Oh, you're a twig, mijo. Have some more.

63
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,480
不用了  谢谢
No, gracias.

64
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,950
我问过你要不要再来点玉米粉蒸肉
I asked if you would like more tamales!

65
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,910
好吧
Sí?

66
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,510
我记得你就是这么说的
That's what I thought you said!

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,320
奶奶和伊美黛老祖宗
Abuelita runs our house

68
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,320
当年一样管理这个家族
just like Mama Imelda did.

69
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,070
不准有音乐
No music!

70
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,500
不准有音乐
No music!

71
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,130
不准有音乐
No music!

72
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,200
我觉得我们是墨西哥唯一一个
I think we're the only family in Mexico

73
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,940
讨厌音乐的家族
who hates music.

74
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,140
我的家人觉得无所谓  但是我...
And my family's fine with that. But me...

75
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,480
-午餐之前回来  孩子  -爱你  妈妈
- Be back by lunch, mijo. - Love you, Mama.

76
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,270
我和我其他家人不一样
I am not like the rest of my family!

77
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,100
-你好  米格尔  -你好
- Hola, Miguel! - Hola!

78
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,000
-非常感谢  -不客气  米格尔
- Muchas gracias. - De nada, Miguel.

79
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,270
但丁
Hey! Dante!

80
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,830
起来  趴下  打滚  握手[抖动]
Sit. Down. Roll over. Shake.

81
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,490
击拳
Fist bump!

82
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,820
好样的  但丁
Good boy, Dante!

83
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,860
我知道我不该喜欢音乐
I know I'm not supposed to love music.

84
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,420
但这不是我的错  是他的错
But it's not my fault! It's his!

85
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,570
埃内斯托·德拉库斯
Ernesto de la Cruz.

86
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,320
有史以来最伟大的音乐家
The greatest musician of all time.

87
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,310
在这个广场上
Right here in this very plaza,

88
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,700
埃内斯托·德拉库斯向着成为墨西哥历史上
Ernesto de la Cruz took his first steps...

89
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:12,140
最伟大的歌手  迈出了第一步
toward becoming the most beloved singer in Mexican history.

90
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,290
他一开始是个圣塔塞西莉亚的无名小卒  像我一样
He started out a total nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me.

91
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,420
但是当他开始唱歌  人们就爱上了他
But when he played music, he made people fall in love with him.

92
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,860
他参演过电影
He starred in movies.

93
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,290
他有最炫酷的吉他  他能飞
He had the coolest guitar! He could fly!

94
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,950
他写了很多首很棒的歌
And he wrote the best songs.

95
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,070
{\an8}埃内斯托

96
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,000
{\an8}埃内斯托·德拉库斯

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,680
{\an8}德拉库斯

98
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,580
{\an8}埃内斯托·德拉库斯
请记住我

99
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,250
但是我一直以来最喜欢的是...
But my all-time favorite, it's...

100
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,790
{\an8}埃内斯托·德拉库斯
请记住我

101
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,810
请记住我
Remember me

102
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,870
请记住我
Remember me

103
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,330
虽然再见必须说
Though I have to say goodbye

104
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,560
-请记住我  -请记住我
- Remember me - Remember me

105
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,440
眼泪不要坠落
Don't let it make you cry

106
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,160
我虽然要离你远去
For even if I'm far away

107
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,940
你住在我心底
I hold you in my heart

108
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,810
在每个分离的夜里
I sing a secret song to you

109
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,450
为你唱一首歌
Each night we are apart

110
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,340
请记住我
Remember me

111
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,970
虽然我要去远方
Though I have to travel far

112
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,660
请记住我
Remember me

113
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,880
当听见吉他的悲伤
Each time you hear a sad guitar

114
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,530
这就是我跟你在一起唯一的凭据
Know that I'm with you the only way that I can be

115
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,730
直到我再次拥抱你
Until you're in my arms again

116
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,310
他过着人人梦寐以求的生活
He lived the kind of life you dream about.

117
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:14,730
{\an8}请记住我
Remember me

118
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,550
直到1942年
Until 1942.

119
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,300
他被一个大钟砸死了
When he was crushed by a giant bell.

120
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,420
我想变得和他一样
I want to be just like him.

121
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,790
有时候  我看着德拉库斯
Sometimes, I look at De la Cruz

122
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,190
冥冥之中感觉我们有着某种联系
and I get this feeling like we're connected.

123
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,780
好像如果他能成为音乐家  也许有一天我也能
Like if he could play music, maybe someday, I could too.

124
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,730
要是我的家人不阻挠就好了
If it wasn't for my family.

125
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,100
小伙子
Ay-ay-ay, muchacho.

126
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,350
我要你擦鞋  没想听你的人生故事
I asked for a shoe shine not your life story.

127
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,970
对不起
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

128
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,740
我只是在家里没法说这些话  所以...
I just can't really talk about any of this at home. So...

129
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,050
如果我是你
If I were you,

130
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,960
我就冲回家和我的家人们说...
I'd march right up to my family and say...

131
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,600
"我就是个音乐家  接受吧"
"Hey, I'm a musician. Deal with it."

132
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,140
我可绝对说不出口
I could never say that.

133
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,010
你在搞音乐吧
You are a musician, no?

134
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,250
我不知道算不算
I don't know.

135
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,990
我是说  我只唱给自己听过
I mean, I only really play for myself.

136
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,130
德拉库斯是因为隐藏了自己的才华  才成为
Ah! Did De la Cruz become the world's best musician

137
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,180
世界上最棒的音乐家吗
by hiding his skills?

138
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,130
不  他走向广场
No! He walked out onto that plaza

139
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,350
大声演唱给大家听
and he played out loud.

140
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,470
你看  他们在布置今晚的场地了
Mira, Mira, they're setting up for tonight!

141
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,270
亡灵节音乐比赛
The music competition for Dia de Muertos.

142
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,960
{\an8}亡灵节才艺大赛
中央广场  晚上七点

143
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,730
你想和你的偶像一样吗  去报名吧
You want to be like your hero? You should sign up!

144
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,390
我的家人会气疯了的
Uh-uh. My family would freak!

145
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,340
如果你害怕  那就乖乖做鞋子吧
Look, if you're too scared then, well, have fun making shoes.

146
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,910
别这样  德拉库斯经常怎么说的来着
Come on, what did De la Cruz always say?

147
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,090
抓住你的机遇
Seize your moment?

148
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,370
让我看看你的本事  小伙子
Show me what you got, muchacho.

149
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,260
我来做你第一个观众
I'll be your first audience.

150
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,270
米格尔
Miguel!

151
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,970
-奶奶  -你在干什么
- Abuelita! - What are you doing here?

152
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,970
离我孙子远一点
You leave my grandson alone.

153
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,080
太太  别紧张
Dona, please!

154
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,450
我只是在擦鞋
I was just getting a shine.

155
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,340
我很清楚你的把戏  臭乐手  他和你说了什么
I know your tricks, mariachi. What did he say to you?

156
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,390
他只是在给我看他的吉他
He was just showing me his guitar.

157
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,770
真不要脸
Shame on you.

158
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:12,160
我的孙子是个纯洁可爱的小天使
My grandson is a sweet little Angelito Querido Cielito.

159
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,840
他不需要你的音乐  臭乐手
He wants no part of your music, mariachi.

160
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,720
你离他远一点
You keep away from him.

161
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:24,100
可怜的小家伙  没事了  孩子
Ay, pobrecito. Oh, estas bien, mijo.

162
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,030
你知道你不该来这种地方
You know better than to be here in this place!

163
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,370
你赶紧给我回家
You will come home. Now.

164
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,920
我们和你说了多少遍了
How many times have we told you?

165
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,040
那个广场上全是臭乐手
That plaza is crawling with mariachis.

166
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,040
知道了  叔叔
Yes, Tio Berto.

167
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,400
-不不不不不  -走开  走开
- No, no, no, no, no! - Ah! Go away, you. Go!

168
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,890
那是但丁
It's just Dante.

169
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,980
不要给流浪狗起名字
Never name a street dog.

170
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,090
这样它们会一直跟着你  去捡我的鞋子
They'll follow you forever. Now, go get my shoe.

171
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,510
{\an8}里维拉家族鞋店

172
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,050
我在乐手广场找到了你们儿子
I found your son in Mariachi Plaza.

173
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,090
米格尔
Ay, Miguel!

174
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,600
你知道奶奶不喜欢那个广场
You know how Abuelita feels about the plaza.

175
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,070
我只是在擦鞋子
I was just shining shoes.

176
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,780
一个音乐家的鞋子
A musician's shoes!

177
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,740
但那个广场上有很多鞋可以擦
But the plaza's where all the foot traffic is.

178
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,640
如果奶奶说不许去广场  那就不许去广场
If Abuelita says no more plaza, then no more plaza.

179
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,870
-但是那今晚呢  -今晚怎么了
- But what about tonight? - What's tonight?

180
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,700
他们要举办一个才艺大赛
Well, they're having this talent show.

181
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,630
我想能不能...
And I thought I might...

182
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,830
-报名吗  -也许吧
- Sign up? - Well, maybe?

183
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,820
你得有才艺才能参加才艺大赛
You have to have talent to be in a talent show.

184
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,380
你打算表演什么  擦鞋吗
What are you gonna do? Shine shoes?

185
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,140
今晚是亡灵节
It's Dia de los Muertos.

186
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,770
谁都不该出门  今晚应该家族团聚
No one's going anywhere. Tonight is about family.

187
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,440
灵坛  我们走
Ofrenda room. Vamonos.

188
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,120
别这样看我
Don't give me that look.

189
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,740
我们的祖先每年只有亡灵节的晚上
Dia de los Muertos is the one night of the year

190
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,170
才能来看我们
our ancestors can come visit us.

191
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,040
我们将他们的照片供奉在灵坛上
We've put their photos on the ofrenda

192
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,920
他们的灵魂才能够过来
so their spirits can cross over.

193
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,210
这可是非常重要的事
That is very important.

194
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,820
如果我们不放照片  他们就来不了
If we don't put them up, they can't come.

195
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,460
我们做了这些吃的
We made all this food,

196
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,420
放上这些他们生前喜欢的东西  孩子
set out the things they loved in life, mijo.

197
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,780
都是为了让他们能回来一家团聚
All this work to bring the family together.

198
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,490
我不希望你随便乱跑
I don't want you sneaking off to who knows where.

199
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,370
你去哪里
Where are you going?

200
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,800
我以为你说完了
I thought we were done.

201
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,860
天啊  我们都是这个家的一份子
Ay, Dios mio. Being part of this family means

202
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,980
就是要和家人待在一起
being here for this family.

203
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,110
我不希望你最后和...
I don't want to see you end up like...

204
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,950
可可曾奶奶的爸爸一样吗
Like Mama Coco's papa?

205
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,680
不要提那个男人  最好把他忘掉
Never mention that man! He's better off forgotten.

206
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,790
但是你先提...
But you're the one who...

207
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,080
我只是...
I was just...

208
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,420
但是...我...
But... I...

209
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,020
爸爸  爸爸回来了吗
Papa? Papa is home?

210
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,530
妈妈  没事的  没事了
Mama, calmese, calmese.

211
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,200
爸爸回来了吗
Papa is coming home?

212
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,730
不  妈妈  没事的  我在呢
No, Mama. It's okay. I'm here.

213
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,430
你是谁
Who are you?

214
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,130
休息一下吧  妈妈
Rest, Mama.

215
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,870
我对你严厉是因为我关心你  米格尔
I'm hard on you because I care, Miguel.

216
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,480
米格尔  米格尔
Miguel? Miguel?

217
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,560
我们该拿这个孩子怎么办
What are we going to do with that boy?

218
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,620
你说得对  他就需要这个
You're right. That's just what he needs.

你会给我惹麻烦的  伙计
You're gonna get me in trouble, boy.

223
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,860
会被人听到的
Someone could hear me.

224
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,540
真希望真的有人想听我演奏
I wish someone wanted to hear me.

225

除了你  好吧

{\an8}德拉库斯精选

228
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,450
我必须要唱歌  我必须要演奏
I have to sing. I have to play!

229
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,340
音乐不仅仅只在我心中  音乐是我的生命
The music, it's not just in me, it is me.

230
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,050
当生活让我失望  我弹起我的吉他
When life gets me down, I play my guitar.

231
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,240
这世界也许自有它的规则
The rest of the world may follow the rules,

232
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,010
但我必须遵从我的内心
but I must follow my heart.

233
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,810
你知道那种感觉  空气中都有歌声
You know that feeling like there's a song in the air and...

234
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,800
只为你而演奏
it's playing just for you?

235

这感觉如此贴近
A feeling so close...

236
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,100
你仿若触手可及
You could reach out and touch it

237
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,300
我从未想过
I never knew

238
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,940
会有如此热忱渴望
I could want something so much

239
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,690
可它真切存在
but it's true

240
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,870
你得有信心  修女
You must have faith, sister.

241
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,260
但神父他不会听我的
Oh, but, Padre, he will never listen.

242
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,530
他会听得进音乐
He will listen. To music.

243
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,580
唯有歌声
Only a song

拥有改变心意的力量

永远不要低估音乐的力量

246
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,590
但神父不会允许的
But my father, he will never give his permission.

247
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,550
我受够了要请求别人的允许
I am done asking permission.

248
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,570
当你的机会到来时  你绝不能与它擦肩而过
When you see your moment, you mustn't let it pass you by.

249
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,610
你必须抓住机遇
You must seize it!

250

德拉库斯先生
Senor de la Cruz,

251
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,920
为了抓住机遇您都做了些什么
what did it take for you to seize your moment?

252
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,700
我必须坚信我的梦想
I had to have faith in my dream.

253
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,900
没有人会将成功送到我面前
No one was going to hand it to me.

254
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,440
我必须靠自己的努力去追求梦想
It was up to me to reach for that dream.

255
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,080
-决不放弃  让梦想成真  -让梦想成真
- Grab it tight and make it come true. - and make it come true.

No, no. We have to make a clear path.

261
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,260
花瓣会指引着我们的先人回家
The petals guide our ancestors home.

262
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,700
我们可不想让他们的亡灵迷路了

263
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,470
我们想要他们回来

266
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,240
这张桌子要放在哪里
Where should we put this table?

放在院子里  孩子
In the courtyard, mijos.

你想让它挨着厨房吗
You want it down by the kitchen?

269
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,690
对  挨着另一张桌子

米格尔  你奶奶想出了一个非常棒的主意
Miguel, your abuelita had the most wonderful idea.

273
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,820
我们都决定了  是时候让你来店里工作了
We've all decided. It's time you joined us in the workshop!

274
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,250
-什么  -以后不用再擦鞋了
- What? - No more shining shoes.

275

你可以做鞋了  每天放学回来就做
You'll be making them every day after school.

276
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,030

万一我做不好怎么办
But what if I'm no good at making shoes?

283
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,800

可可曾奶奶  你爸是埃内斯托·德拉库斯吗
Mama Coco, is your papa Ernesto de la Cruz?

293
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,820
爸爸  爸爸
Papa! Papa!

294
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,540
爸爸  爸爸  就是他
Papa! Papa! It's him!

295
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,440
我知道我的曾曾爷爷是谁了
I know who my great-great-grandfather was.

296
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,280
米格尔  从那上面下来
Miguel, get down from there.

297
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,010
可可曾奶奶的爸爸是埃内斯托·德拉库斯
Mama Coco's father was Ernesto de la Cruz!

298
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,610
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

299
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,530
我会成为一个音乐家
I'm gonna be a musician!

300
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,690
这些都是什么
What is all this?

301
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,730
你瞒着自己的家人做了这种事
You keep secrets from your own family?

302
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,740
都是因为他在广场上待的时间太多了
It's all that time he spends in the plaza.

303
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,390
让他脑袋里装满了疯狂的幻想
Fills his head with crazy fantasies.

304
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,970
这才不是幻想
It's not a fantasy.

305
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,160
这个人是埃内斯托·德拉库斯
That man was Ernesto de la Cruz!

306
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,980
历史上最伟大的音乐家
The greatest musician of all time!

307
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,870
我们不认识这个人
We've never known anything about this man!

308
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,450
但无论他是谁  他都抛弃了他的家庭
But whoever he was, he still abandoned his family.

309
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,860
你学他坏样不会有任何前途
This is no future for my son.

310
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,870
但爸爸  你说我的家人会指引我
But, Papa, you said my family would guide me.

311
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,090
德拉库斯也是我的家人
Well, De la Cruz is my family.

312
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,890
我就应该玩音乐
I'm supposed to play music.

313
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,380
休想  那个人的音乐是种诅咒
Never! That man's music was a curse.

314
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,000
我不会允许的
I will not allow it.

315
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,530
-只要您让我...  -米格尔...
- If you would just let... - Miguel...

316
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,100
你得听你家人的话
You will listen to your family.

317
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,930
别再碰音乐
No more music.

318
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,670
-你们听我弹一次就好  -没得商量
- Just listen to me play! - End of argument.

319
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,250
你想和那个男人下场一样吗  被遗忘
You want to end up like that man? Forgotten?

320
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,540
照片上不了家里的灵坛
Left off your family's ofrenda?

321
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,060
我才不在乎自己有没有被什么愚蠢的灵坛供奉
I don't care if I'm on some stupid ofrenda.

322
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,100
-不  -妈妈
- No! - Mama!

323
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,150
就这样  没有吉他  没有音乐
There. No guitar. No music.

324
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,750
好了  和家人吃个饭这事儿就翻篇了
Oh, come. You'll feel better after you eat with your family.

325
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,650
我不想再待在这个家了
I don't want to be in this family!

326
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,150
米格尔  米格尔
Miguel! Miguel!

327
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,920
{\an8}亡灵节才艺大赛

328
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,390
我想像德拉库斯一样在广场上表演
I want to play in the plaza, like De la Cruz.

329
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,610
我还能报名吗
Can I still sign up?

330
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,000
你有乐器吗
You got an instrument?

331
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,650
没有  但要是我能借把吉他...
No. But if I can borrow a guitar...

332
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,680
参赛的音乐人得自备乐器
Musicians got to bring their own instruments.

333
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,340
孩子  找把吉他来
You find a guitar, kid,

334
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,680
我就帮你报名
I'll put you on the list.

335
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,740
-我能借你的吉他吗  -抱歉  小伙子
- Can I borrow your guitar? - Sorry, muchacho.

336
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,220
-你们有多余的吉他吗  -没有
- You guys have a spare guitar? - No.

337
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,700
我想借下吉他  就一小会儿
I need a guitar just for a little bit.

338
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,430
走开  孩子
Get out of here, kid.

339
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,510
曾曾爷爷  我该怎么办
Great-great-grandfather, what am I supposed to do?

340
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,430
{\an8}抓住机遇

341
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,730
不不不
No, no, no, no.

342
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,450
但丁  停下  闭嘴
Dante, stop! Callate! Shh!

343
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,420
对不起
I'm sorry.

344
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:07,490
德拉库斯先生  请不要生气
Senor De la Cruz, please don't be mad.

345
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,030
我是米格尔
I'm Miguel.

346
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:13,580
您的曾曾孙子  我得借这把吉他
Your great-great grandson. I need to borrow this.

347
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,180
我们的家人觉得音乐是种诅咒
Our family thinks music is a curse.

348
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,730
他们都不理解我  但我知道你能理解
None of them understand but I know you would have.

349
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,210
你会让我跟从自己的内心
You would have told me to follow my heart.

350
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,030
抓住我的机遇
To seize my moment!

351
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,890
如果你同意的话
So, if it's all right with you,

352
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,100
我要去广场上表演  就像你一样
I'm gonna play in the plaza. Just like you did!

353
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,240
那把吉他不见了
The guitar! It's gone!

354
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,120
有人偷了德拉库斯的吉他
Somebody stole De la Cruz's guitar!

355
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,460
窗户破了  看
The window's broken. Look!

356
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,410
是谁  谁在里面
All right, who's in there?

357
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,710
抱歉  事情不是看上去那样
I'm sorry. It's not what it looks like.

358
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,120
德拉库斯是我的...
De la Cruz is my...

359
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,200
里面没有人
There's nobody here.

360
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,250
-米格尔  -妈妈
- Miguel! - Mama!

361
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:24,040
米格尔  回家吧  你在哪  米格尔
Miguel, come home. Where are you, Miguel?

362
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,450
天啊  孩子  你还好吗
Dios mio! Little boy. Are you okay?

363
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,320
来  我拉你一把
Here. Let me help you.

364
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,600
谢谢  我...
Thanks. I...

365
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,600
你怎么回事
Do you mind? Whoa!

366
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,510
看看她长多大了
Look how big she's getting.

367
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,840
但丁  你能看到我吗
Dante! You can see me?

368
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:21,700
等等  发生什么了  但丁
Wait! What's going on? Dante!

369
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,210
-对不起  对不起  -米格尔
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Miguel?

370
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,660
-米格尔  -米格尔
- Miguel? - Miguel?

371
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,890
你怎么来了  你怎么在这里  你还能看到我们
You're here? Here, here. And you can see us?

372
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,430
我们的小小米格尔
Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to!

373
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,870
请问我怎么会认识你
Remind me how I know you.

374
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,790
我们是你的家人  孩子
We're your family, mijo.

375
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,580
-罗西塔姑婆  -对
- Tia Rosita? - Si.

376
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,900
-胡里奥爷爷  -你好
- Papa Julio? - Hola.

377
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,460
维多利亚姨婆
Tia Victoria?

378
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,850
他看起来还没死透
He doesn't seem entirely dead.

379
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,450
也不像还活着
He's not quite alive either.

380
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:00,250
我们得找到老祖宗伊美黛  她知道如何解决
We need Mama Imelda. She'll know how to fix this.

381
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:04,200
老祖宗伊美黛出事了
Oye! It's Mama Imelda.

382
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,490
她过不来
She couldn't cross over.

383
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,990
-她被卡住了  -卡在了另一边
- She's stuck! - On the other side!

384
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,780
奥斯卡叔公  菲利普叔公
Tio Oscar? Tio Felipe?

385
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,170
你好  米格尔
Hey, Miguel.

386
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,480
我感觉这可能和你有关
I have a feeling this has something to do with you.

387
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,540
但如果老祖宗伊美黛没法来找我们...
But if Mama Imelda can't come to us...

388
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,990
我们就去找她  出发
Then we are going to her. Vamonos!

389
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,680
走吧  米格尔  没关系的
Come on, Miguel. It's okay.

390
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:55,100
但丁  但丁  但丁等等
Dante? Dante! Dante, wait up!

391
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,580
你得和我待着  孩子  我们不知道...这是哪里
You got to stay with me, boy. We don't know... where...

392
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,410
这不是一场梦  你们真的就住在这个地方
This isn't a dream then. You're all really out there.

393
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,530
-你觉得我们不存在吗  -我也不知道
- You thought we weren't? - Well, I don't know.

394
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,180
我还以为那可能是
I thought it might've been one of those

395
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,030
大人编来骗小孩子的
made up things that adults tell kids.

396
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,480
就像维生素一样
Like vitamins.

397
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,750
米格尔  维生素真的存在
Miguel, vitamins are a real thing.

398
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,810
现在我有点相信了
Well, now I'm thinking maybe they could be.

399
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,030
宝贝  你这样盯着别人可不太礼貌...
Mija, it's not nice to stare at...

400
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,790
我的天啊
Ay! Santa Maria!

401
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,550
那些是爱波瑞吉吗  但它们是...
Are those... Alebrijes! But those are...

402
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:56,290
真的爱波瑞吉  灵兽
Real alebrijes. Spirit creatures.

403
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,130
它们会给亡灵引路
They guide souls on their journey.

404
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,680
小心脚下  它们到处便便
Watch your step. They make caquitas everywhere.

405
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,720
欢迎回到亡灵之国
Welcome back to the Land of the Dead.

406

00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,880
欢迎回来  有要申报的东西吗
Welcome back. Anything to declare?

409
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,490
几根小油条  家人送来的
Some churros. From my family.

410
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,310
好好享用  下一位
How wonderful. Next.

411
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,290
如果您在出入关时遇到问题
If you are experiencing travel issues,

412
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,550
家人团聚署的工作人员

有请下一家

415
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,330
两位的照片摆在你们儿子的灵坛上
Your photos are on your son's ofrenda.

416
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,420

419
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,900
旅途愉快
Enjoy your visit.

420
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,170
下一位

您的照片在您牙医的灵坛上  祝旅途愉快
Your photo's on your dentist's ofrenda. Enjoy your visit.

422
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,560
-谢谢  -下一位
- Gracias. - Next?

423
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,340
对  是我  弗里达·卡罗
Yes! It is I. Frida Kahlo.

424
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,670
我们能不能跳过扫描这一步
Shall we skip the scanner?

425
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,430
摆我的灵坛太多  你的小机器会挂掉
I'm on so many ofrendas it'll just overwhelm your blinky thingy.

426
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:54,610
糟糕  好像没人摆你的照片  弗瑞达
Well, shoot, looks like no one put up your photo, Frida.

427
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:59,030
好吧  我刚说自己是弗里达  我撒谎了
Okay, when I said I was Frida, just now, that was a lie.

428
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,590
我为自己的行为道歉
And I apologize for doing that.

429
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,380
灵坛上没照片就没有过桥权
No photo on an ofrenda, no crossing the bridge.

430
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,280
我就悄悄溜过去  你都不会知道我走了
I'm just gonna zip right over. You won't even know I'm gone.

431
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,780
马上到了  就差一点点
Almost... there. Just a little further.

432
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,520
起来吧你
Upsy-daisy...

433
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,900
行  好吧  谁在乎啊  臭花瓣桥
Fine. Okay. Fine, who cares? Dumb flower bridge!

434
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,650
要是没人摆我的照片我都不知道该怎么办
I don't know what I'd do if no one put up my photo.

435
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,100
-下一位  -过来孩子  轮到我们了
- Next? - Oh! Come, mijo. It's our turn.

436
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,000
欢迎回来  朋友们  有要申报的东西吗
Welcome back, amigos. Anything to declare?

437
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,910
事实上还真有
As a matter of fact, yes.

438
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,010
你好
Hola.

439
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,740
呼叫玛尔塔·冈萨雷斯-拉莫斯
Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos.

440
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,090
请上报给第七级人员
Please report to Level Seven.

441
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,150
我想念我的鼻子
I miss my nose.

442
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,350
拜托了  帮帮忙  朋友
Come on, help us out, amigo.

443
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,230
我们今晚还有十几个灵坛要赶
We got to get to a dozen ofrendas tonight.

444
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,130
我们不去你前妻家过节
We are not visiting your ex-wife's family for Dia de Muertos!

445
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,720
要你们管事的出来
I demand to speak to the person in charge!

446
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:29,630
很抱歉  夫人  系统显示没人供奉你的照片
I'm sorry, senora, it says here no one put up your photo.

447
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:34,120
我家人肯定会在灵坛上摆我的照片的
My family always puts my photo on the ofrenda.

448
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,290
这个邪恶的盒子谎话连篇
That devil box tells you nothing but lies!

449
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:41,740
-老祖宗伊美黛  -我的亲人
- Mama Imelda? - Oh, mi familia!

450
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,510
他们不让我过桥
They wouldn't let me cross the bridge.

451
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,910
告诉这个女人和这个邪恶的盒子
Tell this woman and her devil box

452
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,570
灵坛上放了我的照片
that my photo is on the ofrenda.

453
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,980
我们还没来得及去灵坛
Well, we never made it to the ofrenda.

454
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,410
-什么  -我们遇见了
- What? - We ran into...

455
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,570
-米格尔  -伊美黛曾奶奶
- Miguel? - Mama Imelda.

456
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,050
怎么回事
What is going on?

457
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,350
你们是里维拉一家人吗
You the Rivera family?

458
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,970
你们被诅咒了
Well, you're cursed.

459
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:10,750
什么
What?

460
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,350
亡灵节是向死者供奉的节日
Dia de los Muertos is the night to give to the dead.

461
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,850
你反倒偷走了死者的东西
You stole from the dead!

462
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,490
我不是要偷走那把吉他
But I wasn't stealing the guitar.

463
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,460
吉他
Guitar?

464
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,900
那把吉他是我曾曾爷爷的东西
It was my great-great-grandfather's.

465
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,210
他肯定也愿意借给我的
He would have wanted me to have it.

466
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,320
我们家不准提那个搞音乐的
We do not speak of that musician.

467
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,370
他对我们家来说已经死了
He is dead to this family.

468
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,290
你们都已经死了
You're all dead.

469
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,840
不好意思  这是谁家的爱波瑞吉
I am sorry. Whose alebrije is that?

470
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,070
它叫但丁
That's just Dante.

471
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,180
它看起来一点也不像爱波瑞吉
He sure doesn't look like an alebrije.

472
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,810
它看上去只是一只普通的老狗
He just looks like a plain old dog.

473
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,150
或是谁丢在理发店的香肠
Or a sausage someone dropped in a barbershop.

474
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,930
不管是什么  都让我严重过敏
Whatever he is, I am terribly allergic.

475
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,710
可是但丁身上又没有毛
But Dante doesn't have any hair.

476
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:46,400
我没有鼻子  还不是一样会过敏
And I don't have a nose, and yet, here we are.

477
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:51,400
但都不能解释我为什么不能过桥
But none of this explains why I couldn't cross over.

478
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,910
你把我的照片从灵台上拿下来了
You took my photo off the ofrenda?

479
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,230
-我不是有意的  -我们怎么才能把他送回去
- It was an accident! - How do we send him back?

480
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,950
既然只是家庭矛盾
Well, since it's a family matter...

481
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,360
解除家族诅咒的方法就是
the way to undo a family curse

482
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,940
-接受家人的祝福  -这样就行了吗
- is to get your family's blessing. - That's it?

483
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,360
接受家人的祝福
Get your family's blessing

484
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:11,150
一切就能恢复正常了
and everything should go back to normal.

485
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,330
但必须赶在日出之前
But you got to do it by sunrise.

486
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,050
日出后会怎么样
What happens at sunrise?

487
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,900
天呐  你的手
Hijole! Your hand!

488
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,040
米格尔  你可不能在我们面前晕倒了
Whoa, Miguel, can't have you fainting on us.

489
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,830
别担心  你的家人就在这
But not to worry. Your family's here.

490
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,780
你现在就可以接受家人的祝福了
You can get your blessing right now.

491
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:34,700
万寿菊  万寿菊  不好意思  夫人
Cempasuchil, cempasuchil. Aha! Perdon, senora.

492
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,450
你看着这个孩子说出他的名字
Now, you look at the living and say his name.

493
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,250
米格尔
Miguel.

494
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,680
成了  然后说"我给你我的祝福"
Nailed it. Now say, "I give you my blessing."

495
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,650
我给你我的祝福
I give you my blessing.

496
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,240
我给你我的祝福  让你回到家
I give you my blessing to go home...

497
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,020
把我的照片放在灵坛上
to put my photo back on the ofrenda,

498
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,140
再也别碰音乐了
and to never play music again.

499
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,890
什么  她不能这样
What? She can't do that!

500
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,590
理论上说  她可以加上任何她希望的条件
Well, technically, she can add any condition she wants.

501
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,290
好吧
Fine.

502
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,630
然后你把花瓣交给米格尔
Then you hand the petal to Miguel.

503
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,460
没有骷髅了
No skeletons!

504
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,650
乐师广场  我来了
Mariachi Plaza, here I come.

505
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,260
这才过两秒你就违反承诺了
Two seconds and you already break your promise.

506
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,480
这不公平  这是我的人生
This isn't fair. It's my life.

507
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,820
你的人生已经过完了
You already had yours.

508
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,410
胡里奥爷爷  我需要你的祝福
Papa Julio, I ask for your blessing.

509
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,500
罗西塔姑奶  奥斯卡叔公
Tia Rosita? Oscar?

510
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,900
菲利普叔公  维多利亚姨奶
Felipe? Tia Victoria?

511
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,260
别为难我们了  孩子
Don't make this hard, mijo.

512
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,530
要么听我的回家要么就别回家了
You go home my way or no way.

513
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,380
你真的这么恨音乐吗
You really hate music that much?

514
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,620
我绝不会让你走上他那条路的
I will not let you go down the same path he did.

515
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:01,270
他那条路  他是家人
The same path he did. He's family.

516
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,680
听你伊美黛曾曾奶奶的话
Listen to your Mama Imelda.

517
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,870
她是为你好
She's just looking out for you.

518
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,130
你要听进去
Be reasonable.

519
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,420
对不起  我要去上个厕所
Con permiso, I need to visit the restroom.

520
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,620
马上就回来
Be right back.

521
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,630
我们是不是该告诉他
Should we tell him there are no restrooms

522
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,980
亡灵之地没有厕所
in the Land of the Dead?

523
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,900
我们走
Vamonos.

524
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,550
有一家人在找一个活人小男孩
We got a family looking for a living boy.

525
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,540
我想当个音乐家  就得得到音乐家的祝福
If I want to be a musician, I need a musician's blessing.

526
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,400
我们需要找到我的曾曾爷爷
We got to find my great-great-grandpa.

527
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,070
等等  小伙子
Hold it, muchacho.

528
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,200
我找到那个活人小男孩了
I found that living boy!

529
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,860
借过一下  借过一下  伙计们
Excuse me. Excuse me, folks.

530
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,220
借过一下
Excuse me.

531
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,750
不  不  但丁
No, no. Dante!

532
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:58,330
扰乱治安  涉嫌拒捕
Disturbing the peace. Fleeing an officer.

533
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,010
假扮一字眉
Falsifying a unibrow.

534
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,470
-这也犯法吗  -非常违法
- That's illegal? - Very illegal.

535
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,710
你需要洗心革面  朋友
You need to clean up your act, amigo.

536
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:08,120
朋友  很高兴你这样称呼我
Amigo? Oh, that's so nice to hear you say that

537
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,680
因为这个亡灵节我很不好过
because I have just had a really hard Dia de Muertos

538
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,060
现在真的很需要一个朋友
and I could really use an amigo right now.

539
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,840
朋友都会相互帮助
And amigos, they help their amigos.

540
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,390
你今晚放我过桥
You get me across that bridge tonight,

541
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,120
我绝对不会亏待你的
and I'll make it worth your while.

542
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,080
你喜欢德拉库斯吗  他和我是老交情了
You like De la Cruz? He and I go way back.

543
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,390
我能帮你弄到他光芒万丈演唱会的前排座位
I can get you front row seats to his Sunrise Spectacular show.

544
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,730
我还能带你进后台  你可以见到他本人
I'll get you backstage. You can meet him.

545
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,300
你只需要放我过桥
You just got to let me cross that bridge!

546
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,740
我应该把你关起来让你在牢里过节
I should lock you up for the rest of the holiday.

547
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,750
但我马上下班了  我也想见我活着的家人
But my shift's almost up and I want to visit my living family.

548
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,180
这次就只给你个警告好了
So I'm letting you off with a warning.

549
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,340
至少把我的戏服还给我吧
Can I at least get my costume back?

550
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,180
不行
No.

551
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,470
算什么朋友啊
Some amigo.

552
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,700
你真的认识德拉库斯吗
You really know De la Cruz?

553
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,580
谁想  天呐  你是个活人
Who wants to... Ahh! Ay! You're alive!

554
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,910
别出声  是的  我还活着
Shh! Yeah, I'm alive.

555
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,130
如果我想回到活人的世界
And if I want to get back to the Land of the Living...

556
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,480
就需要德拉库斯的祝福
I need De la Cruz's blessing.

557
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,000
为什么非要找他
That's weirdly specific.

558
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,830
他是我的曾曾爷爷
He's my great-great-grandfather.

559
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,450
他是你的曾曾...什么
He's your Gr... What?

560
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:12,610
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.

561
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:18,140
等下  不  等等  等等
Wait. No, wait, wait, wait.

562
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,780
对了  你要回活人的世界
Yes! You're going back to the Land of the Living!

563
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,730
要不算了  或许这不是一个好主意
You know what? Maybe this isn't such a good...

564
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,220
不  不  孩子  孩子
No, no, nino! Nino, nino,

565
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,280
我能帮你  你也能帮我
I can help you. You can help me.

566
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,470
我们可以相互帮助
We can help each other.

567
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,240
但最重要的是  你能帮我
But most importantly, you can help me.

568
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,840
-米格尔  -我叫埃克托
- Miguel! - I'm Hector.

569
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,190
好
That's nice.

570
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,490
等等我  小子
Esperame, chamaco!

571
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,080
他会害死自己的
He is going to get himself killed.

572
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:51,230
该我的灵魂向导登场了  小南瓜
I need my spirit guide... Pepita.

573
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,330
米格尔碰过的花瓣在谁那
Who has that petal Miguel touched?

574
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,580
在这  可爱的爱波瑞吉
Here. Nice alebrije.

575
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,100
别动  往上看  一点点  向上看  上  上
Hold still. Look up. A ver, a ver. Look up, up, up.

576
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:32,420
这里  大功告成
Aqui arriba, eso... Eh, la rayita.

577
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,040
好了
Okay. Hey! Ta-da!

578
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,570
这下你死得透透的了
Dead as a doorknob.

579
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,840
听着  米格尔  这个地方靠回忆而存在
So listen, Miguel, this place runs on memories.

580
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,840
大家都记得你
When you're well remembered,

581
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,130
会把你的照片摆出来
people put up your photo

582
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,370
你就能通过那座桥
and you get to cross the bridge

583
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,510
在亡灵节时探望活着的亲人
and visit the living on Dia de Muertos.

584
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,090
除非像我这样
Unless you're me.

585
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,480
你不能过桥吗
You don't get to cross over?

586
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,050
没有人供奉我的照片
No one's ever put up my picture.

587
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,550
但你能改变这个现状
But you can change that!

588
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,750
这是你吗
This is you?

589
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,070
很帅吧
Mmuy guapo, eh?

590
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,400
所以  你带我去见我的曾曾爷爷
So, you get me to my great-great-grandpa...

591
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,070
我就回家后把你的照片摆上灵坛
then I put up your photo when I get home?

592
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:07,100
真聪明  对  真是个好主意  有个问题
Such a smart boy! Yes! Great idea, yes! One hiccup.

593
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,950
德拉库斯很难接近
De la Cruz is a tough guy to get to

594
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,600
而我需要立即过桥
and I need to cross the bridge soon.

595
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,700
今晚就要
Like, tonight.

596
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,590
所以  你在这还有别的家人吗
So, you got any other family here, you know?

597
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,000
比较  好接近一点的
Someone a bit more, eh, accessible?

598
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,290
没了
Nope.

599
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,960
别唬我  小伙子
Don't yank my chain, chamaco.

600
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,510
你在这肯定还有别的家人
You got to have some other family.

601
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,870
只有德拉库斯
Only De la Cruz.

602
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,260
要是你不能帮我  我就自己去找他
If you can't help me, I'll find him myself.

603
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,840
好  好  孩子  行  行
Okay. Okay, kid. Fine! Fine!

604
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,530
我带你去见你的曾曾爷爷
I'll get you to your great-great-grandpa.

605
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,450
没那么容易的  知道吗  他是个大忙人
It's not gonna be easy, you know? He's a busy man.

606
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,050
你在做什么
What are you doing?

607
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,640
我在学骷髅走路  融入大家
I'm walking like a skeleton. Blending in.

608
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,480
别  骷髅不这样走路
No. Skeletons don't walk like that.

609
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,120
-你就这么走路  -不  我没有  打住
- It's how you walk. - No, I don't! Stop it!

610
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,550
埃内斯托·德拉库斯光芒万丈演唱会
Ernesto De la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular?

611
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,970
太酷了
Que padre!

612
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,280
每年你的曾曾爷爷都要举办这个白痴演唱会
Every year your great-great-grandpa puts on that dumb show...

613
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,020
作为亡灵节的谢幕演出
to mark the end of Dia de Muertos.

614
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,690
你能带我参加
And you can get us in!

615
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,500
你说了你有前排座位票的
Hey, you said you have front row tickets!

616
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,630
那是骗人的  我道歉
That... was a lie. I apologize for that.

617
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,920
冷静  孩子  好了  我会带你去见他的
Cool off, chamaco. Come on. I'll get you to him.

618
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,030
怎么去
How?

619
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,260
因为我正好知道他在哪彩排
Because I happen to know where he's rehearsing.

620
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,370
你最好把我的裙子带回来了  埃克托
You better have my dress, Hector.

621
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,760
你好  塞西
Hola, Ceci.

622
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:38,090
-你好  -塞西  我把裙子弄丢了
- Hola. - Ceci, I lost the dress.

623
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,510
我就知道
Ya lo sabia!

624
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,130
我在日出前要给四十名舞者打扮好
I got to dress forty dancers by sunrise.

625
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,740
多亏了你  现在少了一个扮弗里达的了
Thanks to you, I'm one Frida short of an opening number!

626
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:49,810
但丁  我们不该来这
Dante! We shouldn't be in here.

627
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,520
不  不  但丁  快过来
No, no, Dante! Ven aca!

628
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,170
你  你是怎么进来的
You! How did you get in here?

629
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:22,420
-我是跟着我的  -墨西哥无毛犬
- I just followed my... - Oh! The mighty Xolo dog!

630
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,160
给迷失的亡灵引路
Guider of wandering spirits.

631
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,330
你把谁的灵魂引到我这里来了
And whose spirit have you guided to me?

632
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:30,980
我觉得它不是灵魂向导
I don't think he's a spirit guide.

633
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,600
这个世界的爱波瑞吉有很多形态
The alebrijes of this world can take many forms.

634
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,810
它们既神秘又强大
They are as mysterious as they are powerful.

635
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,550
或许它只是条狗  来  我需要你帮我看看
Or maybe he's just a dog. Come, I need your eyes.

636
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:52,590
你当观众  关灯
You are the audience. Darkness.

637
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:56,980
黑暗中  出现了一个巨大的木瓜
And from the darkness, a giant papaya.

638
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,630
舞者从木瓜中爬出
Dancers emerge from the papaya,

639
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:03,600
这些舞者都是我
and the dancers are all me.

640
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,920
他们吸允着母亲的乳汁
And they go to drink from the milk of their mother,

641
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,950
一株仙人掌
who is a cactus.

642
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,360
仙人掌也是我
But who is also me.

643
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:15,040
乳汁并不是乳汁  而是泪水
And her milk is not milk but tears.

644
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,340
是不是太惹眼了
Is it too obvious?

645
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,970
我觉得恰到好处
I think it's just the right amount of obvious?

646
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:24,550
可以加点音乐  可不可以这样
It could use some music. Oh, what if you did like...

647
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,100
然后这样
Oh! And then it could go...

648
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,990
要是燃起熊熊火焰呢
And what if everything was on fire?

649
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,760
没错  火焰  熊熊火海
Yes! Fire! Everywhere!

650
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,220
太有创意了  你真有艺术家的天赋
Inspired! You have the spirit of an artist.

651
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,790
伴舞退场  音乐淡出  灯光渐灭
The dancers exit. The music fades, the lights go out.

652
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:52,430
然后埃内斯托·德拉库斯登台
And Ernesto de la Cruz rises to the stage!

653
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,450
他唱几首歌  太阳升起  观众欢呼
He does a couple of songs, the sun rises, everyone cheers...

654
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,000
请问一下  德拉库斯不在这吗
Excuse me, where's the real De la Cruz?

655
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,230
埃内斯托从不彩排
Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals!

656
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:08,000
他正忙着在那个塔顶办派对呢
He's too busy hosting that fancy party at the top of his tower.

657
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,530
小子  你怎么能在这乱跑
Chamaco, you can't run off on me like that.

658
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,440
走吧  别给人家添乱了
Come on, stop pestering the celebrities.

659
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,820
你说我的曾曾爷爷会在这
You said my great-great-grandpa would be here!

660
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:20,420
结果他在那头开什么派对
He's halfway across town throwing some big party.

661
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,910
这家伙居然连自己的彩排都不来
That bum. Who doesn't show up to his own rehearsal?

662
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,520
你们要真是好朋友
If you're such good friends,

663
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,770
他怎么没请你去
how come he didn't invite you?

664
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,270
你还是他曾曾孙子呢
He's your great-great-grandpa,

665
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:29,150
不也没请你去
how come he didn't invite you?

666
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,570
古斯塔沃  知道怎么才能去派对吗
Hey, Gustavo! You know anything about this party?

667
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,290
一票难求啊
It's the hot ticket!

668
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,720
他如果没请你的话
But if you're not on the guest list,

669
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,260
那就别做梦了 熏香肠
you're never getting in, Chorizo.

670
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,950
-快看  是熏香肠  -熏香肠
- Hey! It's Chorizo! -Choricito!

671
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,210
真好笑  真好笑
A-ha. Very funny, guys. Very funny.

672
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:42,770
熏香肠
Chorizo?

673
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,960
这家伙可有名了
Oh, this guy's famous!

674
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,160
快  问问他是怎么死的
Go on, go on. Ask him how he died.

675
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,890
我不想再提了
I don't want to talk about it.

676
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,780
他是吃香肠噎死的
He choked on some chorizo!

677
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,650
不是噎死  好吗
I didn't choke, okay?

678
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:58,240
是食物中毒  这两者区别可大了
I got food poisoning which is a big difference.

679
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,420
我讨厌这些搞音乐的人
This is why I don't like musicians.

680
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,320
一群自以为是的混蛋
Bunch of self-important jerks.

681
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,870
-我也搞音乐  -是吗
- Hey! I'm a musician! - You are?

682
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,480
你要真想见到埃内斯托的话
If you really want to get to Ernesto,

683
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,960
在德拉库斯广场
there is that music competition...

684
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,510
有一个音乐比赛
at the Plaza De la Cruz.

685
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,460
赢了就能去派对上表演
Winner gets to play at his party.

686
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,200
不行  小子  别犯傻了
No, no. Chamaco, you're loco if you think...

687
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:19,750
我必须得到我曾曾爷爷的祝福
I need to get my great-great-grandfather's blessing!

688
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,430
你能帮我弄把吉他吗
You know where I can get a guitar?

689
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,990
我认识个人
I know a guy.

690
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:40,040
找到了吗  小南瓜  找到他了吗
Have you found him, Pepita? Have you found our boy?

691
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,890
-有脚印  -我们家做的鞋
- A footprint! - It's a Rivera boot.

692
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,860
-7码的脚  -7码半
- Size seven! - And a half.

693
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,120
-内八字  -是米格尔
- Pronated. - Miguel.

694
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,570
你怎么会想当个音乐家
Why the heck would you want to be a musician?

695
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,420
我的曾曾爷爷就是音乐家
My great-great-grandpa was a musician!

696
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,590
一辈子都像耍猴一样
Who spent his life performing like a monkey

697
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,070
表演给陌生人看
for complete strangers.

698
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,040
还是算了吧  谢谢
No thank you. No! Guacala!

699
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,160
你懂什么
What do you know?

700
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,390
你说的吉他到底在哪里
So, how far is this guitar anyway?

701
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,460
快到了
We're almost there.

702
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:19,230
跟上  小子  来吧
Keep up, Chamaco. Come on.

703
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:32,700
-埃克托表哥  -你们好啊  姨父
- Cousin Hector! - Hey! These guys! Hey, Tio!

704
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,350
过得还好吗
Que onda?

705
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,830
他们都是你家人吗
These people are all your family?

706
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:40,060
算是吧  我们都没有照片和灵坛
In a way. We're all the ones with no photos or ofrendas.

707
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,220
无家可归  即将被遗忘  你懂吗
No family to go home to. Nearly forgotten, you know?

708
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:47,420
所以我们就互称表哥  姨父之类的
So, we all call each other cousin, or tio, or whatever.

709
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,100
-埃克托  -切珞姨妈
- Hector! - Tia Chelo!

710
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,870
谢谢你了
Muchas gracias!

711
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,640
给我留点  猪皮哥在吗
Hey! Save some for me! Is Chicharron around?

712
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,040
在那边的房间里
Eh, in the bungalow.

713
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:04,920
不知道他有没有心情见你
I don't know if he's in the mood for visitors.

714
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,770
谁会不想见我埃克托呢
Who doesn't like a visit from Cousin Hector?

715
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,680
晚上好  猪皮哥
Buenas noches, Chicharron!

716
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:21,220
别让我看到你那张蠢脸  埃克托
I don't want to see your stupid face, Hector.

717
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,390
好啦  现在可是亡灵节
Come on. It's Dia de Muertos.

718
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:24,780
我陪你喝两杯
I brought you a little offering.

719
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,020
-滚开  -马上  猪皮哥
- Get out of here. - I would, Cheech.

720
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,740
不过问题是  我和我的朋友米格尔
But the thing is, me and my friend, Miguel...

721
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,570
想借一下你的吉他
We really need to borrow your guitar.

722
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,040
-我的吉他  -是的
- My guitar? - Yes.

723
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,360
我心爱的宝贝吉他
My prized beloved guitar?

724
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,030
我保证马上就还你
I promise we'll bring it right back.

725
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,440
你之前说马上还我的小货车还没还我呢
Like the time you promised to bring back my van?

726
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,100
还有我的小冰箱
Or my mini-fridge?

727
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:43,800
-这个嘛  -我的手绢
- Ah, you see... - Or my good napkins?

728
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,760
我的绳套  我的大腿骨
My lasso? My femur?

729
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,910
这次不一样啦
Well, no, not like those times.

730
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,730
我的大腿骨呢  你这个
Where is my femur? You...

731
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,440
-没事吧  老兄  -我快消失了  埃克托
- You okay, amigo? - I'm fading, Hector.

732
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:57,430
我能感觉到
I can feel it.

733
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,670
连吉他都弹不动了
I couldn't even play that thing if I wanted to.

734
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,110
你弹给我听
You play me something.

735
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:09,540
不行  说好了再也不碰的  猪皮哥
No. You know I don't play anymore, Cheech.

736
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,940
我是帮这个孩子借的
The guitar is for the kid.

737
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,020
想要的话  凭本事拿
You want it, you got to earn it.

738
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:19,330
为你破次例吧  老兄
Ay, only for you, amigo.

739
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,260
想听点什么
Any requests?

740
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:27,370
我最喜欢的那首  你懂的
You know my favorite, Hector.

741
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:48,410
谁都知道胡安妮塔
Well, everyone knows Juanita

742
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:52,930
她瞳孔有两种颜色
Her eyes each a different color

743
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:59,400
龇牙裂嘴  面容憔悴
Her teeth stick out and her chin goes in

744
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,690
她的
And her...

745
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:07,250
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}原词为knockers  意为女人的乳房

746
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:07,250
手臂关节拖在地板上
Knuckles they drag on the floor

747
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,670
-你唱错词了吧  -有孩子在场呢
- Those aren't the words. - There are children present.

748
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:13,450
披头散发
Her hair is like a briar

749
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:18,570
站着总是两腿弯弯
She stands in a bow-legged stance

750
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:24,450
要不是我也长得抱歉
And if I weren't so ugly

751
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:32,740
她或许会对我中意
She'd possibly give me a chance

752
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:40,020
往事如风呀
Brings back memories.

753
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:45,710
谢了
Gracias.

754
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,080
等等  他怎么了
Wait. What happened?

755
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:20,990
彻底被遗忘了
He's been forgotten.

756
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:23,380
如果在活人世界里
When there's no one left in the living world

757
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,300
没人记得你的话
who remembers you...

758
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:26,570
就会从这里消失
you disappear from this world.

759
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:29,870
我们称之为最终的死亡
We call it the final death.

760
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,280
那他去哪里了呢
Where did he go?

761
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:33,810
没人知道
No one knows.

762
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:37,730
可我见过他  我回去后会记得他
But I've met him. I could remember him when I go back!

763
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:39,680
没用的  年轻人
No, it doesn't work like that, chamaco.

764
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:43,090
我们的过往  必须由那些
Our memories, they have to be passed down

765
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:45,160
我们生前认识的人
by those who knew us in life...

766
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,620
口口相传才管用
in the stories they tell about us.

767
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,590
记得猪皮哥的人都不在世了
But there's no one left alive to pass down Cheech's stories.

768
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,060
谁都有消失的一天
Hey, it happens to everyone eventually.

769
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,160
来吧  未来歌神  你还等着赢比赛呢
Come on, De la Cruzcito, you've got a contest to win.

770
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,330
你说你讨厌音乐家
You told me you hated musicians.

771
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,910
原来你也搞过音乐
You never said you were one.

772
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:16,980
不然我怎么认识你的曾曾爷爷
How do you think I knew your great-great-grandpa?

773
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,450
我们以前是搭档
We used to play music together.

774
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,920
是我教的他
Taught him everything he knows.

775
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,490
别吹牛了  你和埃内斯托·德拉库斯是搭档
No manches! You played with Ernesto De la Cruz...

776
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:25,300
他可是史上最伟大的音乐家
the greatest musician of all time?

777
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,140
你可真搞笑
Ah, you're funny.

778
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,250
史上最粗的眉毛还差不多
Greatest eyebrows of all time maybe.

779
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:31,570
他的音乐嘛  别提了
But his music? Eh, not so much.

780
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,330
你可别瞎说了
You don't know what you're talking about.

781
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:38,320
欢迎来到德拉库斯广场
Welcome to the Plaza De la Cruz!

782
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:40,600
露一手吧  小子
Showtime, Chamaco!

783
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,120
卖短袖啦  卖娃娃啦
Llevelo! T-shirts! Bobbleheads!

784
00:47:56,220 --> 00:48:00,160
欢迎各位
Bienvenidos a todos!

785
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:05,240
准备好享用音乐盛宴了吗
Who's ready for some musica?

786
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:09,030
今晚有一场音乐比拼  朋友们
It's a battle of the bands, amigos.

787
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:11,900
赢家可以去塔顶的派对现场
The winner gets to play for the maestro himself,

788
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,960
为埃内斯托·德拉库斯
Ernesto de la Cruz...

789
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,800
演奏一曲
at his fiesta tonight!

790
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,590
这就是我们的入场券  小子
That's our ticket, muchacho.

791
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:24,840
比赛正式开始
Let the competition begin!

792
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:41,830
好了  你想好唱哪首了吗
So, what's the plan? What are you gonna play?

793
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,520
当然是《请记住我》
Definitely Remember Me.

794
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:44,860
不行  那首不行
No! Not that one. No.

795
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,670
这可是他最火的一首歌
Come on. It's his most popular song!

796
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:47,780
不行  有点太火了
Ah, it's too popular.

797
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:48,570
请记住我
Remember me

798
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:49,960
虽然我要去远方
Though I have to travel far

799
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,770
请记住我
Remember me

800
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:54,020
眼泪不要坠落
Don't let it make you cry

801
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:01,630
-那《有点疯狂》呢  -好主意  就这么定了
- What about Poco Loco? - Epa! Now that's a song!

802
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:03,310
未来歌神  你们准备
De la Cruzcito? You're on standby.

803
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:05,400
疯狂恰恰  你们下一组
Los Chachalacos, you're up next.

804
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,640
疯狂恰恰
Los Chachalacos!

805
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,880
你上台前都这么紧张吗
You always this nervous before a performance?

806
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,070
我不知道  以前从来没上过台
I don't know. I've never performed before.

807
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:26,840
什么  你不是说你是音乐家吗
What? You said you were a musician!

808
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,040
是啊  我是说  只要我赢了
I am! I mean, I will be.

809
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,260
我就是
Once I win.

810
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:33,240
你就这么打算的吗  不行  你必须赢
That's your plan? No. You have to win.

811
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,210
你能不能活过今晚全靠这次了
Your life literally depends on... you winning.

812
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:36,680
你却从没上过台
And you've never done this before!

813
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:37,230
我来替你
I'll go up there.

814
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,770
-不行  我必须得上去  -为什么
- No! I need to do this. - Why?

815
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:42,120
如果我一直这么怯场的话
If I can't go out and play one song,

816
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,910
怎么能自称音乐家
how can I call myself a musician?

817
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:44,880
这很重要吗
What does that matter?

818
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,700
我不只是想得到德拉库斯的祝福
Because I don't just want to get de la Cruz's blessing...

819
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:51,810
我想证明我配得上他的祝福
I need to prove that I'm worthy of it.

820
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,710
还真是感天动地
Oh, that's such a sweet sentiment

821
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,110
偏偏是现在
at such a bad time!

822
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:01,950
算了  算了  你想表演是吧
Okay! Okay. You want to perform?

823
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,740
那就好好表演
Then you got to perform!

824
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,750
首先你得放松  甩掉紧张
First, you have to loosen up. Shake off those nerves.

825
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,290
然后用尽全力仰天长啸
Now give me your best grito.

826
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:15,170
-仰天长啸  -对  喊一嗓子
- My best grito? - Come on, yell! Belt it out.

827
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,860
爽死了  轮到你了
Ah, it feels good. Okay, now you.

828
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:28,580
真的够了  小子
Oh, come on, kid.

829
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,200
未来歌神  该你上台了
De la Cruzcito, you're on now!

830
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,900
米格尔  看着我  看着我
Miguel, look at me. Hey, look at me.

831
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:45,220
你可以的
You can do this.

832
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:47,530
用你的音乐抓住他们的耳朵
Grab their attention and don't let it go.

833
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,670
好好唱  小子  你可以的
Make them listen, Chamaco. You've got this.

834
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:52,100
未来歌神
De la Cruzcito.

835
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:02,870
他在干什么  怎么不唱
What's he doing? Why isn't he playing?

836
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,990
让会唱歌的狗回来吧
Bring back the singing dogs!

837
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,940
好样的  快开始吧
Que bien! Vamonos! Whoo!

838
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:29,890
问天空什么色彩
What color is the sky

839
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:32,040
我的亲爱  我的亲爱
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor

840
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,730
你说它是红色
You tell me that it's red

841
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:35,750
我的亲爱  我的亲爱
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor

842
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,820
我把鞋放何处
Where should I put my shoes

843
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,420
我的亲爱  我的亲爱
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor

844
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,560
你说放在你的头上
You say put them on your head

845
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:44,110
我的亲爱  我的亲爱
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor

846
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:46,660
你令我有一点疯狂
You make me un poco loco

847
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,760
究竟这是怎么样
Un poqui-ti-ti-to loco

848
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,410
猜测并没有根据
The way you keep me guessing

849
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:52,540
我同意我也答应
I'm nodding and I'm yes-ing

850
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:55,210
我把这当做福气
I'll count it as a blessing

851
00:51:55,210 --> 00:52:00,160
我不过是有一点疯狂
That I'm only un poco loco

852
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:01,640
别  别  别
No! No! No!

853
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,330
骷髅舞跳得不错嘛
Not bad for a dead guy!

854
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:12,990
你唱得也不错  小子
Not so bad yourself, gordito! Eso!

855
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,050
他就在附近  找到他
He's close! Find him!

856
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,740
这疯狂由你开始
The loco that you make me

857
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,970
这的确是疯狂无比
It is just un poco crazy

858
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:27,650
你真的非常无理
The sense that you're not making

859
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:29,650
你有权利不关心
The liberties you're taking

860
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:32,210
让我摇摇头叹息
Leaves my cabeza shaking

861
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:37,900
你就是有一点疯狂
You're just un poco loco

862
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,400
干得漂亮  小米格尔
Idale, duro, Miguelito

863
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,060
我们在找一个活人小男孩
We're looking for a living kid.

864
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:47,910
十二岁左右
About twelve?

865
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:50,180
你见过一个活人小男孩吗
Have you seen a living boy?

866
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,690
有一点   点  点  点  点  点  点  点
Un poqui-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-

867
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:57,650
点点点点点点疯狂
ti-ti-ti-to loco

868
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:08,700
干得好  我为你骄傲
You did good! I'm proud of you. Eso!

869
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,700
再来一个  再来一个
Otra! Otra! Otra!

870
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,530
-你要去哪儿  -我们得赶快走
- Hey! Where are you going? - We got to get out of here!

871
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,380
什么  你疯了吗  我们就要赢了
What? Are you crazy? We're about to win this thing.

872
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:25,820
女士们  先生们
Damas y caballeros,

873
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:28,070
插播一条紧急通知
I have an emergency announcement.

874
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:31,500
请留意一个活人小男孩
Please be on the lookout for a living boy.

875
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:33,420
他名叫米格尔
Answers to the name of Miguel.

876
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:36,860
今晚早些时候他从家人身边走失
Earlier tonight he ran away from his family.

877
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:40,080
他的家人希望送他回去活人的世界
They just want to send him back to the Land of the Living.

878
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,250
慢着
Wait, wait.

879
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,280
你告诉我德拉库斯是你唯一的家人
You said De la Cruz was your only family.

880
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,930
只有他才能送你回家
The only person who could send you home.

881
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,380
我的确有别的家人  但是...
I do have other family, but...

882
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,260
你一早就能把我的照片带回去
You could have taken my photo back this whole time?

883
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:51,350
可他们讨厌音乐  我需要音乐家的祝福
But they hate music! I need a musician's blessing.

884
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:53,640
-你骗了我  -你不也骗了我
- You lied to me! - Oh, you're one to talk.

885
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,010
看看我  我就快被遗忘了  米格尔
Look at me. I'm being forgotten, Miguel.

886
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:57,820
我都不知道能不能撑过今晚
I don't even know if I'm gonna last the night.

887
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,300
我绝对不能错过
I'm not gonna miss my one chance

888
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,380
我来之不易的过桥机会
to cross that bridge because...

889
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:03,340
就因为你荒唐的音乐梦
you want to live out some stupid musical fantasy.

890
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,410
一点都不荒唐
It's not stupid!

891
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:05,620
我带你去找你的家人
I'm taking you to your family.

892
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:07,200
-放开我  -你会感谢我的
- Let go of me! - You'll thank me later.

893
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,310
你根本不想帮我  你只关心你自己
You don't want to help me. You only care about yourself!

894
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:13,700
留着你的蠢照片吧  离我远点
Keep your dumb photo. Stay away from me!

895
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:14,410
不
No!

896
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,380
孩子  你去哪儿了
Hey, chamaco! Where did you go?

897
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:23,990
孩子  对不起  快回来
Chamaco! I'm sorry! Come back!

898
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:38,200
但丁 不要叫了  不  但丁  放开我
Dante, callate! No! Dante, stop it.

899
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:39,500
他帮不了我
He can't help me.

900
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:42,890
但丁  停下
Dante! Stop!

901
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:45,510
别这样  别跟着我了
Stop it! Leave me alone!

902
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,340
你不是亡灵向导  你只是只笨狗
You're not a spirit guide. You're just a dumb dog!

903
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,670
快走吧
Now get out of here!

904
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:52,620
-是他  -是那个活人小男孩
- It's him! - It's that living boy!

905
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:53,890
-我听说过他  快看  -他还活着
- I heard about him. Look! - He's alive!

906
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:56,360
-他还活着  -这个小男孩是活人
- He's alive. - The boy is alive!

907
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:08,630
这场闹剧该停止了  米格尔
This nonsense ends now, Miguel!

908
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:11,480
我现在就把祝福给你  送你回家
I am giving you my blessing and you are going home.

909
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,120
我不想要你的祝福
I don't want your blessing!

910
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,680
米格尔  站住
Miguel, stop!

911
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,540
回来
Come back!

912
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:22,500
米格尔
Miguel!

913
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:29,150
我是在救你的命
I am trying to save your life!

914
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:31,050
-你是在要我的命  -你说什么
- You're ruining my life! - What?

915
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:33,320
音乐是我唯一的快乐
Music's the only thing that makes me happy.

916
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,140
而你却要夺走我的快乐
And you want to take it away.

917
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,040
你永远不会明白的
You'll never understand.

918
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:46,040
虽然生活对我百般折磨  哭泣的女人
Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona

919
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:50,130
我也无法停止爱你
No dejare de quererte...

920
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,210
我以为你讨厌音乐
I thought you hated music.

921
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:58,480
我爱音乐  我还记得当时的感觉
Oh, I loved it! I remember that feeling...

922
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:02,330
我丈夫弹着吉他  我唱着歌
when my husband would play, and I would sing

923
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:05,220
仿佛一切都不重要了
and nothing else mattered.

924
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,150
但当我们有了可可
But when we had Coco,

925
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:11,080
我才突然发现生命中
suddenly there was something in my life that...

926
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,560
有比音乐更重要的东西
mattered more than music.

927
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,920
我想安定下来
I wanted to put down roots.

928
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:20,410
而他想唱歌给全世界听
He wanted to play for the world.

929
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,740
我们为了想要的生活  彼此都做出了牺牲
We each made a sacrifice to get what we wanted.

930
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:27,120
现在你必须也做出选择
Now you must make a choice.

931
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,200
可我不想做选择
But I don't want to pick sides!

932
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:32,030
为什么你就不能支持我呢
Why can't you be on my side?

933
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,620
一家人不应该就这样吗
That's what family's supposed to do.

934
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:39,670
彼此支持  你永远不会懂的
Support you. But you never will.

935
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:01,980
-祝您玩得愉快  -太激动了
- Have a good time. - Oh, how exciting!

936
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:08,050
是圣徒先生  我是您的粉丝  可以合张影吗
Oh, El Santo. I'm a big fan! You mind if I...

937
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:14,350
谢谢您  先生
Gracias, Senor.

938
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,800
-有邀请函吗  -我不需要那个
- Invitation? - It's okay.

939
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,430
我是埃内斯托的曾曾孙子
I'm Ernesto's great-great-grandson.

940
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:36,630
-打扰一下  先生们  -大伙儿  这是唱《有点疯狂》的那孩子
- Disculpen, senores... - Hey, guys! It's poco loco!

941
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:39,410
-你今晚的表演太棒了  -你们也是
- You were on fire tonight! - You too!

942
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:43,070
看在是同行的份上  帮我个忙行吗
Hey, musician to musician... I need a favor.

943
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,700
音乐大赛冠军  祝贺你们  请进
Oh, the competition winners. Congratulations, chicos.

944
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,500
多谢各位
Thanks, guys!

945
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,690
好好玩儿吧  小音乐家
Hey! Enjoy the party, little musico!

946
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:16,860
谢谢
Gracias!

947
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,880
看  那是埃内斯托
Look! It's Ernesto!

948
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,010
德拉库斯
De la Cruz!

949
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,100
德拉库斯先生
Senor de la Cruz!

950
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:46,020
借过  德拉库斯先生  德拉...
Pardon me! Senor De la Cruz! Senor De la...

951
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:52,590
当你的机会到来时
When you see your moment,

952
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:54,530
你绝不能与它擦肩而过
you mustn't let it pass you by.

953
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:56,370
你必须抓住机遇
You must seize it.

954
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:14,650
就快到了  但丁
We're almost there, Dante.

955
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:21,540
德拉库斯先生  德拉...
Senor De la Cruz! Senor De la...

956
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:29,800
我们又能怎么办呢  没有用的
But what can we do? It is hopeless...

957
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,170
你得有信心  修女
You must have faith, sister.

958
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:33,660
但神父他不会听我的
But Padre, he will never listen.

959
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:36,430
他会听得进音乐
He will listen... to music.

960
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:05,140
女士们和先生们  各位午安  各位晚安
Senoras y senores, buenas tardes, buenas noches

961
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:09,270
各位午安  各位晚安  女士们和先生们
Buenas tardes, buenas noches Senoritas y senores

962
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:13,610
在今夜跟你相遇  带给我满心的欢喜
To be here with you tonight Brings me joy! Que alegria

963
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,460
我用音乐代替言语
For this music is my language

964
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:19,460
这世界是个大家庭
And the world es mi familia

965
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,840
我用音乐代替言语
For this music is my language

966
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:25,020
这世界是个大家庭
And the world es mi familia

967
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:27,040
我用音乐代替言语
For this music is my language

968
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:31,220
这世界是个大家庭
And the world es mi familia

969
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:33,580
我用音乐代替言语
For this music is my lang...

970
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:47,010
你没事吧  孩子
Are you all right, nino?

971
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:54,070
是你  那个小男孩
It's you! You are that boy!

972
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:56,190
你就是那个从活人的世界来的小男孩
The one who came from the Land of the Living.

973
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:58,250
您...知道我
You... know about me?

974
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:01,470
人人都在说你的事
You are all anyone has been talking about.

975
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:03,600
你怎么到这儿来了
Why have you come here?

976
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,550
我叫米格尔  您的曾曾孙子
I'm Miguel. Your great-great-grandson.

977
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:11,750
我...有个曾曾孙子
I... have a great-great-grandson?

978
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:13,290
我需要您的祝福
I need your blessing

979
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:15,760
才能回家去  成为一个音乐家
so I can go back home and be a musician.

980
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:16,900
就像您一样
Just like you.

981
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:21,310
家里的其他人  他们都不支持我
The rest of our family, they wouldn't listen.

982
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,630
我希望您能支持我
But I hoped you would.

983
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:31,240
孩子  你有这般的天赋  我怎么会不支持呢
My boy, with a talent like yours, how could I not listen?

984
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:36,640
我有个曾曾孙子
I have a great-great-grandson!

985
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:46,300
-快看  是弗里达  -没错 是我 弗里达·卡罗
- Look! It's Frida! - Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo.

986
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:49,110
-我的荣幸  女士  -谢谢
- It is an honor, Senora. - Gracias.

987
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:55,410
内格雷特  因方特
Hey, Negrete! Infante!

988
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,650
你们见过我的曾曾孙子没
Have you met my great-great-grandson?

989
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,610
这是我的曾曾孙子
My great-great-grandson.

990
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:02,090
他还活着  他是个小小音乐家
He's alive! And a musician to boot!

991
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:03,960
有酒窝没酒窝  有酒窝没酒窝
Dimple. No dimple. Dimple. No dimple.

992
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,210
没酒窝
No dimple!

993
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,610
敬我们的友谊
To our friendship.

994
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:10,750
我愿为你赴汤蹈火  我的朋友  干杯
I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo. Salud!

995
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,370
有毒
Poison!

996
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:15,970
你知道吗  我从不用替身演员
You know, I did all my own stunts.

997
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:20,400
虽然再见必须说  请记住我
Though I have to say goodbye Remember me...

998
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,990
这些都是我在活人世界的
All of this came from my amazing fans

999
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,720
众多歌迷送的
in the Land of the Living.

1000
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:30,120
太多了  我都不知道该拿它们怎么办
They leave me more offerings than I know what to do with!

1001
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:34,170
怎么了  一下子接受不了吗  你看起来有点迷茫
Hey, what's wrong? Is it too much? You look overwhelmed.

1002
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:37,530
-没事  一切都很好  -那你是
- No! It's all great! - But?

1003
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:38,810
只是
It's just...

1004
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:42,260
只是我从小到大一直把您视为偶像
I have been looking up to you my whole life.

1005
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:45,280
您在我心中无所不能
You're the guy who actually did it!

1006
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,850
但是您有后悔过吗
But did you ever regret it?

1007
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:52,730
为了音乐放弃了一切
Choosing music over everything else?

1008
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,570
确实很艰难
It was hard.

1009
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:58,920
告别家乡  独自上路
Saying goodbye to my hometown. Heading off on my own...

1010
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:01,600
还离开了家人
Leaving your family?

1011
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:06,530
是的  但若重来一次我还是会做同样的选择
Si. But I could not have done it differently.

1012
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:09,800
这是命中注定的
One cannot deny who one is meant to be.

1013
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:14,550
而你  我的曾曾孙子  命中注定要成为音乐家
And you, my great-great-grandson, are meant to be a musician!

1014
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:19,400
你和我  米格尔  我们都是艺术家
You and I, we are artists, Miguel.

1015
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,650
我们不能拘泥于小家
We cannot belong to one family.

1016
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:24,040
整个世界都是我们的家
The world is our family.

1017
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,420
开始放烟花了
The fireworks have begun!

1018
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:42,640
再过一会儿  我的光芒万丈演唱会就要开始了
Soon the party will move across town for my Sunrise Spectacular.

1019
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:45,920
米格尔  你一定要来
Miguel, you must come to the show!

1020
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,820
你可以做我的特约嘉宾
You will be my guest of honor!

1021
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:50,480
-你说真的吗  -当然了  孩子
- You mean it? - Of course, my boy.

1022
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,100
可我去不了
I can't.

1023
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:56,750
我得在日出前回到家里
I have to get home before sunrise.

1024
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:59,220
对  我真得赶紧送你回家了
Oh! I really do need to get you home.

1025
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:05,720
这是我的荣幸
It has been an honor.

1026
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:08,420
真不想把你送走  米格尔
I am sorry to see you go, Miguel.

1027
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,520
希望你早日魂归黄土
I hope you die very soon.

1028
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:14,530
你知道我的意思
You know what I mean.

1029
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,600
米格尔  我把祝福送给你
Miguel, I give you my bless...

1030
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,250
我们说好的  孩子
We had a deal, chamaco.

1031
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:24,500
你是谁  这是什么意思
Who are you? What is the meaning of this?

1032
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:28,390
弗里达  我还以为你来不来了
Oh, Frida! I thought you couldn't make it.

1033
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:30,310
你说会帮我把照片带回去
You said you'd take back my photo.

1034
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:31,510
你答应过我的  米格尔
You promised, Miguel.

1035
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,550
你认识这个  男人吗
You know this, uh, man?

1036
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:37,420
今晚刚认识的  他说他认识你
Uh, I just met him tonight. He told me he knew you.

1037
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:39,710
埃克托
Hector?

1038
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:42,550
求你了  米格尔  把我的照片放上灵台
Please, Miguel. Put my photo up.

1039
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:48,800
我的朋友  你被遗忘了
My friend, you're being forgotten.

1040
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,300
-这又是谁的错  -埃克托  别这样
- And whose fault is that? - Hector, please...

1041
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,690
你拿了我的歌  是我的歌让你出了名
Those were my songs you took. My songs that made you famous.

1042
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,130
-什么  -我被遗忘了
- What? - If I'm being forgotten,

1043
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:57,610
就是因为你没告诉大家歌是我写的
it's because you never told anyone that I wrote them!

1044
01:04:57,610 --> 01:05:01,180
这不可能  德拉库斯的歌是他自己写的
That's crazy! De la Cruz wrote all his own songs.

1045
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,700
你要自己告诉他真相还是我来说
You want to tell him or should I?

1046
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,670
埃克托  我从没抢你功劳的意思
Hector, I never meant to take credit.

1047
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:08,760
我们曾是好拍档  可你死了
We made a great team, but you died...

1048
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:11,030
我唱你的歌
and I only sang your songs

1049
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:13,860
是因为我希望你的生命能以这种方式延续
because I wanted to keep a part of you alive.

1050
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:15,750
真是太高尚了
Oh, how generous!

1051
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:17,870
你们以前真的是搭档
You really did play together.

1052
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:20,610
我不想再跟你计较这些了
I don't want to fight about it.

1053
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:22,490
我只希望你能做出弥补
I just want you to make it right.

1054
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,430
让米格尔把我的照片放上灵台  我就能走过花瓣桥
Miguel can put my photo up, and I can cross over the bridge.

1055
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:28,280
去看我的女儿
I can see my girl.

1056
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:31,700
埃内斯托  记得我离开那晚吗
Ernesto, remember the night I left?

1057
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,330
那是很久前的事了
That was a long time ago.

1058
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:35,130
我们一起喝酒  你告诉我
We drank together and you told me

1059
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,880
你愿意为我赴汤蹈火  你说我是你的朋友
you would move Heaven and Earth... for your amigo.

1060
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:40,750
我希望你能帮帮我
Well, I'm asking you to now.

1061
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:43,310
赴汤蹈火  就像电影里说的
Heaven and Earth? Like in the movie?

1062
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:45,850
-什么  -那是德拉库斯的电影
- What? - That's Don Hidalgo's toast.

1063
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:48,360
《回家路上》里希达戈先生的祝酒词
In the De la Cruz movie, El Camino a Casa.

1064
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,070
我说的是我身上发生的真事  米格尔
I'm talking about my real life, Miguel.

1065
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:52,110
不  电影里也有  看
No! It's in there. Look!

1066
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:54,110
没有比这更真切的语言了
Never were true words spoken.

1067
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:56,980
这值得敬一杯  敬我们的友谊
This calls for a toast. To our friendship!

1068
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:59,910
我愿为你赴汤蹈火  我的朋友
I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo.

1069
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:03,110
但在电影里  希达戈先生在酒里下了毒
But in the movie, Don Hidalgo poisons the drink.

1070
01:06:03,110 --> 01:06:06,230
-干杯  -有毒
- Salud! - Poison!

1071
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:12,110
那天晚上  埃内斯托  我死的那天晚...
That night, Ernesto. The night I left...

1072
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:15,090
我们已经一路演出了好几个月
We'd been performing on the road for months.

1073
01:06:15,390 --> 01:06:16,590
我突然很想家
I got homesick...

1074
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:18,100
于是收拾了东西
and I packed up my songs.

1075
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,360
我们就快实现梦想了
You want to give up now

1076
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:22,530
你却想现在一走了之
when we're this close to reaching our dream?

1077
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:24,350
那是你的梦想  你自己去追
This was your dream. You'll manage.

1078
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,640
没有你歌  我做不到  埃克托
I can't do this without your songs, Hector.

1079
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,080
我要回家了  安室透
I'm going home, Ernesto.

1080
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,690
你想恨我就恨吧  我已经下定决心了
Hate me if you want, but my mind is made up.

1081
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,850
我怎么会恨你
Oh, I could never hate you.

1082
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:40,340
你坚持要走  那我就敬一杯为你送行
If you must go, then I'm sending you off with a toast.

1083
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:44,670
敬我们的友谊
To our friendship.

1084
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:49,580
我愿为你赴汤蹈火  我的朋友  干杯
I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo. Salud!

1085
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:56,120
你送我去车站
You walked me to the train station.

1086
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,450
我突然觉得腹中一阵绞痛
But I felt a pain in my stomach.

1087
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:00,610
我以为是我吃了不该吃的东西
I thought it must have been something I ate.

1088
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:02,860
也许是熏香肠坏了  我的朋友
Perhaps it was that chorizo, my friend.

1089
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:05,590
原来是喝了不该喝的
Or something I drank.

1090
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,740
我就这样死了
I woke up dead.

1091
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:14,980
你给我的酒里下毒
You poisoned me.

1092
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:18,630
你把电影和现实搞混了  埃克托
You're confusing movies with reality, Hector.

1093
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:22,230
这么久以来  我都觉得是我运气不好
All this time, I thought it was just bad luck.

1094
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:27,210
从没想过是你  是你...
I never thought that you might have... That you...

1095
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:27,310
{\an8}《请记住我》

1096
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:32,360
-你怎么可以这样  -埃克托
- How could you? - Hector!

1097
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,980
来人啊  保安
Security! Security!

1098
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:39,030
你夺走了我的一切  你这个小人
You took everything away from me! You rat!

1099
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:42,990
妥善处理他  他有病
Have him taken care of. He's not well.

1100
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:47,600
我只是想要回家  不  不
I just wanted to go back home. No! No!

1101
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,490
真抱歉  我们刚才说到哪儿了
I apologize. Where were we?

1102
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:55,010
你正准备把祝福送给我
You were going to give me your blessing.

1103
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:57,590
对  没错
Yes. Uh, si.

1104
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:03,560
米格尔  我的名声
Miguel, uh, my reputation...

1105
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:07,650
对我来说非常重要
It is very important to me.

1106
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:09,560
我不想让你以为...
I would hate to have you think...

1107
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:13,740
你为了偷埃克托的歌  谋杀了他
That you murdered Hector for his songs?

1108
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:18,370
你不会这么想吧  对吗
You don't think that. Do you?

1109
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:23,480
我...当然不会了  人人都知道你是个好人
I... No. Everyone knows you're the good guy.

1110
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:32,800
埃内斯托曾曾爷爷  我的祝福呢
Papa Ernesto, my blessing?

1111
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,380
保安  看好米格尔  他回不去了
Security? Take care of Miguel. He'll be extending his stay.

1112
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:42,320
什么  可我是你的家人
What? But I'm your family!

1113
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,670
埃克托以前是我最好的朋友
And Hector was my best friend.

1114
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:48,320
成功不是白来的  米格尔
Success doesn't come for free, Miguel.

1115
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,070
你必须不择手段
You have to be willing to do whatever it takes

1116
01:08:51,070 --> 01:08:53,800
来抓住你的机遇
to seize your moment.

1117
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:55,970
你会明白的
I know you understand.

1118
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:58,690
不  不
No! No!

1119
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:03,540
放开我  不
Let go! No!

1120
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:29,120
救命  有人吗
Help! Can anyone hear me?

1121
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,170
我想回家
I want to go home.

1122
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:52,730
-埃克托  -孩子
- Hector? - Kid?

1123
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:56,020
埃克托  你说得对
Oh, Hector! You were right.

1124
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:58,340
我早该回到家人身边的
I should have gone back to my family.

1125
01:09:58,450 --> 01:10:01,020
他们让我不要像德拉库斯一样
They told me not to be like De la Cruz,

1126
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:02,720
可我就是不听
but I didn't listen.

1127
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:05,620
我还说我不在乎他们记不记得我
I told them I didn't care if they remembered me.

1128
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:08,840
我说我不在乎我能不能被放上灵台
I didn't care if I was on their stupid ofrenda.

1129
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,060
孩子  没关系  没事的
Hey, chamaco. It's okay. It's okay.

1130
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:14,790
我说我不在乎
I told them I didn't care.

1131
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:21,300
埃克托  埃克托
Hector! Hector?

1132
01:10:22,330 --> 01:10:25,380
她快把我忘了
She's forgetting me.

1133
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:28,950
-谁  -我的女儿
- Who? - My daughter.

1134
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:35,600
你想过桥就是为了去见她
She's the reason you wanted to cross the bridge.

1135
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,080
我只想再看看她
I just wanted to see her again.

1136
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:41,870
我不该离开圣塞西莉亚
I never should have left Santa Cecilia.

1137
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,870
我多想跟她说声对不起
I wish I could apologize.

1138
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:48,810
多想告诉她爸爸本来是要回家了
I wish I could tell her that her papa was trying to come home.

1139
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:51,600
告诉她爸爸非常爱她
That he loved her so much.

1140
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:55,240
我的可可
My Coco...

1141
01:10:58,330 --> 01:10:59,410
可可
Coco?

1142
01:11:14,990 --> 01:11:18,060
这是从哪儿来的
Where did you get this?

1143
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:22,910
这是我的曾奶奶可可  这是我的曾曾奶奶伊美黛
That's my Mama Coco. That's my Mama Imelda.

1144
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:26,960
这是你吗
Is that you?

1145
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:34,020
-我们是...一家人  -一家人
- We're...Family? - Family?

1146
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:49,110
我一直希望还能再见到她
I always hoped I'd see her again.

1147
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:51,230
希望她也想我
That she'd miss me.

1148
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:55,390
她会把我的照片放上灵坛  可是从来没有
Maybe put up my photo. But it never happened.

1149
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:58,010
你知道最让我难过的是什么吗
You know the worst part?

1150
01:11:58,450 --> 01:12:01,420
我以为就算我不能去活人世界见我的可可
Even if I never got to see Coco in the living world...

1151
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:04,280
总有一天我会在这里见到她
I thought at least one day I'd see her here.

1152
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,540
我会给她一个大大的拥抱
Give her the biggest hug.

1153
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:11,220
可是她是活人世界里最后一个记得我的人
But she's the last person who remembers me.

1154
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,140
一旦她离开了活人的世界...
The moment she's gone from the living world...

1155
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:17,530
你就  从这里消失了
You disappear... from this one.

1156
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,160
你再也见不到她了
You'll never get to see her.

1157
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:21,610
再也见不到了
Ever again.

1158
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:28,170
知道吗  我给她写过一首歌
You know, I wrote her a song once.

1159
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:31,970
以前我们每天晚上都会一起唱
We used to sing it every night at the same time.

1160
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:34,750
不管离家多远我都会唱
No matter how far apart we were.

1161
01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:38,650
我好想再为她唱一回
What I wouldn't give to sing it to her

1162
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:41,430
就  最后  一回
one... last... time.

1163
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:47,040
请记住我
Remember me

1164
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:49,710
虽然再见必须说
Though I have to say goodbye

1165
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:53,260
请记住我
Remember me

1166
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:56,170
眼泪不要坠落
Don't let it make you cry

1167
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:58,520
我虽然要离你远去 
For even if I'm far away

1168
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:01,690
你住在我心底
I hold you in my heart

1169
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:04,440
在每个分离的夜里
I sing a secret song to you

1170
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:08,400
为你唱一首歌
Each night we are apart

1171
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,710
请记住我
Remember me

1172
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:12,460
爸爸
Papa!

1173
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:14,570
虽然我要去远方
Though I have to travel far

1174
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:17,910
请记住我
Remember me

1175
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:21,800
当听见吉他的悲伤
Each time you hear a sad guitar

1176
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:28,710
这就是我跟你在一起唯一的凭据
Know that I'm with you the only way that I can be

1177
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:34,850
直到我再次拥抱你
Until you're in my arms again

1178
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:46,750
请记住我
Remember me

1179
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:52,050
他偷走了你的吉他  还偷了你的歌
He stole your guitar. He stole your songs.

1180
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:56,270
被世人铭记的人应该是你  不是德拉库斯
You should be the one the world remembers, not De la Cruz!

1181
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:58,530
这首歌不是写给别人听的
I didn't write Remember Me for the world.

1182
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,860
是写给我的可可的
I wrote it for Coco.

1183
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:05,250
作为你的曾曾爷爷我真的不够格
I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a great-great-grandpa.

1184
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:06,180
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding?

1185
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:08,930
我刚刚还以为我的曾曾爷爷是个杀人犯
A minute ago I thought I was related to a murderer.

1186
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,710
你可比他好太多了
You're a total upgrade.

1187
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:13,480
从小到大  我都觉得
My whole life, there's been something...

1188
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,360
我跟家里人不太一样
that made me different.

1189
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:17,730
我从不知道为何如此
And I never knew where it came from.

1190
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:21,440
现在我知道了  是因为你
But now I know. It comes from you.

1191
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:27,430
太好了我们是一家人  太好了我们是一家人
I'm proud we're family! I'm proud to be his family!

1192
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:37,180
太好了我们是一家人
I'm proud to be his family!

1193
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:53,140
但丁
Dante?

1194
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:56,740
但丁
Dante!

1195
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,400
是但丁
It's Dante!

1196
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:14,940
-伊美黛  -埃克托
- Imelda! - Hector.

1197
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:16,810
你气色不错
You look good.

1198
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:31,880
但丁  你一直知道埃克托是我的曾曾爷爷
Dante! You knew he was my Papa Hector the whole time!

1199
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,770
你是真的灵魂向导
You are a real spirit guide.

1200
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:36,610
谁是最棒的灵魂向导  是你
Who's the good spirit guide? You are!

1201
01:15:56,150 --> 01:15:57,290
但丁
Dante!

1202
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:21,910
他们回来了
There they are!

1203
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:24,220
米格尔  小米格尔
Miguel! Miguelito!

1204
01:16:24,570 --> 01:16:26,900
看  是米格尔  他没事
Look, it's Miguel! He's all right.

1205
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:30,940
太好了  谢天谢地
Que bueno. Gracias, Dios mio.

1206
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,360
亲爱的  我担心死了
Mijo, I was so worried!

1207
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,840
谢天谢地我们及时找到你了
Thank goodness we found you in time.

1208
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:54,330
至于你  我告诉你多少次了我不想见你
And you... How many times must I turn you away?

1209
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:54,850
伊美黛
Imelda.

1210
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:58,890
我不想跟你有任何关系  活着不想  死了也一样
I want nothing to do with you! Not in life, not in death!

1211
01:16:58,890 --> 01:17:02,420
我花了数十年让家人远离你犯的错
I spent decades protecting my family from your mistakes.

1212
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:03,990
他才跟你在一起五分钟
He spends five minutes with you

1213
01:17:03,990 --> 01:17:05,870
就被扔进了一个天坑里
and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole!

1214
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:07,830
我被扔进天坑不是因为埃克托
I wasn't in there because of Hector.

1215
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:09,810
反倒是他被我牵连
He was in there because of me.

1216
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:12,640
他想帮我回家
He was just trying to get me home!

1217
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:16,310
我不肯听他的  他说得对
I didn't want to listen, but he was right.

1218
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:19,140
没有什么比家人更重要
Nothing's more important than family.

1219
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:23,050
我准备好接受您的祝福了
I'm ready to accept your blessing.

1220
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:25,000
还有您的所有条件
And your conditions.

1221
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,800
但首先  我得找到德拉库斯
But first, I need to find De la Cruz.

1222
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,090
拿回埃克托的照片
To get Hector's photo.

1223
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:31,180
-什么  -这样他才能再见到可可
- What? - So he can see Coco again.

1224
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:33,010
家里的灵坛上应该有他
Hector should be on our ofrenda.

1225
01:17:33,010 --> 01:17:34,260
他也是我们的家人
He's part of our family.

1226
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:35,710
他离开了这个家
He left this family!

1227
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:37,630
他本来想回来找你和可可的
He tried to go home to you and Coco.

1228
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:39,810
可德拉库斯害死了他
But De la Cruz murdered him!

1229
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:42,440
是真的  伊美黛
It's true, Imelda.

1230
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:44,690
是真的又怎么样
And so what if it's true?

1231
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:46,940
你当初扔下我一个人抚养孩子
You leave me alone with a child to raise...

1232
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:49,070
我就该这么原谅你吗
and I'm just supposed to forgive you?

1233
01:17:49,070 --> 01:17:50,390
伊美黛  我...
Imelda, I...

1234
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:52,460
埃克托
Hector!

1235
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:59,040
我快没时间了  是可可
I'm running out of time. It's Coco.

1236
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:01,680
她快把你忘了
She's forgetting you.

1237
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,690
你不必原谅他
You don't have to forgive him.

1238
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:08,130
但我们不该忘了他
But we shouldn't forget him.

1239
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:13,030
我想忘掉你
I wanted to forget you.

1240
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:16,230
我还想让可可也把你忘掉  可是...
I wanted Coco to forget you too, but...

1241
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:19,790
这是我的错  不怪你
This is my fault. Not yours.

1242
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:23,380
对不起  伊美黛
I'm sorry, Imelda.

1243
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:31,680
米格尔  我们帮你拿回他的照片
Miguel, if we help you get his photo,

1244
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,190
你就乖乖回家
you will return home?

1245
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:34,960
再也不碰音乐
No more music?

1246
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:38,350
家人最重要
Family comes first.

1247
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:43,490
我没法原谅你
I can't forgive you.

1248
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,430
但我会帮助你
But I will help you.

1249
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:51,690
我们要怎么接近德拉库斯
So, how do we get to De la Cruz?

1250
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:55,230
我可能知道个办法
I might know a way.

1251
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:48,270
-祝你好运  孩子  -谢谢你  弗里达

- Here, let me help you with... - Don't touch me!

1253
01:19:59,570 --> 01:20:01,940
-大家都清楚计划了吗  -找到埃克托的照片
- Everyone clear on the plan? - Find Hector's photo.

1254
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:04,080
-拿给米格尔  -送米格尔回家
- Give it to Miguel. - Send Miguel home.

1255
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,390
都有花瓣吗
Got your petals?

1256
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:08,540
现在我们只要找到德拉库斯
Now, we just have to find De la Cruz.

1257
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:09,540
谁找我
Yes?

1258
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:12,760
我认识你吗
Don't I know you?

1259
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,000
这一巴掌是因为你谋杀了我最爱的人
That's for murdering the love of my life!

1260
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,380
-谁  你说谁  -她说的是我
- Who... Who the... - She's talking about me!

1261
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:19,520
我是你最爱的人吗
I'm the love of your life?

1262
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,350
我不知道  我还生气着呢
I don't know. I'm still angry at you.

1263
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,040
埃克托  你是怎么...
Hector! How did you...

1264
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,580
这一巴掌是因为你意图谋杀我的曾曾孙子
And that's for trying to murder my grandson.

1265
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:27,800
-曾曾孙子  -她说的是我
- Grandson? - She's talking about me!

1266
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:32,200
你  慢着  你是埃克托是一家人
You! Wait. You're related to Hector?

1267
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,370

The photo!

1268
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:38,780
抓住他
After him!

1269
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,610
保安  快保护我
Security! Ayudenme!

1270
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:46,280
-你说我是你最爱的人  -我不知道我说了什么
- You said love of your life. - I don't know what I said.

1271
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:47,830
我听到你说了
That's what I heard.

1272
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:03,420
请就位  先生  三十秒后登台
Places, Senor. You're on in thirty seconds.

1273
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:12,440
米格尔  我拿到了
Miguel! I have it!

1274
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:29,800

Hurry! Come on!

1275
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:33,870
女士们  先生们
Ladies and gentlemen...

埃内斯托·德拉库斯
Ernesto De la Cruz!

1278
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:50,150
把她给我抓下来
Get her off the stage.

1279
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:01,290
唱  唱
Sing! Sing!

1280
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:12,030
可怜的我
Ay, de mí Llorona

1281
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,550
天蓝色的  哭泣的女人

1287
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:50,770
我爬上那最高的松
Me subí al pino más alto, Llorona

1288
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:53,570
是为了看到你

1289
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:57,980
像那松树一样容易流泪  哭泣的女人

我快忘记唱歌的感觉了

1303
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:55,420
你还是唱得很好

米格尔  我给你我的祝福

这孩子还活着  埃内斯托

你觉得我会让他
You think I'd let him go back

米格尔  等等
Miguel! Stop!

1368
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:00,040
你去哪里了
Where have you been?

1369
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:02,340
我得去找可可曾奶奶  求求你

1370
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:05,110
你拿着那个干什么  给我
What are you doing with that... Give it to me!

1371
01:29:05,190 --> 01:29:09,160
米格尔  站住  米格尔  米格尔
Miguel, stop! Miguel! Miguel!

1372
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:15,110
可可曾奶奶  你能听到吗  我是米格尔
Mama Coco? Can you hear me? It's Miguel.

1373
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:19,570
我见到你爸爸了  记得吗  爸爸
I saw your papa. Remember? Papa?

1374
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:24,800
求求你  要是你也把他忘了  他就会消失了
Please! If you forget him, he'll be gone.

1375
01:29:24,890 --> 01:29:26,110
永远消失
Forever.

1376
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:27,800
米格尔  把门打开
Miguel, open this door!

1377
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:30,760
看  这是他的吉他  对吗
Here. This was his guitar, right?

1378
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:32,630
他以前总弹给您听
He used to play it to you?

1379
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:38,980
看  这个是他  爸爸
See? There he is! Papa!

1380
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:41,420
记得吗  爸爸
Remember? Papa?

1381
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:45,510
米格尔

1382
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:48,900
可可曾奶奶  求求你  不要把他忘了
Mama Coco, please! Don't forget him.

1383
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:57,260
你缠着你曾奶奶在干什么
What are you doing to that poor woman?

1384
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:58,060
没事的  妈  没事的
It's okay, Mamita. It's okay.

1385
01:29:58,060 --> 01:29:59,680
你怎么回事
What's gotten into you?

1386
01:30:06,410 --> 01:30:08,060
我以为你再也回不来了  米格尔
I thought I'd lost you, Miguel.

1387
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:09,490
对不起  爸爸
I'm sorry, Papa.

1388
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:13,530
我们一家人又在一起了  这才是最重要的
We're all together now. That's what matters.

1389
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:15,160
还缺一个人
Not all of us.

1390
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,000
没事了  妈妈
It's okay, Mamita.

1391
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,950
米格尔  给你可可曾奶奶道个歉
Miguel, you apologize to your Mama Coco.

1392
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:25,290
可可曾奶奶
Mama Coco?

1393
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:32,440
快点道歉
Well? Apologize!

1394
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:37,420
可可曾奶奶
Mama Coco?

1395
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:42,630
你的爸爸  想让您再听听这首歌
Your papa, he wanted you to have this.

1396
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,740
妈妈  等等

请记住我

1400
01:30:57,490 --> 01:31:00,180
眼泪不要坠落
Don't let it make you cry

1401
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:03,540
我虽然要离你远去
For even if I'm far away

1402
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:06,430
你住在我心底
I hold you in my heart

1403
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:09,880
在每个分离的夜里
I sing a secret song to you

1404
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:13,500
为你唱一首歌
Each night we are apart

1405
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:17,510

当听见吉他的悲伤
Each time you hear a sad guitar

1409
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:35,310
这就是我跟你在一起唯一的凭据
Know that I'm with you the only way that I can be

1410
01:31:36,370 --> 01:31:41,660
直到我再次拥抱你
Until you're in my arms again

1411
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:50,150
请记住我

1412
01:31:56,260 --> 01:32:00,280
埃琳娜  你怎么了  亲爱的

1413
01:32:00,610 --> 01:32:04,630
没事  妈妈  我没事
Nothing, Mama. Nothing at all.

1414

我爸爸以前总会给我唱这首歌

当我开口要说
When I opened my mouth

1441
01:34:42,150 --> 01:34:44,980

灵魂在音符里
on the strings of our souls

1446
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:03,200
我们身体摆动着跟音乐节奏
