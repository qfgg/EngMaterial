机器人竞技不违法

Not bad, Honey Lemon.

146
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,830
"柠蜜"  "速美子"  "山葵"
"Honey Lemon"? "Go go"? "Wasabi"?

147
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,050
我就把山葵洒在衣服上一次
I spill wasabi on my shirt one time, people.

148
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,510

绰号都是弗雷迪取的
Fred is the one who comes up with the nicknames.

150
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,350
弗雷迪是谁

151
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,930
就是我  在这

别害怕  只是道具服而已
Don't be alarmed. It is just a suit.

153
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,190
我真人不长这样
This is not my real face and body.

154
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,470
在下大名弗雷迪

155
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,520
白天是学校吉祥物  但到了晚上

不  不  我不是学生

我想让小蜜给我研制个分子式
I've been trying to get Honey to develop a formula,

161
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,250
能让我变成一个喷火大蜥蜴  想变就变
that can turn me into a fire-breathing lizard at will.

162
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,660
但她说这"不是科学"
But she says that's "Not science."

163
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,910
真的不是
It's really not.

164
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,630
那我猜我让山葵
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray

165
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,590
帮我研究的缩小射线也不是"科学"咯

- Hiro. - Imagine eating a sandwich,

169
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,920
但所有人都觉得你疯了
but everybody just thinks you're crazy.

170
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,050
打住吧
Just stop.

171
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,340
-镭射眼呢  -什么
- Laser eyes? - What?

172
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,220
-痛感手指呢  -别做梦了

173
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,470
那生长血清呢

174
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,610
那你在研究什么
So, what have you been working on?

175
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,930
马上给你看

布基胶带吗
Duct tape?

177
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,020
很不想泼你冷水  哥们

184
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,700
我注意到你说"好痛"
I was alerted to the need

185
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,160
表示你需要医疗护理
for medical attention when you said, "Ow."

On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

188
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,490
生理上还是心理上的疼痛
Physical or emotional?

189
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,790
现在我将扫描你

主要成分是杆菌肽
The primary ingredient is Bacitracin.

195
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,020
真不巧  我对那个过敏
That's a bummer. I'm actually allergic to that.

196
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,110
你并不对杆菌肽过敏
You are not allergic to bacitracin.

197
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,650
倒是对花生有轻度过敏

198
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,350
不错嘛

00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,030
你给这家伙编程下了不少功夫啊
You've done some serious coding on this thing, huh?

能看出来
I can see why.

你的机器人获胜肯定小菜一碟
With your bot, winning must come easy.

250
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,010
是吧
Yeah, I guess.

251
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,200
你要喜欢简单的事物
Well, if you like things easy,

252
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,520
我的专业就不适合你

00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,890
没什么好害怕的  小家伙
You have nothing to fear, little fellow.

286
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,730
-他好紧张  -不  我没有
- He's so tense. - No, I'm not.

287
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,400
放松些  宏
Relax, Hiro.

288
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,310
你的作品很棒  对吧  速美子
Your tech is amazing. Tell him, Go go.

289
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,040
别发牢骚了  拿出点气概
Stop whining. Woman up.

290
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,610
我没事
I'm fine!

291
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,560
小伙  你需要什么  除臭剂  薄荷糖
What do you need, little man? Deodorant? Breath mint?

292
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
新内裤
Fresh pair of underpants?

293
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,790
内裤吗  你真的需要些特殊帮助
Underpants? You need serious help.

294
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,000
我是有备而来
Hey, I come prepared.

295
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,110
我六个月都没洗过衣服了
I haven't done laundry in six months.

296
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,420
一条内裤能穿四天
One pair lasts me four days.

297
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,570
正面穿完反面穿
I go front, I go back,

298
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,740
脏了翻面还能穿
I go inside-out. Then I go front and back.

299
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,170
那真是又恶心又棒极了
Wow. That is both disgusting and awesome.

300
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,510
别鼓励他了
Don't encourage him.

301
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,080
这叫做"循环利用"
It's called "Recycling."

302
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,850
下一个展示者  滨田宏
Next presenter, Hiro Hamada.

303
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,800
太好了  到你了
Oh, yeah. This is it.

304
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:54,970
我想我该上场了
I guess I'm up.

305
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,260
快来拍照  大家一起说"宏"
Okay, photo, photo! Everybody say, "Hiro."

306
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,840
-宏  -太棒了

307
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,600
我们爱你  宏  祝你好运
We love you, Hiro. Good luck!

308
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,190
-别搞砸了  -祝好运  小伙
- Don't mess it up. - Break a leg, little man.

309
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,820
科学  太棒了
Science, yeah!

310
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,100
好了  伙计  该上场了
All right, bro. This is it.

311
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,700
快来  别不理我呀
Come on. Don't leave me hanging.

312
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,780
怎么了
What's going on?

313
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,330
我真的很想来这里上学
I really want to go here.

314
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,120
你能行的
You got this.

315
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,290
我是宏...
My name is Hiro...

316
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,930
对不起
Sorry.

317
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,770
我叫滨田宏
My name is Hiro Hamada,

318
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,310
我做了些我觉得非常酷的东西
and I've been working on something that I think is pretty cool.

319
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,310
希望你们会喜欢
I hope you like it.

320
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,150
这是一个微型机器人
This is a microbot.

321
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,460
深呼吸
Breathe.

322
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,660
看起来很不起眼
It doesn't look like much,

323
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,040
但当它跟其它同伴连在一起的时候
but when it links up with the rest of its pals,

324
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,510
事情就会变得有趣起来
things get a little more interesting.

325
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,910
微型机器人都由这个神经传递器来控制
The microbots are controlled with this neural transmitter.

326
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,530
我想让它们做什么
I think what I want them to do...

327
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,580
他们就会做什么
They do it.

328
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,870
这个技术能应用于无限领域
The applications for this tech are limitless.

329
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,510
建筑物
Construction.

330
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,340
过去需要团队手工合作
What used to take teams of people working by hand

331
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,760
几个月或者几年的工程
for months or years,

332
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,560
现在只需要一个人就能完成
can now be accomplished by one person.

333
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,050
而这还只是个开始
And that's just the beginning.

334
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,760
交通应用怎么样
How about transportation?

335
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,390
微型机器人可以轻松将任何东西移动到
Microbots can move anything anywhere,

336
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,200
任何地方
with ease.

337
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,580
只要你能想到  微型机器人就能做到
If you can think it, the microbots can do it.

338
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,580
唯一的局限就是你的想象力
The only limit is your imagination.

339
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,930
微型机器人
Microbots!

340
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,390
那是我的外甥
That's my nephew!

341
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,690
太棒了
Yes!

342
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,480
我的家人  我爱我的家人
My family! I love my family!

343
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,270
太棒了
Nailed it!

344
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,270
-你做到了  -不错嘛
- You did it! - Not bad!

345
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,280
真令我大开眼界  伙计
Yeah! You just blew my mind, dude!

346
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,770
他们很爱你  太了不起了
They loved you. That was amazing!

347
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,280
是的
Yes.

348
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,580
再开发一下  你的技术会是革命性的
With some development, your tech could be revolutionary.

349
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,820
阿里斯特·克瑞
Alistair Krei!

350
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,460
我能看一下吗
May I?

351
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,130
真了不起
Extraordinary.

352
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,470
我想要你的微型机器人加入克瑞科技
I want your microbots at Krei Tech.

353
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,170
不会吧
Shut up.

354
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,830
克瑞先生说的对
Mr. Krei is right.

355
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,840
你的微型机器人是一项创新技术
Your microbots are an inspired piece of tech.

356
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,630
你可以继续开发它们
You can continue to develop them,

357
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,310
或者将它们卖给
or you can sell them to a man

358
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,520
一个完全自私自利的人
who's only guided by his own self-interest.

359
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,440
罗伯特  我知道你是怎么看我的
Robert, I know how you feel about me,

360
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,680
但那不应该影响到...
but it shouldn't affect...

361
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,470
这是你的决定  宏
This is your decision, Hiro.

362
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,690
但你应该知道
But you should know

363
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,650
克瑞先生习惯于走捷径并忽视可靠的科学
Mr. Krei has cut corners and ignored sound science

364
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,860
以达到自己的目的
to get where he is.

365
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,150
那不是真的
That's just not true.

366
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,060
对克瑞科技持有你的微型机器人
I wouldn't trust Krei Tech

367
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,870
或是任何东西
with your microbots,

368
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,500
我表示不信任
or anything else.

369
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,420
宏  我会给你
Hiro, I'm offering you

370
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:52,030
任何十四岁少年都无法想象的金钱
more money than any 14-year-old could imagine.

371
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,060
很感谢你的邀请  克瑞先生
I appreciate the offer, Mr. Krei,

372
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,460
但它们不出售
but they're not for sale.

373
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,390
我以为你会做出明智的决定
I thought you were smarter than that.

374
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,960
罗伯特
Robert.

375
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,060
克瑞先生
Mr. Krei.

376
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,390
那是我弟弟的
That's my brother's.

377
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,860
是啊
That's right.

378
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,200
很期待在课堂上见到你
I look forward to seeing you in class.

379
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,870
太不可思议了
Unbelievable!

380
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,150
我就说过嘛
That's what I'm talking about.

381
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,960
好了  天才们
All right, geniuses,

382
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,370
让我们填饱饥饿的大脑吧
let's feed those hungry brains.

383
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,540
回餐馆去
Back to the cafe!

384
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,880
晚饭我请客
Dinner is on me!

385
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,880
太棒了  没什么比免费的食物更好了
Yes! Nothing is better than free food!

386
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,870
-凯斯婶婶  -除非是发霉的
- Aunt Cass? - Unless it's moldy.

387
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,370
我们稍后就到  好吗
We'll... we'll catch up, okay?

388
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,720
当然  我太为你骄傲了
Sure. I'm so proud of you.

389
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,590
你们两个都是
Both of you.

390
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,930
谢谢  凯斯婶婶
Thanks, Aunt Cass.

391
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,270
我知道你要说什么
I know what you're going to say.

392
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,190
我应该为自己感到骄傲
"I should be proud of myself,"

393
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,110
因为我终于用天赋做了些重要的事
"because I'm finally using my gift for something important."

394
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,270
没有没有  我只是想说
No, no. I was just gonna

395
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,030
你的飞行是整个展示的低潮
tell you your fly was down for the whole show.

396
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,110
哈哈  太搞笑了
Ha-ha-hilarious.

397
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,080
你说什么
What?

398
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,130
欢迎来书呆学校  书呆子
Welcome to nerd school, nerd.

399
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,450
我...
Hey, I...

400
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,430
要不是你  我也不会在这里  所以
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. So,

401
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,430
你懂的
you know,

402
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,430
非常感谢你没有放弃我
thanks for not giving up on me.

403
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,100
你还好吗
Are you okay?

404
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,780
是的  我没事
Yeah. I'm okay.

405
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,570
但是卡拉翰教授还在里面
But Professor Callaghan is still in there.

406
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,440
正  不要
Tadashi, no!

407
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,420
卡拉翰在里面
Callaghan's in there.

408
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,790
得有人去帮忙
Someone has to help.

409
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,810
正
Tadashi!

410
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,480
正
Tadashi!

411
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,040
给  喝点茶
Here. Have some tea.

412
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,240
亲爱的
Hey, sweetie.

413
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,690
凯斯婶婶
Hey, Aunt Cass.

414
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,620
松田女士在餐厅里
Mrs. Matsuda's in the cafe.

415
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,080
穿了件完全不适合80岁老人穿的衣服
She's wearing something super inappropriate for an 80-year-old.

416
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,410
说这个总能把你逗笑
That always cracks you up.

417
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,580
你该下楼来
You should come down.

418
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,960
晚会儿吧
Maybe later.

419
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,050
学校又打电话来了
The university called again.

422
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,470

00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,090
我们希望你能在这里  伙计
We wish you were here, buddy.

427
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,120
宏  如果我现在能拥有一项超能力
Hiro, if I could have only one superpower right now,

428
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,670
我希望是能从摄像头里爬出去
it would be the ability to crawl through this camera,

429
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,130
给你一个大大的拥抱
and give you a big hug.

430
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,860
好痛
Ow!

431
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,060
你好  我是白球恩
Hello. I am Baymax,

432
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,020
你的个人医疗保健伙伴
your personal healthcare companion.

433
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,020
白球恩
Hey, Baymax.

434
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,860
我不知道你还能工作
I didn't know you were still active.

435
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,030
我感受到了伤感的情绪
I heard a sound of distress.

436
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,650
有什么麻烦事吗
What seems to be the trouble?

437
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,750
我只是不小心踢到脚趾头
I just stubbed my toe a little.

438
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,120
我没事
I'm fine.

439
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,200
请用一级到十级来表示你的疼痛等级
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

440
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,210
零级  我没事  真的
A zero. I'm okay, really.

441
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,290
谢谢  你可以缩回去了
Thanks. You can shrink now.

442
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,970
我要碰一下会疼吗
Does it hurt when I touch it?

443
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,930
没事儿的  你别碰
That's okay. No touching.

444
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,590
我很好
I'm fine...

445
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,050
你摔倒了
You have fallen.

446
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,230
你以为呢
You think?

447
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,740
-以一级到...  -好痛
- On a scale of 1 to... - Ow!

448
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,100
以一级...
On a scale...

449
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,270
以一级...
On a sca...

450
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,620
以一级到十级...
On a scale of 1 to 10...

451
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,280
请用一级到十级来表示你的疼痛等级
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

452
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,080
零级
Zero.

453
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,450
-你可以哭出来  -不  不
- It is all right to cry. - No. No, no, no, no.

454
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,240
哭泣是对疼痛的自然反应
Crying is a natural response to pain.

455
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,410
我没有要哭
I'm not crying.

456
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,910
-我会扫描你查看伤情  -别扫描我
- I will scan you for injuries. - Don't scan me.

457
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,750
-扫描完毕  -不可理喻
- Scan complete. - Unbelievable.

458
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,760
你没有受伤
You have sustained no injuries.

459
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,420
但是你的荷尔蒙和神经递质水平
However, your hormone and neurotransmitter levels

460
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,420
表明你在经历一些情绪波动
indicate that you are experiencing mood swings,

461
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,800
这在青春期很常见
common in adolescence.

462
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,420
诊断结果为青春期
Diagnosis, puberty.

463
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,770
什么
What?

464
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,350
好了  是时候缩回去了
Okay. Time to shrink now.

465
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,470
你会经历体毛的增加
You should expect an increase in body hair,

466
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,110
特别是在你的脸上  胸前  腋窝还有
especially on your face, chest, armpits, and...

467
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,490
谢谢你  够了
Thank you! That's enough.

468
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,270
你还会经历一些奇怪但很强烈的欲望
You may also experience strange and powerful new urges.

469
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,280
好了  回到你的箱子里去吧
Okay! Let's get you back in your luggage.

470
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:21,510
在你没对我的服务表示满意之前
I cannot deactivate until you say

471
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,450
我无法进入休眠
you are satisfied with your care.

472
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,120
好吧  我很满意我的...
Fine. I'm satisfied with my...

473
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,470
那是我的微型机器人吗
My microbot?

474
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,960
这没道理啊
This doesn't make any sense.

475
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,430
对于要过渡到成年阶段的青少年来说
Puberty can often be a confusing time

476
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,650
青春期通常是让人感到迷惑的
for a young adolescent flowering into manhood.

477
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,640
不  这东西应该被其它微型机器人吸引
No. The thing is attracted to the other microbots,

478
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,640
但那不可能
but that's impossible.

479
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,810
它们都在大火里被毁掉了
They were destroyed in the fire.

480
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,990
这个蠢东西坏掉了
Dumb thing's broken.

481
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,160
你的小机器人想要去哪里
Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.

482
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,340
是吗
Oh, yeah?

483
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,010
你干脆找一下它想去哪儿吧
Why don't you find out where it's trying to go?

484
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,660
那会稳定你青春期的情绪波动吗
Would that stabilize your pubescent mood swings?

485
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,220
当然了
Absolutely.

486
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,180
白球恩
Baymax?

487
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,350
白球恩
Baymax?

488
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,650
白球恩
Baymax?

489
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,410
搞什么
What?

490
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,540
-宏  -嘿  凯斯婶婶
- Hiro? - Hey, Aunt Cass!

491
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,910
你起来了  而且
Wow. You're up and...

492
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,870
是啊  我想是时候了
Yeah! I figured it was time.

493
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,910
你要去学校注册吗
Are you registering for school?

494
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
是的
Yes.

495
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,950
我考虑了你说的  确实启发了我
I thought about what you said. Really inspired me.

496
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,380
亲爱的  那太好了
Oh, honey, that's so great.

497
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,880
好了
Okay,

498
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,300
今晚给你准备特别大餐
special dinner tonight.

499
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,800
我会准备些鸡翅
I'll whip up some chicken wings.

500
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,390
涂上辣酱  辣到你脸都麻
You know, with the hot sauce that makes our faces numb.

501
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,220
-听起来不错  -就这么定了
- Okay, sounds good. - Great!

502
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,890
最后抱抱
Last hug.

503
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,070
白球恩
Baymax!

504
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,240
白球恩
Baymax!

505
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
看路
Watch it!

506
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,810
白球恩
Baymax!

507
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,280
白球恩
Baymax!

508
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,110
你疯了吗  你在干什么
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

509
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,860
我在找你的小机器人想去哪儿
I have found where your tiny robot wants to go.

510
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,460
我说过它坏掉了  它没想去...
I told you, it's broken. It's not trying to go...

511
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,670
锁上了
Locked.

512
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,890
那里有个窗户
There is a window.

513
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,840
请小心些
Please exercise caution.

514
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,400
从这个高度摔下会造成肢体损伤
A fall from this height could lead to bodily harm.

515
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,380
不好了
Oh, no.

516
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,380
稍等  我放些气出来
Excuse me while I let out some air.

517
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,590
你好了吗
Are you done?

518
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,350
是的
Yes.

519
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,110
重新充气还需要一会儿
It will take me a moment to re-inflate.

520
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,680
好吧  小点儿声就行
Fine, just keep it down.

521
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,570
这不是我的微型机器人吗
My microbots?

522
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,120
有人在大量生产
Someone's making more.

523
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,340
宏
Hiro?

524
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,750
你把我的心脏病都吓出来了
You gave me a heart attack!

525
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,090
我的双手可以用作除颤器  请离手
My hands are equipped with defibrillators. Clear.

526
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,920
停下  快停下  只是一种形容而已
Stop, stop, stop! It's just an expression.

527
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,300
不好了
Oh, no.

528
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,640
快跑
Run!

529
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,810
快点
Oh, come on!

530
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,310
我走不快
I am not fast.

531
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,940
果然没骗我
Yeah, no kidding!

532
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,610
快走  快点
Go! Go! Come on.

533
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,030
把门踢开
Kick it down!

534
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,950
那砸开
Then punch it!

535
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,130
快走  快走
Go! Go!

536
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,500
快点  快走
Oh, come on! Go, go, go!

537
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,800
快下去
Move it!

538
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,800
快点
Come on!

539
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,320
不  不
No, no.

540
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,410
快点儿  去窗户那里
Come on! The window!

541
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,490
快挤过去
Suck it in!

542
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,340
白球恩
Baymax!

543
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,000
宏
Hiro?

544
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,100
快  咱们快离开这儿
Come on, let's get out of here.

545
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,020
走  快点
Go! Hurry!

546
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,100
好吧  让我先搞清楚
All right, let me get this straight.

547
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,200
一个戴着歌舞伎面具的男人追杀你们
A man in a kabuki mask attacked you,

548
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,520
他还有一支微型飞行机器人大军
with an army of miniature flying robots.

549
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,190
是微型机器人
"Microbots."

550
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,370
-微型机器人  -对
-Microbots. -Yeah.

551
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,910
他利用神经传递器
He was controlling them

552
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,280
通过心灵感应来控制它们
telepathically with a neurocranial transmitter.

553
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,210
也就是说  这位歌舞伎先生
So, Mr. Kabuki was using esp

554
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,050
是在用超能力来追杀你和气球人
to attack you and balloon man.

555
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,820
你的飞行机器人被偷时你没来备案吗
Did you file a report when your flying robots were stolen?

556
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,090
没  我以为它们已经烧毁了
No. I thought they were all destroyed.

557
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,620
我知道这听着挺扯的
Look, I know it sounds crazy,

558
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,330
不过当时白球恩也在
but Baymax was there, too.

559
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,470
-和他讲讲  -好的  警官
-Tell him. -Yes, officer.

560
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,420
他说的是真...
He's telling the truth.

561
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,760
你这是...怎么了
What the... What's wrong with you?

562
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,600
电量低
Low battery.

563
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,430
你得挺住
Try to keep it together.

564
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,610
我是白球恩  你的个人医疗保健伙伴
I'm healthcare, your personal Baymax companion.

565
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,300
孩子  不如我给你父母打个电话
Kid, how about we call your parents,

566
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,610
叫他们来一趟好了
and get them down here?

567
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,940
什么
What?

568
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,690
把你的姓名和电话写在这儿
Write your name and number down

569
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,290
这样我们就可以...

570
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,130
我得把你弄回家  放到充电座上
I've gotta get you home to your charging station.

571
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120
你还能走吗
Can you walk?

572
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,120
我将对你进行扫描  扫描完毕

573
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,680
医疗保健

574
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
好了
Okay.

575
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,390
我婶婶问起  就说整天在学校  懂吗
If my aunt asks, we were at school all day. Got it?

576
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,890
我们还跳窗户了呢
We jumped out a window.

577
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,780
别  小点声
No! Quiet!

578
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,660
我们还跳窗户了呢
We jumped out a window.

579
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,980
在凯斯婶婶面前可不能提那些事
You can't say things like that around aunt Cass.

580
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,340
宏
Hiro?

581
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,660
你回来了  亲爱的
You home, sweetie?

582
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,680
是啊
That's right.

583
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,380
我就说我听见你了嘛
I thought I heard you.

584
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,670
凯斯婶婶
Hey, aunt Cass.

585
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,010
看看我的小大学生
Look at my little college man.

586
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,230
我都等不急要听了
I can't wait to hear all about it!

587
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,510
鸡翅马上就好
And wings are almost ready.

588
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,680
哦耶
Whee!

589
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
你别出声
Will you be quiet?

590
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,680
是啊  鸡翅  哦耶
Yeah, wings! Whee!

591
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,570
好了  准备辣到你脸都麻了吗
All right, get ready to have your face melted.

592
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,690
吃完明天可就不好受了
We are gonna feel these things tomorrow.

593
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,190
懂我的意思吗
You know what I'm saying?

594
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
好了
Okay.

595
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,870
快坐下  给我讲讲
Sit down. Tell me everything.

596
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,630
问题是  我太晚去报到
The thing is that, since I registered so late,

597
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,120
所以还有好多事情要弄
I've got a lot of school stuff to catch up on.

598
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,580
什么动静
What was that?

599
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,380
摩奇
Mochi.

600
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,890
那该死的猫
That darn cat.

601
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,560
至少吃点再上去  好吗
At least take a plate for the road, okay?

602
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,890
-别学得太...-多谢关心
-Don't work too... -Thanks for understanding.

603
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:39,060
毛毛球  毛毛球
Hairy baby. Hairy baby.

604
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,360
好了  来吧
All right, come on.

605
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,360
我是医疗保健  你的个人白球恩伙伴
I'm healthcare, your personal baymax companion.

606
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,690
一只脚先迈进去
One foot in front of the other.

607
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,680
这没道理啊
This doesn't make any sense.

608
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,210
正
Tadashi.

609
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,340
什么
What?

610
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,020
正
Tadashi.

611
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,980
正走了
Tadashi's gone.

612
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,400
那他什么时候回来
When will he return?

613
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,820
他死了  白球恩
He's dead, baymax.

614
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,660
正身体很好啊
Tadashi was in excellent health.

615
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,900
合理饮食而且注重锻炼
With a proper diet and exercise,

616
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,960
应该活得很久才对
he should have lived a long life.

617
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,910
是啊  本该是的
Yeah, he should have.

618
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,380
可是一场大火...
But there was a fire and...

619
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,540
现在  他已经不在了
Now, he's gone.

620
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,050
-正在这里  -不
-Tadashi is here. -No.

621
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,680
人们总是说他没有真的离开
People keep saying he's not really gone.

622
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,140
只要我们还想着他
As long as we remember him.

623
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,640
就还是会疼
It still hurts.

624
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,640
你的身体上未发现有损伤
I see no evidence of physical injury.

625
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,570
那是另一种疼
It's a different kind of hurt.

626
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,870
你是我的患者

我愿意帮忙
I would like to help.

628
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,480
这个你治不了  伙计
You can't fix this one, buddy.

629
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,410
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

630
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,740
我在下载有关于你的缺失数据
I am downloading a database on personal loss.

631
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,450
数据库下载完毕
Database downloaded.

632
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,050

{\an8}{\pos(42,135)}联系家人与朋友

637
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,500
我正在联系他们
I am contacting them now.

638
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,170
别  别  别联系他们
No, no, no! I... Don't do that.

639
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,630
已联系你的朋友
Your friends have been contacted.

640
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,560
真是的
Unbelievable.

641
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,430

644
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,140
会好起来的  好了  好了
You will be all right. There, there.

645
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,820
谢谢  白球恩
Thanks, Baymax.

646
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,450
关于火灾的事我很遗憾
I am sorry about the fire.

647
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:50,570
没事啦  那是个意外
It's okay. It was an accident.

648
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,870
除非...
Unless...

649
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,210
除非那不是意外
Unless it wasn't.

650
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,700
在作品展上
At the showcase,

651
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,380
那个戴面具的家伙偷走我的微型机器人
that guy in the mask stole my microbots. And...

652
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,090
然后放火来掩人耳目
And then set the fire to cover his tracks.

653
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,170
他该对正的死负责
He's responsible for Tadashi.

654
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,600
我们得去抓住那家伙
We gotta catch that guy.

655
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,840
它是活的
It's alive!

656
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,440
它是活的  它是活的  它是活的
It's alive, it's alive! It's alive!

657
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,810
要想抓住他
If we're gonna catch that guy,

658
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,610
你得升升级
you need some upgrades.

659
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,770
抓住那个戴面具的男人
Will apprehending the man

660
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,360
会改善你的情绪状态吗

当然会
Absolutely.

662
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,000
先改进一下你的身手

663
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,090
现在  来处理一下这里

我有个疑虑
I have some concerns.

665
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,060
这盔甲可能会破坏掉我这无害抱抱的设计
This armor may undermine my non-threatening, huggable design.

666
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,960
要的就是这样  伙计
That's kind of the idea, buddy.

667
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:41,390
{\an8}sick有不舒服之意

668
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,890
你帅惨了
You look sick.

669
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,270
我不可能不舒服  我是个机器人
I cannot be sick. I am a robot.

670
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,010
只是一种形容而已
It's just an expression.

671
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,270
数据转移完毕
Data transfer complete.

672
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:03,810
{\an8}{\pos(129,105)}滨田正

673
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,330
我没觉得
I fail to see

674
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,920
空手道能让我成为更称职的医疗保健伙伴
how karate makes me a better healthcare companion.

675
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,590
你希望我健康  不是吗
You want to keep me healthy, don't you?

676
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,960
朝这儿打
Punch this.

677
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,840

Yes!

683
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,330
来  顶个拳
Yeah! Fist bump!

684
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,220
我的搏击数据库没有顶拳这招
"Fist bump" Is not in my fighting database.

685
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,800
不  这个和搏击没关系
No, this isn't a fighting thing.

686
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,140
当人们兴奋或者是激动的时候
It's what people do sometimes

687
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,930
就会顶拳
when they're excited or pumped up.

688
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,060
看  这不就会了嘛
Hey, now you're getting it.

689
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,780
我会将"顶拳"添加到我的关爱矩阵中
I will add "Fist bump" to my care-giving matrix.

690
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,280
好了  我们去找那家伙吧
All right. Let's go get that guy.

691
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,370
快来
Come on!

692
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,350
拿下他  白球恩
Get him, Baymax!

693
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,780
我们来晚了
We're too late.

694
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,520
你的小机器人好像想去哪里
Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.

695
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,450
来
Come on.

696
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:16,880
建议饭后一小时再游泳
Always wait one hour after eating before swimming.

697
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,400

00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,320
你的心跳急剧加快...
Your heart rate has increased dramatic...

699
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,050
好了  白球恩  你升的级该派上用场了
Okay, Baymax, time to use those upgrades.

700
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:11,440
-宏  -不  别过来
-Hiro? -No, no, no!

701
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,890
离开这儿  快走
Get out of here! Go!

702
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,640
哥们  你在这干什么呢
Dude, what are you doing out here?

703
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,270
没干什么  就是随便走走
Nothing! Just out for a walk.

704
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,100
缓解一下青春期的情绪波动
Helps my pubescent mood swings.

705
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,410
那是白球恩吗
Is that Baymax?

706
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,150
是的  你们真不用...
Yeah, but you really...

707
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,940
他为什么穿着碳纤维内裤
Why is he wearing carbon fiber underpants?

708
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,750
我还会空手道呢
I also know karate.

709
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,030
你们得走了
You guys need to go.

710
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,890
别拒我们千里之外  宏
No, don't push us away, Hiro.

711
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,080
我们愿意帮你
We're here for you.

712
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,750
白球恩联系我们也是因为这个
That's why Baymax contacted us.

713
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,250
痛失至亲的人
Those who suffer a loss,

714
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,670
需要来自亲朋好友的支持
require support from friends and loved ones.

715
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:37,870
好吧  可我...
Okay, but I...

716
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,800
谁愿意跟我们先来分享他的感受
Who would like to share their feelings first?

717
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,460
我来
I'll go. Okay.

718
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,130
我叫弗雷迪  我快有三十天...
My name is Fred, and it has been 30 days since my last...

719
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,000
我的妈啊
Holy mother of megazon!

720
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:50,930
我是不是眼花了
Am I the only one seeing this?

721
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,220
老天爷  不要
Oh, my gosh! Oh, no!

722
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,060
快跑
Go!

723
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,610
抓住他  白球恩
Baymax, get him!

724
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,080
别  别  别  你这是干嘛
No, no, no, no, no! What are you doing?

725
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,530
我这是救你命
I'm saving your life.

726
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,900
白球恩能搞定他
Baymax can handle that guy!

727
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,490
不好了
Oh, no.

728
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,420
山葵
Wasabi!

729
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,130
拜拜
Goodbye!

730
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,050
宏  快说清楚  马上
Hiro. Explanation. Now.

731
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,890
他偷了我的微型机器人  还放了火
He stole my microbots. He started the fire.

732
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,510
我不知道他是谁
I don't know who he is!

733
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,260
白球恩  掌根推击
Baymax, palm-heel strike!

734
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,430
左转
Hard left!

735
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,000
看那面具  那身黑衣服
That mask, the black suit...

736
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,340
我们正在被超级大反派追杀  同志们
We're under attack from a super villain, people!

737
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,080
看  多酷
I mean, how cool is that?

738
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,370
确实是挺危险  不过  实在太酷了
I mean, it's scary, obviously. But how cool!

739
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:07,970
怎么停了
Why are we stopped?

740
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,010
红灯
The light's red!

741
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,640
追车戏哪来的红灯
There are no red lights in a car chase!

742
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,590
他为什么要杀我们
Why is he trying to kill us?

743
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,970
你为什么要杀我们
Why are you trying to kill us?

744
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,940
这种典型的反派看得多了
It's classic villain. We've seen too much!

745
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,320
我们别冒下结论
Let's not jump to conclusions.

746
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,310
没人说他要杀我们
We don't know he's trying to kill us.

747
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:25,610
小心
Car!

748
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:26,940
他是要杀我们
He's trying to kill us!

749
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,320
你刚刚是打转向灯了吗
Did you just put your blinker on?

750
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,900
你得表明你是要转弯啊
You have to indicate your turn!

751
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,190
要遵守交通规则
It's the law!

752
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,250
够了
That's it.

753
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,990
停车
Stop the car!

754
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,320
我和白球恩可以对付他
Baymax and I can take this guy!

755
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,660
时刻系好安全带
Seatbelts save lives.

756
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,290
安全才能时刻在
Buckle up, every time.

757
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,000
你干什么  你干什么
What are you doing? What are you doing?

758
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,140
你干什么  你干什么
What are you doing? What are you doing?

759
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,850
-甩掉他了吗  -小心
-Did we lose him? -Look out!

760
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,440
白球恩  抓紧
Baymax, hold on!

761
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,040
-我们完了  -我们能行
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

762
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:55,400
-我们完了  -我们能行
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

763
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:57,240
-我们完了  -我们能行
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

764
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,250
成功了  耶
We made it! Yes!

765
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,780
我说了我们能行
I told you we'd make it!

766
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,040
你的伤口需要检查
Your injuries require my attention.

767
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,250
而且你的体温过低
And your body temperatures are low.

768
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,960
我们得赶紧离开
We should get out of here.

769
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,010
我知道个地方
I know a place.

770
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:54,040
这是哪儿
Where are we?

771
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:57,880
弗雷迪
Fred.

772
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,350
你这是去哪儿
Where are you going?

773
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:03,510
欢迎来到"米卡萨"
Welcome to mi casa.

774
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,360
{\an8}"米卡萨"实际为西语而非法语

775
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,360
是法语里"前门"的意思
That's French for "Front door."

776
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,180
其实不是
It's really not.

777
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,530
听着  二货
Listen, nitwit.

778
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:11,190
刚刚才有个戴面具的疯子要杀我们
A lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us.

779
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,810
我可没心情...
I'm not in the mood for any...

780
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,480
欢迎回家  弗雷德里克少爷
Welcome home, master Frederick.

781
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,370
好哥们  希斯克里夫
Heathcliff, my man!

782
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,820
大伙快进来  在这儿会很安全
Come on in, guys. We'll be safe in here.

783
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,120
顶一个
Gimme some.

784
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,960
弗雷迪
Freddie,

785
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,970
这是你家
this is your house?

786
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,920
我以为你住在桥洞底下呢
I thought you lived under a bridge.

787
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:35,960
确切的说  是我父母的
Well, technically, it belongs to my parents.

788
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,260
他们正在我家的小岛上度假呢
They're on a vacay on the family island.

789
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,840
其实我们什么时候也该去一趟  好好玩玩
You know, we should totally go some time. Frolic.

790
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,640
你这是逗我呢
You gotta be kidding me.

791
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:51,370
{\an8}弗雷迪  别碰我

792
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,490
要不是我刚刚被一个面具男追杀
If I wasn't just attacked by a guy in a kabuki mask,

793
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,160
这绝对是我今天见到的最不可思议的事
I think this would be the weirdest thing I've seen today.

794
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,410
简直看不下去了
My brain hates my eyes for seeing this.

795
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:02,990
你的体温仍然很低
Your body temperature is still low.

796
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,030
是啊
Yeah.

797
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,580
就像抱着一大块暖暖的棉花糖
It's like spooning a warm marshmallow.

798
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,420
真棒
It's so nice.

799
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,300
哦  又暖又舒服
Oh, yeah, that's toasty.

800
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,090
乖机器人
Good robot.

801
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,900
有人认识这个符号吗
Does this symbol mean anything to you guys?

802
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,060
-是只鸟  -不
-Yes! It's a bird! -No!

803
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:33,290
面具男拿的东西上
The guy in the mask was carrying something

804
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,520
有这个符号
with this symbol on it.

805
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:35,790
抓住那个戴面具的人
Apprehending the man in

806
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,860
会改善宏的情绪状态
the mask will improve Hiro's emotional state.

807
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,620
抓住他
Apprehend him?

808
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,110
我们都不知道他是谁
We don't even know who he is.

809
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:42,870
我有个想法
I have a theory.

810
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,920
"杀人狂博士"
"Dr. Slaughter, md"?

811
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,160
其实是身家百万的武器设计师
Actually, millionaire weapons designer,

812
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:49,620
马尔科姆·查兹提克
Malcolm chazzletick.

813
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,210
"歼灭者"
"The annihilator"?

814
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,920
真实身份  工业家雷德·阿克斯沃西
Behind the mask, industrialist Reid Axworthy.

815
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:59,130
"冯·破坏男爵"  直接说重点
"Baron Von destruct"? Just get to the point!

816
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,460
你们没明白吗
Don't you guys get it?

817
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,930
那个戴面具追杀我们的人
The man in the mask who attacked us

818
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,480
其实就是...
is none other than...

819
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,220
瞧
Voila!

820
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,480
阿里斯特·克瑞
Alistair krei.

821
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,180
-什么  -你想想
-What? -Think about it.

822
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,810
克瑞想要你的微型机器人  你不给
Krei wanted your microbots, and you said no.

823
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,430
但是像他这样的人不会就此善罢甘休
But rules don't apply to a man like krei.

824
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:17,480
不可能  他人这么高调
There's no way. The guy is too high profile.

825
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,530
那么那个人是谁
Then who was that guy in the mask?

826
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,330
我不知道
I don't know.

827
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:23,540
我们对他一无所知
We don't know anything about him.

828
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,990
那个人是AB型阴性血
His blood type is ab-negative.

829
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,720
-体内胆固醇含量...-白球恩
-Cholesterol levels are... - Baymax,

830
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,080
你扫描他了
you scanned him?

831
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,920
程序设定要求我评估每个人的健康需求
I am programed to assess everyone's healthcare needs.

832
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,500
太棒了
Yes!

833
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,040
我用这个数据就能把他揪出来了
I can use the data from your scan to find him.

834
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,830
所以你是打算花一辈子的时间
You'd have to scan everyone in San fransokyo.

835
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,010
来扫描旧京山的每个人
That might take, I don't know, forever.

836
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,530
不  不  不  我...
No, no, no, no. I...

837
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:45,880
我只是需要换个角度来思考
I just have to look for another angle.

838
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,510
有了
Got it!

839
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,530
只要升级了白球恩的传感器
I'll scan the whole city at the same time.

840
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,230
我就能一次性扫描全城的人
I just have to upgrade Baymax's sensor.

841
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,710
事实上  要想抓住那家伙
Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy,

842
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,670
你们都得来次大改造
I need to upgrade all of you.

843
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,030
你说改造谁
Upgrade who, now?

844
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,800
痛失至亲的人
Those who suffer a loss

845
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,700
需要来自亲朋好友的支持
require support from friends and loved ones.

846
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,240
这个节奏我喜欢
Okay, I like where this is heading!

847
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:10,910
我们这群书呆子可对付不了那家伙
We can't go against that guy! We're nerds!

848
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,270
宏  我们很想帮你
Hiro, we want to help,

849
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,630
可我们就只是我们
but we're just us.

850
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,960
不
No.

851
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:20,230
你们的能耐可不止这些
You can be way more.

852
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:23,840
滨田正是我们的挚友
Tadashi Hamada was our best friend.

853
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:25,960
就听你的了
We're in.

854
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,740
你们有这种感觉吗  伙计们
Can you feel it? You guys, do you feel this?

855
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,650
我们即将书写自己的故事
Our origin story begins.

856
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:33,740
我们就要成为超级英雄了
We're gonna be superheroes!

857
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,060
手抬起来
Arms up.

858
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,430
神经传递器一定藏在他面具里
The neurotransmitter must be in his mask.

859
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:40,820
面具一旦到手  他就没辙了
We get the mask, and he can't control the bots.

860
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,980
游戏结束
Game over.

861
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,050
旁人笑我太平凡
They say "We are what we are"

862
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:45,950
可不必就此认命
But we don't have to be

863
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,680
我举止乖张
I'm bad behavior

864
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:50,710
可我仍会倾尽全力
But I do it in the best way

865
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,930
永恒之火熊熊燃烧
I'll be the watcher

866
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,100
我将静观其变
Of the eternal flame

867
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,500
你们狂热的梦想
I'll be the guard dog

868
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,560
由我来保驾护航
Of all your fever dreams

869
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:07,990
我就是那沙漏底部的点点细砂
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass

870
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:14,540
因为我们终将成为不朽
Cause we could be immortals

871
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:16,300
成为不朽
Immortals

872
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,620
就在不久之后
Just not for long for long

873
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,210
放下过去种种恩怨
Live with me forever now

874
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,700
携手并进共同向前
Pull the blackout curtains down

875
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,470
就在不久之后
Just not for long for long

876
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:34,720
我们终将成为不朽
We could be immortals

877
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,520
成为不朽
Immortals

878
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:41,720
成为不朽
Immortals

879
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:46,320
有时心存信仰的唯一回报
Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith

880
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,860
源于历经重重考验后仍在我心
Is when it's tested again and again every day

881
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:55,330
我依旧将你的过去比作我的未来
I'm still comparing your past to my future

882
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:59,210
因为我们终将成为不朽
Cause we could be immortals

883
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,780
成为不朽
Immortals

884
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,250
就在不久之后
Just not for long for long

885
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,250
超级弹跳
Super jump!

886
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,550
超级弹跳
Super jump!

887
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,050
放下过去种种恩怨
Pull the blackout curtains down

888
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:13,970
-我能喷火啦  -就在不久之后
-I breathe fire. -Just not for long for long

889
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,270
我们终将成为不朽
We could be immortals

890
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:23,780
载入史诗
Immortals

891
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:28,150
书写传奇
Immortals

892
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:32,910
成为不朽
Immortals

893
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,740
成为不朽
Immortals

894
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,220
我爱死这身了
I love it!

895
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:39,440
还行吧
Not bad.

896
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,440
你们的衣服都很合身吗
Anybody else's suit riding up on them?

897
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,560
伙计们
Hey, guys!

帅呆了
He's glorious.

902
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,590
好啦  集中注意力
Hold up. Focus.

903
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,010
给他们露一手  老兄
Show 'em what you got, buddy.

904
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,430
拳头啊  让他们见识下那个拳头
The fist, show them the fist.

905
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,600
不  不是这个
No, not that.

906
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:20,520
是那个  另外那个
The thing, the other thing.

907
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,870
火箭飞拳让弗雷迪开心极了
Rocket fist make Freddie so happy!

908
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,400
新特性还不止这个

909
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,330
白球恩  展开双翼
Baymax, wings.

910
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,170
不是吧
No way!

911
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,800
推进器准备
Thrusters.

912
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,440
我没觉得飞行
I fail to see how flying

913
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,690
能让我成为更称职的医疗保健伙伴
makes me a better healthcare companion.

914
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,770
我更不明白你为什么不觉得这个赞爆了
I fail to see how you fail to see that it's awesome!

915
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,310
全速推进
Full thrust.

916
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,740
稳住了  大块头
Steady, big guy.

917
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,660
不着急  慢慢来
Look, let's just take this slow.

918
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,830
起来  起来  起来
Up, up, up, up, up!

919
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,240
向上推进  向上推进
Thrust, thrust, thrust!

920
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,040
过头了  过头了
Too much thrust! Too much thrust!

921
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,660
推进过头了
Too much thrust!

922
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,080
不  不  不  不
No, no, no, no!

923
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:25,620
别熄火  别熄火
Back on! Back on!

924
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,310
别  别  别
On! On! On!

925
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,320
起来  起来  起来
Go up! Up, up, up!

926
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:42,970
我的天
Oh, man!

927
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:46,330
今天算是飞够了
Maybe... Maybe enough flying for today.

928
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,120
你说呢
What do you say?

929
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,160
你的神经递质激素水平正稳步上升
Your neurotransmitter levels are rising steadily.

930
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,650
这说明什么
Which means what?

931
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,290
刚才的治疗见效了
The treatment is working.

932
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:58,820
不
Oh, no!

933
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,410
不  不  不  不  不
No, no, no, no, no!

934
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,760
别这样  白球恩
Whoa, Baymax!

935
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,090
太棒了
Yes!

936
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,290
这真是...
That was...

937
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,410
真是...
That was...

938
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,080
酷毙了
Sick.

939
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,290
只是一种形容而已
It is just an expression.

940
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,540
你说得对  伙计
That's... that's right, buddy.

941
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:21,380
我再也不想坐公交了
I am never taking the bus again.

942
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,430
你的情绪状态有所好转
Your emotional state has improved.

943
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:31,470
只要你对服务表示满意  我随时能休眠
I can deactivate if you say you are satisfied with your care.

944
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,400
什么
What?

945
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:35,240
我才不想你休眠
No, I don't want you to deactivate.

946
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,910
我们还没找到那家伙呢
We still have to find that guy.

947
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:40,030
好了  启动超级传感器吧
So, fire up that super-sensor.

948
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,210
扫描功能已强化
Functionality improved.

949
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:50,280
搜寻范围扩大十倍
1000% increase in range.

950
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,840
已找到匹配源
I have found a match,

951
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,970
就在那座岛上
on that island.

952
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:04,590
-风景还不错  -是啊  如果...
-Killer view. -Yeah. If I...

953
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,760
如果我不恐高的话
If I wasn't terrified of heights,

954
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:08,050
我应该会喜欢这个
I'd probably love this.

955
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,520
可是我很恐高  所以我一点都不喜欢
But I'm terrified of heights, so I don't love it.

956
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:19,240
在那儿  白球恩  带我们过去
There. Baymax, take us in.

957
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:26,820
棒极了
Awesome!

作战小分队的首次着陆
Our first landing together as a team.

959
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,240
走吧  伙计们
Guys, come on.

960
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,500
"隔离区"
"Quarantine"?

961
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:35,410
你们不会不知道"隔离"是什么意思吧
Do you people know what "Quarantine" Means?

962
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:36,480
"隔离"
"Quarantine."

963
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,940
是为了防止污染物引起疾病甚至死亡
Enforced isolation to prevent contamination

964
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,980
所采取的一种强制性隔绝手段
that could lead to disease, or, in some cases, death.

965
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,210
标志牌上可有个骷髅头
There's a skull face on this one.

966

那可是骷髅头
A skull face!

967
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:46,800
别放松警惕
Be ready.

968
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:48,840
他说不定就在附近
He could be anywhere.

969
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,060
受死吧
Fire!

970
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,360
烧死你  烧死你
Spitting fire! Spitting fire!

971
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,410
只是一只鸟
That was a bird.

972
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,950
至少我们的装备挺管用的
Well, at least we know our gear works.

973
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,100
锵锵六人行
Six intrepid friends

974

老大是弗雷迪

977
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,430
弗雷迪的守护者们

978
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:37,370
手持阁楼捡来的古老护身符

979
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:40,190
随意驾驭太阳的力量

980
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,730
护身符是绿的
The amulet is green

981
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,210
说不定是祖母绿
It's probably an emerald

982
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,660
弗雷迪  再唱信不信我劈你脸上
Fred, I will laser-hand you in the face.

983
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:50,290
伙计们  别出声
Guys, Shhhh...

984
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,200
有发现他的踪迹吗  白球恩
Any sign of him, Baymax?

985
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:56,420
这幢建筑干扰了我的传感器
This structure is interfering with my sensor.

986
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,170
棒极了  机器人罢工了
Perfect. The robot's broken.

987
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,640
伙计们  你们可能想看看这个
Guys, you might want to see this.

988
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:18,010
你觉得这是什么  天才
What do you think it is, genius?

989
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:20,860
我不确定  可是看那个

这就对了
That's right.

993
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,400
我们的使命就是挑战不可能
We were asked to do the impossible.

994
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,560
这就是我们的成果
That's what we did.

重新定义传输真正的概念
We've reinvented the very concept of transportation.

Friends, I present project Silent Sparrow.

997
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:19,930
长官  借用一下
General, may I?

998
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,720
魔法帽
Magic hat!

999
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,740
隐形传输
Teleportation.

1000
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,120
物体通过隐形空间实现实时传送
The transport of matter instantaneously through space.

1001
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:40,260
再也不只是科幻小说的情节了
Not science fiction anymore.

1002
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:45,960
不过我们斥巨资可不仅仅是为了运送帽子
Now, we didn't spend billions of tax dollars to teleport hats.

1003
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,860
女士们先生们  你们即将见证历史
Ladies and gentlemen, you're here to witness history.

1004
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,300
准备好兜风了吗  艾比盖尔
Ready to go for a ride, Abigail?

1005
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,620
既然请到了这么多人
We've invited all these people.

1006
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,360
那就让他们都开开眼界
Might as well give 'em a show.

1007
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:59,850
发射前倒计时三十秒
T-minus 30 seconds to launch.

1008
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:02,580
-29  28  -阿尔戈号
-29, 28... -This is argo.

1009
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,420
-舱体就位  -27...
-Capsule's in position. -27...

1010
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,980
先生  我们刚刚检测到
Sir, we've picked up a slight irregularity

1011
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,810
磁控场出现了小范围的异常波动
in the magnetic containment field.

1012
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:11,210
克瑞先生  出什么问题了吗
Mr. Krei, is there a problem?

1013
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:12,810
不  当然没问题
No. No problem.

1014
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,420
安全范围内的参数浮动罢了
It's well within the parameters.

1015
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:16,930
我们继续
Let's move forward.

1016
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:18,930
三  二  一
3, 2, 1.

1017
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,610
座舱气压正常
Cabin pressure is go.

1018
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:22,640
机舱发射
Pod engaged.

1019
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,780
磁场破裂  立刻停止
Field breach! Abort!

1020
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:30,160
我们和机舱失去联系了
We've lost all contact with the pod.

1021
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:33,540
不  天啊
Oh, no.

1022
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,550
-传送门在解体  -飞行员失踪了
-It's breaking up! -The pilot is gone.

1023
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,200
二号传送门已失效
Portal two is down.

1024
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,370
磁控场也失效了
The magnetic containment field's down!

1025
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,630
克瑞  马上关掉它
Krei, shut it down now!

1026
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,550
封闭全岛  禁止进入
I want this island sealed off!

1027
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:53,390
政府叫停了克瑞的项目
The government shut down Krei's experiment.

1028
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:56,340
所以他想用你的微型机器人把机器偷回来
And he's using your microbots to steal his machine back.

1029
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,480
克瑞真的是那个面具男
Krei is the guy in the mask.

1030
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,350
不好了
Oh, no.

1031
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:12,620
白球恩  带我们离开这
Baymax, get us out of here.

1032
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:19,990
去抢传递器
Go for the transmitter.

1033
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,660
就在面具后面
Behind his mask.

1034
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:26,550
白球恩
Baymax!

1035
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,660
好了  计划是什么
All right, what's the plan?

1036
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,220
该弗雷迪出场了
It's Fred time.

1037
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:32,290
超级弹跳
Super jump!

1038
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:33,970
重力摧毁
Gravity crush!

1039
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,500
急速坠落
Falling hard.

1040
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,350
说真的  计划是什么
Seriously, what is the plan?

1041
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,890
-抢面具  -我做你的后盾
-Get the mask. -Right behind you.

1042
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,100
开什么玩笑  计划到底是什么
For real, what is the plan?

1043
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:23,010
你
Hey!

1044
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,900
想跳舞吗  面具男
You want to dance, masked man?

1045
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:29,780
要不就和这个来一曲吧
'Cause you'll be dancing with these.

1046
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:32,900
乖乖交出面具  否则让你尝尝这个
Hand over the mask, or you'll get a taste of this!

1047
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,160
还有这个
And a little bit of that!

1048
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,580
我干得还不错
Hey! I did all right.

1049
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,670
你就这点能耐吗
Is that all you got?

1050
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:47,250
还有这一手啊
You got that, too?

1051
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:50,420
看我不烧死你
It's back into the fire!

1052
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:25,240
你完了  克瑞
It's over, Krei.

1053
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,380
教...  卡拉翰教授
Pro... Professor Callaghan?

1054
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,790
那场爆炸...
The explosion...

1055
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,130
你明明死了
You died.

1056
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:42,800
没死  幸亏你的微型机器人
No. I had your microbots.

1057
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:48,800
可是  正
But, Tadashi.

1058
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,070
你就眼看着他送死
You just let him die.

1059
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,480
把面具给我  宏
Give me the mask, Hiro.

1060
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,110
他冲进去是为了救你
He went in there to save you!

1061
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,650
那是他自己太冲动了
That was his mistake!

1062
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,790
白球恩  干掉他
Baymax, destroy.

1063
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,250
我的程序设定不允许我伤害人类
My programing prevents me from injuring a human being.

1064
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:08,700
不再是了
Not anymore.

1065
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,630
宏  这不是...
Hiro, this is not what...

1066
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:20,510
去吧  白球恩  干掉他
Do it, Baymax! Destroy him!

1067
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:27,010
不  住手  白球恩
No! Stop, Baymax!

1068
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:40,900
不  快放手  他要跑了
No, stop! He's getting away!

1069
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:47,740
白球恩
Baymax!

1070
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:14,100
我违反了程序设定的健康协议
My healthcare protocol has been violated.

1071
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,870
很抱歉对你们造成了伤害
I regret any distress I may have caused.

1072
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:25,360
你们怎么能这样  我都抓住他了
How could you do that? I had him!

1073
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:28,360
你刚刚做的事  我们可没事先说好
What you just did, we never signed up for.

1074
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,710
我们只说好抓住他
We said we'd catch the guy.

1075
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:31,950
仅此而已
That's it.

1076
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,080
我就不该让你们帮我
I never should have let you help me!

1077
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:36,040
白球恩  定位卡拉翰
Baymax, find Callaghan.

1078
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:40,220
强化扫描仪故障了
My enhanced scanner has been damaged.

1079
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,670
展开双翼
Wings.

1080
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,050
宏  这不是计划的一部分
Hiro, this isn't part of the plan.

1081
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,550
起飞
Fly!

1082
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,340
宏
Hiro!

1083
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:09,740
你的血压升高了
Your blood pressure is elevated.

1084
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:12,170
表明你正处于烦恼中
You appear to be distressed.

1085
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:13,870
我没事
I'm fine!

1086
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:16,870
好了  能用了吗
There. Is it working?

1087
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:22,800
-传感器工作正常  -很好
- My sensor is operational. - Good.

1088
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:24,590
那就去
Then let's get...

1089
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,290
搞什么
What?

1090
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,600
你要移除我的医疗芯片吗
Are you going to remove my healthcare chip?

1091
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,420
是的  快打开
Yes. Open!

1092
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:32,510
我的设计初衷是治愈疾病和伤痛
My purpose is to heal the sick and injured.

1093
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,680
白球恩  打开你的芯片槽
Baymax, open your access port.

1094
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:37,470
你要我终结卡拉翰教授吗
Do you want me to terminate Professor Callaghan?

1095
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:39,610
快打开它
Just open!

1096
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:43,670
终结卡拉翰教授
Will terminating Professor Callaghan

1097
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:45,520
就能平复你的情绪吗
improve your emotional state?

1098
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,910
没错  不  我不知道
Yes! No! I don't know!

1099
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:49,150
快开启芯片槽
Open your access!

1100
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:51,660
-这是正想看到的吗  -不重要
- Is this what Tadashi wanted? - It doesn't matter!

1101
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:53,080
正的设计初衷旨在帮助他人并...
Tadashi programed me to aid and...

1102
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,460
正死了
Tadashi's gone!

1103
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,380
正已经不在了
Tadashi's gone.

1104
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:05,510
正在这儿
Tadashi is here.

1105
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,050
不  他已经不在了
No. He's not here.

1106
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:12,090
正还在这儿
Tadashi is here.

1107
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,090
我是滨田正
This is Tadashi Hamada.

1108
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:19,940
这是我机器人项目的第一次测试
And this is the first test of my robotics project.

1109
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:22,440
你好  我是白球恩
Hello, I am Baymax.

1110
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:24,240
停下  停下  快停下
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1111
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:29,370
机器人项目第七次测试
The seventh test of my robotics project.

1112
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:30,790
你好  我...
Hello, I...

1113
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,120
搞什么
What? What?

1114
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:35,410
等等  停下  停止扫描  停...
Wait, wait, wait, stop! Stop scan! Stop...

1115
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:38,990
还是我  滨田正
Tadashi Hamada again,

1116
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:43,420
这是我项目的第三十三次测试
and this is the 33rd test of my robotics project.

1117
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:52,100
我不会放弃你的
I'm not giving up on you.

1118
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:54,880
你可能还不明白  但是人们会需要你的
You don't understand this yet, but people need you.

1119
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,730
咱们继续努力吧
So, let's get back to work.

1120
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,010
我是滨田正
This is Tadashi Hamada,

1121
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,650
这是第八十四次测试
and this is the 84th test.

1122
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,450
准备好了吗  大家伙
What do you say, big guy?

1123
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:10,070
你好  我是白球恩
Hello, I am Baymax,

1124
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,160
你的个人医疗保健伙伴
your personal healthcare companion.

1125
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,440
成功了
It works.

1126
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:14,830
成功了
It works!

1127
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:17,500
太棒了  竟然...成功了
This is amazing! You... you work!

1128
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,090
我就知道能行
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it.

1129
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:23,370
我就知道  会成功的  难以置信
I knew it. Oh, you work. I can't believe it! I can't...

1130
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:26,010
好吧  最关键的一步
Okay. All right, big moment, here.

1131
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,390
扫描我
Scan me.

1132
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:32,310
你的神经传递素明显增多
Your neurotransmitter levels are elevated.

1133
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:34,590
表明你现在十分开心
This indicates that you are happy.

1134
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:37,140
是的  超级开心
I am. I really am.

1135
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:41,180
天啊  我得带我弟来看看
Oh, man. Wait till my brother sees you.

1136
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:44,100
你一定能帮助很多人  伙计
You're gonna help so many people, buddy.

1137
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:45,850
很多很多人
So many.

1138
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:49,730
先这样吧  我很满意你的服务
That's all for now. I am satisfied with my care.

1139
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:01,790
谢谢你  白球恩
Thank you, Baymax.

1140
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,840
真抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1141
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:10,540
我一点也赶不上我哥哥
I guess I'm not like my brother.

1142
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:12,550
宏
Hiro.

1143
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:19,060
伙计们  我...
Guys, I, I...

1144
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:24,980
我们一起去阻止卡拉翰
We're going to catch Callaghan,

1145
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:27,360
这次一定不会搞砸
and, this time, we'll do it right.

1146
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:31,290
下次可别再把你的队友
But maybe don't leave your team

1147
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:33,240
丢在阴森森的岛上了
stranded on a spooky island next time.

1148
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:36,240
-抱歉  -没关系
- Oh, man. - Nah, it's cool.

1149
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:38,460
希斯克里夫开直升机把我们接来的
Heathcliff picked us up in the family chopper.

1150
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,410
宏  你得看看这个
Hiro, we found something you should see.

1151
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:46,750
你差点害死我们
You almost got us all killed!

1152
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,090
克瑞  都怪你
Krei! You did this!

1153
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:51,040
你早知道计划还不完善
You knew it wasn't ready!

1154
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,970
卡拉翰  他怎么也在
Callaghan? He was there?

1155
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,270
他本是个好人啊  发生了什么
He was such a good man. What happened?

1156
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,730
不知道
I don't know.

1157
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:00,690
答案一定藏在某处
But the answer's here somewhere.

1158
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:03,350
等等  暂停
Wait, wait! Stop.

1159
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,140
他在那儿
There he is.

1160
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,980
和飞行员一起
With the pilot.

1161
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:11,400
等等
Hang on.

1162
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,480
既然请来了这么多人...
We've invited all these people...

1163
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:19,840
{\an8}卡拉翰

1164
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,740
飞行员是卡拉翰的女儿
The pilot was Callaghan's daughter.

1165
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,950
所以卡拉翰才怪罪于克瑞
Callaghan blames Krei.

1166
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,570
他要为女儿复仇
This is a revenge story.

1167
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,670
还等什么
So, what are we waiting for?

1168
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:29,670
都布置好了
It's all set up.

1169
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:38,340
这美丽的新园区是我毕生梦想的至高点
This beautiful new campus is the culmination of a lifelong dream.

1170
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:41,130
感谢人生路上遇到的绊脚石
But none of this would've been possible

1171
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:43,600
不然我也不会站在这
without a few bumps in the road.

1172
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:47,670
这些障碍使我们变得更加强壮
Those setbacks made us stronger,

1173
01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:53,710
{\an8}克瑞高科技工业园

1174
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:49,530
并引领我们走向光明的未来
and set us on the path to a bright future.

1175
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,110
那是什么
What is that?

1176
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:53,600
-什么  -障碍
- What? - Setback?

1177
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,490
我女儿在你眼中只是"障碍"吗
Was my daughter a "Setback"?

1178
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:10,920
卡拉翰  你不是...
Callaghan! But you...

1179
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,010
你女儿那是...
Your daughter, that...

1180
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:14,500
那是个意外
That was an accident.

1181
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:17,540
不  你明知那个实验很危险
No! You knew it was unsafe.

1182
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,270
我女儿就是因你的自大而丧生的
My daughter is gone because of your arrogance.

1183
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,140
你要干什么
What are you doing?

1184
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,140
你将艾比盖尔送进机舱时
You took everything from me

1185
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,450
便已夺走了我的一切
when you sent Abigail into that machine.

1186
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:42,250
现在我要以牙还牙
Now I'm taking everything from you.

1187
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:47,580
不
No!

1188
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,330
不  不  别这样
No! No! You can't!

1189
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:01,060
你所有的成就将在你面前消失殆尽
You're going to watch everything you've built disappear.

1190
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,810
然后就轮到你
Then, it's your turn.

1191
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,670
卡拉翰教授
Professor Callaghan!

1192
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:10,320
放开他
Let him go!

1193
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:14,280
这是艾比盖尔希望看到的吗
Is this what Abigail would've wanted?

1194
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,190
艾比盖尔已经不在了
Abigail is gone!

1195
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:21,530
这么做于事无补  相信我  我也经历过
This won't change anything. Trust me, I know.

1196
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:25,400
这孩子说得没错  卡拉翰
Listen to the kid, Callaghan.

1197
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:26,620
求你放了我吧
Please, let me go.

1198
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:28,790
你要什么我都给你
I'll give you anything you want!

1199
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:32,420
我要我女儿回来
I want my daughter back!

1200
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,290
击落他的面具
Go for the mask!

1201
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,570
白球恩
Baymax!

1202
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:57,230
作战开始
Leaping into action!

1203
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,680
不好
Oh, no!

1204
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:34,510
这下压力有点大
Getting a little... A little tight.

1205
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:50,780
-不妙  -他太强大了
- No! - He's too strong!

1206
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,130
-我出不去了  -根本赢不了
- There's no way out! - You can't beat him!

1207
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:54,620
救命  我斗不过他
Help! I can't beat him.

1208
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,050
宏
Hiro!

1209
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:58,470
-宏  宏  -救命
- Hiro? Hiro? - Help!

1210
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:00,180
-对了  -宏
- That's it! - Hiro.

1211
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:01,590
-我知道怎么战胜他了  -宏
- I know how to beat him. - Hiro.

1212
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:03,640
听好了
Listen up!

1213
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,050
动动你们的脑子
Use those big brains of yours,

1214
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:06,600
把思路打开
and think your way around the problem.

1215
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:09,170
换个新角度
Look for a new angle.

1216
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:24,230
我的胳膊  再扯就断了
My arms! They can't go any further!

1217
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:28,750
等一下  这是个外套
Wait a second, it's a suit.

1218
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,620
你好啊  铁片
Hello, sign.

1219
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:33,120
介意让我转一下吗
Care to go for a little spin?

1220
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:34,750
二连转
Double spin!

1221
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:36,910
背转式
Behind-the-back spin!

1222
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,770
白球恩
Baymax!

1223
01:20:57,190 --> 01:20:58,780
宏
Hiro.

1224
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,130
我爱死那个机器人了
I love that robot!

1225
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,130
好了  新计划  别管面具了
Okay, new plan. Forget the mask.

1226
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:30,560
先对付微型机器人  把它们弄进传送门
Take out the bots. They'll get sucked up into the portal.

1227
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:32,230
这才叫计划
Now that is a plan!

1228
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:34,430
小蜜  弗雷迪  能作掩护吗
Honey, Fred, can you give us some cover?

1229
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:36,400
还用你说
Like you have to ask.

1230
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,640
行动吧  弗雷迪
Let's do this, Freddie!

1231
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,610
烟幕弹
Smokescreen!

1232
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,150
预备
Ready and

1233
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,250
俯冲
dive!

1234
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,210
这边的重力有点异常  伙计们
Whoa, the gravity's getting a little weird here, guys!

1235
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:08,760
正好将计就计
Wait. Let's use this!

1236
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:14,850
尝尝充满怒火的绿刃吧
These are green blades of fury!

1237
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:17,800
女人雄起
Woman up!

1238
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:25,890
双牌花式
Double sign-spin.

1239
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,280
老子的铁片热力四射
Now my signs are on fire!

1240
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:38,630
这才叫化学反应
Now that's a chemical reaction!

1241
01:22:41,710 --> 01:22:45,220
后踢  手刀  回旋踢
Back kick. Knifehand. Roundhouse.

1242
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,750
劈拳
Hammerfist.

1243
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,380
你们完了
This ends now!

1244
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:02,070
看来微型机器人不够用了
Looks like you're out of microbots.

1245
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,310
什么
What?

1246
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,410
白球恩
Baymax!

1247
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,240
不
No!

1248
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:24,210
程序设定不允许我们伤害人类
Our programing prevents us from injuring a human being.

1249
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:26,800
不过这个归我们了
But we'll take that.

1250
01:23:56,910 --> 01:23:59,540
它仍在运行  我们得关闭它
It's still on! We have to shut it down!

1251
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:02,000
办不到  遏制场正在失效
We can't! The containment field is failing.

1252
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,420
传送门会自己销毁
The portal is gonna tear itself apart!

1253
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:06,290
我们必须马上离开这儿
We need to get out of here, now!

1254
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:13,970
白球恩
Baymax!

1255
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:16,350
传感器检测到了生命迹象
My sensor is detecting signs of life.

1256
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:19,380
-什么  -从那里面传出来的
- What? - Coming from there.

1257
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,310
是女性的生命体征
The life signs are female.

1258
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,730
她正处于深度休眠中
She appears to be in hyper-sleep.

1259
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:27,070
是卡拉翰的女儿  她还活着
Callaghan's daughter. She's still alive.

1260
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,610
艾比盖尔
Abigail.

1261
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:31,440
我们去接她回来
Let's go get her.

1262
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:34,320
传送门正在解体  你们做不到的
The portal is destabilizing. You'll never make it.

1263
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:36,490
她还活着
She's alive in there.

1264
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:38,370
总得有人去救她
Someone has to help.

1265
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,280
你说呢  伙计
What do you say, buddy?

1266
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:44,160
飞行确实让我成为更称职的医疗保健伙伴
Flying makes me a better healthcare companion.

1267
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,940
小心  这里到处都是碎片
Careful! There's Krei tech debris everywhere.

1268
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,120
小心
Look out!

1269
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,430
已定位到患者
I have located the patient.

1270
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:48,680
快去
Hurry!

1271
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:07,920
来吧  伙计  带她回家
Come on, buddy, let's get her home.

1272
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:15,540
我来指路  出发
I'll guide you out of here. Let's go!

1273
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,090
右转
Veer right!

1274
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:26,020
好的  朝左飞
Okay, to the left.

1275
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:28,230
右急转弯
Hard right!

你总待在那个岛上
I've always felt a distance

1337
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:33,360
咱俩之间都有隔阂了
what with you being on the family island all the time,

1338
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:35,730
