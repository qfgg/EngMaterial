1
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,700
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}墨西哥  伊斯坦科

2
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,410
尼克  这是很悲剧  但我们不是为此而来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Nick, this was a tragedy, but it's not why we're here.

3
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,680
我们现在还负责对抗天气了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What, are we fighting the weather now?

4
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,880
本地人说龙卷风长了脸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Locals say the cyclone had a face.

5
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,280
人在高压下是可能出现幻觉的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}People see things when they're under stress.

6
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,280
那不代表这又是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay? That does not mean that this is the start

7
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,810
重大的世界末日...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}to some other big world-ending--

8
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,550
你们是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who are you?

9
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,410
你们不想掺和进来的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You don't want any part of this.

10
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:53,680
我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I...

11
00:01:53,710 --> 00:02:00,610
将永远爱你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Will always love you, ooh

12
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,180
永远爱你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Will always love you

13
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,980
你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You

14
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,640
我亲爱的你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}My darling, you...

15
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,610
苦甜参半
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Bittersweet

16
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,980
那些回忆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Memories

17
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,350
那就是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That is all

18
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:31,060
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}缅怀

19
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,050
我能
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm taking

20
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,350
带走的一切
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}With me

21
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,840
我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I

22
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,210
将永远爱你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Will always love you

23
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,480
我永远
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I will always

24
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,480
爱你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Love you

25
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,210
我永远
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I, I will always

26
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:58,740
爱你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Love you

27
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,810
英雄已逝  永不遗忘
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Gone, but not forgotten.

28
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,880
感谢基纳斯·林和维翰·拉玛莫斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thanks to Kenneth Lim and Vihaan Ramamurthy

29
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,140
剪辑了这段感人的致敬视频
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}for their help with that touching video tribute.

30
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,340
今年可以说是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This year has been nothing short of--

31
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:12,300
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}杰森·艾乃罗  贝蒂·布兰特

32
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,680
疯狂  简直太疯狂了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}...is crazy. It's, like, insane.

33
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,610
-杰森  -怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Jason. - What?

34
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,640
不许说脏话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No swearing.

35
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,910
反正明天放假了  没事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah. It's the last day of school. We're good.

36
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,240
历史性
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Historic.

37
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,510
五年多前
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Over five years ago,

38
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,340
全宇宙一半的生命
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}half of all life in the universe,

39
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,480
也包括我们城中高中的一半生命
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}including our own Midtown High...

40
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,350
都被抹去了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}...was wiped from existence.

41
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,910
但八个月前
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But then eight months ago,

42
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,550
一群勇敢的英雄把我们带了回来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}a band of brave heroes brought us back.

43
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,550
此事件被称为"闪烁"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They called it "The Blip."

44
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,410
我们这些闪灭了的人  以原年龄回归了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Those of us who Blipped away came back the same age...

45
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,230
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}苏·罗曼  五年前

46
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,830
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}苏·罗曼  今日

47
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,380
但我们没有闪灭的同学们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But our classmates that didn't Blip

48
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,930
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}布拉德·戴维斯  五年前

49
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,880
则长大了五岁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}had grown five years older.

50
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,960
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}布拉德·戴维斯  今日

51
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,450
是啊  我弟弟现在比我大了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, like my little brother is now older than me.

52
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,810
是啊  这是数学
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, it's math.

53
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,240
尽管我们闪灭时  学年已过去了一半
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And even though we had Blipped away halfway through the school year

54
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,510
而且已经考过期中考了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and had already taken midterms,

55
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,380
学校还是要求我们从头重上这个学年
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}the school made us start the year over from the beginning.

56
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,980
太不公平了  这不对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's totally unfair. It's not right.

57
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,280
城中虎们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Tigers...

58
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,440
这段旅程漫长  戏剧性
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}...it's been a long, dramatic,

59
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,580
而且还有些令人困惑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}somewhat confusing road.

60
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,780
随着今年即将结束
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}As we draw this year to a close,

61
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,080
我们也该向前看了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}it's time to move on...

62
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,040
迎来我们生命的新阶段
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}to a new phase of our lives.

63
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,200
祈祷不会再发生什么疯狂事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Pray nothing crazy happens again

64
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,310
因为现在还有复仇者联盟吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}because are the Avengers even like a thing anymore?

65
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,950
有人有什么计划吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Does anyone even have a plan?

66
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
我有个计划
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I have a plan.

67
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,240
首先  我要在飞机上挨着MJ坐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay. First, I'm gonna sit next to MJ on the flight.

68
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,510
第二  我要买个双耳机插口
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Second, I'm gonna buy a dual headphone adapter

69
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,480
跟她看一路的电影
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and watch movies with her the whole time.

70
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,610
-好  -第三
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Okay. - Three,

71
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,540
等我们到了威尼斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}when we go to Venice,

72
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,710
那里的玻璃制品非常有名  是吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Venice is super famous for making stuff out of glass right?

73
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,040
-对  -所以我要给她买条黑色大丽花项链
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- True. - So, I'm gonna buy her a black dahlia necklace

74
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,010
因为她最喜欢的花就是黑色大丽花
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}because her favorite flower is the black dahlia

75
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,580
-因为...  -那起谋杀
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- because of, well... - The murder.

76
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,710
没错  第四  等我们到了巴黎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The murder. Four, when we go to Paris,

77
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,910
我要带她登上埃菲尔铁塔顶部
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm gonna take her to the top of the Eiffel Tower,

78
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,180
把项链送她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}give her the necklace.

79
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,510
然后  第五  我要向她表白
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And then, five, I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

80
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,740
然后  第六  希望她会说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And then, six, hopefully she tells me

81
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,080
她对我也有一样的感觉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}she feels the same way.

82
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,510
别忘了第七步
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, don't forget step seven.

83
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,610
-第七步  -以上都别做
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Step Seven. - Don't do any of that.

84
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:48,780
为什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why?

85
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,910
因为我们将在欧洲做单身汉  彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Because, we're gonna be bachelors in Europe, Peter.

86
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:51,840
-内德  -听着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Ned. - Look,

87
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,940
别的我不知道  但我知道这个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I may not know much, but I do know this:

88
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,940
欧洲人爱美国人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Europeans love Americans.

89
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,710
-是吗  -而且半数欧洲人是女人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Really? - More than half are women.

90
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,280
好吧  行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay. Sure.

91
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,280
但...我真的很喜欢MJ  好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But... I really like MJ, man, okay?

92
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,310
她很棒  有种很黑暗的幽默感
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}She's awesome, she's super funny in a kind of dark way.

93
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,810
有时我还会逮到她看我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And sometimes I catch her looking at me,

94
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,110
我觉得我已错过...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and I feel like I've stood up...

95
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,140
-她来了  别说话...  -好啊  呆子们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- She's coming. Just don't say any... - What up, dorks?

96
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,310
期待科学出游吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Excited about the science trip?

97
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,910
当然  我们正聊出游的事呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, yeah. We're just talking about the trip.

98
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,150
是啊  还有彼得的计划
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, and Peter's plan.

99
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,310
你还有计划
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You have a plan?

100
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,650
我没有什么计划
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't... I don't have a plan.

101
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,010
他打算在我们周游各国期间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's... He's just gonna collect tiny spoons

102
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,580
收集各种小勺子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}when we're traveling to other countries.

103
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,940
像个老太太那样吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Like a... Like a grandmother?

104
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,780
我没打算收集小勺子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm not collecting tiny spoons.

105
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,310
他才收集小勺子呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's collecting tiny spoons.

106
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,710
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, well...

107
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,980
真是跌宕起伏
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}that was a real roller coaster.

108
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,710
对了  出游建议
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}By the way, travel tip:

109
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,940
你应该在手机上下载个VPN
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You should prabably download a VPN on your phone,

110
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,210
这样我们在国外期间  政府就无法追踪你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}just so that the government can't track you while abroad.

111
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,150
明智
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Smart...

112
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,940
我一定照做
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Will do.

113
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,010
哥们  刚刚真的很顺利
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Dude, I think that went really great.

114
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,080
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}无家可归帮助组织  食物  住所  希望

115
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,480
我闪现回我公寓时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}When I Blipped back to my apartment,

116
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,440
住在那里的一家人非常不解
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}the family that was living there was very confused.

117
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,940
那家的妻子以为我是男人的情妇
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The wife thought that I was a mistress.

118
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,910
奶奶则以为我是鬼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The grandma thought that I was a ghost.

119
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,210
真是一团乱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It was... It was really a mess.

120
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,980
谢谢大家能前来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thank you all for coming out

121
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,640
帮助那些因闪烁事件流离失所的人

太了不起了  我紧张死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That was so cool. I was so nervous.

131
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,240
我有点僵硬  我感觉我不是很在状态
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I was a little stiff. I felt like I wasn't in the pocket.

132
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:51,980
不  你很棒的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, I thought you did great.

133
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,310
我倒是觉得你有点僵了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah. I actually think you were a little stiff.

134
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,910
是啊  我也觉得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Uh, yeah, I felt that too. I felt that too.

135
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,350
-没事的  -好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. - Okay.

136
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,710
-你拿到护照了吗  -嗯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Did you get your passport? - Yeah.

137
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,310
-小牙膏呢  -拿了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Mini toothpaste? - Yeah, I did.

138
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,380
抱歉我迟到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, sorry I'm late.

139
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,050
哈皮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Happy.

140
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,610
你真美

你蓄胡子了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's a new beard.

144
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,240
我的闪烁胡子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's my... My Blip beard.

145
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,880
我在闪烁期间长的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}'Cause I grew it in the Blip.

146
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
闪烁胡
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's a Blip beard.

147

我懂了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I see. Yeah.

148
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,440
对了  我迟到是因为
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Anyway, so, the reason I'm late is because

149
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,580
在办公室里找不到这个了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}this was misplaced at the office.

150
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,210
能相信吗  这么大一张
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Can you believe it? Because, it's enormous.

151
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,410
不是指数额  是大小
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Not the amount, the size.

152
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,310
数额也不错  挺慷慨的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The amount's nice too. They're generous.

153
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,110
派珀·波茨表示很遗憾不能前来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Pepper Potts said, sorry she couldn't be here.

好的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Will do.

158
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,940
刚刚怎么回事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What just happened?

159
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,240
提醒你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Heads up,

160
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,110
尼克·弗瑞要给你打电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Nick Fury's calling you.

161
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,510
-尼克·弗瑞要给我打电话  -对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Nick Fury's gonna call me? - Yeah.

162
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,110
为什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why?

163
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,010
为什么  他可能要找你做英雄的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why? He probably has hero stuff for you to do.

164
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,080
你是个超级英雄  他会给超级英雄打电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're a superhero. He calls superheroes.

165
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,410
如果真那么重要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, if it was really that important,

166
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,410
他或许会找别人  不是我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}he'd probably call someone else, not me.

167
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,780
看来不是这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Apparently not.

168
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,510
未知号码  是他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No caller ID. That's him.

169
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,740
我并不想跟尼克·弗瑞通话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't really wanna talk to Fury.

170
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,740
-接电话  -为什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Answer the phone. - Why?

171
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,840
因为如果你不接
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Because, if you don't talk to him,

172
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,080
那他就会打给我  我不想跟他通话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I have to talk to him and I don't want to talk to him.

173
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,040
你为什么不想跟他通话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why don't you want to talk to him?

174
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,710
因为我害怕  接电话吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Cause, I'm scared. Just answer the phone.

175
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,880
-你拒接尼克·弗瑞的电话  -对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- You sent Nick Fury to voicemail? - Yeah.

176
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,010
你不能拒接尼克·弗瑞的电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You don't send Nick Fury to voicemail.

177
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,380
听到了吗  他们在喊我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Did you heart that? They're calling me.

178
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,410
-我得走了  -你得跟他通话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- I gotta go. I gotta go. - You gotta talk to him.

179
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,140
我会打给他的  我保证  我肯定打
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm gonna call him. I promise you, I'm gonna call him. I will.

180
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,980
你不能跟尼克·弗瑞玩消失
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You do not ghost Nick Fury.

181
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,880
我保证  我会打给他的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I promise you, I'll call him.

182
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,780
等我出游回来的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}After my trip.

183
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,110
喂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, hi.

184
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,050
不  他没跟你玩消失
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, no, he's not ghosting you.

185
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,580
好了  一个个问题问
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, one question at a time.

186
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,180

你是复仇者联盟的领袖了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Are you the head Avenger now?

188
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,140
不  我不是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Uh, no, I'm not.

189
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,080
如果外星人再来  你要怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}If aliens come back, what are you gonna do?

190
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,810
如果外星人再来  你要怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}If aliens come back, what are you gonna do?

191

肖恩·温福德  《皇后区论坛报》
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Sean Winford, Queens Tribune.

193
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,640
接过托尼·斯塔克的衣钵是什么感觉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What's it like to take over from Tony Stark?

194
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,210
要接替他可不容易
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Those are big shoes to fill.

195
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,480
我...

我以为你能感应到呢  你不是有彼得一激灵吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I thought that you could sense that with your Peter-tingle.

202
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,980
拜托别管那个叫彼得一激灵
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Please do not start calling it my Peter-tingle.

203
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,180
怎么回事  你躲得开子弹  躲不开香蕉吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So, what's up? You can dodge bullets but not bananas?

204
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,980
不  我就是很需要去度这个假
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, I just really need this vacation.

好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

208
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,050
知道吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You know what?

209
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,040
你该带上你的战衣  以防万一
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You should pack your suit, just in case.

210
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,410
我有个激灵
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I have a tingle about it.

215
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,310
能帮我把东西抬上去吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Can you help me get my stuff up?

216
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,840
-抱歉  那是我的  -没事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Oh, sorry, that's mine. - No worries.

217
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,150
给我个平板
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Give me a tablet.

218
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,740
你想值第一轮班还是第二轮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Do you want first shift or second?

219
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,750
我都行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I could take either.

220
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,410
我值第三轮班吧  我服了安眠药
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Give me the third shift. I took an Ambien.

221
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,780
我不能一个人照顾这些孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I can't chaperone kids alone.

222
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,040
帕克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yo, Parker.

223
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,780
这叫飞机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This is called an airplane.

224
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,140
就像你习惯坐的大巴
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's like buses you're used to,

225
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,310
但它会飞过穷人社区
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}except it flies over poor neighborhoods

226
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,780
而不是穿过其中
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}instead of driving through them.

227
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,550
女士
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Ma'am?

228
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,810
他闪灭了  所以他其实是16  不是21
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He Blipped, so technically, he's 16, not 21.

229
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,050
给我吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'll take that.

230
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,550
她撒谎  我根本不认识她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}She's lying. I don't even know this girl.

231
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,840
MJ就这么拽  是吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Classic MJ, right?

232
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,550
你知道布拉德也要来吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Did you know Brad was coming?

233
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,240
好奇怪啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It... It's so weird.

234
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,480
前一天他还是那个爱哭的小孩
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Like, one day, he's that kid who cried

235
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,680
总是流鼻血
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and got nosebleeds all the time,

236
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,280
突然  我们闪现回来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and suddenly, we Blip back,

237
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,780
他成了肌肉暖男
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and he's totally ripped and super nice

238
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,910
所有姑娘都喜欢他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and all these girls are after him.

239

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"Boh" is my new superpower.

360
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,510
就像"你好"[夏威夷语]的反义词
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's like the anti-"Aloha."

361
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,910
我注定要说这个词
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I was born to say this word.

362
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,310
包里是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So, what's in the bag?

快走  走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Get out of here. Go!

375
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,710

377
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,180
别想
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, no, you don't.

378
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,950
没事吧  快走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You okay? Get out of here. Go!

379
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,410
不好意思  先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Excuse me, sir!

380
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,010
我可以帮忙  让我帮忙吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I... I can help. Let me help.

381
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,810
我很强壮  还很黏
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm really strong, and I'm sticky.

382
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,680
我需要把它引离运河
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I need to lead it away from the canals.

383
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,080
达·芬奇博物馆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The da Vinci Museum.

384
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,010
我们就是为此来威尼斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This is why we're here in Venice.

385
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,210
就是这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, this is it.

386
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,580
闭馆了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's closed.

387
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,680
什么叫闭馆了  到什么时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What do you mean it's closed? Till when?

388
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,580
11月
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}November.

389
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,340
你没查看网站吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You didn't check the website?

390
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,840
这是个好想法
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, that's a good idea.

391
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,480
不是吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, come on.

392

趴下  孩子们  这里安全的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Stay low, kids. We'll be safe here.

393
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,140
那人是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who is that guy?

394
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,840
我不知道  但那水怪被他打得很惨
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't know, but he's kicking that water's ass.

395
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,480
好样的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah! Yeah!

396
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,210
是外星人  肯定是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's aliens. It has to be.

397
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,610
消息网说有个水手  莫里斯·本奇
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}BuzzFeed says there's a sailor, name Morris Bench,

398
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,040
因接触实验性水下发电机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}who was exposed to an experimental underwater generator

399
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,540
而获得了水超能力
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and got hydro powers.

400
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,880
是啊  你是该相信
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, you should definitely believe

401
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,510
在网上读到的一切
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}everything you read on the Internet.

402
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,280
-蜘蛛侠能打得过他  -你觉得是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Spider-Man could take him. - What do you think it is?

403
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,050
作为一个相信科学的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You know, being a man of science...

404
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,480
巫术
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}witches.

405
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,480
不不不  我们想留下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, no, no. We wanna stay. We wanna stay.

406
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,310
幸好我给你带上了战衣  是吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's a good thing that I packed your suit, huh?

407
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,810
你居然给忘了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I can't believe you forgot it.

408
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:47,950
是啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

409
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,880
跟你一起作战的那人是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So, who was that guy that you were with?

410
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,180
那是斯特兰奇先生吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Was that Mr. Strange?

411
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,880
是斯特兰奇博士  梅
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Doctor Strange, May. Doctor Strange.

412
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,790
不  我不知道那是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And, no, I don't know who that was.

413
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,880
是个新来的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It was a new guy.

414
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,280
-我想帮他  但...  -哈皮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- I was trying to help him, but... - Happy,

415
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,480
那是我的午餐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}that's my lunch.

416
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,480
别吃那个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't eat that one.

417
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,450
哈皮也在吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Happy's there?

418
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,250
对  是哈皮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, it's Happy.

419
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,980
他在这儿  来做志工
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's here. He came by to volunteer.

420
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,080
顺便来办公室看看
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And he's hanging around the office.

421
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,780
-他想跟你打个招呼  -我不想...彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- And he wants to say hi. - I don't want... Hi, Peter.

422
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,410
哈皮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, Happy.

423
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:16,980
抱歉  我忙呢  我得送个传单
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Sorry, I'm working hard here. I gotta do a... A leaflet drop.

424
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,140
-你在干什么...  -很高兴你玩得开心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What are you doing in...? - Glad you're having a good time.

425
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,080
别担心  我会照顾好你婶婶
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't worry, I'm really taking care of your aunt.

426
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:27,780
你的计划怎么样了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So how's the plan going?

427
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,640
是遭遇了些挫折
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}There's been setbacks, for sure.

428
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,310
别想太多  相信直觉就好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't over think it, just trust your instincts, you'll be fine.

429
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,340
我知道  爱你  再见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I know. Love you. Bye.

430
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,940
那人是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who is that guy?

431
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,250
他就像钢铁侠和托尔的集合体
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's Iron Man and Thor rolled into one.

432
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,710
他还行吧  他可不比蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's all right. He's no Spider-Man.

433
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,950
你为什么这么痴迷于蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What is it with you and Spider-Man?

434
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,740
怎么了  他很赞的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What? He's just awesome, okay?

435
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,040
他保护本地社区  很激励人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He protects the neighborhood and, you know, he's inspiring.

436
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,880
他激励我做个更好的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He inspires me to be a better man.

437
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,580
好啊  蠢蛋
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What's up, dickwad?

438
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,880
我以为你淹死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thought you drowned.

439
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,050
看来他名叫神秘客
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Sounds like his name's Mysterio.

440
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,540
那句话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"L'uomo del misterio"

441
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,480
是意大利语  "神秘男子"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}is Italian for "Man of mystery."

442
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,180
他们并不清楚他的身份
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They don't actually know who he is.

443
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,210
神秘客
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Mysterio.

444
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,080
名字不错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Cool name.

445
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,950
宝贝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Babe.

446
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,050
你看到了多少
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So how much of that did you actually see?

447
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,950
没看到多少  我忙着跑呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Not much. I was running.

448
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,610
是啊  我也是  我也忙着跑呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Right. Me too. I was also running...

449
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,280
跑远
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}away.

450
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,380
明天去巴黎了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So Paris tomorrow.

451
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,710
去埃菲尔铁塔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Go to the Eiffel Tower.

452
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:29,980
应该很棒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Should be great.

453
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,880
我读到它建造的秘密目的是作为头脑控制天线
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, I read it was secretly built as a mind control antenna

454
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,640
以制造疯子大军
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}to create an army of the insane.

455
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,380
所以那里是我整个出游最喜欢的目的地
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Which is why it's my favorite destination on the whole trip.

456
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,580
你要怎么对付那个水怪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What are you gonna do about the water monster?

457
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,780
不做什么  它死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Nothing. It's dead.

458
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,980
再说  那个神秘客都搞定了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Besides, that Mysterio guy's all over it.

459
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,940
我只想跟MJ一起玩玩
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, I just wanna spend time with MJ.

460
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,340
我们刚刚聊起巴黎  我觉得她是喜欢我的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We were talking about Paris, and I think she really likes me.

461
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,510
真不错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's nice.

462
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,440
让我想起了我和贝蒂刚相爱时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Reminds me of when Betty and I first fell in love.

463
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,710
我刚吃完我的水果馅饼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I had just finished my fruit cobbler, and...

464
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,280
联系你可真不容易  蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're a very difficult person to contact, Spider-Man.

465
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,140
你是尼克·弗瑞
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're Nick Fury.

466
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,510
你射晕了内德
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And you just shot Ned.

467
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,010
只是温和的麻醉剂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Just a mild tranquilizer.

468
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,010
他不会有事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He'll be all right.

469
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,940
很高兴终于见到你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So good to finally meet you.

470
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,580
我在葬礼上看到你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I saw you at the funeral,

471
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,610
但我觉得当时不是交换号码的好时机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but I didn't think that was a good time to exchange numbers.

472
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,440
是啊  那就太不合适了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, that would've been really inappropriate.

473
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,610
-我不就这么说的吗  -是啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- That's what I just said. - Right.

474
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:31,210
重要的是  你到这儿了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The important thing is, you're here.

475
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,810
我本想叫你来的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I tried to bring you here.

476
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,610
但你躲我  可现在你还是来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You avoided me, and now you're here.

477
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,280
真巧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What a coincidence.

478
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,710
等等  这是巧合吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Wait. Was this a coincidence?

479
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,640
我以前无所不知
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I used to know everything.

480
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,610
然后我消失了五年再回来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Then I come back five years later,

481
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,610
现在我什么都不知道了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and now I know nothing.

482
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:49,210
没有情报  没有团队
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No intel, no team.

483
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,680
一个高中小子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And a high school kid

484
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,840
都敢不接我电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}is dodging my calls.

485
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,480
我知道的是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Here's what I do know:

486
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:04,140
一周前  墨西哥一村庄被一场龙卷风摧毁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}A week ago, a village in Mexico was wiped out by a cyclone.

487
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,840
目击者说  那龙卷风长了脸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Witnesses say that cyclone had a face.

488
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:15,840
三天后  摩洛哥发生类似事件
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Three days later, a similar event in Morocco.

489
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,440
一个村庄...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}A village was...

490
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,310
来查个房
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Just making the rounds.

491
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,080
看看经历了今天的创伤性事件
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}See if anyone needs any emotional counseling

492
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,940
是否有人需要情感咨询
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}after today's traumatic events.

493
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,480
不  我们没事的  谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, we'll be okay. We're fine. Thank you.

494
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,110
很好  因为我其实没资格做...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Great because I'm... I'm not qualified to actually...

495
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,910
他睡熟了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, he's passed out.

496
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,750
我反正也没那个资质  晚安了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm really not qualified to do it anyway, so good night.

497
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,710
那是我老师  抱歉了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That was my teacher. Sorry about that.

498
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,710
你刚刚在说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You were saying?

499
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,140
一个村庄被摧毁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}A village was destroyed by

500
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,010
这可能又是一个威胁世界的...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}what may well be another world-threatening...

501
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,380
宝贝  你还醒着吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Babe, you still awake?

502
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,380
你不回我短信
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're not answering any of my texts.

503
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,110
他睡着了  贝蒂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's asleep, Betty.

504
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,780
这么早
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, already?

505
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,510
-是啊  -好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Yeah. - Okay.

506
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,480
所以  我们务必...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's why it's imperative...

507
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,740
孩子们  今天那运河的水
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Boys. So that canal water today

508
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,740
充满了危险的细菌
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}was filled with dangerous bacteria...

509
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,280
再有人来敲门
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Another person touches that door,

510
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,640
你和我就又要参加一场葬礼了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}you and I are going to attend another funeral.

511
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,230
穿战衣
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Suit up.

512
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,980
如果你们俩有谁开始呕吐要告诉我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Let me know if either of you develop vomiting.

513
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,510
斯塔克把这个留给了你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Stark left these for you.

514
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,580
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Really?

515
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,550
"欲戴王冠  必承其重"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown."

516
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,110
斯塔克说你不会懂的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Stark said you wouldn't get that

517
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,640
因为不是《星战》梗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}because it's not a Star Wars reference.

518
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,140
摘了面罩吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You can lose the mask.

519
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,880
这里的人都见过你的真身
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Everyone here has seen you without it.

520
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,440
你只是无故
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You'd only be feigning anonymity

521
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,980
装神秘  还要隔着布料呼吸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and breathing through spandex for no good reason.

522
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,280
走吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Come on.

523
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,280
好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

524
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,440
那是玛丽亚·希尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Over there, we have Maria Hill.

525
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:00,910
这是德米崔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That is Dimitri.

526
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,410
这是贝克先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And this is Mr. Beck.

527
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,710
神秘客
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Mysterio?

528
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,840
什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What?

529
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,840
没什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Doesn't matter.

530
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,810
我朋友这么喊你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's what my friends have been calling you.

531
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,480
你可以喊我昆廷
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, you can call me Quentin.

532
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,840
你今天的表现真出色
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You handled yourself well out there today.

533
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,380
我看到你拉着那座塔楼了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I saw what you did with the tower.

534
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,440
我的世界就需要你这种人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We could use someone like you on my world.

535
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,440
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thanks.

536
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,510
什么  你的世界
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm sorry. Your world?

537
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,280
贝克先生是来自地球
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Mr. Beck is from Earth.

538
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,040
但不是你的地球
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Just not yours.

539
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,840
现实有很多个  彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}There are multiple realities, Peter.

540
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:38,250
这里是616号地球  我来自833号地球
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This is Earth Dimension 616. I'm from Earth 833.

541
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,080
抱歉  你是说存在多元宇宙吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm sorry, you're saying there's a multiverse?

542
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,510
我以为那只是个理论
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}'Cause I thought that was just theoretical.

543
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,580
这将完全改变
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, that completely changes

544
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,110
我们对初始奇点的理解
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}how we understand the initial singularity.

545
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,980
这可是个永恒膨胀的系统
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We're talking about an eternal inflation system.

546
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,940
那怎么行得通  那么多量...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How does that even work with all the quantum...?

547
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,140
真是疯了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's insane.

548
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,340
抱歉  好酷啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}S-sorry. It's really cool.

549
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:59,050
不要为比其他人聪明而道歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't ever apologize for being the smartest one in the room.

550
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,140
好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Anyway...

551
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,910
它们诞生于黑洞中的稳定轨道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They were born in stable orbits within black holes.

552
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,180
是基本元素构成的生灵
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Creatures formed from the primary elements:

553
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,780
气  水  火  土
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Air, water, fire, earth.

554
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,310
科学部为它们起了学名
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The Science Division had a technical name.

555
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,880
但我们喊它们元素怪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We just called them Elementals.

556
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,340
它们的变体普版存在于我们的神话中
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Versions of them exist across our mythologies.

557
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,080
原来传说都是真的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Turns out, the myths are real.

558
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,110
就像托尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Like Thor.

559
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:27,010
托尔原是传说  但现在是我物理课的内容
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thor was a myth, and now I study him in my physics class.

560
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,780
这些传说是威胁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}These myths are threats.

561
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,240
它们最初于多年前在我的地球上实体化
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They first materialized on my Earth many years ago.

562
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,740
我们调动力量与它们交手
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We mobilized and fought them,

563
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,250
但它们随着每场战斗愈发强大
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but with each battle, they grew, got stronger.

564
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,610
我是仅剩的最后一支阻止它们的军团的一员
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I was part of the last battalion left trying to stop them.

565
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,680
但我们只推迟了不可避免的结局
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}All we did was delay the inevitable.

566
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,080
元素怪又来到了这里  袭击相同的地点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The Elementals are here now, attacking the same coordinates.

567
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,340
卫星已证实了这点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Our satellites confirm it.

568
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:49,080
所以感谢贝克先生摧毁了另三个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So thank Mr. Beck for destroying the other three.

569
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,250
现在只剩一个了  火
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}There's only one left: fire.

570
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,080
它们中最强的一个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The strongest of them all.

571
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,210
摧毁了我的地球的那个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The one that destroyed my Earth.

572
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,780
也是杀死我家人的那个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's the one that took my family.

573
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,480
我很遗憾
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm sorry.

574
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,380
再过大概48小时  它就会出现在布拉格
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And it will be in Prague in approximately 48 hours.

575
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,340
我们只有一项任务  干掉它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We have one mission: kill it.

576
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,840
你要跟我们一起来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And you're coming with us.

577
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,080
抱歉  你是说布拉格吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm sorry, did you say Prague?

578
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:17,210
弗瑞先生  这似乎是很严重的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Mr. Fury, this all seems like bigtime,

579
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,910
很重大的  超级英雄的那种事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}you know, huge superhero kind of stuff.

580
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:23,710
我只是友好邻居蜘蛛侠  先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And, I mean, I'm just a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.

581
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,580
少来了  你上过太空呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Bitch, please. You've been to space.

582
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,720
我知道  但那是意外
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I know, but that was an accident.

583
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,340
先生  拜托  你肯定还能找别人吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Sir, come on. There's gotta be someone else you can use.

584
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,140
-托尔呢  -去别的世界了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What about Thor? - Off-world.

585
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,010
好吧  斯特兰奇博士
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, um, Doctor Strange.

586
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,710
-没空  -惊奇队长
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Unavailable. - Captain Marvel.

587
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:36,940
别跟我提她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't invoke her name.

588
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,780
先生  我真的想帮忙的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Sir, look, I really wanna help. I do.

589
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,040
但如果我婶婶得知我离开了大部队
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But if my aunt finds out I left my class trip,

590
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,880
她会杀了我的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}she's gonna kill me.

591
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,180
经过了华盛顿纪念堂的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And if I'm seen like this in Europe

592
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,240
如果我再这样在欧洲出现
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}after the Washington Monument,

593
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,580
我全班同学都会猜到我的身份

会叫的轮子有升级油抹
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The squeaky wheel gets the upgrade grease.

-那太好了  -没事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Okay. Great, great. - It's fine.

775
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,280
那些元素怪什么情况了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So, what's the status on the Elemental thing?

776
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,710
-会在哪里出现  -在这座城市里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Where's it gonna happen? - Uh, here in the city.

778
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,580
我在想办法呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's... I'm figuring it out.

779
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,540
你得做点什么  彼得  拜托
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You have to do something, Peter, please.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Ned. - Yeah. Yeah, babe.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The good news is, we've all got our own rooms.

783
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,280
-可算  -不是吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- It's about time. - Serious?

784
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,110
-帕克  -是  先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Parker? Parker! - Yes, sir.

785
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:24,510
那玩意几小时后就来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That thing is going to be here in a few hours.

00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,980
-我们让你无聊了吗  -他不是无聊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Are we boring you? - He's not bored.

787
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,580
他只是在想被你绑架来的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's just thinking about how you kidnapped him.

788
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,240
他有困难
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He had obstacles.

789
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,980
我解决掉了困难
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I removed them.

790
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,950
他们还是不肯疏散城市
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And they still won't evacuate the city.

791
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,480
白痴
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Idiots.

792
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,610
怎么办  帕克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So, what's the plan, Parker?

793
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,110
我去大教堂塔楼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I will be in the cathedral tower,

794
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:42,610
留意火怪的出现
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}keeping watch for the fire monster.

795
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:44,950
等它出现  我就呼叫你们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}When that shows up, I will radio you guys,

796
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:48,240
-然后我和贝克先生  -我叫神秘客
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- and then Mr. Beck and I will... - My name is Mysterio.

797
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:54,210
然后我和神秘客就冲上去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's when Mysterio and I will move in.

798
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,580
彼得  听我说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Peter, listen to me.

799
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,910
最好的结果  唯一的好结果
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The best hope you have, the only hope,

800
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,610
就是现在阻止它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}is to stop it here now,

801
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,350
不惜一切
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}no matter what the cost.

802
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,610
尽量带他远离市民
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Maneuver it away from civilians if you can,

803
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:06,980
但最重要的是让它远离金属
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but most important, keep it away from metal.

804
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,140
如果它长得太大
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}If it gets too big,

805
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:10,440
就能开始汲取地球内核的力量
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}it'll be able to draw power from the Earth's core.

806
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:13,410
那样的话  它就不可阻挡了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}After that, there's no way to stop it.

807
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,350
我的朋友都在这里呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, man, my friends are here.

808
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,580
我忍不住觉得我们给他们带来了危险
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I can't help but think that we're putting them in danger.

809
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:24,810
你还担心我们伤害你的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're worried about us hurting your friends?

810
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,280
你  调动无人机袭击你自己的学校旅游大巴
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You, who called a drone strike on your own school tour bus?

811
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:33,340
斯塔克给了你一套价值百万的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Stark gave you a multibillion-dollar

812
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,810
现实增强战术情报系统
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}A.R. Tactical intelligence system,

813
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:37,380
你首先就拿它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and the first thing you do with it

814
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,640
去炸你朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}is try and blow up your friends.

815
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:43,810
在我看来  你显然没做好准备
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's clear to me that you were not ready for this.

816
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:53,180
弗瑞叫我来看看你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Fury asked me to come up here and see how you were doing.

817
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,580
他对冲你发脾气感到过意不去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He just... He felt bad about snapping at you.

818
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:56,410
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Really?

819
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:59,410
这个地球上有反讽这回事吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You guys do have sarcasm on this Earth, right?

820
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:01,980
你感觉怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How you feeling?

821
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,550
我没想到我这个暑假还得拯救世界
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I didn't think I was gonna have to save the world this summer.

822
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:12,740
我知道这话听上去很混蛋  但...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I know that makes me sound like such a jerk. I just...

823
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:17,080
我本来计划好了跟我喜欢的女孩...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I had this plan with this girl that I really like...

824
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:20,180
现在都毁了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and now it's all ruined.

825
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:30,080
想要正常生活不叫混蛋  孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're not a jerk for wanting a normal life, kid.

826
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:33,410
这条路很艰辛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's a hard path.

827
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:36,010
你会看到一些事  会做一些事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You see things. You do things.

828
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:37,380
你要做出选择
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You make choices.

829
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,480
人们敬仰你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}People look up to you...

830
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,110
即便你赢得战役  有时也会死人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and even if you win a battle, sometimes they die.

831
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,550
我喜欢你  彼得  你是个好孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I like you, Peter. You're a good kid.

832
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:51,980
我心里有些想对你说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}There's a part of me that wants me to tell you, just...

833
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,740
转身离开这一切
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}turn around, run away from all this.

834
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:56,240
但我心里又清楚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Then there's another part of me

835
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:58,110
我们要对付的东西是什么样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}that knows what we're about to fight,

836
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,350
这关乎到什么  我很高兴有你在
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}what's at stake, and I'm glad you're here.

837
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:04,380
我也是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Me too.

838
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:06,610
但你担心你的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But you're worried about your friends.

839
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,780
对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

840
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:11,240
我觉得我总害他们有危险
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Just always feel like I'm putting them in danger.

841
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:14,440
让他们待在室内
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, just get them inside

842
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:17,110
让他们在安全处待几小时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and keep them in a safe place for just a few hours.

843
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:17,950
他们会没事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They'll be all right.

844
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:22,810
能有个人一起聊聊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's really nice to have somebody to talk to about

845
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,280
超级英雄的事真好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}superhero stuff, you know?

846
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:27,080
不客气
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Anytime.

847
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:30,040
如果我们活下来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And, hey, we survive this,

848
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:31,850
你还有一整个暑假能杀布拉德呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}you'll have all summer to kill Brad.

849
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,740
待会儿见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}See you out there.

850
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:37,910
好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}All right.

851
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:43,510
对不起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Scusi.

852
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,180
抱歉  那是意大利语
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Sorry, that's Italian.

853
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:51,540
好了  伊迪丝  快点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay. EDITH? Oh, come on.

854
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:52,610
你好  彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hello, Peter.

855
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,740
我需要想个办法让我的朋友们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I need to find a way to keep my friends

856
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,110
接下来几小时待在室内
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}inside the next few hours.

857
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:57,510
我们想想办法吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Let's see what we can do.

858
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,280
好消息
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Good news.

859
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,310
我们要去看歌剧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We're going to the opera!

860
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,010
-开什么玩笑  -歌剧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- You're kidding me. - The opera?

861
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:04,240
别看我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't look at me.

862
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,680
不是说去嘉年华吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What happened to the carnival?

863
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,380
这就是升级人生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This is upgrade living, guys.

864
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,980
来嘛  门票是旅游公司免费送的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Come on. The tour company just gave us these tickets.

865
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,210
免费哦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}For free!

866
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:14,240
你们知道歌剧门票多贵吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Do you have any idea how much opera tickets cost?

867
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:14,980
不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No,

868
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:18,710
因为我们没有人想去看歌剧  从来不想
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}because none of us have ever wanted to go to the opera, ever.

869
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:21,740
我觉得这是我们增长文化知识的好机会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, I think this is gonna be culturally enriching for us.

870
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:22,880
谢谢  内德
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thank you, Ned.

871
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:26,410
各位  这或许将是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Everyone, this is gonna be, maybe,

872
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,380
我们整个旅程中最棒的四小时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}the best four hours of our whole trip.

873
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,810
四小时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Four hours?

874
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:33,510
各位  我觉得这会很好玩的  真的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Guys, I think this is gonna be fun. Seriously.

875
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,040
你们肯定都庆幸我让你们带身好衣服了吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I bet now you're all happy that I had you pack a nice outfit.

876
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:41,710
是啊  因为我们更想去看四小时的歌剧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, because we'd much rather go to a four-hour opera

877
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:43,580
而不是全世界最大的派对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}instead of the biggest party in the world.

878
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,550
再说一次  跟我无关
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Again, don't look at me.

879
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:47,850
帕克  收到吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Parker, do you copy?

880
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,510
通讯检查  一  二
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Comm check, one, two.

881
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,710
好  我们到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, here we are.

882
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,610
在人流之前到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Beat the rush.

883
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,850
是啊  是往外走的人流
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, the rush out.

884
00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:00,410
我们走运  有最好的座位
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Lucky for us, we got the best seats in the house.

885
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,510
走吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Let's go.

886
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:06,450
我给你留个位置
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'll save you a seat.

你真美
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You look really pretty.

888
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:16,680
因此我才有价值吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And therefore, I have value?

889
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:19,610
不  我完全不是那意思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No. No, that's not what I meant at all. I was just...

890
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:20,880
我在逗你呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm messing with you.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Want to go in on a pair?

896
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:35,640
坐在一起吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You mean, sit next to each other?

897
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:36,450
好啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

898

你不想跟我坐一起吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You don't want to sit next to me,

902
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:44,980
还是不想要眼镜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}or, no, you just don't want the glasses?

903
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:46,240
我不是那意思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I didn't mean that.

904
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:49,740
你先去吧  我去给我们买一副
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}If you go ahead, I'll go grab us a pair.

你能跟MJ说我病了什么的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Could you just tell MJ that I'm sick or something?

912
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,240
好吧  小心点

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Where do you think she's going?

921
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:42,440
会是去嘉年华吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Do you think she's going to the carnival?

922

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}As soon as I see something, Beck, I'll, uh...

928
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:09,140
我就告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'll let you know.

929
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,550

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The suit's great. It's awesome.

931
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:16,180
射网处有点紧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's a little tight around the old web-shooter.

932
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:16,760
帕克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Parker!

933
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:18,140
我闭嘴了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, I'll shut up.

934
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:20,710

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, my God, babe, isn't this beautiful?

935
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:23,050
是啊  真美啊  宝贝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, it's real beautiful, babe.

00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,450
-怎么了  -老实说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What's wrong? - You know, honestly, I just...

937
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:29,240
我不是很适应人多  要不我们...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't do well with big crowds, so maybe we should...

938
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,880
我知道怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I have the perfect thing.

939
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:31,910
走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Come on.

940
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,940
别担心  宝贝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't worry, babe.

941
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:44,580
我们能远离人群  呼吸点新鲜空气
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We'll get away from the crowds, get some fresh air.

942
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:46,550
你会感觉好得多的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You'll feel a thousand times better.

943
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,510
能量激增
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Energy spiking.

944
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:54,110
还有地震活动
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We have seismic activity.

945
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:06,610
他出现了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, he's here!

946
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:07,740
贝克  准备好了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Beck, are you ready?

947
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:08,810
你知道怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You know what to do.

948
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,310
听你的  蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}On your lead, Spider-Man.

949
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,540
不  回来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, come back!

950
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:19,310
回来救我们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Come back and help us!

951
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:27,080
你上吧  孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're up, kid.

952
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,140
等等  那是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Wait, wait. Is that...?

953
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:42,850
你觉得那是蜘蛛侠吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Do you think that's Spider-Man?

954
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:44,330
不不不
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, no, no.

955
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:46,010
那是他的欧洲山寨货
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's a European rip-off version of him.

956
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:48,240
我前两天还看他的报道了  不是他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I was actually read about him the other day. It's not him.

957
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,700
不  贝克  他吸收了旋转木马
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, Beck! He's got the carousel!

958
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:04,780
他在变大了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's getting bigger!

959
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,850
他叫什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What's his name? What's his name?

960
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:08,980
是夜猴侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's Night... Night Monkey.

961
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,880
-夜猴侠  -对  对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Night Monkey? - Yeah. Yeah.

962
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,110
夜猴侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Night Monkey!

963
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:13,410
-对  -夜猴侠  救命
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Yeah. - Night Monkey, help!

964
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:14,130
夜猴侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Night Monkey.

965
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:14,890
-救我们  -什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Save us! - What?

966
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,340
夜猴侠  我们困住了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Night Monkey, we're stuck!

967
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,640
-不不  -救命
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Oh, no, no. - Help us! Help!

968
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,280
你没事吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Are you okay?

969
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,980
-执行B计划吧  -好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- On to Plan B? - Yeah!

970
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:41,810
我们得拿它无法吸收的东西打它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We gotta hit him with something he can't absorb!

971
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:43,210
我左  你右
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I go left, you go right!

972
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:44,610
动手
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now!

973
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,740
好  打它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, shoot him!

974
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,240
好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah!

975
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:07,550
伤到它了  继续
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That hurt him. Keep it coming.

976
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,450
蜘蛛侠  保持距离
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Spider-Man, keep your distance.

977
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:18,850
我在尽力
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm trying!

978
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:21,440
别让它靠近摩天轮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Can't let him get near the Ferris wheel.

979
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:23,180
好  看我的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay. I'm on it!

980
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,510
那是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What is that?!

981
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:56,850
贝蒂  贝蒂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Betty! Betty!

982
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:20,410
就这样  好样的  你打中它了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's it! Nice! Nice! You got him!

983
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:28,480
不不不
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, no, no.

984
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:36,180
太迟了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's too late.

985
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:38,910
不管发生什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Whatever happens...

986
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:41,080
很高兴我们相识一场
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm glad we met.

987
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,310
贝克  你要干什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Beck, what are you doing?

988
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,640
我上次该干的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What I should have done last time.

989
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:53,380
贝克  别
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Beck, don't do it!

990
00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:58,610
贝克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Beck!

991
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:19,980
贝克先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Mr. Beck?

992
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:24,380
谢天谢地
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, thank God.

993
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,580
我真想亲你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I would totally kiss you,

994
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,910
但我觉得我刚有点吐在嘴里了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but I think I just threw up in my mouth a little.

995
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:42,310
我可能有薄荷糖
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I might have a mint.

996
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:45,280
结束了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So it's over?

997
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:46,740
那是最后一个了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That was the last of them.

998
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:49,480
但不会是我们最后一次面临威胁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But not the last threat we'll ever face.

999
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,910
我们得保持警惕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We need to stay vigilant.

1000
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:56,580
这世界正缺你这样的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}There's a void in this world for someone like you.

1001
00:55:56,610 --> 00:56:00,110
希尔和我明天要去柏林的欧警总部
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hill and I are going to Europol headquarters in Berlin tomorrow.

1002
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:01,740
你该一起来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You should join us.

1003
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,610
谢谢  我可能真会去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thank you. I just might take you up on that.

1004
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:18,580
你有天赋  帕克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You got gifts, Parker,

1005
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:20,210
但你不想来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but you didn't wanna be here.

1006
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:20,940
弗瑞先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Mr. Fury, I...

1007
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,510
我希望你也能去柏林
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'd love to have you in Berlin too.

1008
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:28,180
但你得想好  你要不要挺身而出
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But you got to decide whether you're going to step up or not.

1009
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:30,640
斯塔克选了你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Stark chose you.

1010
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,910
他让你做了复仇者
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He made you an Avenger.

1011
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:35,080
我需要那个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I need that.

1012
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:38,310
世界也需要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The world needs that.

1013
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:40,240
或许斯塔克错了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Maybe Stark was wrong.

1014
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:44,710
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Was he?

1015
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,580
选择权在你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The choice is yours.

1016
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,380
我们去喝一杯吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Let's get a drink.

1017
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,210
我没到21
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm not 21.

1018
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:22,680
你该庆祝  我们今晚做了好事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You gotta celebrate. We did something good tonight.

1019
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,950
是啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

1020
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,450
弗瑞是对的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Fury was right.

1021
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,910
托尼为我做了好多事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Tony did a lot for me, so...

1022
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,880
我欠他的  欠大家的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I owe it to him, to everybody.

1023
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:33,510
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Do you?

1024
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:35,680
对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah. I mean...

1025
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:40,380
斯塔克先生给了我做更多的机会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Mr. Stark gave me the chance to be more.

1026
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,210
他希望我做的比他好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He wanted me to be better than him.

1027
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:43,980
弗瑞希望我不负他的期望
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And Fury just wants me to live up to that.

1028
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,580
那你想要什么  彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What do you want, Peter?

1029
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:47,680
-什么意思  -你想要什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What do you mean? - What do you want?

1030
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,240
我不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't know.

1031
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,810
你想要什么  彼得·帕克  就现在
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What do you want? You, Peter Parker. Now.

1032
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:53,610
我知道你在想
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I know you're thinking about it.

1033
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,510
我想去旅我的行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I wanna go on my trip, right?

1034
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:57,810
我想回去跟朋友们一起旅行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I want to go back on my trip with my friends.

1035
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,740
跟我喜欢的姑娘
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And go to the top of the Eiffel Tower

1036
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:04,410
去埃菲尔铁塔顶层  然后向她告白
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}with the girl who I really like and tell her how I feel, and...

1037
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,510
吻她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}give her a kiss.

1038
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:09,480
闭嘴啦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Shut up, man.

1039
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:11,780
你不会那么做  是吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're not gonna do that, are you?

1040
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,540
-我不能  -为什么不能
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- No, I can't. - Why not?

1041
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:15,780
因为我还有太多责任
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Because I have too much of a responsibility.

1042
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:20,210
-天啊  非常感谢  -那是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Oh, my God. Thank you so much. - What are those?

1043
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,040
-那是...  -伊迪丝眼镜  是啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Are those the...? - EDITH glasses, yeah.

1044
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:23,280
之前掉地上了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They were just on the floor?

1045
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,680
戴上试试  让我看看
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Try them on. Let's see how they look like.

1046
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,680
-是吗  -嗯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Yeah? - Yeah.

1047
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:32,110
我还挺喜欢的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I actually really like them.

1048
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:33,880
我能跟你说实话吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Can I be completely honest with you?

1049
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,610
请吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Please.

1050
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,610
丑爆了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They look really stupid.

1051
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:40,510
但或许还有隐形眼镜版本的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But maybe they have a contact-lens version.

1052
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:42,010
你戴上试试
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You try them on.

1053
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,880
-不  得了  -试试嘛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- No, come on. - Try them on.

1054
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:46,010
-我不想戴  -戴上试试嘛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- I don't wanna try them on. - Just put them on.

1055
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:55,010
你觉得怎么样  孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What do you think, kid?

1056
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:01,840
"下一个托尼·斯塔克  我信任你"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"Next Tony Stark, I trust you."

1057
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:05,840
"给下一个托尼·斯塔克  我信任你"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."

1058
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,710
什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What?

1059
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:08,970
斯塔克先生给我留下眼镜时还有段话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Mr Stark left me a message with those glasses:

1060
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:11,190
"给下一个托尼·斯塔克  我信任你"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."

1061
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:13,820
我还是不懂  你喝了几杯柠檬汁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm still not following. How many lemonades have you had?

1062
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:15,630
他知道我犯过的每个错误
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He knew every mistake I ever made.

1063
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:18,630
他肯定也知道我还没做好这个准备
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So, he must've known that I wasn't ready for something like this.

1064
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:19,790
那他为什么要把眼镜给你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why would he give it to you?

1065
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:21,400
因为或许他不是把伊迪丝托付给了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Because maybe he didn't trust me to have EDITH,

1066
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,380
而是托付我选个应该拥有它的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}he just trusted me to pick who should.

1067
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,130
这要合理多了  他一向知道我会做正确选择
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It makes much more sense. He always knew I'd do what's right.

1068
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,260
他不会把眼镜给弗瑞的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And he's not gonna give them to Fury

1069
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,770
因为弗瑞只会自己留着伊迪丝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}because Fury would give himself EDITH.

1070
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:31,060
这你八成是说对了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're probably right about that.

1071
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:33,810
是啊  所以世界需要下一个钢铁侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Right, so the world needs the next Iron Man.

1072
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,480
那不会是我的  我是个皇后区来的16岁孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And it's not me. I mean, I'm a 16-year-old kid from Queens.

1073
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,350
得是个大人  有经验
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It needs to be an adult with some experience

1074
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,630
就像托尼·斯塔克一样好  比如你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and that's good like Tony Stark, like you.

1075
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:44,840
不  彼得  得了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No. Peter, come on.

1076
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:46,760
不行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No.

1077
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:50,510
-伊迪丝  -你好  彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- EDITH? - Hello, Peter.

1078
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:51,870
嗯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, um...

1079
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:56,090
我想把你的控制权交给昆廷·贝克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'd like to transfer your control over to Quentin Beck.

1080
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:58,660
-彼得  你干什么呢  -做正确的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Peter, what are you doing? - Doing the right thing.

1081
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:01,290
移交控制权需要确认
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Any transfer will require confirmation.

1082
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,040
斯塔克把眼镜给了你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Stark gave you the glasses.

1083
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,120
斯塔克给了我个选择
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Stark gave me a choice.

1084
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,220
这是我要做的选择  我现在要选了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's my choice to make. Okay? I'm gonna make it.

1085
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:09,030
你是个士兵  是领袖  你阻止了元素怪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, you're a soldier, a leader. You stopped the Elementals.

1086
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:11,970
你救了我  救了世界  好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You saved my life. You saved the world, okay?

1087
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,410
他会希望你拿着眼镜的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He'd want you to have them.

1088
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,230
等待确认
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Waiting for confirmation.

1089
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:16,260
确认
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Confirm.

1090
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:21,730
欢迎加入复仇者联盟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Welcome to the Avengers.

1091
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,090
你戴挺帅的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They look good on you.

1092
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:33,850
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thank you.

1093
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:35,280
很荣幸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's an honor.

1094
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,000
嗯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

1095
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,200
斯塔克先生真的会喜欢你的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Mr. Stark would've really liked you.

1096
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:44,470
-你去哪  -去找MJ
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Where you headed? - I'm gonna go find MJ.

1097
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:47,230
祝你好运  孩子  我觉得你有一半机会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Good luck, kid. I'll give you about a fifty-fifty chance.

1098
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:48,700
你挺别扭的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're pretty awkward. So...

1099
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:50,350
嗯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

1100
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,950
-回见了  -回见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- See you later, man. - See you.

1101
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:27,130
瞧  并不难吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}See? That wasn't so hard.

1102
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:28,240
太好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yes!

1103
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:32,340
谁帮我褪下这身破戏服
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Somebody get this stupid costume off me!

1104
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:40,660
好  我们拿到伊迪丝了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, we got EDITH.

1105
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,300
把这个连上我们的系统
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Get these connected to our system.

1106
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:44,890
敬酒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Toast! Toast! Toast!

1107
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:48,060
这是场重大胜利  但我们的任务还很艰巨
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now, this is a big win, but we still got a lot of work to do.

1108
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:49,810
敬酒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Toast! Toast! Toast!

1109
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:51,360
好啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah!

1110
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,620
好吧  敬一杯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, toasts!

1111
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,070
给我  道格
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Give me that, Doug.

1112
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,180
敬让我们走到一起的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}To the man who brought us all together,

1113
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,210
我们的前老板  托尼·斯塔克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}our former boss, Tony Stark.

1114
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:02,040
小丑国王
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The jester king.

1115
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:06,650
被财富和科技包裹
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Literally wrapped in wealth and technology

1116
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:09,100
他却不配使用它们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}that he was unfit to wield.

1117
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:11,120
就像我设计的全息系统
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Like the holographic system I designed.

1118
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,720
那是革命性的突破
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}A revolutionary breakthrough

1119
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,040
有无限的应用前景
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}with limitless applications

1120
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:17,370
却被托尼变成了自我治疗机器  还改名叫...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}that Tony turned into a self-therapy machine and renamed...

1121
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:21,130
二进制增强记忆重塑工具  简称"二重"[吐]
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF.

1122
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:28,250
我这个治疗实验花费了6.11亿美元
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}$611 million for my little therapeutic experiment.

1123
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:31,600
他把我的毕生心血改名叫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He renamed my life's work...

1124
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:32,490
"二重"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"Barf."

1125
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,150
我对他说这是个错误
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I told him it was a mistake,

1126
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:36,190
我的科技可以改变世界
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}that my technology could change the world.

1127
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,640
然后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And then...

1128
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,080
他解雇了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}he fired me.

1129
01:02:42,610 --> 01:02:44,000
说我...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Said I was...

1130
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:46,540
不稳定
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}unstable.

1131
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:49,380
敬托尼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}To Tony.

1132
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:51,180
敬托尼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}To Tony!

1133
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:53,140
接下来  敬威廉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Next, to William.

1134
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:54,600
威廉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}William!

1135
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:58,650
托尼·斯塔克在一个山洞里就造成了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave!

1136
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:00,750
用的是一堆破烂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}With a box of scraps!

1137
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:03,230
我的幻景科技和你的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The integration of my illusion tech

1138
01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:05,580
武器化无人机的结合简直绝妙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}with your weaponized drones was brilliant.

1139
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:08,360
强大幻景  真实摧毁  屡试不爽
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Powerful illusions, real damage, worked like a charm.

1140
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,540
而这还只是开始
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And it's just the beginning.

1141
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:11,560
-谢谢  兄弟  -敬古特曼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Thank you, brother. - To Guterman.

1142
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:12,910
-古特曼  -敬古特曼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Guterman! - To Guterman!

1143
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:14,020
你编写的故事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The story you created

1144
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:15,840
一个来自另一个地球的战士昆廷
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}of a soldier from another Earth named Quentin

1145
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,210
在欧洲跟太空怪物战斗  简直荒谬至极
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}fighting space monsters in Europe is totally ridiculous

1146
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:20,680
可看来现在
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and apparently exactly the kind of thing

1147
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,020
大家就信这一套了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}people would believe right now.

1148
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:23,630
所有人都信了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, everybody bought it.

1149
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:25,360
-古特  -古特曼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Gutes! - Guterman!

1150
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,350
-敬维多利亚  -敬维多利亚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- To Victoria. - To Victoria!

1151
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:29,590
在每个袭击点制造电磁脉冲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Staging electromagnetic pulses at each attack site

1152
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:32,110
让弗瑞的卫星确认我们的谎言
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}so Fury's own satellites would confirm our lies.

1153
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:33,870
好点子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Inspired idea.

1154
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:35,930
-敬詹妮丝  -詹妮丝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- To Janice. - Janice!

1155
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:38,270
托尼死后  是她发现了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}After Tony died, she was the one who discovered that

1156
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:40,180
伊迪丝没有被交给我们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}EDITH was being handed over not to us,

1157
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:42,130
或是国防部
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}not to the Defense Department,

1158
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:43,540
而是给了个孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but to a child.

1159
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:45,300
-谢谢  -敬詹妮丝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Thank you. - To Janice!

1160
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:47,590
也敬你们其他人  托尼·斯塔克死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And to the rest of you, Tony Stark is gone.

1161
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:51,080
现在有个机会  会有人站出来的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}There's a window of opportunity, and someone will step up.

1162
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:53,740
但现如今  哪怕你是在场最聪明的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But these days, you can be the smartest guy in the room,

1163
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:56,190
最有资质的人  也没人在乎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}the most qualified, and no one cares.

1164
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:58,060
除非你披着斗篷飞
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Unless you're flying around with a cape

1165
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:59,810
或是手能发出激光
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}or shooting lasers from your hands,

1166
01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:02,350
否则根本没人听你说话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}no one will even listen.

1167
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:08,110
我现在有斗篷和激光了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, I've got a cape and lasers.

1168
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:10,990
凭借我们的科技  和伊迪丝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}With our technology and with EDITH,

1169
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:15,900
神秘客将成为地球上最伟大的英雄
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Mysterio will be the greatest hero on Earth!

1170
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:17,170
好啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah!

1171
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:19,890
到时所有人都得听着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Then everyone will listen!

1172
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:24,650
不是听一个酗酒的巨婴
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Not to a boozy man-child.

1173
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:25,960
不
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No!

1174
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:28,840
也不是听一个青春期少年
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Not to a hormonal teenager.

1175
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,190
不
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No!

1176
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:31,950
而是听我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}To me...

1177
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:35,440
以及我很富有的手下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and to my very wealthy crew.

1178
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:36,760
敬我们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}To us.

1179
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:37,660
敬我们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}To us.

1180
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,180
敬神秘客
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}To Mysterio!

1181
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,990
敬神秘客
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}To Mysterio!

1182
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:42,310
敬彼得·帕克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}To Peter Parker.

1183
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:44,090
敬彼得·帕克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}To Peter Parker!

1184
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,070
可怜的孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Poor kid.

1185
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,060
我们开工吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Let's get to work.

1186
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:55,420
彼得  天啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Peter, oh, my God.

1187
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:56,650
我们差点死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We almost died.

1188
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:57,990
没事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's fine. It's fine.

1189
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,710
我的任务执行完了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Guess what, I'm done with the mission.

1190
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:01,910
-哥们  旅行结束了  -什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Dude, the trip's over. - What?

1191
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:04,140
我们去哪都有怪物从地下钻出来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}There's monsters coming out of the ground everywhere we go.

1192
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:05,580
我们的家长当然会叫我们回去了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Of course our parents would want us home.

1193
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:08,850
请别让我待机  彼得  你没死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't put me on hold. Peter, you're not dead.

1194
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:11,060
天啊  太好了  待在这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, my God. Yes, good. Stay here.

1195
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:13,730
别...去换身衣服  我们在订飞机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't... Put some clothes on. We're booking flights.

1196
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,250
我们为科学而来  却因巫术而走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We came for science, we're leaving because of witches.

1197
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:17,920
欢迎来到新黑暗时代
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Welcome to the new Dark Ages.

1198
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:22,580
-怎么回事  -我们一早就回家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What is going on, dude? - We're going home in the morning.

1199
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:24,740
不不  元素怪都没了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, no, no. All the Elementals are gone.

1200
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:26,990
-内德  -来了  亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Ned. - Coming, sweetie.

1201
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:29,990
你们能小点声吗  我在直播
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Can you guys keep it down? I'm live-streaming.

1202
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:32,450
好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

1203
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:36,550
你去哪了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Where were you?

1204
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:38,830
我迷路了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I got lost.

1205
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:40,790
我们担心你来着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We were worried about you.

1206
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:42,660
幸好你回来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Good thing you're back.

1207
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,140
是啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

1208
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:46,330
巴黎去不成了  是吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So much for Paris, right?

1209
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:47,520
本会很好玩的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It would've been fun.

1210
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:48,250
是啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

1211
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,500
晚安
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Night.

1212
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:50,120
晚安
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Night.

1213
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:52,990
你真美...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You look ni...

1214
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:01,490
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay.

1215
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:06,940
那个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, um...

1216
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:10,570
我还不希望旅行就此结束
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm not ready for this trip to be over yet, and

1217
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:12,620
我想做点有趣的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I kind of want to do something fun

1218
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:15,680
不在日程上  不是规划好的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}that's not on the itinerary or planned

1219
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,990
也没有哈林顿老师陪着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}or with Mr. Harrington.

1220
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:17,850
好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yes.

1221
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:20,830
"好"  你想去吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"Yes," Like you wanna go?

1222
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:21,850
对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yes.

1223
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:26,170
太好了  那10分钟后外面见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay. Awesome. I'll see you outside in 10 minutes.

1224
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:27,690
五分钟后外面见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Meet me outside in five minutes.

1225
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:30,400
-五分钟也行  -好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Five is good. - Okay.

1226
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,080
-好  再见  -再见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Okay, bye. - Bye.

1227
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:39,230
夜猴侠  救命  夜猴侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Night Monkey, help us! Help! Night Monkey!

1228
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,170
你想去哪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So where do you wanna go?

1229
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:52,170
-管他呢  -好啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Who cares? - Awesome.

1230
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:53,250
-好  -走吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Okay. - Let's go.

1231
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:01,280
我很高兴我们能出来走走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm glad we're doing this.

1232
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:04,220
-是啊  我也是  -看看这座城市
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Yeah, me too. - To see the city a bit.

1233
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:07,610
人们以前会在这座桥上执行处决
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You know, they used to execute people on this bridge.

1234
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:10,010
把人放进篮子里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They would put them in a basket,

1235
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:11,430
丢进水里淹死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and they would drown in the water.

1236
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,200
-抱歉  -没事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Sorry. - It's okay.

1237
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,090
有件事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}There's this thing that

1238
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:24,950
我想跟你说  想了好一阵了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I've been wanting to talk to you about for a while.

1239
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:27,390
什么事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah?

1240
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:30,550
这是我们在欧洲的最后一晚了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's our last night in Europe,

1241
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:34,290
我有个计划  我想告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and I had this plan that I wanted to tell you.

1242
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:36,450
我就说了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm just gonna tell you.

1243
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:39,490
MJ  我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}MJ, I...

1244
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:40,540
"我是蜘蛛侠"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"I'm Spider-Man."

1245
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:43,840
-什么  -那是你想说的吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What? - That's what you were gonna say.

1246
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,880
你是蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That you're Spider-Man.

1247
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:49,730
不  我不是蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No. I'm not Spider-Man.

1248
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:52,850
我观察你好一阵了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, I've been watching you for a while now.

1249
01:07:52,850 --> 01:07:55,060
挺明显的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's kind of obvious.

1250
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:58,110
我不是蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm not Spider-Man.

1251
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,850
你为什么会觉得我是蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What would make you think that I was Spider-Man?

1252
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:02,000
-彼得  华盛顿  -什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Peter, Washington? - Yeah?

1253
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:05,930
你突然之间毫无道理地不见了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The fact that you disappear out of nowhere for no reason.

1254
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:07,660
不  我病了  记得吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, I was sick. Remember?

1255
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:08,840
我...肚子疼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I had my... The tummy?

1256
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,720
苏珊·杨以为你是个男妓
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You know, Susan Yang thinks you're a male escort.

1257
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,810
什么  我当然不是男妓
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What? No. Of course I'm not a male escort.

1258
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:13,890
那你就是蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, then you're Spider-Man.

1259
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:17,110
-不  我才不是蜘蛛侠  -那今晚呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- No, I'm not Spider-Man at all. - What about tonight?

1260
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:19,300
你溜出去  跟那怪物打斗  我看到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You snuck off and you fought that thing. I saw you.

1261
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:21,810
你不可能看到我  因为我不是蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You can't have seen me because I'm not Spider-Man.

1262
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:24,690
而且新闻上说那是夜猴侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And also, on the news, it was the Night Monkey.

1263
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:26,030
-夜猴侠  -对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- The Night Monkey? - Yeah.

1264
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:27,640
新闻上那么说的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's what it said on the news,

1265
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:30,550
新闻从不撒谎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and the news never lies.

1266
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,290
夜猴侠  好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Night Monkey. Okay.

1267
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:34,560
你干什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What are you doing?

1268
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,270
夜猴侠和蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, do the Night Monkey and Spider-Man

1269
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:39,670
用一样的网吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}use the same webs?

1270
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:42,310
或许吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, maybe.

1271
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:44,750
或许他是只蜘蛛猿  谁知道呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Maybe he's a Spider Monkey. Who knows?

1272
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,580
你看我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Were you only watching me

1273
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:52,290
只是因为你以为我是蜘蛛侠吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}because you thought I was Spider-Man?

1274
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,270
对啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

1275
01:08:57,750 --> 01:08:59,370
要不然我为什么要看你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why else would I be watching you?

1276
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:02,660
无所谓了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Doesn't matter.

1277
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:04,890
就是以为...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Just thought that maybe...

1278
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:11,970
那怎么回事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What the hell was that?

1279
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:14,790
我不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't know.

1280
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:28,820
那是什么投影仪吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What is it, like some kind of projector or something?

1281
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:32,230
对  但非常先进
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, but it's really advanced.

1282
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:34,720
看上去好真
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It... It looked so real.

1283
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:36,880
是啊  非常真
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, really real.

1284
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:41,080
-等等  那么说...  -元素怪是假的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Wait, does that mean that...? - The Elementals are fake?

1285
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,210
但那没道理  因为我们在场的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That doesn't make any sense because we were there, right?

1286
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:47,450
现场有火  还造成了毁灭
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}There was fire and destruction, and...

1287
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:50,800
谁会做出那种事啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who would do something like that?

1288
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:01,720
神秘客
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Mysterio.

1289
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:07,870
我是蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I am Spider-Man.

1290
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:10,470
我坏大事了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I've really messed up.

1291
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:13,210
等等  你现在说真的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Wait. You're b-being serious right now?

1292
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:15,190
你没开玩笑  你百分百认真的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're not joking with me? Like, you're 100 percent serious?

1293
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:17,030
-因为这不好笑  -我没开玩笑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Because it's not funny. - No, I'm not joking.

1294
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:19,490
因为我本来只有67%确定
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Because I was only like 67 percent sure.

1295
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:21,340
-MJ  -那你为什么在这儿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- MJ... - So why are you here?

1296
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:22,800
你为什么来参加学习出游
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why are you on this school trip?

1297
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,300
我知道你有千万个问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, I know you have a lot of questions,

1298
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,140
但我们真得走了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but look, we really have to get out of here, okay?

1299
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:29,740
好  真不敢相信我猜到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay. Okay. I can't believe I figured it out!

1300
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:33,290
你夺走了我的一切
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You took everything from me!

1301
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:36,010
这是为了我家人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This is for my family!

1302
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:43,720
暂停
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Pause.

1303
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:46,480
暂停
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Pause.

1304
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:48,650
抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Sorry.

1305
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:52,120
可以快进到最后吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, can you just fast-forward to the end?

1306
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,340
好  稍等
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yep. Stand by.

1307
01:10:57,910 --> 01:11:00,450
好  飞飞飞  射射射
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}All right, fly, fly, fly, zap, zap, zap.

1308
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:03,570
暂停  我不太喜欢这走位
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Pause. I'm not in love with this choreography,

1309
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:04,310
但也凑合了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but it'll do.

1310
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:05,360
关闭图像
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Kill image.

1311
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,290
无人机显形
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}De-cloak drones.

1312
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,320
好  武器
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}All right, weapons.

1313
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:12,250
-你要武器化吗  -对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- You want to weaponize? - Yep.

1314
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,210
启用武器  准备
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Weapons only. Stand by.

1315
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,190
很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Nice.

1316
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:25,720
停下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Stop.

1317
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,220
有点...我也说不清
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Something. I don't know what it is.

1318
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:29,270
但有点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's something...

1319
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:30,800
这样吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Just dou... You know what?

1320
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:34,020
破坏力翻倍  再来一遍
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Double the damage and then run it again.

1321
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:35,550
要我翻倍吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You want me to double it up?

1322
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:37,050
-对  -好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Yeah. - All right.

1323
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:38,090
堵耳朵
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Cover your ears.

1324
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:49,810
很好  就这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That is good! That's good.

1325
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:52,220
-时间没问题吧  -没问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- We on schedule? - Oh, yeah.

1326
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:54,750
向伊迪丝网络上传软件破解
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Uploading software hack to EDITH network.

1327
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:55,480
有了它的无人机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}With her drones,

1328
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:58,280
我们就能制造一起足以覆盖整个城市的事件
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}we'll be able to create an event big enough to cover an entire city.

1329
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,690
好样的  确保每台无人机都能调用武器
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}All right. Well done. Make sure every drone is weapons-hot.

1330
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:01,800
我们需要最大破坏
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We need maximum damage.

1331
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,510
-那会死伤惨重的  -当然
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- That's gonna cause a lot of casualties. - Oh, yeah.

1332
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:07,330
伤亡大  报道多  我得盖过其他新闻
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}More casualties, more coverage. I gotta cut through the static.

1333
01:12:07,330 --> 01:12:09,150
伦敦是座美丽的城市  它会遭殃
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}London's a beautiful city, and it'll suffer,

1334
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:12,030
但他们能重建  如果我想做下个钢铁侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but they can rebuild. I mean, if I'm gonna be the next Iron Man,

1335
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:15,140
我得在复仇者级别的威胁下拯救世界
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I need to save the world from an Avengers-level threat.

1336
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:19,710
但等它的新救世主到来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But when its new savior descends,

1337
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:22,250
那些伤亡都会被遗忘
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}all those casualties will be forgotten.

1338
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,750
詹妮丝  你要就位  准备让我速换盔甲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Janice, you'll be in position with my quick-change armor

1339
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,910
-去迎接胜利  -没问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- for the victory lap? - Of course.

1340
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:28,790
-你想试试...  -不
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- You wanna try...? - No, that's...

1341
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:30,700
我的手怎么了  怎么会这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What's going on with my hand? Why is that happening?

1342
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:33,760
从广场上回来的一台无人机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}One of the drones that came back from the plaza

1343
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,600
丢了个投影仪  没事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}was missing a projector. It's fine.

1344
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:38,960
等等  你...你才告诉我吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Wait, and you're...? You're telling me this now?

1345
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:42,860
就一台无人机  图像不会有问题的  我保证
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's one drone. The image will be perfect, I promise.

1346
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:44,230
那台投影仪是证据
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That projector is evidence.

1347
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:45,390
能让人们知道我们在做什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's gonna tell people what we're doing

1348
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:46,570
怎么做到的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and how we're doing it.

1349
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:49,900
我可是在努力骗过70亿人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I am trying to fool 7 billion people here,

1350
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:52,490
包括尼克·弗瑞  他可是全世界最多疑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}including Nick Fury, who happens to be the most paranoid

1351
01:12:52,490 --> 01:12:54,630
也最危险的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and most dangerous person on the planet.

1352
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:56,470
如果他在我杀了他前发现了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And if he catches on before I've killed him,

1353
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:57,870
他会一枪崩了我的脑袋
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and he will put a bullet in my head.

1354
01:12:57,870 --> 01:13:00,310
没人想被一枪崩了脑袋  是吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And nobody wants a bullet in their head, right?

1355
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:03,490
是吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Right?

1356
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:07,610
威廉  你看着我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}William, can you look at me?

1357
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,050
调出伊迪丝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Pull up EDITH.

1358
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,240
你好  昆廷
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hello, Quentin.

1359
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:16,030
亲爱的  启动五级搜索
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hi, honey. I need a level-five search,

1360
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:17,970
全资源协议  查找这个装置
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}full-resource protocol for this device.

1361
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:19,330
正在放大
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Magnifying.

1362
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:23,070
那里  搜索进出那栋建筑的一切
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}There. Search everything going in and out of that building.

1363
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:25,050
已找到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Located.

1364
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:27,680
该死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Shit.

1365
01:13:30,930 --> 01:13:33,010
威廉  有一天
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You know, William, one day,

1366
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:35,730
等我因为这个不得不杀了彼得·帕克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}after I've had to kill Peter Parker because of this,

1367
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:39,730
我希望你记得  他的血是沾在你手上的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I hope you remember that his blood is on your hands!

1368
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,070
真不敢相信我把眼镜给了贝克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I can't believe I gave Beck those glasses.

1369
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:46,430
我怎么能那么蠢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, how could I be that stupid?

1370
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:48,100
他大概此刻正在监视我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's probably spying on me right now

1371
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:50,010
或是派无人机来杀我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}or sending a drone to come and kill me.

1372
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:52,900
你还能调用杀人无人机吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You had access to killer drones?

1373
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:54,080
对  我并没想要的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, I didn't really want them,

1374
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,090
尤其是在我差点杀了布拉德之后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}especially after I almost killed Brad.

1375
01:13:56,490 --> 01:13:58,100
你差点杀了布拉德
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You almost killed Brad?

1376
01:13:58,110 --> 01:14:00,030
听着  我得打给弗瑞先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, I have to call Mr. Fury

1377
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:01,670
告诉他贝克是骗子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and tell him that Beck's a fraud, but...

1378
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:03,190
但他应该监听了我的电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I think he tapped my phone.

1379
01:14:03,190 --> 01:14:04,550
好吧  那你怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay. So, what are you gonna do?

1380
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:06,500
我需要我的战衣
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I need my suit,

1381
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:09,820
我得去柏林  跟弗瑞先生当面说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and I have to go to Berlin and talk to Mr. Fury in person.

1382
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:15,590
那个...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Just...

1383
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:36,580
内德  太好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Ned, perfect.

1384
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:38,700
这戏服太棒了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The costume looks great...

1385
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,440
穿去化装舞会太合适了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}for the costume party

1386
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,830
就在王子城堡
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}at the prince's castle.

1387
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,210
她知道了  我告诉她了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}She knows. I told her.

1388
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:47,780
不是他告诉我的  是我猜到的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He didn't tell me. I figured it out.

1389
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:51,260
太棒了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's cool.

1390
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:52,800
老早就猜到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Like, a long time ago.

1391
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:55,960
神秘客是个骗子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, Mysterio is a fraud.

1392
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:58,290
但他救了我和贝蒂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But he saved me and Betty's lives.

1393
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:00,360
不  他用幻景科技伪造了整件事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No. He's been faking the whole thing with illusion tech.

1394
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:03,220
对  他使用了全息投影仪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, he's using these, like, hologram projectors.

1395
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:05,700
真疯狂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's crazy.

1396
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:06,650
是啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

1397
01:15:08,990 --> 01:15:12,230
所以你们是要一起查案吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So you guys were like working the case together or what?

1398
01:15:12,230 --> 01:15:13,420
主要是靠我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's been mostly me.

1399
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:16,290
内德  打给梅  让她打给哈林顿老师
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, Ned, I need you to call May, get her to call Mr. Harrington,

1400
01:15:16,290 --> 01:15:18,190
说她希望我去柏林亲戚家住
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}say that she wanted me to stay with family in Berlin,

1401
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:19,520
等待风波过去  好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}until this all blows over. Okay?

1402
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,750
好的  轻松
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Got it. Easy.

1403
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:23,080
你们撒谎真是驾轻就熟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You guys lie with such ease.

1404
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:24,690
我得走了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I gotta go.

1405
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,950
等等  投影仪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Wait, wait, wait. The projector.

1406
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:28,360
你会需要这个的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're gonna need this.

1407
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,160
别跟任何人说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't tell anyone about this, okay?

1408
01:15:31,170 --> 01:15:32,710
知道的人都会有危险
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Anyone who knows is in danger.

1409
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:42,220
所以  你也知道了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So you know too.

1410
01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:45,570
真酷  虽然是我先知道的  而且要更早
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's cool. I mean, I've known first, and I've known longer,

1411
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:47,130
但又不是什么竞争
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but it's not a competition.

1412
01:15:57,550 --> 01:15:59,170
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}德国  柏林

1413
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,480
不好意思  你知道哪...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Excuse me. Do you know where...?

1414
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:13,730
-夜猴侠  -不  等等  我不...天啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Nacht Monkey! - No, wait, I didn't... Oh, man.

1415
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:17,330
上车
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Get in.

1416
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:24,830
弗瑞先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Mr. Fury...

1417
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:27,470
你要解释很多事了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You've got a lot of explaining to do.

1418
01:16:27,470 --> 01:16:29,620
-不不  听着  -等安全了再说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- No, no, no, listen. - Wait until we're secure.

1419
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:31,010
好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay.

1420
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:37,310
对哦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Right.

1421
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:06,430
你要跟我们说说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So is there anything you want to tell us

1422
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:07,560
你的女朋友吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}about your girlfriend?

1423
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,050
他是指伊迪丝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's talking about EDITH.

1424
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:10,670
我知道我犯了个错误  我很抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, I know I made a mistake, I'm sorry,

1425
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:12,230
但他不是你想的那样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but he is not who you think he is.

1426
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:14,410
贝克是个骗子  神秘客  元素怪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Beck is a liar. Mysterio, the Elementals,

1427
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:16,730
都是假的  他有种幻景科技
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}it's all fake. He has some illusion tech.

1428
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:19,670
他就是这样骗了你  还骗我把伊迪丝交给了他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And that's how he tricked you guys, and me into giving him EDITH.

1429
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:21,130
这是个投影仪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's a projector.

1430
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:23,700
我从布拉格的火怪身上拽下来的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I pulled it off the fire monster in Prague.

1431
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:27,060
我们看到的一切死亡和毁灭
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So all that death and destruction we witnessed

1432
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:28,690
都是这个假造的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}was created by this?

1433
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:31,330
不  不光是这个  我觉得他在用无人机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, not just this. I think he's using drones.

1434
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:32,810
如果真是如此
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, if this is true,

1435
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:36,270
那贝克就非常危险  我们也得机智应对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}then Beck's very dangerous and we need to be smart.

1436
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:38,040
你还告诉谁了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who else did you tell about this?

1437
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:41,100
帕克  帕克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Parker? Parker!

1438
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:43,760
-怎么了  -贝克  他在这儿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What's wrong? - It's Beck. He's here.

1439
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:46,280
什么  希尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What? Hill?

1440
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,170
不  只是幻...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, it's just an illu...

1441
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:54,990
弗瑞
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Fury!

1442
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:01,780
彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Peter.

1443
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:04,610
我以为我们很要好呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I thought we were close.

1444
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:08,660
弗瑞本就必须死  但你不一样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Fury always had to die, but not you.

1445
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:10,350
别躲了  贝克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Stop hiding, Beck!

1446
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:14,570
我本想帮你离开这一切
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I tried to help you walk away.

1447
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:16,620
这下你逼我不得不动手了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now you're making me do this.

1448
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,280
是你说  你只是个孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You told me, you were just a kid.

1449
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:28,830
是你说  你想去追那姑娘
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You told me, you wanted to run after that girl.

1450
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,210
-救命  -MJ
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Help me! - MJ!

1451
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:32,700
天啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, God!

1452
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:36,680
彼得  怎么回事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Peter, what's going on?

1453
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:38,210
我知道这是假的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I know this isn't real.

1454
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,660
你确定吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Do you, though?

1455
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:41,700
MJ
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}MJ!

1456
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:43,250
MJ
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}MJ!

1457
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,900
我看你分不清真假了  彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't think you know what's real, Peter.

1458
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:03,690
你需要醒过来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You need to wake up!

1459
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,210
看看你自己
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, look at yourself.

1460
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:41,960
你只是个害怕的孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You are just a scared little kid

1461
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,500
穿着件运动衫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}in a sweat suit.

1462
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:46,290
我创造了神秘客
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I created Mysterio

1463
01:19:46,290 --> 01:19:49,980
好给世界一个可以信仰的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}to give the world someone to believe in.

1464
01:19:50,010 --> 01:19:51,530
我控制真相
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I control the truth.

1465
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:54,540
神秘客就是真相
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Mysterio is the truth.

1466
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:19,340
如果你真够好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}If you were good enough,

1467
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,710
或许托尼就不会死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}maybe Tony would still be alive.

1468
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,690
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}安托尼·爱德华·斯塔克

1469
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:38,170
内心深处  你知道我是对的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Deep down, you know I'm right.

1470
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,080
你自己做了选择
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You made your choice.

1471
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,260
你只需要让位
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And all you had to do was step aside.

1472
01:20:54,580 --> 01:20:57,340
现在你...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And now you have...

1473
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:09,930
弗瑞
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Fury.

1474
01:21:11,150 --> 01:21:13,360
贝克的人想找到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Beck's people are trying to find

1475
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:15,510
所有能曝光他们的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}everyone who could expose him.

1476
01:21:16,850 --> 01:21:17,710
你告诉谁了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who'd you tell?

1477
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:19,620
我知道你跟人说了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I know you told someone...

1478
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:20,650
告诉我吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}...so just tell me.

1479
01:21:20,650 --> 01:21:22,310
-好  -你告诉谁了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Okay. - Who did you tell?

1480
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:23,660
你还告诉谁了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who else did you tell?

1481
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:25,590
就我班上的内德和MJ
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Just Ned and MJ from my class.

1482
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:27,020
内德可能告诉他女友贝蒂了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Maybe Ned told his girlfriend Betty,

1483
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:28,040
但没别的了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but that's it.

1484
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:30,430
怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What?

1485
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:33,590
你太好骗了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You are so gullible.

1486
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:35,810
-什么  -虽然很聪明
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What? - I mean, you're smart as a whip.

1487
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:36,830
但是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Just a...

1488
01:21:38,030 --> 01:21:38,980
太好骗了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}...sucker.

1489
01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:41,310
现在你的朋友也都得死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And now all your friends have to die.

1490
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:42,070
天啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, my God.

1491
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,340
骗那些
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's easy to fool people

1492
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:50,260
已经在自我欺骗的人很容易
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}when they're already fooling themselves.

1493
01:21:55,370 --> 01:21:56,760
但不管如何  彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But for what it's worth, Peter,

1494
01:21:58,750 --> 01:21:59,930
我真的很抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I really am sorry.

1495
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:10,930
-伊迪丝  -是  昆廷
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- EDITH. - Yes, Quentin.

读取彼得·帕克班级旅行的资料
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Access files to Peter Parker's class trip.

1497
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:16,450
我要他们在伦敦转机回家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I need them to fly home from London.

1498
01:22:58,430 --> 01:22:59,360
我在哪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Where am I?

1499

城市监禁中心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Municipal holding facility.

1500
01:23:01,970 --> 01:23:04,560
他们说他们在火车场发现了昏迷不醒的你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They said they found you unconscious at the train yard.

1501
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:05,830
很危险啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Very dangerous.

1502
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:06,990
我们给了你件衬衫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And we gave you the shirt

1503
01:23:06,990 --> 01:23:08,830
因为你似乎有点冷
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}because you seemed a bit cold.

1504
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:10,260
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thanks.

1505

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You guys are nice.

1506
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,870
你们的英语说得真好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You speak really good English.

1507

01:25:17,430 --> 01:25:18,380
只有我知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Only I would know.

1537
01:25:20,370 --> 01:25:21,780
记得我们去德国那次吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Remember we went to Germany?

1538
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,870
你在房间点了付费视频
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You pay-per-viewed a video in your room?

1539
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:25,700
他们虽没列出标题  但结账时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They didn't list titles, but I could tell by the price

1540
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:27,520
我一看价钱就知道你看了成人电影
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}it was an adult film at the front destk.

1541
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:28,740
-你还不知道我怎么发现的  -好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- And you didn't know how I knew... - Okay. Okay,

1542
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:30,470
是你  别说了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}fine! It's you. It's you. It's you. Stop.

1543
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:34,720
见到你太好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's so good to see you.

1544
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:38,310
彼得  你得告诉我出了什么事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Peter, you gotta tell me what the hell is going on here.

1545
01:25:39,930 --> 01:25:41,540
好  别动
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, hold still.

1546
01:25:41,710 --> 01:25:42,710
好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}There we go.

1547
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:51,890
你不是有超级怪力吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I thought you had super strength.

1548
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:53,220
还是疼的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It still hurts.

1549
01:25:55,970 --> 01:25:58,080
-哈皮  拜托  -好了  放松
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Happy, come on. - All right, relax.

1550
01:26:00,110 --> 01:26:02,110
-就差几下了  好了  -天啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Just a few more. There we go. - Oh, my God.

1551
01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:04,160
-放松  -别叫我放松  哈皮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Relax. - Don't tell me to relax, Happy!

1552
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,460
我搞砸得这么严重怎么放松
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How can I relax when I messed up so bad?

1553
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:09,550
我信任了贝克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I trusted Beck. Right?

1554
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:10,770
我当他是朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I thought he was my friend.

1555
01:26:10,770 --> 01:26:13,440
我把斯塔克先生留给我的唯一一件东西给了他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So, I gave him the only thing that Mr. Stark left behind for me,

1556
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,480
他现在要杀了我朋友和半个欧洲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and now he's gonna kill my friends and half of Europe,

1557
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:18,330
所以别叫我放松
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}so please do not tell me to relax.

1558
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:22,780
抱歉  哈皮  抱歉  我不该喊的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm sorry, Happy. I'm sorry. I shouldn't shout.

1559
01:26:26,370 --> 01:26:27,630
我就是好想他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I just really miss him.

1560
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,010
我也想他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, I miss him too.

1561
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,480
不管我去哪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Everywhere I go...

1562
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:37,220
都能看到他的脸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I see his face.

1563
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,980
全世界都在问
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And the whole world is asking

1564
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:42,150
谁会做下一个钢铁侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}who's gonna be the next Iron Man... And

1565
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:47,350
我不知道那是不是我  哈皮  我不是钢铁侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't know if that's me, Happy. I'm not Iron Man.

1566
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:51,120
你不是钢铁侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're not Iron Man.

1567
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,040
你也不会成为钢铁侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're never gonna be Iron Man.

1568
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:57,770
没人能达到托尼的境界
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Nobody could live up to Tony.

1569
01:26:58,630 --> 01:26:59,660
托尼都不能
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Not even Tony.

1570
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:02,840
托尼是我最好的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Tony was my best friend.

1571
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:04,720
但他状态很糟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And he was a mess.

1572
01:27:05,290 --> 01:27:06,780
他总质疑自己做的一切
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He second-guessed everything he did.

1573
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:08,340
心里乱得很
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He was all over the place.

1574
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,190
他唯一没质疑过的抉择
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The one thing that he did that he didn't second-guess

1575
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,240
就是选你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}was picking you.

1576
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:16,940
我觉得托尼那么做
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't think Tony would have done what he did

1577
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,530
是因为他知道等他不在了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}if he didn't know that you were gonna be here

1578
01:27:19,530 --> 01:27:20,640
你肯定会挺身而出
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}after he was gone.

1579
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:24,120
你的朋友们有麻烦了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now, your friends are in trouble,

1580
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:27,100
你孤身一人  你的装备不见了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}you're all alone, your tech is missing.

1581
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:30,560
你打算怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What are you gonna do about it?

1582
01:27:36,370 --> 01:27:37,510
我要去扁他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm gonna kick his ass.

1583
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:40,910
我是指现在  我们具体要做什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, right now. Like specifically, what are we gonna do?

1584
01:27:40,910 --> 01:27:42,690
因为我们在一片郁金香花田上空
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Because we've been hovering over a tulip field

1585
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:43,850
悬停15分钟了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}for the last 15 minutes.

1586
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:45,640
好吧  我不能给我的朋友们打电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Right. I can't call my friends

1587
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,030
因为他在追踪他们的手机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}because he's tracking their phones.

1588
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:48,330
把你的手机给我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Give me your phone.

1589
01:27:48,670 --> 01:27:49,820
-我的手机吗  -对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- My cell phone? - Yeah.

1590
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:51,330
好  给
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay. Here.

1591
01:27:51,870 --> 01:27:52,900
你的密码是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What's your password?

1592
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:54,050
"密码"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"Password."

1593
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:55,500
不  你的密码是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, what is your password?

1594
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,380
"密码"这个词
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"Password," Spelled out, password.

1595
01:27:57,380 --> 01:27:58,220
你作为安全主管
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're the head of security,

1596
01:27:58,230 --> 01:27:59,470
居然用"密码"做密码
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and your password is "Password"?

1597
01:27:59,470 --> 01:28:00,780
我也挺不好意思的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't feel good about it either.

1598
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:03,300
大家好  喝杯茶吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hello, governor. Cup of tea for you?

1599
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:04,200
我马上到伦敦了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm gonna be in London soon.

1600
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,970
-他们在伦敦  -伦敦  好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- They're in London. - London, okay.

1601
01:28:05,970 --> 01:28:07,290
我需要套战衣
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, I need a suit.

1602
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,200
战衣
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Suit?

1603
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:30,930
好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, um...

1604

调出关于蜘蛛侠的一切
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}bring up everything you have on Spider-Man.

1605
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:44,420

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, open that. Okay, no, no, no.

1606
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,600
-怎么了  -没事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What? - Nothing.

1607
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:56,640
你搞定战衣  我来搞定音乐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You take care of the suit. I'll take care of the music.

1608
01:29:01,090 --> 01:29:02,780
我好喜欢齐柏林飞艇
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I love Led Zeppelin.

1609
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:10,490
好  调出我的射网器
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, can you pull up my web-shooters?

1610
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:13,390
分离电击蛛网
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Isolate the Taser webs,

1611
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,960
重构  增加电压
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and reconfigure and boost the voltage

1612
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:19,110
增强25%
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}to a factor of 25 percent,

1613
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:22,100
让我完全手控爆炸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and give me complete manual control over detonation.

1614
01:29:25,030 --> 01:29:27,000
我以为克里人的潜伏间谍
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I thought Kree having sleeper cells

1615
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,040
是绝密情报
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}was top secret information.

1616
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:31,300
尼克  卫星监测到了电磁脉冲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Nick, satellites are picking up an EM pulse.

1617
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:32,520
那事不是结束了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I thought that was over.

1618
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:33,810
而且是最大的一波
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's the biggest one yet.

1619
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:35,540
-在哪  -伦敦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Where? - London.

1620
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:38,150
好  各位  旅游公司组织了城市环游
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, guys, the company set up a city tour,

1621
01:29:38,150 --> 01:29:40,480
然后我们吃口饭  就去机场
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and then we'll grab a bite and head to the airport.

1622
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:46,050
没有人打算说说这一切多疯狂吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Is no one else gonna acknowledge how crazy this is?

1623
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:48,420
我懂  这趟科学出游
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, yeah, I get it. There's been nothing scientific

1624
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:50,110
完全不科学
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}about this science tour at all.

1625
01:29:50,110 --> 01:29:51,810
不不  我是在说彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, no, I'm talking about Peter.

1626
01:29:51,810 --> 01:29:53,890
难道没别人注意到他多可疑吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Has no one else here noticed how shady he is?

1627
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:55,530
因为我看到他只穿内裤跟个女人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Because I saw him in the back room of a rest stop

1628
01:29:55,530 --> 01:29:57,590
在一个休息站的后屋里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}with some woman in his underwear,

1629
01:29:57,590 --> 01:29:59,170
而且他总偷偷溜走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and he's always sneaking away,

1630
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:01,200
比如在歌剧院时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}like back at the opera, huh?

1631
01:30:01,210 --> 01:30:02,870
现在他又突然离队
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And, now what, he's suddenly off the trip,

1632
01:30:02,870 --> 01:30:04,580
去柏林找亲戚了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}like with his family in Berlin?

1633
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:07,150
难道没有别人想知道真相吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Is no one else here interested in the truth?

1634
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,710
"客观事实的概念
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"The very concept of objective truth

1635
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:12,170
都在从这世上消失"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}is fading out of the world."

1636
01:30:12,350 --> 01:30:14,440
乔治·奥威尔  谢谢  MJ
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}George Orwell. Thank you, MJ.

1637
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:16,630
是啊  既然彼得不在
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah. Well, I mean, since Peter's not really here

1638
01:30:16,630 --> 01:30:17,770
不能讲出他的事实
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}to tell his truth,

1639
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:19,560
那你的事实呢  布拉德
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}what about you, Brad?

1640
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:21,900
你为什么觉得你可以拍人上厕所的照片
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why do you think it's cool to take pictures of people in the bathroom?

1641
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:23,680
是啊  哥们  那怎么回事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, dude, what's that about?

1642
01:30:23,870 --> 01:30:25,830
不不  不是那样的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, no, no, it wasn't like that. It was...

1643
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:27,290
我是想...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I was trying to take a...

1644
01:30:27,290 --> 01:30:29,560
我们忘记这一切的疯狂吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Let's just put all this craziness behind us

1645
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,740
度过一个美好平和的下午
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and have a nice, peaceful afternoon.

1646
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:36,210
"好啊  哈林顿老师"同学们说  好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"Sounds great, Mr. Harrington," Said the class. Okay.

1647
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:38,900
我现在要做个酷老师
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm gonna be a cool teacher right now.

1648
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:42,260
你别再那么做了  是很奇怪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You gotta stop doing that. Okay? It is weird.

1649
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:43,900
再不许在厕所里拍照了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No more photos in the bathroom.

1650
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:46,190
不管是小便池还是隔间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Urinal or stalls.

1651
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:47,090
-好吗  -看啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Okay? - Look at this.

1652
01:30:47,090 --> 01:30:49,290
哈林顿先生  这是你的大巴
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Mr. Harrington, come on, this is your bus.

1653
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:50,780
我们有自己的大巴呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We got a bus all to ourselves.

1654
01:30:50,780 --> 01:30:52,740
见到你们很高兴  来吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Nice to see you all. Come along.

1655
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:55,080
-给我吧  好  -走吧  谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- I'll get this, yeah? Why not? - Let's go. Thank you.

1656
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,480
嗯  谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah. Thank you, brother.

1657
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:57,890
好的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}All right.

1658
01:30:58,950 --> 01:31:00,090
孩子们接到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I have the kids.

1659
01:31:04,670 --> 01:31:05,970
我尽快赶过来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I got here as fast as I could.

1660
01:31:06,050 --> 01:31:08,660
我把周边扫了一遍  没有发现
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I did a full perimeter sweep. Nothing.

1661
01:31:09,650 --> 01:31:10,540
该死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Damn it.

1662
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,200
脉冲在激增
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Pulse is spiking.

1663
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:15,200
我再去看看
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'll take another look.

1664
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,060
你一看到什么  马上报告
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Soon as you see something, report.

1665
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,370
我们只剩你了  贝克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're all we've got, Beck.

1666
01:31:20,070 --> 01:31:21,300
如果这是我担心的那样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}If this is what I fear,

1667
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:22,680
那上帝保佑我们了  弗瑞
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}then God help us, Fury.

1668
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:24,960
上帝保佑我们所有人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}God help us all.

1669
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,690
好的  没有复仇者来  我们可以开始了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, people, no Avengers coming. We're good to go.

1670
01:31:28,690 --> 01:31:31,440
-威廉  启动无人机  -收到  兄弟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- William, launch the drones. - Copy that, brother.

1671
01:31:31,530 --> 01:31:34,860
无人机进入大气层  武器就绪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Drones are entering the atmosphere weapons-hot.

1672
01:31:40,670 --> 01:31:42,930
-很好  詹妮丝  -还在熨斗篷呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Excellent. Janice? - Still working on the cape.

1673
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:43,880
把褶子都熨平了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You gotta get those wrinkles out.

1674
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:46,050
再过几小时  我真可能要跟女王握手了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}In a few hours, I could literally be shaking hands with the queen.

1675
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:47,670
-古特曼  -马上就位
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Guterman? - Almost in position.

1676
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:49,940
-好  来吧  维多利亚  -增强脉冲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Okay. Hit it, Victoria. - Increasing pulse.

1677
01:31:52,190 --> 01:31:53,140
不管是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Whatever this thing is,

1678
01:31:53,150 --> 01:31:55,350
它比之前的强100倍
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}it's 100 times bigger than the previous ones.

1679
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:56,160
伊迪丝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Edith?

1680
01:31:56,710 --> 01:31:57,650
是  昆廷
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yes, Quentin.

1681
01:31:58,490 --> 01:31:59,950
我要处理的麻烦在哪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Show me my loose ends.

1682
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:01,850
节目一开始
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Once the show's going,

1683
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:03,750
就等我命令执行击杀
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}execute the kill order on my command.

1684
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:04,880
-收到  -好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Copy. - All right.

1685
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:06,100
节目开始
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Start the show.

1686
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:10,080
我们来拯救世界吧  各位
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Let's save the world, people.

1687
01:32:12,490 --> 01:32:14,370
我不喜欢这情况  绝对有问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't like this. Something's definitely up.

1688
01:32:15,290 --> 01:32:18,440
你现在是蛛友了  "蜘蛛侠的朋友"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're an FOS now. "Friend of Spider-Man."

1689
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,970
你得记住  保持冷静
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And you have to remember, just stay calm.

1690
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:26,370
内德  那看上去不妙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Ned, that doesn't look good.

1691
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:29,020
但那是假的  所以不必担心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But it's fake, so, there's nothing to worry about.

1692
01:32:29,030 --> 01:32:32,080
孩子们进入击杀区了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And the kids are in the kill zone.

1693
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:34,270
干得好  古特曼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Great work, Guterman.

1694
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:39,240
-干什么  -我是哈皮  哈皮·霍根
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What? - Happy here. Happy Hogan here.

1695
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:40,380
我知道  你有什么事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I know. What do you want?

1696
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:42,340
斯塔克先生那边在整理东西
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Over at Mr. Stark's, going through his belongings.

1697
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:44,660
你似乎留下了一块冲浪板
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Apparently there was a surfboard you left behind.

1698
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:45,920
-什么  -那边的人说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What? - People over there said

1699
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:47,340
尼克·弗瑞不像冲浪的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}they didn't think Nick Fury was a surfer,

1700
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:48,530
但我说"人不可貌相"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but I said, "Appearances can be deceiving."

1701
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:51,740
不是我的  永远别再打这个号码了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's not mine. And don't ever call this number again.

1702
01:32:57,060 --> 01:32:59,810
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}英国  多赛特海岸

1703
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,500
好  弗瑞听懂暗语了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay. Fury's got the coded message.

1704
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,730
-你的朋友在塔桥上  -好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Your friends are at the Tower Bridge. - Okay.

1705
01:33:04,730 --> 01:33:06,690
你朋友说是伦敦桥  但我还是猜出来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Your boy called it London Bridge, but I figured it out.

1706
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:09,140
-我去接他们  好吗  -好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- I'm gonna go scoop them up, okay? - Yeah.

1707
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:10,200
-我们快到了  -是啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- We're close. - We're close.

1708
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:11,640
-战衣怎么样了  -快好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- How's the suit coming? - Almost done.

1709
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:12,780
-很好  -等等
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Good. - Wait, wait.

1710
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:15,610
你走之前  如果我出事了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Before you go, if something happens to me,

1711
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:17,260
你可以把这个给MJ吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}could you please give this to MJ?

1712
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:19,800
你能安全回来的  到时你自己给她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You are gonna make it back. You'll give it to her yourself.

1713
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,180
-你行的  -我行的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Okay? You got this. - I got this.

1714
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:24,110
-跟我说一遍  -他们用的是幻景科技
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Walk me through it. - I know it's illusion tech, right?

1715
01:33:24,110 --> 01:33:26,150
我只需要进入幻景内部
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}All I do is get on the inside of the illusion,

1716
01:33:26,150 --> 01:33:27,200
我就能击垮它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}then I can take it down,

1717
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:28,760
找到他  而他只是个人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}find him, and he's just a guy.

1718
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:30,300
我可以把伊迪丝夺回来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So, I can take EDITH right back.

1719
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:32,620
好  但上次  你被火车撞了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Right, but last time, you got hit by a train.

1720
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,390
是的  但这次
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}True, but this time...

1721
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:36,830
我怎么解释呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How do I explain this?

1722
01:33:37,530 --> 01:33:39,010
我有种第六感
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I have a sixth sense.

1723
01:33:39,130 --> 01:33:40,160
彼得一激灵
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The Peter-tingle.

1724
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:42,530
你是说那个吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's what you're talking about, right?

1725
01:33:42,690 --> 01:33:43,690
但现在不好使
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's not working, though.

1726
01:33:43,690 --> 01:33:45,790
我听说现在不好使了  是吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I heard it wasn't working right now. Is it?

1727
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:46,570
是好使的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It is working.

1728
01:33:46,570 --> 01:33:48,050
-我不知道好不好...  -好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- I don't know if it's working... - Good.

1729
01:33:48,050 --> 01:33:50,090
好  你有彼得一激灵  这就是你的计划
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay. You got the Peter-tingle. That's the plan.

1730
01:33:50,090 --> 01:33:51,330
我去接你的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm gonna go get your friends.

1731
01:33:51,430 --> 01:33:53,200
你让你的彼得一激灵重新上线
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You get that Peter-tingle back online.

1732
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:55,320
我行的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I got this. I got this.

1733
01:34:09,450 --> 01:34:10,580
闪电开始
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Cue the lightning.

1734
01:34:10,790 --> 01:34:12,050
闪电开始
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Cuing lightning.

1735
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,310
先生  上面还安全吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Sir, is it still safe on the top,

1736
01:34:19,310 --> 01:34:21,700
还是我们该下来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}or should we all come down?

1737
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:22,440
天啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, my.

1738
01:34:24,610 --> 01:34:25,840
大巴司机怎么说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What did the bus driver say?

1739
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,290
大巴司机不见了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Bus driver's gone.

1740
01:34:27,630 --> 01:34:28,990
-什么  -去哪了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What? - Where?

1741
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:31,810
没事的  戴尔老师和我能控制局面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's okay. Mr. Dell and I have it under control!

1742
01:34:31,810 --> 01:34:33,740
不  别把我拉进来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No. Don't drag me into this.

1743
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:35,610
我已经尽力了  朱利亚斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm doing my best, Julius!

1744
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:38,460
-听着  -又是巫术
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Look... - Oh, the witches are back.

1745
01:34:38,530 --> 01:34:40,680
天啊  快下车
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, my God, get off the bus!

1746
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:48,120
好  跟我来  孩子们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, follow me, kids.

1747
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:52,230
来  快走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Come on, let's go!

1748
01:35:05,530 --> 01:35:08,200
这才是复仇者级别的威胁呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now, that is an Avengers-level threat.

1749
01:35:24,910 --> 01:35:26,350
这边走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This way. This way!

1750
01:35:26,610 --> 01:35:28,280
-好  -天啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Okay. Okay. - Oh, my God!

1751
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:29,900
-弗拉士  -跟着手走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Flash! - Follow that hand.

1752
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:31,550
这边走  跟我来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This way. Follow me.

1753
01:35:31,770 --> 01:35:33,310
这都不是真的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's not real, it's not real!

1754
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:34,950
我看可挺真的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, it looks pretty real to me!

1755
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:36,300
跟我来  孩子们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Follow me, kids!

1756
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:39,670
地  风  火  水  不
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Earth, wind, fire, water. Oh, no.

1757
01:35:39,670 --> 01:35:41,710
他们合体了  就像超能战士
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They joined forces like the Power Rangers.

1758
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,630
-那是战神金刚  -什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- You're thinking of Voltron. - Who?

1759
01:35:43,630 --> 01:35:45,500
你想的是战神金刚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Voltron! You're thinking of Voltron!

1760
01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:47,180
看  是神秘客
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, look, it's Mysterio!

1761
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:48,450
他会救我们的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's gonna save us!

1762
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:53,660
等等  如果神秘客知道我们知道了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Wait, if Mysterio knows we know...

1763
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:55,970
-我们就危险了  -对  他们也是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Then we're in danger. - Yeah, and so are they.

1764
01:35:55,970 --> 01:35:56,800
我们走吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We should go.

1765
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,230
灭了那巫术
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Kill that witch! Ba-bow!

1766
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:04,300
这是为了我家人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This is for my family!

1767
01:36:05,950 --> 01:36:07,450
你该去安全的地方  弗瑞
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You should get somewhere safe, Fury.

1768
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:09,440
我觉得这事不会有好结局的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't see this ending well.

1769
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:11,070
多谢你关心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I appreciate your concern,

1770
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:13,780
但我绝不会丢下战友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but I never leave my men behind.

1771
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:17,130
好  通讯检查  听到吗  孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}All right, comms check. Can you hear me, kid?

1772
01:36:17,130 --> 01:36:19,120
能听到  就是外面有点吵
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah. I can. It's a little loud out here.

1773
01:36:19,130 --> 01:36:20,890
-新战衣不错  -谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- I like the new suit. - Thanks.

1774
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,060
彼得  你确定那不是真的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Peter, you sure that's not real?

1775
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:25,780
嗯  但比我想的要大100倍
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, it's just 100 times bigger than I expected.

1776
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:26,770
还是原计划
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Still the play?

1777
01:36:27,150 --> 01:36:28,100
我们得升高些
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We need to get high enough

1778
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:29,790
以确保贝克不会看到我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}so Beck doesn't see me coming.

1779
01:36:29,810 --> 01:36:31,720
收到  粘住了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Copy. Stay sticky.

1780
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:36,840
-哈皮  -孩子  怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Happy. - Yeah, kid. What is it?

1781
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:39,920
我们得认真地谈谈你和我婶婶的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We need to have a serious conversation about you and my aunt!

1782
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,160
贝克  报告
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Beck, report!

1783
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:58,260
古特曼  我需要个回应
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Guterman, I need a response.

1784
01:36:58,260 --> 01:36:58,910
快点  果决点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Something quick and decisive.

1785
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:00,560
"是所有那些元素怪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"It's all the Elementals.

1786
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,350
它们不知怎么融合成了..."
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They're somehow merged into something..."

1787
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:04,540
...成了别的东西  要强大得多
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}...into something else. Something more powerful.

1788
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:06,600
它在汲取地球核心的能量
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's drawing energy from the Earth's core.

1789
01:37:11,610 --> 01:37:13,200
这太扯了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}See, now, that's some bullshit.

1790
01:37:17,050 --> 01:37:17,740
那是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Is that...?

1791
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:23,820
做好万全准备
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Be ready for anything.

1792
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:24,960
好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

1793
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:33,190
不是真的  不是真的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's not real, it's not real, it's not real!

1794
01:37:40,190 --> 01:37:41,290
太赞了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's awesome.

1795
01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:09,370
威廉  有无人机脱离阵型了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}William, I've got drones breaking formation.

1796
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:11,780
可能是撞了鸟群  没事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Maybe they hit a flock of birds. You're fine.

1797
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:14,070
我要看里面什么情况  我要手动控制
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I wanna see what's happening there, I'm taking manual control.

1798
01:38:20,550 --> 01:38:21,600
你看到什么了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Do you see anything?

1799
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:23,370
看到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

1800
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:25,680
我要杀了他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I'm gonna kill him.

1801
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:31,790
希望成功
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I hope this works.

1802
01:38:48,470 --> 01:38:49,330
你在吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You got me?

1803
01:38:54,510 --> 01:38:55,320
我罩你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I got you.

1804
01:38:56,020 --> 01:38:58,120
老板  幻景被破坏了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Boss, the illusion is coming apart.

1805
01:39:01,450 --> 01:39:02,320
我看到你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I see you.

1806
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:08,830
-伊迪丝  保护我  -收到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- EDITH, give me some protection. - Copy.

1807
01:39:23,630 --> 01:39:24,890
中止幻景  中止
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Kill it. Just kill the illusion. Kill it.

1808
01:39:24,890 --> 01:39:26,270
不  不能中止  他们会看到的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, I'm not gonna kill it. They'll see.

1809
01:39:26,270 --> 01:39:28,990
我要他们看到什么他们就会看到什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They'll see what I want them to see!

1810
01:39:28,990 --> 01:39:31,110
-你还需要斗篷吗  -是的  詹妮丝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Do you still need the cape? - Yes, Janice.

1811
01:39:31,990 --> 01:39:34,170
-我还要斗篷  -好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- I still need the cape. - Done.

1812

-威廉  渲染我的幻景战衣  -好  等等
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Now William render my illusion suit. - All right, hang on.

1813
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:41,690
怪物里都是无人机  简直疯了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The monster was full of drones! It's crazy!

1814
01:39:41,690 --> 01:39:42,770
你在那里呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}There you are.

1815
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:47,690
慢慢来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Easy.

1816
01:39:51,870 --> 01:39:53,390
那是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who the hell is that?

1817
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:56,120
-内德  -哈皮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Ned! - Happy!

1818
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:57,970
我得带你们离开
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I gotta get you guys out of here!

1819
01:39:57,970 --> 01:39:59,410
-上飞机  -你是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Get on the jet! - Who are you?

1820
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:01,650
我跟蜘蛛侠共事  你们得上飞机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I work with Spider-Man. Okay? You gotta get on that jet.

1821
01:40:01,660 --> 01:40:02,670
你为蜘蛛侠工作
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You work for Spider-Man?

1822
01:40:02,670 --> 01:40:04,950
是跟蜘蛛侠共事  不是为他工作
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I work with Spider-Man, not for Spider-Man.

1823
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:10,520
-新计划  进塔楼  -什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- New plan. Into the Tower. - What?

1824
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:11,600
哈皮  你没事吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Happy, are you okay?

1825
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:13,410
我们没事  去抓贝克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah. We're okay. Just get Beck.

1826
01:40:13,410 --> 01:40:15,730
-伊迪丝  目标是蜘蛛侠  -收到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- EDITH, target Spider-Man. - Copy.

1827
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:22,140
我自己杀那些孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'll just kill the kids myself.

1828
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:38,470
你们在这儿呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}There you are.

1829
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:42,680
进王冠权杖密室
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Into the Crown Jewels vault!

1830
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:45,030
-好  快走  -快走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Yeah, go, go, go! - Come on.

1833
01:40:52,270 --> 01:40:53,770
-什么  -进密室  快去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What? - Into the vault. Go!

1834
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:57,380
找掩护
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Take cover!

1835
01:41:16,610 --> 01:41:17,350
好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay.

1836
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:23,210
行吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah?

1837
01:41:23,470 --> 01:41:25,570
不  不要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No. No.

1838
01:41:29,370 --> 01:41:30,670
我看到你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I see you.

1839
01:41:33,070 --> 01:41:34,260
拿开那玩意
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Get that thing out...

1840
01:41:39,230 --> 01:41:39,890
快走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Go!

1841
01:41:47,450 --> 01:41:48,960
美队怎么做到的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How does Cap do that?

1842
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:02,130
哈皮  说话  告诉我你们还活着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Happy, say something, please, to let me know you're alive!

1843
01:42:02,190 --> 01:42:04,650
-我在  -哈皮  谢天谢地
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- I'm here. I'm here. - Happy, thank God.

1844
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,870
我为我们争取到了时间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I bought us some time,

1845
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:08,400
但不多
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but not much.

1846
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:11,210
我想靠近贝克  但我无法摆脱这些无人机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm trying to get to Beck, but I can't shake these drones!

1847
01:42:26,070 --> 01:42:26,830
找到你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Gotcha.

1848
01:42:49,310 --> 01:42:50,460
上去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Going up!

1849
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:28,550
可算
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Finally.

1850
01:43:28,930 --> 01:43:30,580
威廉  情况怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}William, how we doing?

1851
01:43:30,580 --> 01:43:32,450
幻景几乎重建完毕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Illusion almost back up.

1852
01:43:33,150 --> 01:43:34,920
我不知道你要怎么把这事圆回来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't know how you're gonna spin this.

1853
01:43:49,850 --> 01:43:51,540
好啊  没网了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, great. No webs.

1854
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:07,440
-我们要死了吗  -有我在没人会死的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Are we gonna die? - Nobody dies on my watch.

1855
01:44:09,930 --> 01:44:11,660
我的人生都浪费在打电游上了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I wasted my life playing video games,

1856
01:44:11,660 --> 01:44:12,970
我们就要死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and we're gonna die.

1857
01:44:13,660 --> 01:44:14,950
我有个假身份证
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I have a fake ID,

1858
01:44:15,450 --> 01:44:16,860
可我都没用过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and I've never even used it.

1859
01:44:17,490 --> 01:44:20,720
我每天都发蠢视频  就希望大家喜欢我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I post stupid videos daily for people to like me.

1860
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:22,790
要不是你的蠢视频
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}If it wasn't for those stupid videos,

1861
01:44:22,930 --> 01:44:24,590
蜘蛛侠就不可能找到你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Spider-Man would've never found you.

1862
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:27,130
蜘蛛侠...关注我吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Spider-Man...? Spider-Man follows me?

1863
01:44:27,810 --> 01:44:28,870
是我救了我们  各位
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I saved us, guys.

1864
01:44:28,870 --> 01:44:30,600
如果你救了我们  那我们怎么还是要死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}If you saved us, then why are we about to die?

1865
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:31,960
-MJ  -别说了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- MJ! - Stop it!

1866
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:33,480
对不起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm sorry, okay?

1867
01:44:33,530 --> 01:44:35,050
我执迷于说真话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's just, I'm obsessed with telling the truth

1868
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:37,060
哪怕这伤了其他人的感情
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}even if it hurts other people's feelings.

1869
01:44:38,230 --> 01:44:39,890
我爱上了蜘蛛侠的婶婶
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm in love with Spider-Man's aunt.

1870
01:44:44,050 --> 01:44:45,370
我们不是在分享心里话吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We're sharing, right?

1871
01:45:24,590 --> 01:45:26,150
你的谎言结束了  贝克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Your lies are over, Beck.

1872
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:30,680
这的确不理想  但我还有应急措施
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This certainly isn't ideal, but I have contingencies.

1873
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:31,520
伊迪丝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Edith?

1874
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,810
把眼镜给我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Just give me the glasses.

1875
01:45:42,650 --> 01:45:43,690
你要这个吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You want these?

1876
01:45:45,990 --> 01:45:47,150
来拿啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Come and get them.

1877
01:45:57,100 --> 01:45:58,530
上线吧  彼得一激灵
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Come on, Peter-tingle.

1878
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:24,660
这些无人机怎么不开火
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why aren't these drones firing?

1879
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:26,040
你处在射击范围内
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're in the strike zone.

1880
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:27,120
-你可能被击中  -不
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- The chance of getting hit is... - No,

1881
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:31,020
所有无人机马上开火

1883
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:55,210
贝克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Beck.

1884
01:46:56,260 --> 01:46:57,340
你骗了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You lied to me.

1885

我还信任了你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I trusted you.

1886

我知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I know.

1887
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:02,300
那是最...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's the most...

1888
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:04,820
让人失望的部分
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}d-disappointing part.

1889
01:47:06,570 --> 01:47:08,180
你是个好人  彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're a good person, Peter.

1890
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:12,220
真是个弱点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Such a weakness.

1891
01:47:14,610 --> 01:47:15,690
斯塔克是对的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Stark was right.

1892
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:18,070
这是你应得的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You do deserve them.

1893
01:47:30,050 --> 01:47:31,540
你再骗不了我了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You can't trick me anymore.

1894
01:47:35,540 --> 01:47:37,070
伊迪丝  关闭无人机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}EDITH, turn off the drones.

1895
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:41,600
生物识别扫描完成  欢迎回来  彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Biometric scan complete. Welcome back, Peter.

1896
01:47:41,660 --> 01:47:43,970
是否执行全部取消协议
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Shall I execute all cancellation protocols?

1897
01:47:43,970 --> 01:47:44,630
做吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Just do it.

1898
01:47:44,630 --> 01:47:46,730
-全部执行  -确认
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Execute them all. - Confirmed.

1899
01:47:55,780 --> 01:47:56,580
矛给我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Give me the spear.

1900
01:47:58,150 --> 01:47:59,190
那是戟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's a halberd.

1901
01:48:04,410 --> 01:48:05,110
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thank you.

1902
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:11,110
你怎么能做这么多坏事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How could you do all of this?

1903
01:48:12,030 --> 01:48:13,280
你会懂的  彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You'll see, Peter.

1904
01:48:14,590 --> 01:48:17,650
人们需要相信
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}People, they need to believe.

1905
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:20,630
如今
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And nowadays...

1906
01:48:23,050 --> 01:48:24,680
他们什么都肯信
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}they'll believe anything.

1907
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:36,430
他...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Is he...?

1908
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:39,300
这是真的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Is this real?

1909
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:42,860
幻景都停止了  彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}All illusions are down, Peter.

太好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah!

1912
01:48:59,790 --> 01:49:00,610
你去哪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Where you going?

1913
01:49:09,170 --> 01:49:09,850
MJ
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}MJ.

1914
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:13,960
-你没事吧  -我没事  你没事吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Are you okay? - I'm okay. Are you okay?

1915

01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:17,790
嗯  大家都没事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, everyone's okay.

1917
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:21,930
-怎么回事  -无人机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What happened? - There was just the drones,

1918
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:24,640
它们本来跟着我们  然后突然就停了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and they were following us, and then they just stopped.

1919
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:27,980
-是你停止了它们吗  -对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Was that you? - Yeah.

1920
01:49:29,610 --> 01:49:30,410
你抓到他了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Did you get him?

1921
01:49:33,870 --> 01:49:35,780
-嗯  -我...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Yeah. - Well, I, um...

1922
01:49:37,030 --> 01:49:37,810
带来了那个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}brought that.

1923
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:40,580
以防你还需要帮助
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}In case you needed some help.

1924
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:41,960
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thanks.

1925
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:45,920
总之
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Anyway, uh,

1926
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:49,020
有个汗津津的家伙跟我们一起在塔楼里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}there was this sweaty guy in the tower with us.

1927
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:51,060
他好像是为你工作
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I think he's like, works for you or something.

1928
01:49:51,590 --> 01:49:52,290
他...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He, um...

1929
01:49:53,130 --> 01:49:54,150
他给了我这个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He gave me this.

1930
01:49:54,550 --> 01:49:56,920
不不
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No. No.

1931
01:49:58,190 --> 01:49:59,680
MJ  真抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}MJ, I'm so sorry.

1932
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:01,660
-我有个计划的  很傻  -彼得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- I had this plan. I had this stupid plan. - Peter.

1933
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:03,470
我都写下来了  我打算给你买下这个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I wrote it all down, and I was gonna buy you this

1934
01:50:03,470 --> 01:50:05,260
然后去巴黎送你  在...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and give it to you in Paris at the top...

1935
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:10,430
你吻了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And you kissed me.

1936
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:12,460
-什么  -是啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What? What? - Yeah.

1937
01:50:13,420 --> 01:50:15,250
我在跟人亲近上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't really have much luck

1938
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:17,520
不怎么走运
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}when it comes to getting close to people.

1939
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:20,760
所以我撒谎了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So I lied.

1940
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:24,400
我看你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I wasn't just watching you

1941
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:27,010
不仅仅是因为我猜到你蜘蛛侠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}because I thought you were Spider-Man.

1942
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:32,510
太好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's great.

1943
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:36,990
-黑色大丽花  就像拿起谋杀案  -谋杀案
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Black dahlia, like the murder. - The murder.

1944
01:50:36,990 --> 01:50:37,700
-好  -是啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Good. - Yeah.

1945
01:50:39,210 --> 01:50:40,540
抱歉都坏了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Sorry it's broken.

1946
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:42,960
我更喜欢坏掉的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I actually like it better broken.

1947
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:46,160
我真的好喜欢你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I really like you.

1948
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:48,950
我也真的好喜欢你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I really like you too.

1949
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:05,250
好  那我...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay. I should...

1950
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:08,450
我回去找同学们了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I should probably get back to the class.

1951
01:51:08,450 --> 01:51:09,230
我去...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'll go and...

1952
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:12,930
-嗯  我也不知道  -好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Yeah. Heh. I don't know. - Heh. Okay.

1953
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:15,690
以防万一
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Just in case.

1954
01:51:23,870 --> 01:51:24,960
不
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, no.

1955
01:51:25,390 --> 01:51:26,290
不  梅  你是对的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, May, you're right.

1956
01:51:26,290 --> 01:51:28,250
他干得很棒  他很坚强
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He did great. He was strong.

1957
01:51:28,730 --> 01:51:30,880
对  我也很高兴他留下了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah. I'm glad he stayed too.

1958
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:32,060
我得挂了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I gotta go.

1959
01:51:33,790 --> 01:51:34,990
很高兴你还活着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, I'm glad you're alive.

1960
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:36,710
看来那句暗语起作用了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I guess the coded message worked.

1961
01:51:36,710 --> 01:51:38,790
"人不可貌相"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"Appearances can be deceiving."

1962
01:51:39,650 --> 01:51:42,070
你怎么不直接冲镜头眨眼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm surprised you didn't just wink in the camera.

1963
01:51:42,070 --> 01:51:44,680
-你不是懂了  -那也是因为我一开始
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- It worked. - Only because I had serious doubts

1964
01:51:44,690 --> 01:51:45,870
就对贝克持有很深的怀疑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}about Beck from the beginning.

1965
01:51:45,870 --> 01:51:47,560
才不是  他完全信了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Not true. He had zero doubts.

1966
01:51:51,130 --> 01:51:52,140
帕克呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Where's Parker?

1967
01:51:52,570 --> 01:51:53,470
他跟个姑娘在一起呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's with a girl.

1968
01:51:53,550 --> 01:51:55,890
我需要跟他谈谈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I need to speak with him.

1969
01:51:56,910 --> 01:51:57,670
他会联系你的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He'll call you.

1970
01:51:58,150 --> 01:51:58,840
他...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He'll...?

1971
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:05,140
好啊  好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay. Great.

1972
01:52:05,590 --> 01:52:06,490
他最好联系我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, he better.

1973
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:08,520
否则我拿你是问
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Or it's your ass.

1974
01:52:09,740 --> 01:52:12,530
你可别想跟我玩消失
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And don't even think about ghosting me.

1975
01:52:27,830 --> 01:52:29,710
{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}新泽西  纽瓦克

1976
01:52:30,050 --> 01:52:31,750
你确定没有别人发现吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Are you sure no one else has figured it out?

1977
01:52:31,790 --> 01:52:34,900
确定  反正也没别人注意你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, I mean, it's not like anybody really pays attention to you.

1978
01:52:35,970 --> 01:52:36,700
扎心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Ouch.

1979
01:52:37,170 --> 01:52:38,410
除了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Except for me.

1980
01:52:39,180 --> 01:52:39,890
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thanks.

1981
01:52:40,150 --> 01:52:41,710
-别迟到  -我不会的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Don't be late. - I won't.

1982
01:52:41,710 --> 01:52:42,500
回见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}See you later.

1983
01:52:42,780 --> 01:52:45,480
-你们好可爱  -谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- You guys are so cute. - Thanks.

1984
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:48,650
我还想  或许我们可以
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I was thinking that maybe we should all,

1985
01:52:49,110 --> 01:52:51,080
比如说  一起去双人约会什么的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't know, like go on a double date or something.

1986
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:53,220
我们分手了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We broke up.

1987
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:54,990
不  怎么了  为什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No. What? Why?

1988
01:52:54,990 --> 01:52:56,850
男人和女人会渐渐疏远
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Men and women grow apart,

1989
01:52:57,420 --> 01:52:59,100
但他们所共同经历的旅程
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but the journey they share together

1990
01:52:59,110 --> 01:53:00,680
将永远成为他们的一部分
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}will always be a part of them.

1991
01:53:02,170 --> 01:53:04,360
-你好睿智  -谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- You are so wise. - Thank you.

1992
01:53:07,510 --> 01:53:08,490
你好  杰拉德
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hello, Gerald.

{\an8\bord1\fs18\b1}汤普森

1994
01:53:09,690 --> 01:53:11,240
妈妈不能来吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Could Mother not make it?

1995
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:19,150
-梅  -我保证...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- May! - I promise you...

1996
01:53:19,290 --> 01:53:21,200
他来了  别给我开罚单
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's here. Don't give me a ticket.

1997
01:53:23,610 --> 01:53:25,460
你没事太好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm so glad you're okay.

1998
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:28,890
真的  我没事  我真的很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, for real, I'm good. I'm actually really fine.

1999
01:53:28,890 --> 01:53:30,670
走吧  你的包呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Let's go. Where are your bags?

2000
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:32,120
对啊  被炸飞了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, right. They got blown up.

2001
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:32,980
是啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

2002
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:35,320
我给你买了热奶油百吉饼

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I kept my identity pretty guarded this past couple years.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I'm tired of the lies.

2007
01:53:45,510 --> 01:53:47,810
所以该说出实话了

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yes, that evolves and grows like any other.

2013

我还不确定会向什么方向发展
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I still don't know where it's going to go.

2014

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- On or off. - To share it with people...

2017

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm gonna go because I've got a date.
