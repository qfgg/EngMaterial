15
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,520
安静
Quiet!

16
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,500
你是什么东西
What are you?

17
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,390
你是恶魔
You're a demon!

18
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,390
不  不  我不是恶魔
No, no. I'm not a demon.

19
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,890
我不是恶魔
I'm not a demon.

20
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,720
看  只是个普通人
See? Just a guy.

21
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,430
只是一个来救这些龙的普通人  所以...
Just a guy here to rescue these dragons, so, uh...

22
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,800
-但你从火里走了出来  -龙鳞
- But you walked through fire! - Dragon scales!

23
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,030
龙经常会掉鳞
Dragons shed a lot.

24
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,030
不  我一看到恶魔就能认出来
No, I know a demon when I see one.

25
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,570
人腿不可能这么细
No human legs are that skinny.

26
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,100
你这叫什么闪亮登场  看看我的
Think that's a good entrance? Get a load of me.

27
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,810
我就知道  还有更多的恶魔
I knew it! More demons!

28
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,380
不  这只是一个
Ah, it's really just a nitwit

29
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,680
忘记给屁股涂防火层的蠢蛋
who forgot to fireproof his butt.

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,010
烫烫烫烫
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

31
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,720
伙计们  别  先别下来
Guys, no, not yet!

32
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,890
瞧好了  本大爷是你最可怕的噩梦
Behold, your worst nightmare. Behold.

33
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,590
还有我坚持要跟过来的妹妹
Along with his sister, who insisted on coming.

34
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,120
你就这么介绍我吗
That's my intro?

35
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,660
伙计们  太早了  你们总是登场太早了
Guys, too soon. You always come in too soon.

36
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,500
抱歉  我还在习惯我的翅膀
Sorry, still getting the hang of my wings.

37
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,370
鱼脚司  你又带宝宝来了
Fishlegs, again with the baby?

38
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,570
-这是偷袭  -我找不到保姆
- This is a raid. - I couldn't find a sitter.

39
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,570
到处都是恶魔
Demons everywhere!

40
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,670
世界要末日了
It's the end of the world!

41
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,440
阿斯翠德  我本来把他都安排好了
Astrid. I had him right where I wanted him.

42
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,550
现在我把他安排好了
And now he's right where I wanted him.

43
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,720
开工吧
Let's get to work.

44
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,620
好吧  看来偷袭是没戏了
Okay, we screwed that up,

45
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,950
但是至少没人知道我们在这里
but at least nobody else knows we're here.

46
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,590
放松点  丫头  没事的
Easy, girl. It's okay.

47
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,460
我们会带你离开这里
We're gonna get you out of here.

48
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,830
猩红长角龙
A Crimson Goregutter!

49
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,540
看看这个怪家伙
Look at this weirdo.

50
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,080
它肯定超级蠢
Bet it's super-dumb.

51
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,710
我为什么打不开这个笼子
Why can't I get this cage open?

52
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,050
因为得滑开
It slides.

53
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,520
显然嘛
Obviously.

54
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,150
入侵者
Attack!

55
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,150
-带救出来的龙离开这里  -抓住那头夜煞
- Get the rescues out of here! - Get that Night Fury!

56
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,530
甲板上不得跑动
No running on the deck!

57
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,030
很滑  会摔倒的
It's slippery. You could fall.

58
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,700
让开  让我来对付这些难缠的家伙
Step aside! Let me handle the tough guy stuff.

59
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,640
我干掉两个
Yeah! That's two for me.

60
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,010
小心
Look out!

61
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,040
-不不不不  -对不起
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no! - Sorry!

62
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,950
谢谢你
Thank you.

63
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,960
快去救出其他人  伙计
Now, go get the rest, bud.

64
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,090
我还以为这是偷袭呢
I thought this was supposed to be a stealth mission.

65
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,730
他们总是搞成那样
Yeah, they always start that way.

66
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,930
小心
Look out!

67
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,970
谢谢  风里飞
Thanks, Stormfly!

68
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,840
别担心
Oh, stop worrying.

69
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,510
他们会成功的
They'll get it.

70
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,080
最终会的
Eventually.

71
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,480
撤退  全部救出来了
Move out! We got 'em all.

72
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,620
我要把你们一个个锁头
I'm gonna headlock every last one of you.

73
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,820
-快走  快走  -菜鸟
- Let's go, let's go, let's go! - Amateurs.

74
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,790
-我才刚开始热身呢  -大家撤退
- I was just getting started. - Clear out, guys!

75
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,120
快走
Go, go!

76
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,060
别让他们跑了
Don't let them get away!

77
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,700
祝你们一无所获  伙计们
Good hustle, boys!

78
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,740
没牙仔  该走了
Toothless, time to go!

79
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,910
伙计们
Hey, guys.

80
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,720
你永远是我的后盾  伙计
You always have my back, bud.

81
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:32,210
这里是伯克岛  你们离家后的新家
This is Berk, your new home away from home.

82
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,580
这是一个非常完美
A stunning, one-stop,

83
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,280
花销全免的一站式梦中之地
all-expense-paid dream destination.

84
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,580
安顿下来  打消你们的担忧
So, settle in and let your worries melt away.

85
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,720
这里服务到位  菜品火爆
The service here soars, the cuisine is fiery...

86
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,330
当地居民还非常五彩纷呈
...and the locals are as colorful as you get.

87
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,300
所有自称的度假天堂都自吹有海滩和阳光
Any run-of-the-mill paradise boasts beaches and sunshine.

88
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,900
我们不会
Well, not us.

89
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,340
我们有其他人根本触及不到的东西
We've got something no one else can touch.

90
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,870
朋友们  我们有龙  让一让
We, my friend, have dragons. Make room!

91
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,870
他们来了
They're coming!

92
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,640
很多很多龙
Lots and lots of dragons.

93
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,590
伙计们  来认识一下新来的柏克岛民
Gang, meet our latest Berkians.

94
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,690
欢迎来到天堂  伙计
Welcome to paradise, mate.

95
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,630
-我们的家就是你们的家  -真是个可人儿
- Our home is your home. - Well, aren't you a beauty!

96
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,160
不客气  不客气
Ah, you're welcome. You're welcome.

97
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,030
我可是干掉了一百个捕龙猎手
I took on, like, a hundred trappers.

98
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,370
一千个捕龙猎手
A-a thousand trappers.

99
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,200
穿着冒火的内裤
All with burning undies.

100
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,200
我满脸浓密的胡子差点着火呢
My thick, full beard almost caught on fire.

101
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,970
别说了
Ugh. Just-just stop.

102
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,310
小嗝嗝的妈妈
So, uh, Hiccup's mom,

103
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,110
对我的裂骨攻击有什么评价吗
any notes on my bone-crushing assault,

104
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,010
是不是近乎完美
or was it pretty much perfect?

105
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,750
简直难以形容
Oh, it was indescribable.

106
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,720
叫我瓦尔卡吧  都一年了
And please, call me Valka. It has been a year.

107
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,850
亲密到能直呼姓名了
First-name basis.

108
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,050
我觉得今天真正的英雄是没牙仔
I think the real hero of the day was Toothless.

109
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,760
对吧  伙计
Isn't that right, bud?

110
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,290
要是没有你我们该怎么办呢  龙族之王
What would we do without you, oh, king of dragons?

111
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,990
我们该怎么办呢
What would we do?

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,630
首先  我们可以多勤加训练
Well, we could train a lot harder, for one.

113
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,300
刚刚真是太松散了
That was pretty sloppy.

114
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,100
阿斯翠德说得有道理
Astrid, uh, does have a point.

115
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,710
也许你们都有点太依赖于你们的龙
Perhaps you all rely a little bit too much on your dragons

116
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,840
彼此之间的合作反而不够了
and not enough on one another.

117
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,340
看  我就是这么说的嘛
See? That's exactly what I was saying.

118
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,340
你们都得好好听啊  伙计们
Just listen up, guys.

119
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,880
你妈妈超级喜欢我
Yeah, your mom's super impressed with me.

120
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,680
她简直恨不得认我当儿子
I'm like the son she always wanted.

121
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,910
鱼肉仔
Fishmeat.

122
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,890
你有新朋友了
You found a new friend.

123
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,700
小心头
Mind your heads!

124
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,280
要是龙族之王在这里却不维护好秩序
What good is having the king of dragons around

125
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,150
那有什么用
if he can't keep the order?

126
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,920
伙计  你想做点什么还是...
Hey, bud, do you want to do something here or...?

127
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,260
你指望我们把这些家伙安置在哪里
And where do you suppose we put these ones?

128
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,760
我们能腾出空间的
Ah, we'll make room.

129
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,170
你竟然带回来一只胡瓜龙
You brought back a Hobgobbler!

130
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,340
这是噩兆  我们被诅咒了
They're a bad omen. We're cursed.

131
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,870
胡说
Nonsense.

132
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,440
他能做出什么乱子
What harm could he do?

133
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,540
完全无害
No injuries.

134
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,440
肉有点颤  但是很健康
They're all a little shaken but otherwise healthy.

135
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,480
有谁饿了吗
Now, who's hungry?

136
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,950
我的重点是  你不能老是把龙带回到这里
Point is you can't keep bringing dragons back here.

137
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,960
拜托  伙计
Come on, boy.

138
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,490
你这只是在自找麻烦
You're just asking for trouble.

139
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,260
不行  你这个小贼
No, you don't, you little thief!

140
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,800
那些捕龙者们离我们越来越近
Those trappers are getting closer by the day.

141
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,960
我们能对付他们  我们有领头龙
We can handle them. We have the alpha.

142
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,470
是吗  伙计
Ain't that right, bud?

143
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,230
你看他们多开心啊
Would you look at how happy they are?

144
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,970
她好棒
She's awesome.

145
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,340
戈伯  放松  我们成功做到了
Gobber, relax. We did it.

146
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,940
这里是全世界第一个龙与维京人的乌托邦
The world's first dragon-Viking utopia.

147
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,480
我们让梦想成真了
We made the dream a reality.

148
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,850
这也许是你的梦想  我的梦想没有那么拥挤  更...
Your dream maybe. Mine's less crowded and more...

149
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,380
卫生一点
...sanitary.

150
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,290
戈伯  你骗不了别人
Gobber, you're not fooling anybody.

151
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,520
我知道你也爱他们
I know you love them.

152
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,290
你们这一代应该带领我们
You're supposed to be the generation

153
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,760
走向未来的
that leads us into the future.

154
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,770
食物大战
Food fight!

155
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,100
真美啊
Ooh, gorgeous.

156
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,100
-别弄乱我头发  -乖鱼肉仔
- Watch the hair! - Good, Fishmeat.

157
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,940
-上帝啊  -正中眉心
- Ugh! God help us. - Right between the eyes!

158
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,550
是时候先不要再担心外面的问题
Time to stop worrying about problems out there...

159
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,550
-戈伯  -先处理好这里的问题
- Gobber. - ...and start sorting out the ones right here.

160
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,010
好吧  好吧
Okay, okay.

161
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,250
我会好好考虑的
I-I'll think about it.

162
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,050
拉住鞍  先结婚
Hang up those saddles and get married.

163
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,390
结婚
The "M" word.

164
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,490
真恶心  除非是我结婚
Gross. Unless it's me.

165
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,990
像一对正式的王族夫妇般统治这里
Start ruling like a proper royal couple.

166
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,530
嫁给他吧  拜托
Marry him, please.

167
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,900
你是这里唯一一个还有点理智的人
You're the only one with any sense around here.

168
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,130
要是交给你  我们还有希望
With you wearing the pants, there's still hope.

169
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,470
戈伯
Wow! Gobber...

170
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,870
真是一点都不尴尬啊
Not awkward at all.

171
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,140
阿斯翠德  不要那样
Astrid, don't be like that.

172
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,810
这可是明明白白的拒绝啊
Whoa. That is a definitive no.

173
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,240
要是你想要埋进胡子里大哭一场
Look, if you need a beard to cry on,

174
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,410
就靠在我的肩膀上吧  你的泪水就能
just lean on my shoulder and you can cry into

175
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,420
流进我浓密的胡子里
my full, thick beard.

176
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,290
谢了  悍夫纳特
Oh, thank you, Tuffnut.

177
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,990
谢谢你
Thank you.

178
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,560
太感激你了
So much.

179
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,560
与父亲同名的艾瑞特
Eret, son of Eret!

180
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,160
说说报告
What's the report?

181
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,830
海湾那里又发现两条捕龙者拖船
Two more trapper barges spotted in the strait.

182
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,560
那我们就去找他们
So we go after them.

183
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,600
-怎么了  -总有一天
- What? - One day,

184
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,970
你会挑起一场你赢不了的战争
you're gonna pick a fight you can't win.

185
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,630
弓箭手
Archers!

186
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,310
屠龙者  坚守防线
Dragon killers. Stay on your guard.

187
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,250
亡牙龙
Deathgrippers.

188
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,190
后退  照我说的做
Back! Do what I say, now!

189
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,160
快点
Do what I say!

190
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,000
龙骑士攻击了我们
The dragon riders attacked us here,

191
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,440
位于东航线的这里
off the Eastern Strait.

192
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,640
-朗纳  -抱歉
- Ragnar. - Um, sorry.

193
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,980
我亲爱的军阀们
My dear warlords.

194
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,080
你们征服世界的计划怎么样了
How go your plans to conquer the world?

195
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,620
格里莫  老朋友
Grimmel, my old friend.

196
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,950
谢谢你能来
Thank you for coming.

197
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,560
德拉戈大败一年后
A year since Drago's defeat,

198
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,390
看来你已经没有你的龙军了
and no further along with your dragon army, I see.

199
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,030
这都怪伯克岛的那位年轻首领
You can thank the young chief of Berk for that.

200
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,700
斯多戈之子吗
Stoick's boy?

201
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,270
是的  他和她那群热爱和平的龙骑兵
Yep, he and his peace-loving dragon riders

202
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:12,170
到处突袭我们的船  偷走我们的龙
continue to raid our ships and steal our dragons.

203
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,710
听起来的确很烦人
Mm. That does sound like a nuisance.

204
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,950
但是我的任务是杀死龙
But I'm in the business of killing dragons,

205
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,950
而不是夺回龙
not retrieving them.

206
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,110
-但是  格里莫  -那蠢小子已经帮你
- But, Grimmel... - That idiot boy has done

207
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,550
做好了所有事
all of the work for you,

208
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,990
他把所有龙都聚集到了一个地方
gathering the dragons in one place.

209
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,350
为什么还要劳烦我出手
Why bother me?

210
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,030
因为那群龙被一只夜煞保护着
Because the flock is protected by a Night Fury.

211
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,530
不可能
Not possible.

212
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:39,500
看来还是有一只从你手下逃脱了
It seems one slipped through your fingers.

213
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,200
听着  伯克的龙会跟随着他们的龙王
Look, Berk's dragons will follow the alpha.

214
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:48,540
所以我们雇你抓住他  把那群龙带回来
So we'll pay you to capture him and bring the flock to us.

215
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,350
我们还给你准备好了你最喜欢的饵
We even have your favorite bait.

216
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,690
昨晚突袭中  他们唯一没有救走的龙
The only dragon they left us from last night's raid.

217
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,220
母的
A female? Hmm.

218
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,690
那就这么说定了吗  老朋友
So, do we have a deal, old friend?

219
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,470
小心
Watch out!

220
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,610
等一切都结束后
When all is said and done,

221
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:26,280
这个年轻的首领要把夜煞乖乖交给我
this young chief will bring me the Night Fury.

222
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,990
他们没有首领  只是一个小子
They don't have a leader, just a boy.

223
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,390
小嗝嗝
Hiccup.

224
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,060
这里是伯克岛  儿子
This is Berk, son.

225
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,230
这里是我们的家
It's our home.

226
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,530
这里是你祖父母的家
It was the home of your grandparents

227
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,270
还有他们的祖父母
and their grandparents before them.

228
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,270
我作为首领的职责就是要保护我们  小嗝嗝
And it's my job as chief to protect us, Hiccup.

229
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,580
总有一天  等你长大了
And one day, when you're all grown up,

230
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,740
这份职责会传递给你
that job will be passed on to you.

231
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,480
好吧
Okay.

232
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,820
这很重要  儿子  因为在那里
And it's very important, son, because out there,

233
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,590
日落的尽头  是龙的家
beyond the sunset, lies the home of the dragons.

234
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,560
没错
Aye.

235
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,800
传说行驶到离他们太近的船只
Legends tell of ships that sailed too close to it,

236
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,530
会从世界的边缘跌落
only to drop off the edge of the world,

237
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,400
永远不会再回来
never to be seen again.

238
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,600
但是那些回来的水手
But those sailors who turned back

239
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,540
会讲述那巨大的瀑布
told tales of a great waterfall

240
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,110
和龙守护着的秘密世界入口的故事
and dragons guarding the entrance to a Hidden World.

241
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,110
那不仅是他们的巢穴  小嗝嗝
Not just a nest, Hiccup,

242
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,580
而是一片所有龙的故土
but a land from which all dragons come.

243
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,420
连夜煞也是吗
Even Night Furies?

244
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,220
尤其是夜煞
Especially Night Furies.

245
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,660
他们好可怕
Those are scary.

246
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,190
别担心
Don't you worry.

247
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,130
总有一天  我会找到那个秘密世界
One day, I'll find the Hidden World

248
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,300
封上那个入口
and seal it up,

249
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,240
这样  人和龙就不会再争斗了
so that people and dragons will fight no more.

250
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,110
干什么
What?

251
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,280
好吧
Oh, all right.

252
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,580
你知道这不是用来给你磨牙的吧
You do know it's not a chew toy, don't you?

253
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,850
你想要这个吗  你想要这只腿吗
Is this what you want? Oh, do you want this leg?

254
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,360
你想要我的腿吗  去吧
Do you want my leg? Go get it.

255
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,740
你的滑翔技术越来越好了  伙计
Getting pretty good at gliding on your own, bud.

256
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,650
你就是躲到这里来避开戈伯的啊
Oh, so this is where you come to get away from Gobber.

257
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,460
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

258
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,390
他说得没错
Well, he's right, you know.

259
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,260
真的吗
R-Really?

260
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,370
你觉得我们俩应该...
You think you and I should...?

261
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,630
天啊  才不是
Oh, Gods, no.

262
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,640
我们俩根本就还没准备好呢
We're nowhere near ready for that.

263
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,640
是啊  那太疯狂了
No, that's-that's crazy.

264
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,440
我是说  他说的关于这一切的话
I mean, he's right about all of this.

265
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,580
现在的确好像全世界都知道我们了
It does seem like the whole world knows about us now.

266
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,950
是啊  我们带回来的龙越多
Yep. And the more dragons we bring back here,

267
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,350
盯上我们的目光就越多
the bigger of a target we become.

268
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,820
我真希望有办法能让他们别来烦我们
I just wish there was some way to make them leave us alone.

269
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,390
可能真的有
There might be.

270
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,830
爸爸以前和我说过一个老水手之间的传说
Dad used to talk about an old mariners' myth,

271
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,360
龙都居住在世界边缘的秘密世界
of a secret land at the edge of the world

272
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,630
没有人能够找到他们
where dragons live totally out of reach.

273
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,640
水手们最会讲故事了
Well, sailors are known for tall tales.

274
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,670
是啊  但万一是真的呢
True. But what if it's real?

275
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,710
这也许能解决我们所有的问题
It could be the answer to all of our problems.

276
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,250
怎么解决  把所有龙都转移过去吗
How? By moving the dragons there?

277
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,980
不  我们所有人
Uh-uh. All of us.

278
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,820
你是认真的吗
Seriously?

279
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,390
抛弃我们七代人流传下来的家园
And abandon our home of seven generations?

280
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,790
你爸爸交给你保护的家园吗
The home your father left you to protect.

281
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,490
我觉得我们需要一个真正的解决方案  小嗝嗝
Yeah, I think we need a real solution, Hiccup.

282
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,240
我们也可以采取戈伯的建议
Well, we could just take Gobber's advice

283
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,470
先结婚
and tie the knot.

284
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,470
这样能解决一切问题
That should fix everything.

285
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,380
但是  要是你还无法确认你的真心
But, hey, if you're having doubts about yours truly,

286
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,750
鼻涕虫也是个不错的人选
I'm pretty sure Snotlout's available.

287
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,950
他的眼里只有你妈妈
He only has eyes for your mom.

288
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,250
-开始玩脏的了  -是你逼我的
- Playing dirty now, huh? - You asked for it.

289
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,760
看来还是会有婚礼了
Looks like there might be a wedding after all.

290
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,920
你好大的胆子  太卑鄙了
Oh, how dare you? That is a low blow.

291
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,630
不  你别想跑
No, no, you are not getting away.

292
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,860
好吧  你赢了  你赢了
Okay, okay, you win, you win!

293
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,430
你永远赢
You always win.

294
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,300
你当初就知道我不好对付
You knew what you were getting into.

295
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,640
没错
Uh-huh. Right.

296
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,810
伙计
Uh, bud?

297
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,550
你...没错  不用等等我们
What... Yeah, sure, don't bother to wait for us.

298
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,030
我的天
Oh, my gods.

299
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,770
小嗝嗝
Uh, Hiccup!

300
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,510
我们是朋友  不用杀了我们
Yeah, yeah, w-we're friends. No need to kill us.

301
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,530
另一只夜煞
Another Night Fury.

302
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,430
不像是  那更像是
No, not quite. It's more like a...

303
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,200
-亮...煞  -光煞
- Bright... Fury. - A Light Fury.

304
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,910
好吧  你的称呼可能更好
Yeah, yours is better, probably.

305
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,210
什么叫不见了
What do you mean, gone?

306
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,510
消失了  遁入夜幕中
Vanished, into thin air.

307
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,270
怎么样
What do you think?

308
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,580
耳朵更短  没有背板
Stubbier ears. No dorsal plates.

309
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,080
好吧
Okay. Got it.

310
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,920
这一晚真闹腾
What a night.

311
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,790
伙计  你怎么了
Bud, what's gotten into you?

312
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,120
你怎么这么喘气流口水
What is all this slobbering and panting?

313
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:53,490
你还看不出来吗  他恋爱了
Isn't it obvious? He's in love.

314
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,560
相信我  谈恋爱只有痛苦和煎熬
Trust me, relationships are nothing but pain and misery.

315
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,200
我怎么说的来着
What did I just say?

316
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,940
我的遭遇还不够看吗
A-am I not enough?

317
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,870
我觉得他是说"不够"
I think that's a no.

318
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,750
-这样的吗  -这样吧
- Something like this? - You know what?

319
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,190
就照着没牙仔的卡画个白色的就行
Just trace your Toothless card and make her white.

320
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,120
-你早说啊  -你敢信吗
- You could've led with that. - Can you believe it?

321
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,120
没牙仔有女朋友了
Toothless has a girlfriend.

322
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,160
我从来没带你约过会
I never took you for a romantic.

323
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,700
从来没有
Like, ever.

324
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,660
但这也太甜了
But it's so sweet.

325
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,070
你看
I mean, look.

326
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,610
那也太可怜了
Okay. That's just sad.

327
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,110
-还很奇怪  -你最好做些什么
- And weird. - Yeah, you better do something.

328
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:48,720
认真的吗  我宁愿铲一天屎也不想看他这样
Seriously? I'd rather shovel poop all day than watch that.

329
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,370
好吧  那我们回森林里去
All right. Let's head back to the woods

330
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,150
看看能不能找到她
and see if we can find her.

331
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,820
好主意
Ah, good idea.

332
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,160
单独聊聊
A little privacy.

333
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,260
-男孩之间的对话  -什么
- It's boy talk. - What?

334
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,930
走吧  赶紧搞定
Come on, let's go work this out.

335
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,230
你想结婚了
So, you want to get married.

336
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,770
其实没有
Uh, no, actually.

337
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,670
好消息是我参加过两场婚礼
Good news. I've been to two weddings.

338
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:12,540
都被我砸了  但没有一场知名度比得上你们的
I crashed both, but none as high profile as this one.

339
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,170
各种压力  批判  不仅仅是我的
Lots of pressure, judgment, and not just by me.

340
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,710
听着  我们谈过了  我们不结婚
Look, we talked about it. We're not getting married.

341
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,310
胆怯  常有的事
Cold feet. I've seen it before.

342
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,580
别担心  小嗝儿  有我呢
Don't worry, Little Hiccy. I'm here.

343
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,050
等等  嗝儿
Wait, Hiccy?

344
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,050
我见过阿斯翠德看你的眼神
Now, I've seen the way Astrid looks at you.

345
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,590
大家都有目共睹  那种疑虑
Everyone has. That doubt.

346
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,020
明显的失望
That not so subtle disappointment.

347
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,030
渴望得到比你更好的人
That longing for something more than you.

348
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,930
你要专心成为更配得上她的人
You need to focus on being worthy.

349
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,930
看在雷神的分上  她可是战士女王
I mean, she's a warrior queen, for Thor's sake.

350
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,930
而你既不是战士也不是女王
And you are neither.

351
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,630
但有我做你的伴郎
But with me as your best man...

352
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,300
你愿意的话  我可以做你的灵魂向导
your spirit guide, if you will...

353
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:46,310
你会学会如何拥抱你内心的维京之魂
you'll learn to embrace your inner Viking.

354
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,310
让那些质疑者  很多质疑者看看
Show these naysayers, of which there are many,

355
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,750
你不仅仅只是一个发型糟糕
that you're more than just a malnourished runt

356
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,880
牙齿奇怪  脖子歪曲  营养不良的小矮人
with bad hair, strange teeth, and a twig for a neck.

357
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,320
你真的很不会鼓励人
You're-you're really bad at pep talks.

358
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,290
不要被那种不安全感
Stop letting these insecurities

359
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,890
所击败
get the best of you.

360
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,060
大家都看着你  所有人都看着
Everyone's watching. I mean, everyone.

361
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,570
你要男人起来  像我一样
You need to man up. Do as I do.

362
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,160
很难  但是我向你保证
It'll be hard, but you have my word.

363
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,330
在我违背我的保证之前  我不会放弃
And until I break that word, I won't give up.

364
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,040
我是在白费时间吗
Hey! What am I wasting my time here?

365
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,710
你在树林里发现什么亮亮的...那是什么
You see some shiny thing in the woods... Ooh, what is that?

366
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,920
没牙仔
Toothless!

367
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,650
不要动
Don't move a muscle.

368
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,130
有人来了
Someone's here. Huh?

369
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,800
他躲过了我们的侦察兵
He managed to slip past our scouts

370
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,270
在树林里设了个捕龙夹
and lay a trap in the woods.

371
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,180
毁掉了男孩交心
It ruined boy talk.

372
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,370
-我去找他  -慢点  戈伯
- Gah, let me at him! - Slow down, Gobber.

373
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,210
派一支搜查队搜查天空和地面
Let's get a search team on the ground, scouts in the air.

374
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,250
没牙仔和我去沿海岸线巡逻
Toothless and I will fly the coastline.

375
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:03,220
我不建议你带没牙仔出去  首领
Yeah, I wouldn't advise taking Toothless anywhere, Chief.

376
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,390
我认得这做工
I know this handiwork.

377
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:08,720
恐惧格里莫  在我那儿可是个有名的家伙
Grimmel the Grisly. Famous back where I'm from.

378
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,030
我见过的最聪明的捕龙猎手
The smartest dragon hunter I ever met.

379
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,130
当然了  不及我
Well, next to me, of course.

380
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,330
他没有那么聪明  他就那么丢下了他的捕龙夹
Well, he can't be that smart. He left his trap unmanned.

381
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,670
老格里莫做的任何事都不是随意的
Nothing's accidental when it comes to old Grimmel.

382
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,340
他为捕猎而生
He lives for the hunt,

383
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,340
懂他猎物的一举一动
to get inside the mind of his prey,

384
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,810
把它们所有的选择都掌控在手中
to control its every choice.

385
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,370
对他来说  一切都是一场游戏
It's all a game to him.

386
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,310
他不知道他遇上的对手是谁
Well, he doesn't know who he's playing with.

387
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,310
没错  我们对付过像他那样的人
Yeah. Well, we've dealt with his kind before.

388
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,350
别小瞧了他  小嗝嗝
Don't underestimate him, Hiccup.

389
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:37,080
记住我说的话  他会回来的
Mark my words. He'll be back.

390
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,690
我们就等他来
Then we'll be waiting for him.

391
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,430
好了
All right.

392
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,840
好吧  给我点线索
All right, come on, give me a clue here.

393
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,010
给我点线索  爸爸
Give me a clue, Dad.

394
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,830
希望你别介意我自己拿来喝了
Oh, I hope you don't mind if I help myself.

395
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,770
这味道真不错
This is, uh, mmm, quite good.

396
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,880
真厉害  不过让我先喝完
Oh, that is impressive. But let me finish my drink.

397
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,710
没牙仔
Toothless!

398
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,220
你对他做了什么
What did you do to him?

399
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,150
只是让他睡了过去
Eh, nothing that he won't sleep off.

400
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,760
不介意吧
May I?

401
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,890
小嗝嗝首领
Chief Hiccup.

402
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,930
我该叫你首领还是小嗝嗝
Hmm? Do I say Chief or do I call you Hiccup?

403
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,200
你喜欢哪个
What do you prefer?

404
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:02,900
你根本不知道我是谁  对吗
You have no idea who I am, do you?

405
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,010
你父亲认识我
Well, your father knew of me.

406
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,910
曾经有一个首领
Now, there was a chief.

407
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:14,520
他是最厉害的捕龙猎手
One of the greatest dragon hunters to have ever lived.

408
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,080
他会怎么想你
What would he think of you?

409
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,220
他做得没错
He had it right, you know.

410
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,220
为了让你能在一个更好的世界中成长
Making it his mission to destroy the beasts

411
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,490
而将消灭那些怪兽作为己任
so that you could grow up in a better world.

412
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,460
他改变了主意
He changed his mind.

413
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,830
看看他落得什么下场
And look where that got him.

414
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,540
我们还是直奔主题吧
So let's get to the point.

415
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,240
我是夜煞杀手
I am the Night Fury killer.

416
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,810
我杀死了每一只夜煞  除了你的
I've hunted every last one but yours.

417
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,410
你要把那条龙交给我  不然我...
You are going to give me that dragon, or I will...

418
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,310
我永远不会交出他
I will never give him up.

419
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,320
你希望龙和我们平等自由地相处吗
You wish dragons to live free among us like equals?

420
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,390
这种观念有毒  孩子
A toxic notion, my boy.

421
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:02,030
历史证明我们是更高级的种族
History has shown that we are the superior species.

422
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:06,500
万一你的错误观念流传开来怎么办
What if word of your misguided ideas were to spread?

423
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,600
据我们所知  那样简直就是
It would be the undoing of civilization

424
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:13,140
文明的倒退
as we know it.

425
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,150
我们抓到他了吗
Did we get him?

426
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,290
出来
Now!

427
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,990
抱歉打扰了
Sorry to barge in.

428
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,920
你以为你能这么走进我的家
You think you can come into my home,

429
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:35,090
坐在我父亲的椅子上  威胁我的龙吗
sit in my father's chair, and threaten my dragon?

430
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,060
这里是伯克岛
This is Berk.

431
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:40,570
我们从比你恶劣百万倍的人手中守护了自己的家园
And we have defended our way of life from far worse than you.

432
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,270
有战斗精神  我喜欢
A fighting spirit. I love it.

433
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:48,610
恐怕你搞错了
Only I'm afraid you're mistaken.

434
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:52,250
你从来没有见过像我这样的人
You've never seen anything like me.

435
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,530
阿斯翠德  小心
Astrid, look out!

436
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,630
-小心  -孩子  快跑
- Look out! - Son, get clear.

437
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,900
快跑
Run!

438
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,550
在我下次来之前
Have my dragon ready

439
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:30,550
准备好我要的龙  不然我会毁掉你爱的一切
when I return, or I will destroy everything you love.

440
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,930
-进去  -大半夜的
- Inside. - It's the middle of the night.

441
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,200
-我们来这里干什么  -好了
- What are we doing here? - All right.

442
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,970
好了  大家安静一下
All right, everybody. Settle down, please.

443
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,010
鱼脚司
Fishlegs.

444
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,440
你见过那种龙吗
Have you ever seen that species of dragon before?

445
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,380
让我去和他战斗
Let me at him!

446
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,210
我要让他尝尝我的厉害
I'll give him a piece of my mind!

447
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,020
厉害就是指我的拳头
And by mind, I mean fist!

448
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,520
你们忘了大家差点丧命吗
Did you miss the part where we almost died?

449
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,160
你们没看到我的房子吗
Have you seen my house?

450
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,630
这是新的敌人
This is a new kind of enemy.

451
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:15,300
我低估了他  这是我的错
And I underestimated him. Now, that's on me.

452
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,300
但我不会再犯这样的错误了
But I will not do that again.

453
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,530
我们是维京人  我们不会临阵逃脱
We're Vikings. We don't run from a fight.

454
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,220
至少我不会  你可能会
At least, I don't. You might.

455
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,500
我同意小嗝嗝
I agree with Hiccup.

456
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,510
我们还没见识过格里莫真正的手段
We haven't seen the last of Grimmel.

457
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:29,410
他是一个耐心  专注的捕猎者
He's a predator, single-minded and patient.

458
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,580
他得不到他想要的东西是不会停手的
He won't stop until he gets what he wants.

459
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,680
我支持艾瑞特
I'm with Eret.

460
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,680
我们必须认真对待这次威胁
We have to take this threat seriously.

461
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
格里莫只是一个征兆
Grimmel is just a sign of the times.

462
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,120
我们的敌人愈发聪明  执拗
Our enemies are getting smarter, more determined.

463
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,560
我们不仅人数占劣势  还将弱点暴露在明处
We're not just overcrowded. We are exposed and vulnerable.

464
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,160
无法应付全面战争  要拿我们爱的人涉险
Short of full-blown war and risking everyone we love,

465
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,430
我觉得...
I don't...

466
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:55,770
我觉得我们不该再留在这里了
I don't see a way of staying here any longer.

467
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,540
斯多戈会怎么想
What would Stoick think of this?

468
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,110
听他说完
Hey! Hear him out!

469
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,520
如果我们想和我们的龙和平共处
If we want to live in peace with our dragons,

470
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,550
我们需要一个更好的计划
we need a better plan.

471
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:14,250
你有什么想法  首领
So what are you saying, Chief?

472
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,420
我想说  我们要消失
I'm saying we have to disappear.

473
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,360
消失在地图上
Off the map.

474
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,590
带这些龙去一个没人能找到他们的地方
Take the dragons to a place where no one will find them.

475
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
那是哪里
And where might that be?

476
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,430
他是说要去寻找秘密世界
He's talking about a quest for the Hidden World.

477
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,300
秘密什么
The hidden what?

478
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,440
-白日做梦  -没错
- Out to lunch. - Yeah.

479
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,440
我小时候  我父亲就一心想找到那里
My father was obsessed with it when I was a boy.

480
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,210
他绘制了地图  记录了笔记
He made notes and maps

481
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:38,050
寻找深藏在世界边缘
in search of the ancestral home of all dragons,

482
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:41,280
所有龙的故土
tucked away somewhere beyond the edge of the world.

483
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,420
这也许是我们想要的解决办法
It may be the solution we need.

484
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,250
我们是龙的子民
We are dragon people.

485
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,350
我们属于那里
It's where we belong.

486
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,360
我知道这里是我们的家
Look, I know this is our home.

487
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,130
我的父亲把这里交给我来守护
My father left me to protect it.

488
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,130
但是伯克岛不仅仅只是这个地方
But Berk is more than this place.

489
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,070
我们才是伯克
We are Berk.

490
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,700
这些人民  这些龙
The people, the dragons.

491
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,470
我们去哪里  伯克就在哪里
I say Berk is wherever we go.

492
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,180
我支持他  还有谁
I'm with him! Who else?!

493
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,660
不好意思  让一下
Excuse me. Coming through.

494
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,770
让我过去一下
Just, let me just get right through here.

495
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:37,600
鱼肉仔  来吃石头  吃石头
Fishmeat, look, eat your rocks. Eat your rocks.

496
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,110
天  带宝宝飞的人实在是太没素质了
Gods! People who fly with babies are the worst.

497
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,840
我觉得我总是在问你这个问题  但是
I feel like I'm always asking you this question, but...

498
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,850
醒醒  坏脾气  醒醒
Wake up, Grump! Wake up!

499
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:49,250
你有个具体的计划还是...
Is there an actual plan or...?

500
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:52,350
只要一路飞到世界尽头
Just keep flying until we reach the end of the world.

501
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,820
听起来很靠谱
Ah. Seems sensible.

502
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,620
他们在哪里
So, where are they?

503
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,560
显然已经离开了
Gone. Obviously.

504
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,690
夜煞再一次从你手中
The Night Fury escaped you?

505
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,860
-逃走了  -是我促成的
- Again? - I encouraged it.

506
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:07,300
他们放弃了他们唯一的防守点
They've abandoned their only defensible position.

507
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:11,300
带着一点可怜的家当  恐惧地逃离
Running scared with what little they can carry.

508
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,210
没个尽头
It just keeps going.

509
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,910
因为世界其实是圆的
That's 'cause the world is actually round.

510
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,510
太阳是圆的  月亮是圆的
The sun's round. The moon is round.

511
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,880
星星是圆的
Stars are round.

512
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,710
尽管它们又小又蠢
Even though they're small and stupid.

513
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,750
对吧  星星
Right? Stars.

514
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,920
别气馁  他们跑不了多远
Don't fret. They won't get far.

515
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,190
夜煞已经被干扰了
The Night Fury is distracted.

516
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,890
我让他见到了你的母龙
I introduced him to your female.

517
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,890
夜煞相配就相伴终身
Furies mate for life, you see.

518
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,760
你发现了什么  伙计
What you picking up on, bud?

519
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,370
光煞
The Light Fury!

520
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,770
她在跟着我们
She's following us! Wow!

521
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,770
好厉害
Cool.

522
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,810
-你看  -她去哪里了
- Would ya look at that? - Where'd she go?

523
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,780
她是天空做的吗
Is she made of sky?

524
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,120
慢点  没牙仔
Whoa! Hold up, Toothless!

525
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,920
看看这是谁
Well, look who it is.

526
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,260
很高兴终于...
Oh, hey, it's really nice to finally...

527
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,940
太棒了  真是太棒了
This is perfect. So great.

528
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,780
都闭嘴
Not a word.

529
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,170
对对对  但他们去哪里了
Y-Yes, yes, but where did they go?

530
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,220
还得要我解释
I have to explain this.

531
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,890
夜煞无法在寒冷的环境中生存
Night Furies can't survive in the cold,

532
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,120
所以他们没有去北边
so they haven't gone north.

533
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,220
他们想要甩开
They're trying to put distance between themselves

534
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,920
东边和南边的敌人
and enemies to the east and south.

535
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:44,500
夜煞无法长时间飞行
And Night Furies cannot fly long distances without rest.

536
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,970
他们的飞行路线上必须要有停靠点
Their flight path must include stops.

537
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,370
稍稍休息
Potty break!

538
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,010
所以  他们去了...
Therefore, they've gone...

539
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,780
他们只能去...
They can only have gone...

540
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:03,320
有人想猜一猜吗
Does anyone want to take a guess?

541
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,750
有人吗
Anyone?

542
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,890
东边
Ah, east!

543
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:10,620
是西边
West.

544
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,460
很简单吧
Hmm? Simple, you see?

545
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,460
这不是很有趣吗
Oh, isn't this fun?

546
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,630
不是吗  不是吗
Yes? No?

547
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,600
是的  是的
Yes. Yes.

548
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,940
你对捕猎的爱呢
Where is your love of the hunt?

549
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,470
你们不是侵略者吗
I thought you were conquerors.

550
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,680
你们会得到你们想要的东西
You'll have your prize in time.

551
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:33,650
给我几天好好享受一下这种时光
Just allow me a few more days to enjoy this.

552
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,650
我真是太怀念了
I have dearly missed it.

553
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,280
好了
All right.

554
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,450
看来我们今晚就在这里扎营了
Looks like we're camping here for tonight.

555
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,420
感谢雷神
Well, thank Thor for that.

556
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,420
太好了  我的地盘
Yes. My own place.

557
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:46,790
我准备建个小屋  只准长胡子的人进
I plan to build a hut, only for the bearded.

558
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,660
暴芙纳特  你不能进
Ruffnut, you got to stay out.

559
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,460
连鬓胡不算
Chin whiskers don't count.

560
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:53,670
我看到了一座以我的形象建造的霸气之塔
I see a tower of manliness in the shape of me.

561
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:56,900
绝对比艾瑞特要高  肌肉更大
It's gonna be taller than Eret with bigger muscles.

562
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:58,440
什么
W-What?

563
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,540
滚出我的房子
Get out of my house! Hey.

564
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,570
-有什么问题吗  -有问题
- Is there a problem here? - Yeah, there's a problem.

565
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,880
自从你出现后
Ever since you showed up,

566
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,450
你就一直想要压过我
you've been trying to upstage me.

567
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,650
你就是嫉妒  妄想
You're just so jealous. It's delusional.

568
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,550
妄想这个词用得很好
Yeah, delusion's a good word for it.

569
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,080
听着  艾瑞特之子
Listen, son of Eret.

570
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,520
等小嗝嗝这个首领不行了  下一个轮到的是我
When Hiccup blows it as chief, I'm next in line.

571
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,920
二把手  因为我已经是瓦尔卡的最爱了
Number two, 'cause I'm clearly Valka's favorite.

572
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,860
所以你最好给我放尊重点
So, you better start showing me some respect.

573
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,560
奇怪的小矮子
Strange little man.

574
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,330
别介意他
Ah, don't mind him.

575
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,670
你有这挪威神的身材不是你的错
It's not your fault you have the body of a Norse god.

576
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,700
我也有这种困扰
I myself have the same problem.

577
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,540
铁匠摊就建在这里
Blacksmith's stall goes right here.

578
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,360
一二三四五
One, two, three, four, five.

579
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,550
-哪里...  -好吧
- Where's...? - Uh, okay.

580
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,950
等等  大伙儿  我说扎营
Uh, hold on, gang. I-I said make camp.

581
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:46,020
-你看到那些了吗  -而不是建一个新的村庄
- Did you see them? - Not build a new village.

582
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,920
谁死了让你当首领的
Who died and made you chief?

583
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,590
干什么
What? Ow!

584
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,930
我知道  这个地方很棒
Granted, this place is very nice,

585
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:55,100
但这里不是秘密世界
but it's not the Hidden World.

586
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,100
我们都不知道是不是真的有秘密世界
We don't even know if this Hidden World exists.

587
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,370
没错  这地方是真实的
Yeah. This place is real.

588
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,140
没有比一群又累又饿的维京人
Eh, there's nothing more stubborn

589
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,740
更加固执的了
than a mob of tired, hungry Vikings.

590
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,810
我想这里应该也能做一个不错的基地吧
Well, I guess this can work as a base in the meantime.

591
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,850
这里易守  隐蔽性高
It's defensible, hidden.

592
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,120
好吧  你们能留下来
All right. You can stay.

593
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,850
这里就是新伯克了
Say hello to New Berk!

594
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,720
开始造房子吧  伙计们
Let's get building, lads.

595
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,120
等我和没牙仔找到秘密世界
Until Toothless and I find the Hidden World.

596
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,660
算了吧
Get off it!

597
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,120
关于声音
Now, about that voice.

598
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:28,600
能不能不要用鹅叫
Can we lose the whole honking goose thing?

599
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,830
很难想象婚礼祝福
It's hard to imagine wedded bliss

600
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,770
一直要伴着那种声音
with that going off every minute.

601
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,640
如果你要继续往西
If you're going to continue west,

602
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,940
我得回头确保没人跟踪我们
I should head back to make sure we weren't followed.

603
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,170
好主意  我跟你一起去  保护你
Great idea. I'll go with you for protection.

604
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,810
不  你太重要了  这里更需要你
No! You're far too important here.

605
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:46,080
没错
Yeah.

606
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,050
小心点
Just be careful.

607
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,450
怎么了
What?

608
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,720
这个想让全世界找不到我们的计划
This plan to hide us from the rest of the world.

609
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,620
虽然我也希望能成真
Though-though I wish it were possible,

610
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,160
但恐怕无法长远  小嗝嗝
I fear it can't last, Hiccup.

611
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,930
你知道我已经努力想这么做好几年了
I mean, you know I tried to do the same for years.

612
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:09,030
但是贪婪的人类总会想别的办法
But greedy humans always find a way.

613
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,640
我只是...我只是希望你能好好考虑一下
I just... I only ask that you think about it.

614
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,580
你还是觉得我疯了还是...
Do you still think I'm crazy or...?

615
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,980
这么说吧  这个主意很有你的风格
Let's just say this whole idea is very you.

616
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,150
谢谢你昨晚支持我
Well, thanks for supporting me last night.

617
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,690
对我来说意义很大
It meant a lot.

618
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,220
先别急着谢我
Don't thank me yet.

619
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,190
我只是希望你的话没错
I just hope you're right about this.

620
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:54,180
没牙仔  不  太早了
Toothless. No, it's too early.

621
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,450
你现在会画画了
Oh, now you can draw.

622
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:48,530
看来有人没睡觉啊
Oh. Someone hasn't slept.

623
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:52,000
那个光煞根本不让我接近她半英里之内
Well, that Light Fury won't let me within a mile of her.

624
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
在没牙仔拿下她之前  我们都别想睡觉
And neither of us will be getting any sleep

625
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,640
或者找到秘密世界了
or finding the Hidden World until Toothless takes over.

626
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:00,470
你觉得怎么样
What do you think of that?

627
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,580
你之前就试过这个  他不想要
You tried this once before. He didn't want it.

628
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:08,050
现在  他不得不这么做了
Well, until now, he didn't have a reason to.

629
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:09,480
对吧  伙计
Right, bud?

630
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,520
怎么了
What?

631
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:21,490
没什么  我很惊讶
No, nothing. I'm-I'm impressed.

632
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,770
看看你  接受改变
I mean, look at you. Embracing change.

633
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:26,400
我真为你自豪
I am proud of you.

634
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,400
他是我最好的伙计
Well, he's my best bud.

635
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,400
我希望他能开心
I want him to be happy.

636
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:32,980
再说了  只装到他把她带回来
Eh, besides, it's just until he brings her back.

637
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:39,510
好了
All right.

638
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,250
准备好就开火
Fire when ready.

639
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,390
看来你知道尾巴是防火的了
Well, I guess you know the tail is fireproof.

640
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:53,120
好了  没牙仔
Okay, Toothless.

641
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:54,960
好吧  我知道
Okay, okay. Okay, yes, I know.

642
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,460
我知道
I know.

643
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,970
我知道
Okay, I know.

644
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:01,300
-拜托  别折腾了  -看啊
- Please, this is not helping. - Well, well, well.

645
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,070
有人很激动
Someone's excited.

646
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,470
他第一次约会呢
He's fresh off his first date.

647
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:07,440
现在为爱癫狂了
Now he's love crazed.

648
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,710
逼疯的可是我们
Only we're the ones going crazy.

649
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:13,010
他越早把那个光煞带回来越好
The sooner he brings back that Light Fury, the better.

650
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:15,280
但这样的话他得会自己飞
Yeah, but to do that, he'll need to fly without me.

651
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,150
所以该试试这个改良版的新宝贝了
So time to give this new and improved baby a shot.

652
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:23,620
好样的  看起来很棒  没牙仔
Attaboy. Looking sharp, Toothless!

653
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:26,190
你觉得怎么样  伙计
So what do you think, bud?

654
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,590
带她回家
Bring her home.

655
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:30,760
最晚到落日之前
By sundown at the latest.

656
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,260
不  给你女朋友吧
No, save it for your girlfriend.

657
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:35,100
快去吧
Go on. Get out of here.

658
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,380
没事的
It's okay.

659
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,670
小心
Watch out!

660
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,570
快走  云中跃
Go, Cloudjumper!

661
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,430
敬首领
To the chief!

662
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,740
敬首领
To the chief!

663
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,010
没错  敬我们的首领
Aye. To our chief.

664
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:09,040
和他爸爸真是像
Oh, a chip off the old block.

665
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,010
好了  伙计们  我有点晕了
Yeah, okay, guys. Now I'm just getting sick.

666
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,780
好了
Okay.

667
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:15,680
不得不说
Got to say,

668
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,520
我本来以为你是疯了
I thought you were well off your rocker,

669
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,680
但这地方还不算赖
but this spot ain't half bad.

670
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:22,550
这里本来只是一个临时停靠点
This was supposed to be a temporary solution.

671
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,520
大家都很赞同
It's unanimous.

672
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,290
都觉得这里绝对能住得更好
Everyone agrees we've definitely traded up.

673
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:28,660
干得漂亮  首领
Well done, Chief.

674
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,330
万一那尾巴坏了呢
What if the tail broke?

675
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:31,930
万一格里莫找到他了呢
What if Grimmel found him?

676
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:34,530
-万一他需要我呢  -你能不能放松点
- What if he needs me? - Would you relax?

677
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:36,700
他现在可能正开心着呢
He's probably having the time of his life.

678
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,940
我怎么知道  她从来不接近我们
How would I know? She never comes around.

679
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:42,080
就算来也是匆匆跑走
And when she does, she's always rushing off.

680
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,840
我是说我们怎么知道
I'm saying how-how do we know

681
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,510
她适不适合我们
if she's right for us?

682
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,510
-我们  -你懂我的意思
- Us? - You know what I mean.

683
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:50,380
她那么狂野轻佻  我话就放在这里了
She's so wild and skittish. I'm just gonna say it.

684
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,550
我不信任她
I don't trust her.

685
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:54,350
你无法驯服他们所有的  小嗝嗝
Can't tame 'em all, Hiccup.

686
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,850
总有一天  你要解下你的围裙
One day, you'll have to snip those apron strings

687
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:59,020
让没牙仔展开翅膀
and let Toothless stretch his wings.

688
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,090
这让我想起了我以前和斯多戈聊起你
Reminds me of a talk I had with Stoick about you.

689
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,330
他们都是从哪里来的
Where do they keep coming from?

690
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:08,900
-谁  -这些该死的胡瓜龙
- Who? - Those bloody Hobgobblers.

691
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,540
他们跳得比兔子还快
I swear they're popping up faster than rabbits.

692
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:13,540
我觉得他们想吃了我
I think they want to eat me.

693
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,740
我肯定非常美味
Evidence would suggest I'm tasty.

694
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,410
嗝儿  有空吗
Hiccy, a moment?

695
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:20,410
听着  我一直在看你走路的样子
Listen, I've been watching you walk.

696
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:22,480
不要跛  没人会嫁给这样的人
Lose the limp. No one's gonna marry that.

697
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,350
我有一条假腿
I have a prosthetic leg.

698
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,520
我也是  我还有寄生双胞胎呢
So have I. And I have a parasitic twin,

699
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,920
但是你也没见我一瘸一拐啊
but you don't see me limping around about it.

700
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,920
来吧  抬起头  嗝儿  挺起胸膛
Come on. Chin up, Hiccy. Puff out that chest.

701
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:34,530
屁股往左边一点
Move that butt to the left a little bit.

702
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,470
妈妈  你受伤了吗  怎么回事
Mom, are you hurt? W-What happened out there?

703
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:47,740
我不知道怎么回事  但是格里莫在跟着我们
I don't know how, but Grimmel is tracking us.

704
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:51,610
都是因为这些胡瓜龙
Ah! This is all because of the Hobgobblers.

705
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,710
他有一百多艘船  也许还不止
He has a hundred ships, maybe more,

706
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:56,720
还有足够抓走我们所有龙的箱子
with enough cages for all of our dragons.

707
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,750
如果格里莫要带他们来这里
If Grimmel is leading them here,

708
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,820
我们得先干掉他
we have to take him out of the mix.

709
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,660
我们要怎么做到
Uh, and how would we do that?

710
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,660
去那里先抓住他
By going there to capture him.

711
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,830
抓住他
Capture him?

712
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:10,770
我支持他  还有谁
I'm with him! Who else?!

713
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:01,150
分散开来  这样很难抓住我们
Okay, split up. We'll be harder to catch.

714
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:03,720
我觉得我们应该分散开  因为那个
I was thinking we should split up, just because.

715
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,950
我喜欢你的直觉
I like your instincts.

716
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:07,690
什么意思
What is this?

717
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,660
安静
Shh! Shh! Quiet.

718
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,230
-安静  -在你需要的时候
- Quiet. - Where's your dragon

719
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:54,170
你的龙去哪里了  首领了
when you need him, hmm, Chief?

720
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:57,770
肯定把你忘光了
Must have forgotten all about you.

721
00:54:57,770 --> 00:54:59,840
捕猎的首要原则
First rule of the hunt:

722
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,270
将猎物和兽群分开
separate the prey from its pack.

723
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:06,280
你自己离开了战斗
You've just removed yourselves from the equation.

724
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,180
你到底为什么要这么做
Why are you doing this? Really?

725
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:10,980
我还以为你不在乎呢
I didn't think you cared.

726
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:13,750
和你不一样  我小时候
Well, unlike you, when I was a boy

727
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:17,820
遇到了一只夜煞  趁他睡着时把他杀了
and I came upon a Night Fury, I killed it where it slept.

728
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:22,260
这简单的勇气之举让我成为了村里的英雄
That simple act of courage made me a hero in my village.

729
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:25,800
于是我决定要把每一只都杀光
So I decided to kill every last one,

730
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,270
为这个世界上的人们带来真正的和平
bringing real peace to the people of this world.

731
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:31,270
直到你出现了
Until you came along,

732
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:34,540
到处宣扬龙并不是
preaching that dragons are something other than

733
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,710
小偷和杀人犯
thieves and murderers.

734
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:41,580
我就要杀死你  来制止这一派胡言的流传
That nonsense dies now, starting with you.

735
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,880
但你有你自己的龙
But you have dragons of your own.

736
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,980
这些吗
These?

737
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:47,990
他们是屠龙者
They're dragon killers,

738
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:51,260
用他们自己的毒液迫使他们顺从我
drugged into obedience with their own venom.

739
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:54,590
连你的龙王也控制不了他们
Not even your precious alpha could control them.

740
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:57,930
他们只为我效命
They serve me and only me.

741
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:00,300
让我来为你演示一下
Allow me to demonstrate.

742
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,100
躲起来
Take cover!

743
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:08,070
分散开来
Split up!

744
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,620
快跑
Whoa! Run!

745
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:36,340
上来
Up here!

746
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,990
快点
Hurry!

747
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,890
快走  快走
Go, go, go, go, go!

748
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,160
小嗝嗝
Hiccup!

749
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:08,070
接到你了
Gotcha.

750
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:09,740
快走  云中跃
Go, Cloudjumper!

751
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:18,980
我们的英雄
Our hero!

752
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,930
他到处都带着他那愚蠢的龙宝宝
Ugh, he takes that stupid baby everywhere.

753
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:41,970
我的神啊
God almighty!

754
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:43,900
看来我们不需要这个了
Guess we won't be needing this then, huh?

755
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,170
我带领我们直直走进了他的陷阱
I led us right into his trap.

756
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:49,370
干得漂亮  首领  对吧  暴芙
Yeah, nice work, Chief. Right, Ruff?

757
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:50,910
等等
Wait.

758
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:52,380
暴芙纳特呢
Uh... Where is Ruffnut?

759
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,250
我们丢下她了吗
We-we left her behind?

760
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:56,280
你怎么会没发现她不见了吗
How could you not notice she was missing?

761
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,120
你们俩坐的是双头龙啊
You ride a two-headed dragon.

762
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,280
没错
Oh, yeah.

763
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:02,390
我现在感觉就像暴芙纳特每天一样  好蠢
I feel like how Ruffnut is every day: dumb.

764
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:04,220
我的老奥丁啊
Odin be spanked!

765
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:06,320
真是越来越好了
This just gets better and better.

766
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:07,860
还有更多好消息吗
Any more fantastic news?

767
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,190
我一直避免去看她
I try to avoid looking at her.

768
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,730
不然会让我胃酸回流
It gives me acid reflux.

769
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:12,930
伙计们  不要摘下头盔
O-Okay, guys, just keep your helmets on.

770
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,400
我和没牙仔会找到她的
Toothless and I will find her.

771
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,330
没牙仔现在有光煞了
Toothless has the Light Fury now.

772
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:18,100
他可能再也不会回来了
He's probably not even coming back.

773
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:19,340
什么
What?

774
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:21,340
你给了他自由  小嗝嗝
You gave him his freedom, Hiccup.

775
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:23,240
你能指望怎么样
What were you expecting?

776
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,110
我没想到他会永远离开
I never thought he'd stay away for good!

777
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:27,850
我....
I-I...

778
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:31,250
我会想办法的  我只是需要更多时间
Look, I'll-I'll figure it out. I just need more time.

779
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,790
他觉得他得独自领导
He thinks he has to lead alone.

780
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:39,320
因为他父亲只能那样
Well, because his father had to.

781
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:42,930
他没有意识到你们一起有多强大
He doesn't realize the strength you have together.

782
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:46,330
-你还相信他吗  -当然了
- Do you still believe in him? - Of course.

783
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:48,130
我希望他也能相信自己
I wish he did.

784
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:52,500
但是他觉得自己没了没牙仔就一无是处
But he thinks he's nothing without Toothless.

785
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:55,180
那就帮他意识到真相
Then help him realize the truth.

786
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:00,980
-上来  -什么
- Get on. - What?

787
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:02,210
我们会找到他的
We're going to find him.

788
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,450
真的吗
Really?

789
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:07,750
大家稍安勿躁
Everybody, stay put.

790
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,450
我们会救回暴芙纳特的  别担心
We will get Ruffnut back. Don't worry.

791
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:12,120
担心
Worry?

792
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:14,930
要是暴芙纳特在他们手上  我更担心他们
If they're stuck with Ruffnut, I'm more worried about them.

793
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:20,330
为什么拉长了脸
Why the long face?

794
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:22,400
我的脸很长  但你的真的很长
I mean, mine's long, but yours is really long.

795
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,170
只有脸没有脑  好像生来就被拉长了
All face and no brain, like you got stretched at birth.

796
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:26,770
你也有双胞胎兄弟吗
Do you have a twin, too?

797
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:28,510
悍夫纳特在妈妈肚子里就占了所有空间
Tuffnut took up all the room in Mom's belly.

798
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:30,370
不然我的脑袋会更圆  还会有更多脑子
Otherwise I'd have a rounder head and more brains.

799
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:32,510
这就是科学
That's science.

800
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:34,910
我的辫子就像小双头龙  看
My braids are like little Zipplebacks. See?

801
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,280
连上面的霉斑看上去都像眼睛  好可爱
Even the mold spots look like eyes. It's so cute.

802
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:40,990
上面还有小小的角什么的
They even have little horns and everything,

803
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:42,320
就像吐吐和喷喷
just like Barf and Belch.

804
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,020
只不过我和吐吐真是受不了喷喷
Except me and Barf can't stand Belch,

805
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:45,220
所以其实只是吐吐
so they're really just Barfs.

806
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,290
这里好暖和
It's warm in here.

807
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:48,460
我知道你在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

808
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,260
从来没有过这么性感的囚犯
You've never had a prisoner this hot.

809
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:53,060
男孩子们都爱我
All the boys love me.

810
00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:55,200
除了艾瑞特  他是绝对没有机会了
Except Eret, who totally lost his chance.

811
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,240
过了这村没这店了  小子  抱歉
That ship has sailed, boy. Sorry.

812
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,570
小嗝嗝基本算是已经娶了
And Hiccup is practically married

813
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:00,750
那个圆脑袋  阿斯翠德
to that round-head, Astrid.

814
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:03,590
但是鼻涕虫和鱼脚司基本算是我的后宫
But Snotlout and Fishlegs, they're basically my harem.

815
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:05,510
真是很难选
I just can't choose, you know?

816
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:08,110
鼻涕虫很健壮  但是有点太好看了
Snotlout's a beefcake but almost too pretty, you know?

817
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:10,450
有时候我觉得他更爱他自己  而不是我
Sometimes I think he's more in love with himself than me.

818
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:13,820
一段感情里只能有一个美人儿
There's only room for one beauty in this relationship.

819
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:16,390
鱼脚司要是能让我在冰川上
Fishlegs would keep me alive longer if I had to

820
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:18,630
吃掉一条鱼的话  我还能活久点
eat one of them, stranded on some glacier somewhere.

821
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:20,030
但是他总是在聊龙的事
But he never shuts up about dragons.

822
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:21,430
有人老是在说话的话  你不会烦吗
Don't you hate when people never stop talking?

823
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:23,330
-我会  -他们就说啊说啊说个不停
- Yes, I do. - They just keep going and going.

824
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:25,830
真是太无聊了
Blah, blah, blah. It's so boring.

825
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,830
-我们就不能把她喂给你的龙吗  -我饿了
- Can't we just feed her to your dragons? - I'm hungry.

826
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,230
你们这里都吃什么
Hey, what do you have to eat around here?

827
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,500
我对鱼过敏  不要忘了
I'm allergic to fish. You should know that.

828
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,840
那个愚蠢的新岛上只有鱼
That's all they have at that stupid new island.

829
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:35,410
你们有扇贝吗
Do you have any clams?

830
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:37,240
他们就像里面装了咬过的东西的
They're like little mouths with slimy food inside

831
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,340
小嘴巴  就像以前妈妈那样
that's already chewed, like the way Mom used to do it.

832
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,510
够了
Enough!

833
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,950
直到我12岁了  她就说"自己咬东西"
Until I turned 12 and she was like, "Chew your own food."

834
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:46,520
于是我就说"不  我还很喜欢呢"
And I was like, "No, I kinda like it."

835
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:49,250
你真是我遇见过最烦人的生物
Most annoying creature ever to cross my path.

836
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:54,160
你把龙放出来了
Oops, you let the dragons out.

837
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,030
我要抓住你  我要抓住你
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you.

838
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:57,860
-不  这个会抓住你  -带...
- No, this one's gonna get you. - Get...

839
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,200
带上他快滚
Take him and go!

840
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,930
快点  我求你了
Please! I beg you!

841
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:05,340
亡牙龙只能放弃自己的晚餐了
The Deathgrippers will have to forgo dinner.

842
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:09,130
你给你的龙喂龙吗
Ew, you feed your dragons dragons?

843
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:10,910
-快滚  -你的厕所在哪里
- Go! - Where's your bathroom?

844
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:12,010
我得...
I got to...

845
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:14,310
好吧  上帝啊
Okay! Gods.

846
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:17,380
难怪你头发都灰了
No wonder you have gray hair.

847
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:19,250
压力太大不好
Stress is not good for you.

848
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,060
再见  废物们
So long, losers!

849
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:35,600
-她在往哪里飞  -她在追踪什么东西
- Where-where is she heading? - She's tracking something.

850
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,530
对吗  姑娘
Aren't you, girl?

851
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:40,540
这里只有延绵千里的...
There's nothing but miles and miles of...

852
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:14,200
巨大的瀑布
A great waterfall.

853
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:16,640
在世界的尽头
At the end of the world.

854
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:20,450
风里飞
Stormfly!

855
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,140
看
Look.

856
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:38,850
这是真的存在的
It really does exist.

857
01:04:56,270 --> 01:04:59,100
-没牙仔  -你会吓到他们的
- Toothless. - Shh. You'll spook them.

858
01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:44,550
那才叫龙王
Now, that's a king.

859
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:28,530
我们该离开了
We should go.

860
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:31,460
不
Ooh, no.

861
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,910
风里飞
Stormfly!

862
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:01,660
快走  快走
Go! Go!

863
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:14,540
对不起  伙计  我只是
I-I'm sorry, bud. I-I just...

864
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,630
孩子
Son.

865
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,470
你应该好好睡觉的
You should be asleep.

866
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:46,770
我渴了
I was thirsty.

867
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,610
过来
Yeah, come here.

868
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:04,820
爸爸
Dad?

869
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:08,930
你要给我们找新妈妈吗
Are you gonna get us a new mom?

870
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,630
我不想要再找别的
I don't want another.

871
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:17,870
你妈妈是我唯一的女人
Your mom was the only woman for me.

872
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:20,540
她是我一生的挚爱
She was the love of my life.

873
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:26,680
但是有爱就会有失去
But with love comes loss, son.

874
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,550
这是注定的
It's part of the deal.

875
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:33,290
有时候会很痛苦  但到了最后  一切都是值得的
Sometimes it hurts, but in the end, it's all worth it.

876
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:39,460
没有比爱更好的馈赠
There's no greater gift than love.

877
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:24,030
没事的  伙计
It's okay, bud.

878
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,440
你属于哪里  和她一起
You belong there, with her.

879
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,640
而我们不一样
We don't.

880
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:35,450
没事的
And that's all right.

881
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:37,750
我们会想办法...
We'll find a way to man...

882
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:53,530
她跟着我们回来了
She followed us back!

883
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:59,970
也许我们还是不用说再见的
We might not have to say good-bye after all.

884
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:08,780
没错
That's it.

885
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:12,620
-暴芙纳特  -想我了吗
- Ruffnut? - Miss me?

886
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:14,090
你怎么逃出来的
How did you escape?

887
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:15,820
我烦到他们放我走了
I annoyed them till they let me go.

888
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:17,490
等等  等等
Wait. Wait.

889
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:20,590
-格里莫放你走了  -真蠢
- Grimmel let you go? - So dumb.

890
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:22,590
他们受不了我
They couldn't handle me.

891
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:24,600
大家都以为悍夫纳特更烦  但是
See, everyone thinks Tuffnut's more annoying, but...

892
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,900
等等  暴芙纳特  认真点
Wait, hold on. Ruffnut, focus.

893
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,770
你被跟踪了吗
Were you followed?

894
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:30,840
我从来没有回头看  小嗝嗝
I never look back, Hiccup.

895
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:33,050
没牙仔
Toothless.

896
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:35,950
没牙仔
Toothless!

897
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:48,390
没牙仔  回来
Toothless, come back!

898
01:10:56,830 --> 01:10:58,170
不
No!

899
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:19,650
我们的小小游戏终于要结束了
And now our little game must come to an end.

900
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,790
让他们退下  龙王
Call them off, alpha!

901
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:28,590
没必要让她跟着丧命
No reason for her to die, too.

902
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:43,070
他们在干什么
What are they doing?

903
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:46,810
-他们能干掉他的  -这样她就会有危险
- They could totally take him. - Not with her life on the line.

904
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:51,580
省点力气吧
Save your breath.

905
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:54,890
他们唯一听命的龙王是我
The only alpha they respond to is me.

906
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:04,690
别太难受  你已经尽力了
Don't feel too badly. You tried your best.

907
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:09,600
但是你没有你的龙就一无是处
But you are nothing without your dragon.

908
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:25,960
没牙仔
Toothless!

909
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:46,200
真是太好了
Oh, that is just great!

910
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:47,370
现在怎么办
Now what?

911
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,940
我觉得该让二把手成为一把手了
I think it's time for number two to become number one.

912
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:52,880
他听你的
He'll listen to you.

913
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:00,150
-别说  -我没打算说
- Don't say it. - I wasn't going to.

914
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:01,890
我不该带你去那里的
I shouldn't have dragged you out there.

915
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:04,590
他就不会把我送回来  她也不会跟过来
He wouldn't have flown me back. She wouldn't have followed.

916
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:06,120
没错
Yep.

917
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:09,090
我感觉自己就像遇到没牙仔之前那么没用
I feel like the same screwup I was before I met Toothless.

918
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:10,930
看得出来
I can see that.

919
01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:13,100
你准备就这么站在这里同意我说的一切吗
Are you just gonna stand there and agree with everything?

920
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:14,410
你说得对
Well, you're right.

921
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:16,770
你又回到了原点
You're back to where you started,

922
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:19,100
但我当初是第一个相信你的人
but I was the first to believe in you.

923
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:20,810
从那以后  我就一直看着你
And I have watched you doubt

924
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:23,270
处于深深的自我怀疑之中
whether you're worthy ever since.

925
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,110
但是你知道吗
But you know what?

926
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:28,980
我能有今天  全是因为你
I am the person I am today because of you.

927
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:32,050
我从来没有告诉过你  但的确是那样
I never told you that, but it's true.

928
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:34,750
你是最勇敢  最固执
You are the bravest, most stubborn,

929
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:38,760
最有决心的傻蛋
most determined knucklehead I know.

930
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,020
这不是没牙仔赋予你的优点  小嗝嗝
Toothless didn't give you that, Hiccup.

931
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:44,360
-他只是让你...  -更轻松
- He just made it... - Easier.

932
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:47,970
现在会变得更加困难
And now it's gonna be a lot harder.

933
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:51,400
那你准备怎么办
So, what are you gonna do about it?

934
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:54,140
也许做些傻事吧
Probably something stupid.

935
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:56,910
这才是我认识的小嗝嗝
That's the Hiccup I know.

936
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:02,910
做好准备  大家伙儿  我们要把他们救回来
Suit up, gang. We're going to get them back.

937
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:05,920
-什么  -他疯了
- What? - He's lost his mind.

938
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:09,020
这才像个结婚的样子
Now, that's marriage material.

939
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:12,260
终于  我的好学生  你准备好了
At last, faithful pupil, you are ready.

940
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:17,430
我们没有龙要怎么把我们的龙救回来
Um, how are we gonna get our dragons back without dragons?

941
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:18,800
相信我
Trust me.

942
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:27,810
快点
Move it.

943
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,940
没错  龙王
Um, that's right, alpha.

944
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:34,920
不许妄动
No surprises.

945
01:14:43,290 --> 01:14:48,860
穿着这些从悬崖上跳下去
So, jump off the cliff in these.

946
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:50,360
这就是你最好的办法了吗
That's the best you've got?

947
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:53,160
不你们才是我最好的计划
No, you guys are the best I've got.

948
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:57,200
-我支持他  还有谁  -我...
- I'm with him! Who else?! - I'm with...

949
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,240
暴芙纳特  那是我的台词
Ruffnut, that was my line.

950
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,240
-出发  -跟上了
- Let's go! - Try to keep up!

951
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:09,710
-我上了  -上
- I'm doing it! - All right!

952
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:25,260
你们不会真的觉得我会把夜煞交给你们吧
You didn't think I'd actually hand you the Night Fury, did you?

953
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:26,960
只有我能杀他
He's mine to kill.

954
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:28,770
狡猾的毒蛇
That snake!

955
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:31,470
我要结束我挑起的一切
I intend to finish what I started.

956
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:35,810
祝你们没了龙王也能控制他们
Best of luck controlling them without an alpha.

957
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:38,080
等着  没牙仔
Hold on, Toothless!

958
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:44,260
松开
Let go!

959
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,380
应该先练练的
Could've used some practice!

960
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:47,480
我不该吃早饭的
Ah, I should've skipped breakfast!

961
01:15:59,100 --> 01:15:59,930
没牙仔
Toothless!

962
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:03,870
小心
Look out!

963
01:16:03,870 --> 01:16:05,900
烫烫烫烫
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

964
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:10,980
他们要跑了
They're getting away!

965
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:22,290
时机正好
Perfect timing.

966
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:24,950
干掉他们  瘦的那个交给我
Put that down! I'll take the skinny one!

967
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:25,960
认真起来
Game faces!

968
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:28,790
你还在等什么  上啊
Yeah, what are you waiting for? Get in there.

969
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,100
找掩护
Take cover!

970
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:08,330
你去哪里
Where are you going?!

971
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,840
-小心  -谢谢
- Heads up! - Thanks.

972
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:15,780
小心
Look out!

973
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:20,850
谢谢
Thanks.

974
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:48,070
我来了  没牙仔
I'm coming, Toothless!

975
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:51,180
你还觉得他在乎你吗
You still think he cares about you?

976
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:56,380
看看他会去追谁
Let's just see who he follows.

977
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:10,630
对不起  伙计  这一切都对不起
I'm sorry, bud, for everything.

978
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,620
去追她吧
Now, let's go get her.

979
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,060
二把手来了
Number two coming through!

980
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:40,620
惊喜
Surprise!

981
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:42,090
很抱歉
Sorry about that.

982
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:44,060
来啊
Come on.

983
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:49,430
又放出一个  还有四个
All right! One more free! Four to go!

984
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,340
跟上
Try to keep up!

985
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:55,640
有我呢
I got your backs.

986
01:18:57,180 --> 01:19:00,240
我们简直就像是一个小队
Yeah, it's almost like we're a team.

987
01:19:03,150 --> 01:19:06,180
你竟然带宝宝来战场
You brought a baby to a battle.

988
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:09,250
换我可不会这么做
Ah-ah-ah. I wouldn't do that if I were you.

989
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:21,600
天  我爱那条龙
God, I love that dragon.

990
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,730
快回来
Come on! Come back here!

991
01:19:26,710 --> 01:19:28,710
抱歉我们迟到了
Sorry we're late for the party.

992
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:30,540
你们来得正好
You're right on time.

993
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:42,290
没错  没错
That's it. That's it.

994
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:56,000
我们要怎么在不伤害到她的前提下把他弄下来
How are we gonna get him off her back without hurting her?

995
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,340
惧怕我的胡子吧
Fear the facial hair!

996
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:08,780
-好想念这种时代  -我也是
- Oh, I have missed this. - Me, too.

997
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:12,380
你看到他了吗
Ooh. See that there?

998
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:14,420
真可爱
Aw. Cute.

999
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:17,220
这是噩兆  你被诅咒了
That's a bad omen. You're cursed.

1000
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,130
没错  上
Yes! Go on!

1001
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:26,400
好样的
Good on you!

1002
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,730
看来你其实也没有那么噩啦
I guess you're not so bad after all.

1003
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:53,420
弃船
Abandon ship!

1004
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:04,100
真是太棒了
Yay! Oh, that was awesome!

1005
01:21:13,670 --> 01:21:14,650
我们有麻烦了
Uh, we've got problems.

1006
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:32,570
干掉他  小嗝嗝
Take him down, Hiccup!

1007
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,410
我们需要赶紧想个更好的计划
We need a better plan, and quick!

1008
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:51,220
你  你在干什么
Uh, uh, what are, what are you doing?

1009
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:54,620
好吧  好吧
Okay. Okay.

1010
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,860
他去哪里了
Where has he gone?

1011
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:21,740
你会害死我们俩的
You'll kill both of us!

1012
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:24,210
在龙身上战斗
Fighting over a dragon?

1013
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:25,650
这就是你的计划吗
That's your plan?

1014
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:31,290
这才是
This is.

1015
01:22:34,430 --> 01:22:36,360
去救他
Save him.

1016
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:14,800
不
No!

1017
01:23:20,510 --> 01:23:21,900
看
See?

1018
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:24,280
我就知道你会来的
I knew you'd come around.

1019
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:01,940
早上好  伙计
Hey. Good morning, bud.

1020
01:24:03,950 --> 01:24:06,550
好样的
Here you go.

1021
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:09,350
你可真是充满了惊喜
Boy, you're full of surprises.

1022
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:13,790
他是你的了
He's all yours.

1023
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:27,540
艾瑞特也许的确有好身材
You know, Eret may be blessed with brawn,

1024
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:31,440
但悄悄告诉你  你有脑子
but, just between us, you have the brains.

1025
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,710
一把手
Number one.

1026
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:08,380
你说得对  伙计  是时候了
You're right, bud. It's time.

1027
01:25:10,050 --> 01:25:14,920
我总是忙于为一个我想要的世界而战
I was so busy fighting for a world that I wanted,

1028
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:17,960
我没有想过你需要什么
I didn't think about what you needed.

1029
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:24,660
你已经照顾我们够久了
You've looked after us for long enough.

1030
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:26,830
该为你自己考虑考虑了
Time to look after yourselves.

1031
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,810
风里飞  我的好姑娘
Oh, Stormfly, my good girl.

1032
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:45,080
好了  坏脾气
All right, Grumpy.

1033
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:48,090
去吧
Off you go.

1034
01:25:48,470 --> 01:25:51,390
再见  你这只丑八怪
So long, you big ugly beast.

1035
01:25:51,390 --> 01:25:52,590
我会想你的
I'll miss you.

1036
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:04,000
云中跃
Oh, Cloudjumper. Oh.

1037
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:14,740
去吧  伙计
Go on, bud.

1038
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:16,910
带他们去秘密世界
Lead them to the Hidden World.

1039
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:21,050
你们在那里会很安全
You'll be safe there.

1040
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:24,550
比和我一起安全得多
Safer than you could ever be with me.

1041
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:28,110
没事的  我也爱你
It's okay. I love you, too.

1042
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:29,430
我希望你自由
And I want you to be free.

1043
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:35,800
我们的世界不配拥有你们
Our world doesn't deserve you.

1044
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,070
还不配
Yet.

1045
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,920
去吧  没牙仔
Go, Toothless.

1046
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:53,620
去吧
Go.

1047
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:22,630
为了首领和首领夫人
To the chief and chieftess!

1048
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:27,100
好样的
Good on you!

1049
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:30,570
来吧  埋在我浓密的假胡子里哭吧
Come, cry into my full, thick beard.

1050
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:32,840
太美了
It's so beautiful!

1051
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:35,080
恶心
Gross.

1052
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:37,250
好吧  你赢了
Okay, you win.

1053
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:39,750
我喜欢感性的人
I like sensitive guys.

1054
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:41,590
我还以为永远不会有这一天了
I thought it would never happen.

1055
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:43,120
终于啊
Finally, right?

1056
01:30:13,350 --> 01:30:15,990
我小时候  世界上是有龙的
There were dragons when I was a boy.

1057
01:30:18,990 --> 01:30:21,320
那些伟大的天空之龙
Ah, there were great, grim sky dragons

1058
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:25,400
像大鸟一样在悬崖上筑巢
that nested on the clifftops like gigantic, scary birds.

1059
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,650
棕色的小龙
Little, brown, scuttly dragons

1060
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:32,840
成群结队地捕老鼠吃
that hunted down the mice and rats in well-organized packs.

1061
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:35,270
还有无比巨大的海龙
Preposterously huge sea dragons

1062
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:40,240
甚至是大蓝鲸的二十多倍大
that were 20 times as big as the big blue whale.

1063
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:42,750
有人说他们回到了海中
Some say they crawled back into the sea,

1064
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:46,350
没有给人类留下一块骨头或尖牙来纪念他们
leaving not a bone nor a fang for men to remember them by.

1065
01:30:47,670 --> 01:30:51,050
也有人说这只是一些传说
Others say they were nothing but folktales to begin with.

1066
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:53,590
我觉得无所谓
Ah, I'm okay with that.

1067
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:19,150
伙计
Hey there, bud.

1068
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:27,230
还记得我吗
Remember me?

1069
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:30,530
没事的
It's okay.

1070
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:44,940
我见到你也很高兴  伙计
Hey, I am glad to see you, too, bud.

1071
01:31:45,430 --> 01:31:47,380
他不会吃掉你爸爸的
He's not gonna eat your father.

1072
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:50,490
尾巴还能用吗
How's the tail holding up?

1073
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:53,050
也许需要加点油  或者拧紧一点
Probably could use some oil and a little fine-tuning.

1074
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:55,980
看  没事的  他们是朋友
Look, it's okay. They're friends.

1075
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:02,830
来
Here.

1076
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:04,800
去吧  没事的
Go on. It's all right.

1077
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:05,500
来吧
Come.

1078
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,830
他不会伤害你们的
He won't hurt you.

1079
01:32:08,830 --> 01:32:10,500
伸出你们的手
Hold your hands out.

1080
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:13,040
像这样
Like this.

1081
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,940
没错
That's it.

1082
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:19,880
让他来接近你们
Let him come to you.

1083
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:14,230
传说
Legend says

1084
01:33:14,230 --> 01:33:18,030
当发生地震  或者岩浆喷发
that when the ground quakes or lava spews from the earth,

1085
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:23,140
就是龙在告诉我们他们的存在
it's the dragons, letting us know they're still here,

1086
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:26,080
等待我们想明白该如何共处
waiting for us to figure out how to get along.

1087
01:33:34,230 --> 01:33:37,140
没错  这个世界认为就算龙存在
Yes, the world believes the dragons are gone,

1088
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:39,290
也已经完全消失了
if they ever existed at all.

1089
01:33:39,910 --> 01:33:44,290
但我伯克人知道  不是这样的
But we Berkians, we know otherwise.

1090
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:47,460
我们会一直守护着这个秘密  直到时机成熟
And we'll guard this secret until the time comes

1091
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:51,470
龙能够平安回归这个世界
when dragons can return in peace.
