在来电显示上应该有他的号码

254

{\r原文字幕}Oh, my God. These women are so pathetic.

501
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,990
我们说的越少越好
{\r原文字幕}The less we say, the better.

502
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,530
我们不需要让她们知道我们的私事
{\r原文字幕}We don't need them knowing our personal business.

那女人可行了
{\r原文字幕}'Cause she's a real piece of work.

532
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,300
她在她女儿小时候抛弃了她
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, abandoned her own daughter when she was just a kid.

533
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,550
珊楠一辈子都在寄养家庭里
{\r原文字幕}Shannan was in and out of foster homes her whole life.

{\r原文字幕}Doesn't even care how Shannan made it.

536
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,730
只要她能分到钱
{\r原文字幕}Just as long as she shared the wealth.

537
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,230
我的女儿有3部手机

538
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,700
她在克雷格信息网工作
{\r原文字幕}She was working on the... Craigslist.

539
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,530
莫琳也是这样
{\r原文字幕}Yes, so did Maureen.

540
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,080
梅利莎也是
{\r原文字幕}So did Melissa.

541
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,580
她们都这样  所以她们的结局也都一样
{\r原文字幕}They all did. That's why they're all so the same,

542
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,710
因为在网上  你什么都能买到
{\r原文字幕}because online, you can practically go shopping.

543
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,960
他们迟早会抓住这个人的
{\r原文字幕}Sooner or later, they're gonna get this guy.

544
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,290
他们可以
{\r原文字幕}There's gotta be some...

545
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,500
追踪电脑
{\r原文字幕}computer trace they can do.

546
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,550
不是  他们不是用邮件联系的
{\r原文字幕}Mm-mm. They don't get you on email.

547
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,470
是你要把自己的号码放网上  他们会打
{\r原文字幕}You post a number, then they call.

548
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,730
而且还是很难追踪的
{\r原文字幕}Which is untraceable

549
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:56,220
因为女孩们都是用一次性电话的
{\r原文字幕}because the girls work on burner phones.

550
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,050
你懂不少啊
{\r原文字幕}Look at you, knowing your shit.

551
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,220
他们认为女孩们都是瘾君子
{\r原文字幕}They think they're all drug addicts.

552
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,340
梅利莎从来没碰过毒品
{\r原文字幕}Melissa wasn't even into drugs.

553
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,230
莫琳也没有
{\r原文字幕}Neither was Maureen.

554
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,190
她只是喝酒
{\r原文字幕}She drank.

555
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,150
喝酒总比毒品好  因为喝酒合法
{\r原文字幕}Drinking's better than drugs because it's legal.

556
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,780
但是可卡因才能让生意做下去
{\r原文字幕}But coke is the best way to keep a call going.

557
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,740
能真的赚到钱
{\r原文字幕}Make some real bank.

558
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:17,030
爱信不信  你们的女孩子都懂
{\r原文字幕}Your girls knew that, whether you want to believe it or not.

559
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,210
他们告诉我梅根去她想去的地方了
{\r原文字幕}They told me Megan was where she wants to be.

560
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,870
还有
{\r原文字幕}That, uh...

561
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,170
她不爱我
{\r原文字幕}That she didn't love me.

562
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,670
虽然很伤心  但我感到了一点解脱
{\r原文字幕}As sad as it is, I feel some kind of relief.

563
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,260
至少警察终于关注了
{\r原文字幕}At least they're finally paying attention.

564
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,260
你在开玩笑吗
{\r原文字幕}Are you shitting me?

565
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,360
如果你觉得他们在
{\r原文字幕}If you think they give one goddamn

566
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,180
关注这些女孩吗  你就是在妄想
{\r原文字幕}about these girls, you're delusional.

567
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,940
他们都没在寻找女孩们
{\r原文字幕}They weren't searching for them.

568
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,110
警察就是停在路边
{\r原文字幕}A cop stopped along the side of the road

569
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,610
让他的狗去拉屎的时候
{\r原文字幕}to let his dog take a shit.

570
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,780
意外地发现她们的
{\r原文字幕}He accidentally found them.

571
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,190
我的意思就是
{\r原文字幕}What I meant was...

572
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:59,030
至少这件事被报道了  人们都知道了
{\r原文字幕}at least it's on the news and people are aware of it.

573
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,660
你看过这些新闻吗
{\r原文字幕}Have you watched the news?

574
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,990
都是在说  "他是个警察"  "他是抓捕者"
{\r原文字幕}It's all, "He's a cop," "He's a clammer,"

575
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,620
他是这  他是那
{\r原文字幕}he's this, he's that.

576
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,370
全都是  "他"  "他"  "他"
{\r原文字幕}It's all "him," "him," "him."

577
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,540
那我们的女孩呢  谁在谈论她们
{\r原文字幕}What about our girls? Who's talking about them?

578
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,860
当他们谈论到女孩们时
{\r原文字幕}And when they do,

579
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,090
都是在说  "妓女"  "卖淫者"

583
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,850
他们根本不关心
{\r原文字幕}They don't care.

584
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,730
他们都在责怪女孩们
{\r原文字幕}They blame them.

585
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,690
作为母亲
{\r原文字幕}And it's our job, as mothers,

586
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,480
作为姐妹  我们要做的就是

去他们的前院
{\r原文字幕}to their front fucking yard.

591
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,360
谁叫了媒体
{\r原文字幕}Who tipped them off?

592
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,280
这是一个私人社区  我会叫警察的

{\r原文字幕}Go ahead. It'll take them an hour to get here.

这里有个疯女人要糟践橡树海滩

00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,300
十二分钟
{\r原文字幕}Twelve minutes.

604
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,310
现在我们都知道  你可以及时出现
{\r原文字幕}Now we both know you can show up on time

605
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,510
还有你的秘书不是个白痴
{\r原文字幕}and your secretary's not a retard.

606
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:53,140
我们可以回我办公室谈吗
{\r原文字幕}Can we just go back to my office and talk about this?

607
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,430
我们就在这谈
{\r原文字幕}We'll talk right here.

608
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,230
这是一个
{\r原文字幕}This is a...

609
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,480
这是一个私人社区
{\r原文字幕}This is a private community.

610
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,610
那你为什么不逮捕我
{\r原文字幕}Well, then why don't you arrest me?

611
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,690
听好了  我来这儿是帮你的
{\r原文字幕}Listen, I came here to do you a favor.

612
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,900
我不想看到你戴着手铐被拖走
{\r原文字幕}I don't want to see you hauled away in handcuffs.

613
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:08,360
你不明白当那些穿制服的警察来到这
{\r原文字幕}Don't you understand that when the uniforms get here,

614
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,390
你就会因非法侵入而被定罪
{\r原文字幕}they're gonna cite you for trespassing.

615
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,080
好吧  我直话直说
{\r原文字幕}Okay, let me get this straight.

616
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,990
我女儿打电话求救
{\r原文字幕}My daughter calls for help

617
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,160
可你们花了一个小时才到这
{\r原文字幕}but it takes you an hour to get here,

618
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,920
但是戴普夫特·外福斯打电话给你们
{\r原文字幕}but the Stepford Wives call you

619
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,540
你们出现得比做三明治还快
{\r原文字幕}and you show up in less time than it takes to make a sandwich!

620
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,890
不管你是在找什么
{\r原文字幕}Whatever it is that you're looking for,

621
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,630
吉尔伯特小姐  都不在这
{\r原文字幕}Mrs. Gilbert, it is not here.

622
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,460
那为什么我14岁的孩子刚刚
{\r原文字幕}Okay, then why did my 14-year-old

623
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,090
在你们放走的那个男人的家前
{\r原文字幕}just find her sister's earring

624
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,430
找到了她姐姐的耳环
{\r原文字幕}outside the home of the man that you just set free?

625
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:33,390
珊楠在早上4点51分时尖叫地穿过这里
{\r原文字幕}Shannan went screaming through here at 4:51 in the morning,

626
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,270
但没有人帮她
{\r原文字幕}and no one helped her.

627
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,480
有人感到愤怒吗  有人表示担心吗
{\r原文字幕}Where is the outrage? Where's the concern?

628
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,480
要是有四具尸体出现在我家附近
{\r原文字幕}Four dead bodies show up in my neighborhood,

629
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,230
我早就在屋顶上吼起来了  到底发生了啥
{\r原文字幕}I'd be shouting from the rooftops to get to the bottom of it.

630
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,320
他们在隐瞒什么
{\r原文字幕}What are they hiding?

631
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,450
你在隐瞒什么  吉尔伯特小姐
{\r原文字幕}What are you hiding, Mrs. Gilbert?

632
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:53,330
你从来没告诉我珊楠是在寄养家庭长大的
{\r原文字幕}You never told me that Shannan grew up in foster care.

633
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,370
你也从来没告诉过我
{\r原文字幕}You never told me that you nearly got shit-canned

634
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,290
你差点因为部门管理不善而被解雇
{\r原文字幕}for mismanaging your department.

635
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,170
继续努力吧  长官
{\r原文字幕}Keep up the good work, Commissioner.

636
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,310
操
{\r原文字幕}Fuck's sake.

637
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:26,110
我把所有我看到的门牌号都写下来了
{\r原文字幕}I wrote down every house number and license plate I saw.

638
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:29,200
我们需要和这些人  还有这些人谈一谈
{\r原文字幕}We need to talk to these people and these people.

639
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,240
他们有可能看到过她
{\r原文字幕}They might've seen her.

640
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,490
没人会说的  他们只希望我们走远点
{\r原文字幕}No one's gonna talk 'cause they want us out.

641
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,470
这些人都是一伙的
{\r原文字幕}These guys are looking out for each other.

642
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,250
他们都有朋友在萨福克县警察局
{\r原文字幕}They all have friends in Suffolk PD.

643
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:41,830
警察说每个人都通过了测谎仪测试
{\r原文字幕}The police said everybody passed lie detector tests.

644
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,380
对  但是每个人都可以通过测谎仪测试
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, but anybody can pass a lie detector test

645
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,250
只要他们问你  "你叫什么名字
{\r原文字幕}if all they ask you is "What's your name,

646
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,380
还有你喜欢的颜色"
{\r原文字幕}and your favorite color."

647
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,760
这听上去好像是珊楠在逃离她的司机
{\r原文字幕}It sounds like Shannan's running from her driver.

648
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,010
你可以在911通话记录里听到他的声音
{\r原文字幕}You can hear him in the 911 call.

649
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,260
这没道理
{\r原文字幕}That makes no sense.

650
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:58,470
不管情况多糟糕  我都会去找我的司机
{\r原文字幕}I don't care how fucked up I am, my ass is going to that driver

651
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,590
因为他是我唯一的出路
{\r原文字幕}because he's my way out.

652
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,640
司机是安全保障  这也是雇他的原因
{\r原文字幕}He's my safety. That's what you pay him for.

653
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,220
也许他生气了  因为她没付钱给他
{\r原文字幕}Well, maybe he was mad she didn't pay him.

654
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,930
为什么突然间变成了她没付钱给司机
{\r原文字幕}Why would she all of a sudden not pay her driver?

655
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,150
也许因为方式她需要给家里些钱
{\r原文字幕}Maybe because she was bringing money home.

656
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,110
所以你并不知道她付没付钱
{\r原文字幕}Okay, do you don't know she didn't pay him.

657
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:19,780
你只是在猜罢了
{\r原文字幕}You're just guessing.

658
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:21,200
这只是假设
{\r原文字幕}Well, I'm assuming.

659
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:25,280
她也可能被迫吸毒  喝醉了或嗑上头了
{\r原文字幕}She's probably forced to get stoned, drunk, high--

660
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,420
-没有强迫这一说  -好吧随便了
{\r原文字幕}- Not forced. - Okay, whatever.

661
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,550
我只是说  我也经过那样的生活
{\r原文字幕}I'm just saying, I've lived it.

662
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,760
我也只是说  你不是珊楠
{\r原文字幕}Well, I'm just saying, you're not Shannan.

663
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,170
玛丽  我可怜你
{\r原文字幕}Mari, I feel for you...

664
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,850
比可怜我自己
{\r原文字幕}more than I feel for myself

665
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,090
或在场其他人更甚
{\r原文字幕}or any of the other ladies here,

666
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,690
因为珊楠仍然毫无音讯
{\r原文字幕}because Shannan's still missing.

667
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,560
知道了总比一无所知要好
{\r原文字幕}And knowing is better than not knowing.

668
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,110
但是你不会真的觉得
{\r原文字幕}But you don't really think that...

669
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,310
我是说  或许接受这件事不会有其他转机
{\r原文字幕}I'm just saying it might be good to accept

670
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,530
对你也许会更好
{\r原文字幕}that there isn't another ending to all this.

671
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,880
你他妈的知道这么多  是什么狗结局啊
{\r原文字幕}What's that ending, if you know so goddamned much?

10672
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,510
{\an2\b1\pos(30,50)\fr30\fs14\shad0\bord0}未知来电

673
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:10,760
你好
{\r原文字幕}Hello?

674
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,400
是玛丽·吉尔伯特吗
{\r原文字幕}Is this Mari Gilbert?

675
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:14,940
是的
{\r原文字幕}Yes.

676
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,780
我是乔·斯卡利斯
{\r原文字幕}My name's Joe Scalise.

677
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:20,200
有些事情  你可能感兴趣
{\r原文字幕}I have some information you're gonna want to hear.

678
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,080
我是乔·布鲁尔的邻居  约翰
{\r原文字幕}I'm a neighbor of Joe Brewer, the john.

679
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,390
我从你发布的传单里  找到了你的号码
{\r原文字幕}I got your number from one of those fliers you posted.

680
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:24,310
萨福克县警局没有回我电话
{\r原文字幕}Suffolk PD don't return my calls no more.

681
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,340
你要知道的是  在橡树海滩
{\r原文字幕}You're gonna learn that the good people of Oak Beach,

682
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,720
善良的人也许只学会了一件事
{\r原文字幕}if they live by one thing, it's this:

683
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,310
就是对那些可能
{\r原文字幕}be wary of those who would...

684
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,490
可能会破坏美好事物的人保持警惕
{\r原文字幕}who would ruin a very good thing.

685
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:39,850
夫人  他们最害怕的
{\r原文字幕}You are, madam,

686
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:43,160
就是像您这样穷追不舍的人
{\r原文字幕}the wayfarer they've been dreading.

687
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,840
我不知道珊楠是个妓女
{\r原文字幕}I didn't know Shannan was a prostitute.

688
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:58,050
我也不知道她有往家里寄钱
{\r原文字幕}I didn't know she was bringing home money.

689
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:01,880
她从没让任何人帮她
{\r原文字幕}She doesn't let anyone help her.

690
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:06,010
我还以为我们一直是一起的
{\r原文字幕}I thought we were doing this together.

691
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,220
太恼人了
{\r原文字幕}So fucking annoying.

692
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:11,970
抱歉
{\r原文字幕}Sorry.

693
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,940
我们不是在跟踪你们
{\r原文字幕}We weren't following you.

694
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,110
有点算吧
{\r原文字幕}We kind of were.

695
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:19,520
你俩在聊什么
{\r原文字幕}What are you two talking about?

696
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,850
家庭
{\r原文字幕}Families.

697
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,440
是啊
{\r原文字幕}Yeah.

698
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,950
跟我说说珊楠的优点吧
{\r原文字幕}Tell me something nice about Shannan.

699
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,580
她提前两年从高中毕业
{\r原文字幕}She graduated high school two years early.

700
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:33,990
她非常聪明
{\r原文字幕}She was smart.

701
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,210
而且她是我们家第一个大学生
{\r原文字幕}And she was the first one in our family to go to college.

702
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,260
我叫她  "歌姬"
{\r原文字幕}I called her "Diva."

703
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:45,970
因为她就是我眼中的歌者
{\r原文字幕}Because she's such a little diva.

704
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,590
安珀身高一米五
{\r原文字幕}Amber stood 4'11"

705
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:52,730
连90斤都没有
{\r原文字幕}and weighed 100 pounds soaking wet.

706
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:57,220
她的腿看起来和小鸡腿一样
{\r原文字幕}Her legs looked like little chicken drumsticks.

707
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,950
她失踪那天我还跟她说话了
{\r原文字幕}I spoke to her the day she went missing.

708
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:08,030
我们当时在吵架
{\r原文字幕}We were in a fight.

709
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,850
你现在走的地方
{\r原文字幕}You're walking through

710
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:32,720
是凶手抛尸的地方
{\r原文字幕}what used to be the killer's dumping ground.

711
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:35,020
他只会把尸体搬到路边上
{\r原文字幕}He only moved the bodies to the road

712
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,940
因为这一片区域被划成
{\r原文字幕}because this whole area is set to be

713
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,020
"蚊子计划"的范围
{\r原文字幕}drained as part of the mosquito project.

714
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,740
意思是人们在闲逛时
{\r原文字幕}That means people poking around,

715
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,450
总会发现不该看见的东西
{\r原文字幕}seeing things they shouldn't.

716
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:51,200
在这
{\r原文字幕}Here.

717
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:52,750
看
{\r原文字幕}Look.

718
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,960
这是他储存物资的地方
{\r原文字幕}This is where he keeps his supplies.

719
00:45:58,170 --> 00:45:59,250
那  在哪呢
{\r原文字幕}But... where?

720
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,340
快进去  快
{\r原文字幕}Go, go, go.

721
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,640
-这种事经常发生  -怎么了
{\r原文字幕}- Shit like that happens. - What's up?

722
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,850
天哪
{\r原文字幕}Oh, God.

723
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:14,560
冷静  别
{\r原文字幕}Easy. Just...

724
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:31,080
乔·布鲁尔没有杀害珊楠
{\r原文字幕}Joe Brewer didn't kill Shannan.

725
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:33,490
他可能是个反社会者
{\r原文字幕}He may be a sociopath,

726
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,250
但他不是精神病患者
{\r原文字幕}but he's not the psychopath.

727
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:37,620
这应该归罪于  皮特·哈克特
{\r原文字幕}That honor goes to Peter Hackett.

728
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:40,910
哈克特医生
{\r原文字幕}Dr. Hackett?

729
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:51,430
听着  我知道你和你的下属并不在意
{\r原文字幕}Look, I know you and your buddies don't give a shit.

730
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:54,100
别担心  你不用忍受我多久了
{\r原文字幕}Don't worry. You're not gonna have to put up with me much longer.

731
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,050
但是现在  这还是我的案子
{\r原文字幕}But for the moment, this is my case.

732

{\r原文字幕}It's nice to see you again, Ms. Gilbert.

737
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,730

{\r原文字幕}I saw spools of burlap in a shed by his house.

738

{\r原文字幕}Every clammer, contractor, landscaper

{\r原文字幕}I tell you what, why don't you let

743
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,830
警察来做警察该做的事呢  亲爱的
{\r原文字幕}the policemen do the police work, honey?

744
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:20,790

{\r原文字幕}- Why don't you suck my dick? - Classy.

745
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,040
这个人在她失踪第二天早上
{\r原文字幕}This is the guy who called me

746
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,120
打过电话给我
{\r原文字幕}the morning after she disappeared.

747
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,630
他说他帮助过她
{\r原文字幕}He said that he helped her.

748
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,550
拜托  你会把它记录下来吗

{\r原文字幕}So I know it's a mood stabilizer.

755
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:20,940
她告诉我你带她去看心理医生了
{\r原文字幕}She told me you took her to a psychiatrist.

756
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:22,520
你为什么不告诉我
{\r原文字幕}Why didn't you tell me?

757
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,900
没什么好说的
{\r原文字幕}There's nothing to tell.

758
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:28,690
需要六周药物才能见效
{\r原文字幕}It takes six weeks for the medication to have any effect,

759
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,990
到时候我们才能知道有没有用
{\r原文字幕}so we'll know more then.

{\r原文字幕}Ever there's a problem, he's always the first one to call.

764
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:34,760

{\r原文字幕}"Help me. Help me. They're going to kill me."

772
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:56,990

{\r原文字幕}So I sat her down on the porch,

773
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:58,860
然后我说  "放松点"

我告诉她我已经报警了

{\r原文字幕}As soon as I said that, she ran.

777
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,540

就往那边跑了

780
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,390
等等  那些监控摄像头能用吗

00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:09,920
她一小时前发布了这个
{\r原文字幕}She posted this an hour ago.

848
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:12,850
天哪  金
{\r原文字幕}Oh, Kim.

849
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:14,310
她在想什么呢
{\r原文字幕}What is she thinking?

850
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:19,930
我平时很忙
{\r原文字幕}I'm a busy guy.

851
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:22,430
我每天拨打接听很多电话
{\r原文字幕}I make and take a lot of calls.

852
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:26,320
但怎么会打给一个我不认识的女人呢
{\r原文字幕}But how would I call a woman I don't even know?

853
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:27,900
我是一个医生
{\r原文字幕}I'm a doctor...

854
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,030
不是魔术师
{\r原文字幕}not a magician.

855
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:36,040
她说
{\r原文字幕}She said that...

856
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,710
是你告诉她  你帮助了他女儿
{\r原文字幕}that you told her that you helped her daughter.

857
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:43,040
我希望她不会
{\r原文字幕}I hope she doesn't blame herself

858
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:45,620
因为她女儿的事而自责
{\r原文字幕}for the life her daughter led.

859
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,710
但是
{\r原文字幕}But...

860
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,760
有其母必有其女
{\r原文字幕}apples don't fall far from the tree.

861
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,250
我说的对吗
{\r原文字幕}Am I right?

862
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:00,470
所以  关于那晚你还记得些什么
{\r原文字幕}So, what do you remember from that night?

863
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:05,810
我想那是  我和芭芭拉在佛罗里达的时候
{\r原文字幕}I think that's when Barbara and I were in Florida.

864
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,730
你钓过马林鱼吗
{\r原文字幕}You ever been marlin fishing?

865
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:10,990
但是那时候你在这里
{\r原文字幕}But you were here.

866
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,810
因为当他女儿的男友
{\r原文字幕}Because when the daughter's boyfriend

867
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:15,990
第二天过来找她
{\r原文字幕}came the next morning to look for her,

868
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,580
难道你没有帮忙找她吗
{\r原文字幕}didn't you offer to help search for her?

869
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,420
佛罗里达可能是
{\r原文字幕}Florida might have been...

870
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:26,670
一周前的事了  哦  好吧
{\r原文字幕}the week before. Oh, okay.

871
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:30,010
是的  我看到这个孩子在附近转来转去
{\r原文字幕}That's right. I saw this kid tooling around,

872
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:33,590
他给我讲了他的故事  我无法拒绝他
{\r原文字幕}and he told me his story and I couldn't turn him away.

873
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,180
我们这里都这么做  我们帮助大家
{\r原文字幕}That's what we do around here, we help people.

874
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:41,770
如我直言  哈克特医生
{\r原文字幕}With all due respect, Dr. Hackett,

875
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:45,110
你住在一个封闭的小区里
{\r原文字幕}you're living in a gated community

876
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:45,940
小区有一块牌子  上面写着:
{\r原文字幕}with a sign that says:

877
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,820
"要么友好  要么离开"
{\r原文字幕}"Be nice or leave."

878
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:52,610
我不知道这是否传达了特定的信息
{\r原文字幕}I don't know that that sends that particular message.

879
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,070
听着  警察已经来过了
{\r原文字幕}Look... the police came.

880
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,990
他们说一切正常
{\r原文字幕}They said everything was kosher.

881
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:57,910
是的
{\r原文字幕}Right.

882
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:00,500
但是
{\r原文字幕}But...

883
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,130
你为什么不给他们看监控录像
{\r原文字幕}why didn't you show them the security footage?

884
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:06,920
为什么他们没有要求提供监控录像
{\r原文字幕}Why didn't they ask for it?

885
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:10,670
这不是我的调查  独行侠
{\r原文字幕}This is not my investigation, kemosabe.

886
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,840
你是头儿
{\r原文字幕}You're the head honcho.

887
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,550
也许你应该好好教育你的手下
{\r原文字幕}Maybe you ought to teach your cops better.

888
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,680
一个女孩儿失踪了
{\r原文字幕}A girl goes missing

889
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:21,520
然而你有一卷监控录像
{\r原文字幕}and you have a tape.

890
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:27,860
你是说你看都没看过吗
{\r原文字幕}Are you telling me that you didn't at least watch it?

891
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:32,240
那可是诱导取证
{\r原文字幕}That would be tampering with evidence.

892
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:35,030
我说的对吗
{\r原文字幕}Am I right?

10893
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,960
{\fs14\bord0\shad0\b1\pos(55.8,194.1)}橡树岛海滩协会的私人财产
禁止非法侵入

894
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:09,940
皮特·哈克特是一个自负的吹牛大王
{\r原文字幕}Peter Hackett is a self-important blowhard.

895
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,570
他没有带头指控  这个行为本身
{\r原文字幕}The very fact that he's not leading the charge in this

896
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:16,490
就是你需要关注的关键证据
{\r原文字幕}is all the evidence you need to point a finger.

897
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:18,370
好的  如果这是真的
{\r原文字幕}Okay, if that's true,

898
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:21,200
为什么珊楠没有和其他女孩在一起
{\r原文字幕}why wasn't Shannan found with the other girls?

899
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,830
因为  袭击她是计划之外的事
{\r原文字幕}'Cause the attack on her didn't go as planned.

900
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:25,160
她逃出来了
{\r原文字幕}She'd gone off running.

901
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,750
有人见过她  警察来了
{\r原文字幕}People had seen her. The police came.

902
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:29,840
这太冒险了
{\r原文字幕}It just became too risky.

903
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,300
他声称  他为叛逆女孩营造了一个家
{\r原文字幕}He tells people that he runs a home for wayward girls.

904
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:36,010
他帮她们戒毒  他拯救了她们
{\r原文字幕}That he rehabs them. That he saves them.

905
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:38,340
他真正的意思是埋葬她们
{\r原文字幕}What he really means is he buries them.

906
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,890
他的客厅里有一张检查台
{\r原文字幕}He's got an examination table in his living room.

907
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,020
他所谓的"叛逆女孩之家"
{\r原文字幕}And his "home for wayward girls"

908
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,520
其实是"墓地"的代号
{\r原文字幕}is really just code for "graveyard."

909
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,020
那么珊楠在哪呢
{\r原文字幕}Then where is Shannan?

910
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,440
在他的后院
{\r原文字幕}In his backyard.

911
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:55,280
那片沼泽
{\r原文字幕}The marsh.

912
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:10,500
那是唯一还没有被搜查的地方
{\r原文字幕}It's the one place they haven't searched.

913
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,810
我们发现了另一个女孩
{\r原文字幕}We found another one.

914
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,480
尸体碎块  被肢解了
{\r原文字幕}Pieces, dismembered.

915
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:35,030
取证科说匹配上了一双腿
{\r原文字幕}Forensics says it matches a pair of severed legs

916
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:36,690
在96年的一个装着些腿的塑料袋里
{\r原文字幕}found in a plastic bag in '96.

917
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:40,740
-1996年吗  -是的
{\r原文字幕}- '96? - Yeah, '96.

918
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:45,330
你是说有人在海洋公园
{\r原文字幕}Are you telling me that somebody's been dumping bodies

919
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:48,370
持续抛尸了他妈15年吗
{\r原文字幕}in Ocean Parkway for 15 fucking years?

920
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:51,750
看起来像是这样的
{\r原文字幕}It looks like it.

921
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:53,710
这是什么
{\r原文字幕}Hey, what is this?

922
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,830
珊楠·吉尔伯特的医疗记录
{\r原文字幕}Shannan Gilbert's medical records?

923
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:56,510
不是吧  你认真的吗
{\r原文字幕}Come on, seriously?

924
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:58,220
你真的以为  你可以
{\r原文字幕}You really think you're gonna find

925
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,050
从这些医疗记录里找到答案吗
{\r原文字幕}any answers in these medical records?

926
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,230
听着  如果她还活着
{\r原文字幕}Look, if she was still around,

927
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:04,470
我们现在已经找到她了
{\r原文字幕}we would have found her by now.

928
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,180
我的意思是  实话实说
{\r原文字幕}I mean, honestly,

929
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:09,100
谁会花这么多时间找一个失踪的妓女
{\r原文字幕}who spends this much time looking for a missing hooker?

930
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:21,320
如果你是来给我说教的  省省吧
{\r原文字幕}If you're here to give me some big speech, save it.

931
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,780
我已经听别人那听过了
{\r原文字幕}I already heard it from the others.

932
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:27,330
金  我知道你很坚强
{\r原文字幕}Kim, I know you're strong,

933
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:30,620
你以为你能应付任何事情  但是
{\r原文字幕}and you think you can handle whatever comes your way, but...

934
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,380
这太愚蠢了
{\r原文字幕}this is just plain stupid.

935
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:37,800
每个人都有自己的命运
{\r原文字幕}Everyone has their destiny.

936
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:41,420
也许安珀的是安珀的  也许这是我的
{\r原文字幕}Maybe Amber's was Amber's, and maybe this is mine.

937
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:46,470
你不是真心相信的
{\r原文字幕}You don't really believe that.

938
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,540
你这么做  是因为内心深处
{\r原文字幕}You're only doing this because deep down,

939
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:53,270
你认为你就值这么多
{\r原文字幕}you think that's all you're worth,

940
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:55,560
但是这不是真的
{\r原文字幕}but that's not true.

941
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:00,440
你给珊楠说这个了吗
{\r原文字幕}You tell that to Shannan?

942
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,710
是我把安珀扯进来的  你知道吗
{\r原文字幕}I got Amber into this, you know?

943
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:18,550
你尝试过了  玛丽
{\r原文字幕}You tried, Mari.

944
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,720
-给你  -谢谢
{\r原文字幕}- Here. - Thank you.

945
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:31,520
林恩的男朋友认识个做衣服的人
{\r原文字幕}Lynn's boyfriend knew a guy.

946
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,060
我们都穿着它们去守夜
{\r原文字幕}We're all wearing them to the vigil.

947
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:39,770
-打开电视  -为什么
{\r原文字幕}- Turn on the TV. - Why?

948
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:44,780
也没有证据表明
{\r原文字幕}...there's also no evidence to suggest

949
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:47,620
这是同一个杀手干的
{\r原文字幕}that it's the work of a single killer.

950
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,240
虽然  珊楠·吉尔伯特
{\r原文字幕}Although Shannan GIlbert

951
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:54,160
恰巧在同一时间同一地点失踪了
{\r原文字幕}coincidentally went missing at the same time in the same place,

952
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:56,210
但是她不符合受害者的侧写特征
{\r原文字幕}she doesn't fit the victim profile.

953
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:59,000
她是唯一一个没有单独来橡树海滩的人
{\r原文字幕}She was the only one who didn't come to Oak Beach alone

954
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,380
她还有个司机
{\r原文字幕}because she had a driver.

955
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:01,760
哦  天呐
{\r原文字幕}Oh, God.

956
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,130
我们将继续寻找她  但是
{\r原文字幕}We will continue to look for her, but...

957
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,800
除非我们找到谋杀的证据
{\r原文字幕}until we find evidence of foul play,

958
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:10,180
吉尔伯特女士将不再被认为
{\r原文字幕}Miss Gilbert will no longer be considered

959
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,390
与这个案子相关
{\r原文字幕}a part of this larger case.

960
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:13,430
局长
{\r原文字幕}Commissioner...

961
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,270
-暂时就这些  -操
{\r原文字幕}- That's all for the moment. - Fuck!

962
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:22,650
是的  我是玛丽·吉尔伯特
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, this is Mari Gilbert...

963
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,030
你还好吗
{\r原文字幕}Hey, you okay?

964
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:29,250
他们停止寻找珊楠了
{\r原文字幕}They stopped looking for Shannan.

965
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:31,080
他们不再找她了
{\r原文字幕}They're not looking for her anymore.

966
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,080
-没事  -我们要做什么
{\r原文字幕}- It's okay. - What are we gonna do?

967
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:36,370
为什么他们
{\r原文字幕}Why did they...

968
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,080
所以我们来这了
{\r原文字幕}That's why we're here.

969
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:40,670
好吗
{\r原文字幕}Okay?

970
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:42,710
是的  你说的对
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, right.

971
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,680
没事的

{\r原文字幕}How can you say Shannan's not connected?

{\r原文字幕}it's not evidence of guilt.

985

{\r原文字幕}with no clothes on and nearly froze half to death

1002
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,790

正在外面上双轮夜班

{\r原文字幕}Yeah. Look, Mari, I know that you gave her away to foster care,

1005
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,170
我知道你认为把她带回家
{\r原文字幕}and I know you think it's your

1006
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,080
是你的责任
{\r原文字幕}responsibility to bring her home again.

1007
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,160
但是这不是你的责任
{\r原文字幕}But this isn't on you.

1008
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:41,000
我是她的妈妈
{\r原文字幕}I'm her mother.

1009
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:43,630
都是因为我
{\r原文字幕}It's all on me.

1010
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:58,560
你把她送走的
{\r原文字幕}You gave her away?

1011
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,020
看在上帝的份上  舍尔
{\r原文字幕}Oh, for fuck's sake, Sherre,

1012
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,350
我们能不能现在不讨论这个
{\r原文字幕}can we not do this right now?

1013
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:04,770
你骗了我
{\r原文字幕}You lied to me.

1014
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,900
我没有骗你
{\r原文字幕}I didn't lie.

1015
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:09,820
你告诉我是政府带走她的
{\r原文字幕}You told me the state took her.

1016
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:15,070
那我该说什么
{\r原文字幕}What was I supposed to say?

1017
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,580
"妈妈把你姐姐送走了
{\r原文字幕}"Mommy gave your sister away

1018
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:19,870
因为她得不到她需要的帮助"
{\r原文字幕}because she couldn't get her the help she needed."

1019
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:22,460
你觉得我想让珊楠那样吗
{\r原文字幕}Do you think I wanted that for Shannan?

1020
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:25,170
你认为我没有
{\r原文字幕}Do you think I didn't try to do everything in my power

1021
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:26,880
尽我所能帮助她吗
{\r原文字幕}to get her the help she needed?

1022
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:30,960
珊楠有躁郁症
{\r原文字幕}Shannan was bipolar.

1023
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:32,510
她一团糟
{\r原文字幕}She was a mess.

1024
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:35,340
我带她去看我负担不起的医生
{\r原文字幕}I took her to doctors I couldn't afford

1025
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:37,390
给她吃她不愿吃的药
{\r原文字幕}who gave her drugs that she wouldn't take

1026
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:40,560
那药有副作用  我都不忍心看
{\r原文字幕}that had side-effects that I couldn't stand to watch.

1027
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:43,640
我当时也只是个孩子
{\r原文字幕}I was just a kid.

1028
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,820
她需要的是爱
{\r原文字幕}What she needed was love.

1029
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,900
她一辈子里
{\r原文字幕}It was the only thing she ever wanted her whole...

1030
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:55,160
唯一想要的东西
{\r原文字幕}fucking life.

1031
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:58,280
你又怎么知道她想要什么
{\r原文字幕}Okay, but how do you know what she felt?

1032
01:05:58,370 --> 01:06:00,200
因为我也感受到了  妈妈
{\r原文字幕}Because I feel it too, Mom.

1033
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,960
珊楠可能走了  但我还在这里
{\r原文字幕}Shannan may be gone but I'm still here.

1034
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:08,960
我还在这里
{\r原文字幕}I'm still here.

1035

{\r原文字幕}These fucking women, they've brainwashed you.

1037
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:18,850
你想知道他们为什么这么坚决地要守夜吗
{\r原文字幕}You wanna know why they're so dead set on this vigil?

1038
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:20,970
这是他们否认现实的方法
{\r原文字幕}It's their way of denying

1039
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,020
否认自己是糟透了的母亲和姐姐的方式
{\r原文字幕}what god-awful mothers and sisters they were.

1040
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:24,150

1046
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,490
我希望她们是我的家人

你在暗示是我那晚追了那个女孩
{\r原文字幕}You're implying I chased after this girl.

1095
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:35,510
我自己走路都不利索
{\r原文字幕}I can't catch up to myself walking backwards.

1096
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,640

{\r原文字幕}- Yes, but-- - When I was young,

被困在一只小艇上
{\r原文字幕}I was... stranded on a skiff...

1098
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:49,940
四面是水
{\r原文字幕}in the water...

1099
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:51,770
一片漆黑
{\r原文字幕}in the dark.

1100
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:55,700
只有我一个人
{\r原文字幕}I was all alone

1101
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:58,740
很害怕自己  会死
{\r原文字幕}and scared I was... gonna die.

1102
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:00,700
然后  我看到了一条船
{\r原文字幕}Then I saw this boat.

1103
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:04,540
离我很远  但是
{\r原文字幕}It was far away, but...

我还是发射了照明弹
{\r原文字幕}I sent up a flare,

1106
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,420
他们来救我了
{\r原文字幕}and they came to save me.

1107
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:12,750
第二天

1108
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:16,630

{\r原文字幕}I enrolled in emergency medicine.

01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:31,190
如果她还活着  我们会找她他的
{\r原文字幕}If she's out there, we gotta find her.

1112
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,280
你是个大英雄
{\r原文字幕}You're the real hero.

{\r原文字幕}Nice to see you again.

1117
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,100
不要怕  我没带订书机来
{\r原文字幕}Don't worry. I left my staple gun at home.

1118
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:10,100

{\r原文字幕}So how did you get in my office?

1119

已经不是你的办公室了
{\r原文字幕}It's not your office anymore.

1120
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,150
对  是啊
{\r原文字幕}True. True.

1121
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:20,820
没错  他们是说要让我提前退休
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, they're putting me out to pasture, as they say.

1122
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:23,320
你觉得  世人会记住你什么
{\r原文字幕}What do you think you'll be most remembered for?

1123
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:25,870
你来干什么
{\r原文字幕}What can I help you with?

1124
01:16:29,330 --> 01:16:30,870
你为什么不派人去搜沼泽
{\r原文字幕}Why haven't you searched the marsh?

1125
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:34,590
这是橡树海滩里  唯一没被搜的地方
{\r原文字幕}It's the only place in Oak Beach you haven't searched.

1126
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:37,920
因为一个成年男人都无法穿过那里
{\r原文字幕}Because a grown man can't get through there,

1127
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:40,550
更别提一个90多斤的小女孩了
{\r原文字幕}never mind a 100-pound girl.

1128
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:43,590
是  但那就是珊楠最后出现的安科路旁边
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, but it borders Anchor Way where Shannan was last seen,

1129
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:46,010
而且还挨着皮特·哈克特住着的左舷路
{\r原文字幕}and Larboard Court where Peter Hackett lives.

1130
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:48,770
所以  还是因为哈克特
{\r原文字幕}Ah, so this is about Hackett.

1131
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:51,560
我们已经判定他无罪了
{\r原文字幕}We've already cleared him.

1132
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,940
什么  你们得去跟乔·斯卡利斯聊聊
{\r原文字幕}What... You gotta talk to Joe Scalise.

1133
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:57,860
乔·斯卡利斯是个偏执的阴谋论者
{\r原文字幕}Joe Scalise is a paranoid conspiracy freak.

1134
01:16:57,940 --> 01:16:59,530
他跟哈克特宿怨已久
{\r原文字幕}He and Hackett hate each other.

1135
01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:01,820
他们很多年前就因为土地问题吵过架
{\r原文字幕}Some dispute they had years ago over land.

1136
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,660
他恨不得哈克特死
{\r原文字幕}He wants to bury Hackett.

1137
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:05,070
也许他在把你当枪使呢
{\r原文字幕}Maybe he's giving you the shovel.

1138
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:07,540
那她的外套怎么说
{\r原文字幕}What about her jacket?

1139
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,490
如果哈克特和珊楠接触过
{\r原文字幕}If Hackett had contact with Shannan,

1140
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:11,960
那她的外套可以证明
{\r原文字幕}her jacket would prove it.

1141
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,920
上面会有皮肤细胞或衣服纤维之类的吧
{\r原文字幕}It would have skin cells or fibers on it or something.

1142
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,300
我们没有那件外套
{\r原文字幕}We don't have the jacket.

1143
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:21,700
他们一开始捡到外套的时候
{\r原文字幕}When they first picked it up,

1144
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:23,050
珊楠的失踪还没有正式立案
{\r原文字幕}Shannan wasn't officially missing

1145
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:24,840
现在外套不见了
{\r原文字幕}and it got lost.

1146
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:31,180
这算什么  是在掩饰无能  还是甩脱责任
{\r原文字幕}What is this, some kind of cover-up or just incompetence?

1147
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:33,980
赶紧去搜沼泽  否则我就去找媒体了
{\r原文字幕}Search the marsh or I'm going on the news.
