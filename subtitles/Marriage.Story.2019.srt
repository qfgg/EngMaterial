00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,170
我之所以爱妮可...
What I love about Nicole...

24
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,590
即便是令人尴尬的事  她也能让大家感到自在
she makes people feel comfortable about even embarrassing things.

25
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,350
你看上去很关爱动物
Hey, you look like you care about animals.

26
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,140
是的
Yes, I do.

27
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,690
当别人诉说时  她总能认真倾听
She really listens when someone is talking.

28
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,590
-愿意登记一下吗  -其实我...
- Do you want to sign up here? - You know what? I...

29
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,390
真巧  我登记过了
It's funny, I actually signed up for this

30
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,810
但我从没有收到过回复
but I never heard from you guys.

31
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,060
有时她会因此花费太多的时间
Sometimes she listens too much for too long.

32
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,640
好吧  如果你给我发电邮...
Okay, if you email me here...

33
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,390
非常感谢  祝你今天愉快  祝好运
Thank you so much. Have a good day. Good luck.

34
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,590
她是个好市民
She's a good citizen.

35
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,310
-打给他就好  -我不打
- Just call him. - I'm not calling.

36
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,940
当遇到棘手的家庭琐事时
She always knows the right thing to do

37
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,020
她总能知道该如何处理
when it comes to difficult family shit.

38
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,920
打给他
Call him.

39
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,270
当我犹豫不决时
I get stuck in my ways,

40
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,590
她知道何时该推我一把  何时该让我一个人静静
and she knows when to push me and when to leave me alone.

41
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,710
我们的头发都是她剪
She cuts all our hair.

42
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,270
她总是莫名其妙地
She's always inexplicably

43
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,210
泡一杯茶  却不喝
brewing a cup of tea that she doesn't drink.

44
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,850
对她来说  把袜子收好  或关上柜门  或洗碗
And it's not easy for her to put away a sock, or close a cabinet,

45
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,460
都不容易  但她会为了我努力去做
or do a dish, but she tries for me.

46
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,480
妮可在洛杉矶长大  身边都是演员
Nicole grew up in LA around actors,

47
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,060
导演  电影和电视

48
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,480
她和她的母亲桑德拉

49
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,210
以及她姐姐凯茜感情很好
and Cassie, her sister.

50
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,090
仔细看看包装
Note the wrapping.

51
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,880
妮可很会挑选礼物
Nicole gives great presents.

52
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,690
她作为母亲  会用心地陪孩子玩耍
She is a mother who plays, really plays.

53
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,300
-蜥蜴吗  -是的
- Lizard? - Yeah.

54
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,460
她从不厌烦  或对孩子说玩过头了
She never steps off playing or says it's too much.

55
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,710
-妈妈  -有时候肯定是玩过头了
- Mom. - And it must be too much some of the time.

56
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,550
"砍下了一颗圣诞树..."
"...chopped down a Christmas tree..."

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,710
好吧
All right.

58
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,500
很好  二  三  四  什么
Nice. Two, three, four... What?

59
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,520
这是在逗我吗  我刚坐过牢
Are you kidding me? I was just in jail!

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,810
该死的
Goddamn it!

61
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,800
-别笑话我  别笑了  -她争强好胜
- Do not laugh at me! Stop it! - She's competitive.

62
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,310
她胳膊很有力  很会开罐头
She's amazing at opening jars because of her strong arms,

63
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,090
我觉得她这一点很性感
which I've always found very sexy.

64
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,560
她总是把冰箱塞得满满的
She keeps the fridge over-full.

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,590
不会饿着家里任何一个人
No one is ever hungry in our house.

66
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,130
她会开手动挡
She can drive a stick.

67
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,190
你怎么能这样
How could you?

68
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,270
出演了那部叫《情迷少女》的电影后
After that movie, All Over The Girl,

69
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,940
她本可以留在洛杉矶成为一名电影明星
she could have stayed in LA and been a movie star,

70
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,840
但她放弃了这个机会  跟我到纽约去演戏剧
but she gave that up to do theater with me in New York.

71
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,800
别让你花了冤枉钱
You might as well get what you paid for.

72
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,420
她很勇敢

舞技超群

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,550
很有感染力  她让我也希望自己会跳舞
Infectious. She makes me wish I could dance.

75
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,060
当她不知道什么事  或是没有看过某本书
She always says when she doesn't know something,

76
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,100
某部电影或某部剧时  她都直言不讳
or hasn't read a book, or seen a film or a play,

77
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,390
而我却会信口开河
whereas I fake it or say something

78
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,210
或是假装自己有一段时间没看了
like I haven't seen it in awhile.

79
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,730
她最喜欢把我的疯狂想法
My crazy ideas are her favorite things

80
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,460
付诸实践
to figure out how to execute.

81
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,090
我们来试试...
Let's try it...

82
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,170
爬行
crawling...

83
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,750
但同时又站着
but also standing.

84
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,170
她是我最喜欢的女演员
She's my favorite actress.

85
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,880
我之所以爱查理...
What I love about Charlie...

86
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,250
查理无所畏惧
Charlie is undaunted.

87
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,020
他从不会因为别人的观点或任何挫折
He never lets other people's opinions or any setbacks

88
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,590
而放弃自己想做的事
keep him from what he wants to do.

89
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,600
他喜欢我  所以...
And he liked me, so...

90
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,640
查理吃东西时总是速战速决
Charlie eats like he's trying to get it over with

91
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,810
就像有人跟他抢似的
and like there won't be enough food for everyone.

92
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,130
吃三明治时总是狼吞虎咽
A sandwich is to be strangled while devoured.

93
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,800
你的毛衣是不是穿反了
Is your sweater on backwards?

94
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,890
但他极其注意整洁
But he's incredibly neat,

95
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,000
我要靠他才能让一切井井有条
and I rely on him to keep things in order.

96
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,420
那...
So...

97
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,380
他很有节能意识
He's energy-conscious.

98
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,380
抱歉
Sorry.

99
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,890
他不经常照镜子
He doesn't look in the mirror too often.

100
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,590
我哭了四次
I cried four times.

101
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,520
我也是
Me too.

102
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,140
他看电影时很容易落泪
He cries easily in movies.

103
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,090
不知道我们哭的是不是同一个地方
I wonder if it was the same four.

104
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,270
他非常自立  他会补袜子
He's very self-sufficient. He can darn a sock,

105
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,340
给自己做晚饭  烫衬衣
and cook himself dinner, and iron a shirt.

106
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,750
你弄得怎么样了
How are we doing over here?

107
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,350
甜椒切好了
The peppers are cut.

108
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,750
他很少会有挫败感
He rarely gets defeated, which...

109
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,350
而我却经常有
I feel like I always do.

110
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,000
我这还有几根胡萝卜
I've got some carrots.

111
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,560
查理从容地接纳我所有情绪
Charlie takes all of my moods steadily.

112
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,800
他不会被我的这些情绪影响  或让我因此难堪
He doesn't give in to them or make me feel bad about them.

113
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,810
他很会穿搭
He's a great dresser.

114
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,130
他从不会打扮不得体  男人很难做到这一点
He never looks embarrassing, which is hard for a man.

115
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,770
该死的  查理  振作起来
Goddamn it, Charlie, get it together!

116
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,400
他非常争强好胜
He's very competitive.

117
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,630
不是吧
Come on!

118
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,810
-这是什么  波罗的海大道是谁的  -我的
- What's this? Who owns Baltic Avenue? - Me.

119
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,770
多少钱
How much is it?

120
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,730
-我的钱不够了  -四百五
- I don't have enough. - $450.

121
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,380
好吧  那我破产了  对吗  游戏结束了
Okay, so I'm done? I'm done, right? That's it?

122
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,130
太不爽了
This is so frustrating!

123
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,500
太不爽了  总是我输
This is so frustrating. I always lose.

124
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,600
-爸爸  -他很喜欢当爸爸
- Dad. - He loves being a dad.

125
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,310
他喜欢一切本应遭人讨厌的事情
He loves all the things you're supposed to hate,

126
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,340
例如孩子耍性子或半夜醒来
like the tantrums, the waking up at night.

127
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,500
我做了个噩梦
I had a bad dream.

128
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,210
没关系
It's okay.

129
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,140
他如此热衷于这些事  几乎都让人生厌了
It's almost annoying how much he likes it,

130
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,480
但是  大多数情况还是挺好的
but... then, it's mostly nice.

131
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,300
爸爸  别走
Dad, stay.

132
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,300
他总是沉浸在自己的世界里
He disappears into his own world.

133
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,770
见鬼
Shit.

134
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,170
-什么是"见鬼"  -我们到站了
- What's "shit?" - This is our stop.

135
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,090
他和亨利这点很像
He and Henry are alike in that way.

136
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,560
有人牙齿上或脸上沾了食物
He can tell people when they have food

137
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,350
他都会以一种
in their teeth or on their face

138
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,920
不会让人难堪的方式指出
in a way that doesn't make them feel bad.

139
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,850
好了吗
Are you good?

140
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,630
好了
Perfect.

141
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,590
查理白手起家
Charlie is self-made.

142
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,050
他的父母...
His parents...

143
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,170
我只见过一次  但是...
I only met them once, but...

144
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,560
他告诉我他小时候
he told me there was a lot of alcohol

145
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,670
父母经常酗酒  有时还很暴力
and some violence in his childhood.

146
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,190
她一出来望风
As soon as she comes with a lookout,

147
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,060
他们就拿摄像机跟上
they're coming with a camcorder.

148
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,850
摄像机  是这么叫的吧
Camcorder. Is that what they're called?

149
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,000
他没给自己留退路就从印第安纳州搬到了纽约
He moved to New York from Indiana with no safety net,

150
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,690
现在他比任何纽约人都更像纽约人
and now he's more New Yorker than any New Yorker.

151
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,940
-我确保他们用了对的杏仁奶  -有才
- I made sure they used the right almond milk. - Genius.

152
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,460
无论跟谁在一起  他都很擅长营造家的氛围
He's brilliant at creating family out of whoever is around.

153
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,810
在剧团里  他就像施了魔咒一般
With the theater company, he cast a spell

154
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,550
让所有人都很有归属感
that made everyone feel included.

155
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,520
所有人都同等重要  哪怕是实习生也一样
No one, not even an intern, was unimportant.

156
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,850
他能记住所有圈内笑话
He could remember all the inside jokes.

157
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,590
刮风天你会去哪
And where do you go when it's windy?

158
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,920
好吧  很好笑
Oh, yeah, that... that was funny.

159
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,960
他做事非常有条理  极其细致
He's extremely organized and thorough.

160
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,730
他非常清楚自己想要什么
He's very clear about what he wants,

161
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,250
不像我  有时会搞不清楚
unlike me, who can't always tell.

162
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,000
先停一下
Let's stop right there.

163
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,910
{\an8}查理无所畏惧...

164
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:47,000
{\an8}他非常争强好胜
他很喜欢当爸爸...

165
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,880
谁先来
Who wants to start?

166
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,000
我不会把它念出来的
I-I'm not going to read this out loud.

167
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,670
为什么
Why is that?

168
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,750
因为我不喜欢我写的东西
Because I don't like what I wrote.

169
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,460
当我们调解你们的分居
As we mediate your separation

170
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,050
以及最后的离婚时
and eventual divorce,

171
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,520
事情会变得相当有争议
things can get quite contentious.

172
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,340
所以  我希望先从回忆对方好的一面开始
So, I like to begin with a note of positivity,

173
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,600
让我的客户想起
for the people I work with to remember

174
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,730
他们当初结婚的理由
why they got married in the first place.

175
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,550
这样  当你们分开时
And so that, as you come apart,

176
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,750
你们就会记起
you're reminded that...

177
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,420
你曾对这个人有过深厚的感情
this is a person you had great feeling for,

178
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,380
或许在很多方面依旧如此
and maybe still do in many ways.

179
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,000
我来读我的吧  我喜欢我写的
I'll read mine. I like what I wrote.

180
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,750
你们都得读出来
For it to really work,

181
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,480
才有效果
you both have to read.

182
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,800
我不读
I'm not going to.

183
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,840
好吧
Okay, um...

184
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,690
我觉得这很可惜
I just think it's a shame

185
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,300
你们写下了对彼此的美好回忆
that you guys aren't going to get to hear,

186
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,130
却没有机会听到
uh, the wonderful things you wrote about each other.

187
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,890
她总说我不会写作  但我觉得我写得非常好
She always says I can't write, but I think mine's pretty good.

188
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,390
妮可  或许你听了查理写的会改变主意
Nicole, maybe you'd change your mind once you heard Charlie's.

189
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,980
我不想听查理写了什么
I don't want to hear Charlie's.

190
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,270
我们之前说好要听的
We promised to listen.

191
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,250
没错
That's right.

192
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,800
这是这个过程的第一步
That's the very first step in this process.

193
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,390
如果你们俩
Well, I think I'm going to go

194
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,840
要坐在这儿一唱一和
if you two are going to just sit around and

195
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,090
那我还是走吧
suck each other's dicks.

196
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,350
如此罪恶怎会节制
How can this evil allow moderation?

197
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,800
如此罪恶怎会节制
How can this evil allow moderation?

198
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,550
背叛亡者怎会是正义的
How can it be right to betray the departed?

199
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,960
人类怎可变得如此...
How is it human to be so...

200
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,050
背信弃义
faithless?

201
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,210
我不需要不虔诚者的赞赏
I want no praise from impious men.

202
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,300
不要与他们安然共处一屋
No home with them of quiet ease.

203
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,300
我的血管之中仍流淌着高尚的血液
Noble blood still runs in my veins.

204
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,050
我要辜负我的父亲...
Shall I fail my father...

205
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,590
压抑自己的哭泣
stifling my cries,

206
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,750
斩断悲伤的翅膀吗
clipping the wings of grief?

207
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,310
难道他的尸首注定要在土里不幸地腐败
Must his corpse in the ground wretchedly waste away,

208
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,520
眼睁睁地化为乌有吗
feebly count for nothing?

209
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,500
难道杀害他的凶手注定会幸灾乐祸...
Must his killers gloat...

210
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,670
难道杀害他的凶手注定会幸灾乐祸
Must his killers gloat,

211
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,440
永远不用血债血偿...
never to pay with blood, for blood...

212
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,690
查理把点评语给了我  但其实是给你的
Charlie gave me the note, but it's really for you.

213
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,190
-他要我不要卡壳  -怎么会是给我的
- He told me to pick up my cues. - How is that for me?

214
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,850
演戏就是回应
Acting is reacting.

215
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,640
我在回应你  你拖慢了我的节奏
I'm responding to you. You're slowing me down.

216
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,380
弗兰克  今晚是最后一场演出  你知道的
Frank, it's closing night, you know.

217
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,670
你觉得查理和妮可永远不会复合了吗
You don't think Charlie and Nicole will ever get back together?

218
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,960
对  我觉得这次真的结束了
No, I think this time it's really over.

219
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,800
还是有点奇怪  我觉得就像我爸妈要离婚一样
It still feels weird. I feel like my parents are splitting up.

220
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,190
一直都是"查理和妮可"
It's always been "Charlie and Nicole."

221
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,690
-查理还会给点评语吗  -会
- Is Charlie still giving notes? - Yep.

222
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,840
你真幸运  妮可  真希望我也能去洛杉矶
You're lucky, Nic. I wish I was going to LA.

223
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,250
洛杉矶空间很大  这里太拥挤了
You can actually have space in LA. There's no space here.

224
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,130
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

225
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,890
我想敬...
I want to make a toast

226
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,300
查理
to Charlie...

227
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,600
还有我们亲爱的妮可
and to our beloved Nicole,

228
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,170
她即将到阳光灿烂的加州
who is going to be going out on a new adventure,

229
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,210
展开一段新的冒险
all the way to sunny California.

230
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,850
我们也准备尝试新的事物
And we are also going to try something new.

231
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,460
我们的剧目要在百老汇上演了
We are going to take our play to Broadway.

232
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,810
让我想起我自己年轻的时候
It reminds me of when I was a young person

233
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,140
第一次去百老汇的情景
and went to Broadway for the first time.

234
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,380
我跟你们说
And I'm telling you,

235
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,880
在27岁就赢得你的第一座托尼奖
winning your first Tony at 27,

236
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,310
这会冲昏你的头脑
it can mess with your head.

237
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,150
我那时还只是个小毛孩
I mean, I was just a baby.

238
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,810
伊利亚·卡赞在后台
Elia Kazan was backstage...

239
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,340
我要过去了
I'm going to go over there now.

240
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,230
-别去  玛丽·安  -用肘推着迈克·尼科尔斯
- Don't do it. Mary Ann? - elbowing Mike Nichols.

241
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,850
而迈克在跟迪特里希聊天
And Mike was chatting with Dietrich,

242
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,880
而玛琳  她通常特别风趣
and Marlene, you know, she usually was a barrel of monkeys,

243
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,750
但那晚她非常非常严肃
but tonight she was very, very serious.

244
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,920
稍等我一下好吗
Could you give me a second?

245
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,170
我得做些研究  不过...
Well, I'd have to study it, but...

246
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,800
我以为你们很晚才会回来
I didn't expect you guys home until late.

247
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,600
-他怎么样  -挺乖的  准时就去睡觉了
- How's he doing? - Good, good. He went to bed on time.

248
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,390
没闹
No fuss.

249
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,460
我给他读了一段《时代广场的蟋蟀》
Read him some of Cricket in Times Square.

250
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,750
天  你们真是太好看了
God, you guys are so attractive.

251
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,090
该死  抱歉  我没忍住说出来了
Shit. Sorry, I didn't stop that from being said.

252
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,060
没关系
No, it's okay.

253
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,290
我会按完整工时付钱
I'll pay for the whole time.

254
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,640
是我们自己要早点回来的
We decided to come home early.

255
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,550
谢谢  还有来回路上的时间
Hey, thanks. And also the travel time...

256
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,250
...跟其他人一样聊天  但我得走了
...conversation as well as anybody, but I've gotta run.

257
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,940
如果你懂我的意思的话
...if you know what I mean.

258
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,460
-你要走了吗  -反正我没打算搬进来
- Y-You're leaving? - Well, I ain't moving in.

259
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,710
我们很快回来...
We'll be back when you get your...

260
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,730
要是你不喜欢那个调解人  我们就再找一个
If you don't like that mediator, we'll find another one.

261
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,890
-好  -我们可能根本不需要调解人
Yeah. - W-We might not need a mediator.

262
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,000
反正我们把东西分了就行  我无所谓
We'll just split everything anyway, I don't care.

263
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,050
-我也无所谓  -大部分都可以归你
- Me neither. - You can have most of it.

264
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,940
我们要住得近点  让亨利更容易接受
We'll get apartments near each other, make it easier for Henry.

265
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,640
我们会解决好的
We'll figure it out.

266
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,840
-我们的目标是一致的  -对
- We want the same things. - Right.

267
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,170
话说  那个试播集一定很有意思吧
In the meantime, the pilot will be fun for you.

268
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,750
你不会觉得那剧本很糟吧
You don't think it's bad, do you?

269
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,210
我根本不看电视  所以我也没法判断
I don't ever watch TV, so, you know, I can't tell.

270
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,960
我跟亨利说了两周后去洛杉矶看他
I told Henry I'd come out to LA in two weeks to see him.

271
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,500
有话就说
Yes?

272
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,420
没什么
Nothing.

273
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,390
我能看出来你想给我点评语
I can tell you want to give me a note.

274
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,460
不  没有
No, I don't.

275
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,590
好吧  确实是  但我觉得...
Yeah... I mean, yes, I do, but I guess...

276
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,390
我觉得现在可能已经不重要了
I guess it doesn't matter now.

277
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,020
你不会再参加我们的演出了
You won't be with the show anymore.

278
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,130
我想说的事挺蠢的
It's stupid.

279
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,550
你不告诉我的话肯定睡不着
You're not going to be able to sleep until you tell me.

280
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,840
有可能
Maybe not.

281
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,880
那就说吧
Okay, then.

282
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,170
是这样  有两点
So, there are two things.

283
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,440
我觉得你在第七幕开场时的姿势
I thought your posture at the top

284
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,550
还是太端着了
of scene seven is still too dignified.

285
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,670
-好吧  -还有就是...
- Okay. - And then...

286
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,590
在结尾时  我能看出来你在强挤情绪
at the end, I could tell you were pushing for the emotion.

287
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,060
你知道我在舞台上哭不出来
Well, you know I can't cry on stage,

288
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,340
我也知道你不喜欢我假装  但...
and I know you don't like it when I fake it, but...

289
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,960
我以为今晚也许能哭出来  但...
I thought maybe tonight it would come, but...

290
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,050
并没有
it didn't.

291
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,090
我就想说这些
That's all I had.

292
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,090
谢谢你迁就我
Thanks for indulging me.

293
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,090
晚安  查理
Good night, Charlie.

你今天想做些什么
What do you want to do today?

306
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,170
跟你一起边玩边休息
Hang out and relax with you.

307
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,250
-我也是  -不能休息
- Me too. - No relaxing.

308
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,730
妮可今天要去试妆发造型
Nicole has a hair and makeup test today,

309
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:48,520
而亨利  我们给你和表兄妹们报名了童话营
and Henry, we got you into Fairy Camp with the cousins.

310
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,190
我讨厌童话营
I hate Fairy Camp.

311
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,520
凯西说大家都喜欢童话营
Cassie says everyone likes Fairy Camp,

312
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,340
我觉得是真的
and I think this is true.

313
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,750
亨利  照我教你的  去给妈妈冲杯咖啡
Henry, go make your mom some coffee like I taught you.

314
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,130
妈妈  等着尝我的咖啡吧
Mom, wait till you taste my coffee.

315
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,230
你们总是一起睡觉吗  在纽约也这样
Do you always sleep together? Even in New York?

316
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,420
不  只是最近这样  毕竟我们还处于过渡阶段
No, it's just for right now while we go through this transition.

317
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,960
该死
Oh, shit.

318
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,870
查理来了可别告诉他
Don't tell Charlie when he gets here.

319
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,140
他讨厌孩子跟大人一起睡
He hates co-sleeping.

320
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,240
我得说  我支持查理
Well, I have to say, I agree with Charlie.

321
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,920
真是"没想到"
Surprise surprise.

322
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,640
-就好像...  -天  这么早
- It's as if... - Jesus, it's early.

323
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,380
你从天而降砸了进来
you have exploded......into this room.

324
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,440
这种事我可以自己来
I can do this part alone.

325
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,380
好吧  我不看
Fine. I won't look.

326
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,770
只要你在我家  起床时间就是六点半
As long as you're in my house, wake up is at 6:30 a.m.,

327
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,730
在你想明白你想做什么之前
and until you know what you want to do,

328
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,560
我们就得做我想做的事
we're going to do what I like to do.

329
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,440
我不能从以前凡事都顺着查理
I can't just go from what Charlie

330
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,590
变成以后凡事都顺着你
wanted to do to what you want to do.

331
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,230
虽然我64岁了
Even though I'm 64

332
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,020
还有个死了的同志丈夫
and have a dead gay husband,

333
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,890
我仍然能做到每天起床
I manage to get up every day,

334
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,600
过我的生活  并且对自己感到很满意
live my life, and feel pretty good about myself.

335
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,130
所以  也许你妈还是懂点什么的
So, maybe your mom knows a thing or two.

336
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,840
你知道我会怎么做吗
You know what I would do?

337
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,250
什么怎么做
About what?

338
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:10,850
等查理来了  我会立马带他去棕榈泉
When Charlie gets here, I'd whisk him off to Palm Springs.

339
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:14,170
我和你爸遇到瓶颈时就会这么做
That's what your father and I did whenever we hit a speed bump.

340
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,520
你不是撞见爸爸在棕榈泉给看门的吹箫吗
Didn't you walk in on Dad blowing the porter in Palm Springs?

341
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,270
我一直很后悔当时那么生气
And I always regretted getting so upset about it.

342
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,350
我和查理要离婚了  妈
Charlie and I are getting a divorce, Mom.

343
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,230
棕榈泉解决不了问题
There's nothing for us in Palm Springs.

344
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,170
你睡觉前得洗洗脸
You need to wash your face before you go to sleep.

345
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,560
等爸爸来了
When Daddy gets here,

346
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,850
-也许我们可以一起去坐大白鲨游船  -好
- maybe we could all go on the Jaws ride. - Yeah.

347
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,440
我也可以跟爸爸去一次  再跟你去一次
Or I could go once with Daddy and once with you,

348
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,480
反正我也不介意去两次
because I wouldn't mind going twice anyway.

349
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,270
不  我们都一起去  亲爱的
No, we'll all go together, sweetheart.

350
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,310
你知道吗  环球影城
Did you know that Universal Studios

351
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,600
也是我第一次试镜的地方
is where I did my first screen test?

352
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,810
在飞机上  我用查理的视角读了试播集剧本
On the plane, I re-read the pilot as if I were Charlie reading it,

353
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,670
我有点觉得简直太烂了
and I started to think it was just bad.

354
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,550
我的经纪人说值得一看
My agent says it's one to watch.

355
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,300
-这咖啡确实不错  谢谢  -不客气
- This coffee is good. Thank you. - You're welcome.

356
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,600
万一查理带着我原创的剧
What if Charlie is on Broadway

357
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,020
去了百老汇
with a play I brought him, which I originated,

358
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,480
而我却在演烂剧怎么办
and I'm just doing bad TV?

359
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,710
大家只会佩服能上电视的人
Everyone is only impressed when they see someone on TV.

360
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,350
-她真美  -她的假发看起来很棒
- She's beautiful. - Her wig looks great.

361
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,810
过去十年她都在哪
Where's she been the past ten years?

362
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,770
在纽约演些奇怪的戏剧  下城区的东西
Doing weird theater in New York, downtown shit.

363
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,940
-我看过一场  台上下雨了  -我能说句话吗
- I saw one. It rained onstage. - Can I say something?

364
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,390
挺棒的  前卫
It was good. Edgy.

365
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,480
她丈夫是导演  据说控制欲非常强
Directed by her husband, supposedly very controlling.

366
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,980
-她能来是我们的幸运  -我没想到她会答应
- We're lucky to have her. - I'm surprised she said yes.

367
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,320
我们该感谢她的离婚
We can thank her divorce.

368
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,480
她的手能调整下位置吗
Can she move her hand?

369
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,440
要做出孩子的头发跟她手指交错的效果会有点难
It's going to be hard to roto in the hair on the baby around her fingers.

370
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,250
你能把手再往孩子身体下方挪一点吗
Can... you move your hand further down the baby?

371
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,630
-哪里  这里吗  -完全离开头部
- Where? Like here? - Off the head entirely.

372
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,560
我得支撑住他的头
I have to support his head.

373
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,060
不  当然要支撑住头
No, no, support the head, of course.

374
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,050
只是试着...从肩膀的位置去支撑
Just try and do it from the... shoulders?

375
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,890
-完美  -是的  很好
- It's perfect. - Yes, good.

376
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,980
我不能这么抱孩子
I can't hold a baby like this.

377
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,230
她是对的  看起来会很奇怪
She's right, that's going to look weird.

378
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,480
不  完全可以  只是需要点时间去...
No, we can totally do it. It just gonna take time...

379
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,440
这部剧必须符合自然科学的原理  这很重要
It was very important to me to have this show based on hard science.

380
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,840
这样我们就能看到你美丽的脸
So we can see your pretty face

381
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,550
而不是我们自己的
and not ours.

382
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,810
你应该看看植物入侵前我的样子
You should've seen me before the plants invaded.

383
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,940
我这是出于敬意
I say that with respect.

384
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,750
我是被两个妈妈养大的
I was raised by two mothers.

385
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,250
能把反光板放低点吗  帕布罗
Can you lower the board please, Pablo?

386
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,420
这样呢  这样行吗
Here? How about here?

387
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,910
现在呢
How about now?

388
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,520
怎么到哪都会有个撩妹的器械师
Why is there always a flirty grip?

389
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,540
你们想要什么效果都行
I can do anything you want.

390
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,810
我只需要她提前两小时...
I just need her here two hours before...

391
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,600
我能说句话吗
Can I say something?

392
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,000
丹尼斯  稍等  怎么了  亲爱的
Dennis, hold on. What, honey?

393
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,960
她得知道怎么抱婴儿
She has to know how to hold a baby.

394
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,640
-后面等她杀了唐尼  -她杀了唐尼
- Later on, after she kills Donny... - She kills Donny?

395
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,560
这是秘密  我们没把那几页给剧组
That's a secret. We didn't give the crew those pages.

396
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,920
她成了植物界的某种大地母亲
...she becomes a sort of a Earth mother to the plant community.

397
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,690
要是她对自己的孩子来说是个坏母亲
That's not going to make any sense

398
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,640
这逻辑就不能自洽了
if we feel like she's a bad mother to her own kid.

399
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,190
-她说得对  -唐尼知道吗
- She's right. - Does Donny know?

400
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,650
能离开纽约感觉一定很好
Must be nice to get out of New York.

401
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,690
我本来就是这里的人
Well, I'm from out here.

402
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,520
我们的女儿米娅在纽约大学  住在一个小屋子里
Our daughter, Mia, is at NYU, living in a shoebox.

403
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
她说有一次热得都有40度了
She says it went up to 104 the other day.

404
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,940
-我们很激动能请到你  -我也很激动能来
- We are just so excited to have you. - I'm excited to be here.

405
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,440
我们要走本世纪早期的审美风格
We're going for an early aughts aesthetic,

406
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,600
你能来就更有保障了
so having your presence just nails that.

407
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,810
本世纪早期的审美有什么特点
What signifies early aughts?

408
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,480
《爱上少女》之前在电视上播出了...
Into The Girl was on TV...

409
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,690
-是《情迷少女》  -或是什么流媒体之类的
- All Over The Girl. - ...or streaming or something.

410
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,640
你在那部电影里太他妈性感了
You are fucking hot in that movie.

411
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,520
-卡罗  -去他的  我说的是心里话
- Carol. - Fuck it, I speak my mind.

412
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,730
不能让我们的儿子看
We're not allowing our son to see it.

413
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,810
因为你露奶了
Because you show your tits.

414
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,880
-卡罗  -是啊
- Carol! - Yeah.

415
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,770
-丹尼斯  -这是卡特·米切姆
- Dennis. - This is Carter Mitchum.

416
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,350
他是加大洛杉矶分校的未来学家
He's a futurist at UCLA.

417
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,840
他是剧里所有环境相关细节的顾问
He's consulting on all the environmental stuff for the show

418
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,850
以确保细节准确无误
so it's accurate.

419
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,350
-很高兴见到你  -做到了吗
- Nice to meet you. - Is it?

420
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,350
-什么  -准确
- What? - Accurate?

421
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,630
目前为止  完全没做到
So far, none of it.

422
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,160
这试播集肯定能过  准备好搬回洛杉矶吧
This pilot will go. So get ready to move back to LA.

423
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,790
听着  你刚才在那边说的一切
Listen, everything you were saying

424
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,500
都非常正确
back there was absolutely right.

425
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,700
如果她不是个好母亲  我们就会失去观众
If she's a bad mom, we lose the audience.

426
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,920
{\an8}没人知道我们会写死唐尼
Nobody knows we're killing Donny,

427
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,390
-包括唐尼自己  -我以为...
- including Donny. - I... I thought...

428
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,340
要是你想参与我们的编剧工作  一定要告诉我们
Let us know if you'd like to be part of our writer's room.

429
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,550
我相信你一定能帮上大忙
I bet you'd be really helpful, actually.

430
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,880
或者我也可以当导演
Or I could direct.

431
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,560
-可以啊  -抱歉  可能听起来有点疯狂
- No, yeah. - Sorry, what? Maybe that sounds crazy.

432
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,750
不会  你有执导的样片吗
No, do you have a reel?

433
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,810
没有  我没实操过
No, because I've... I've never done it.

434
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,550
但我看我丈夫做了这么多年了
I watched my husband do it for years.

435
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,160
就快是前夫了
Almost ex-husband.

436
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,500
未婚夫的反义词是什么
What's the opposite of fiancé?

437
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,140
我和丹尼斯会跟你的经纪人聊聊
Dennis and I will talk to your agent about it.

438
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,810
在剧团的时候我就一直想试着执导
At our theater I always wanted to direct,

439
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,560
然后查理就会说一些
and then Charlie would say something like,

440
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,480
"下次让你来"之类的话  但导演一直都是他
"The next one," but he was always the director,

441
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,130
所以永远不会有"下次"
so there never was a next one.

442
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,980
谁知道呢  要是我们不离婚  也许会有吧
I don't know. Maybe if we'd stayed married, there would've been.

443
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,840
不  我们要写死他  看起来不太可能...
Yeah, no. We're going to kill him off. It seems unlikely...

444
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,310
我要给你一个号码
I'm going to give you a number.

445
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,020
行啊  是心理医生吗  是的话我已经有了
Okay, is it a therapist? Because I have a therapist.

446
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,770
其实是我妈的心理医生  我们共用一个
Well, it's my mom's therapist. We share her.

447
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:05,750
她是个律师  我和丹尼斯离婚时就是找她代理的
She's a lawyer. She represented me when I left Dennis.

448
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,770
你和丹尼斯离婚了
You and Dennis are divorced?

449
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,100
2013年的事了
Since 2013.

450
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,380
你们还在一起工作
You still work together.

451
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,640
挺好啊
That's nice.

452
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,230
才不好  他就是个王八蛋
Oh, no, he's a fucking cocksucker.

453
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,460
诺拉帮我争取到了这个项目的一半
Nora got me half of this project in the settlement.

454
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,210
我们说过不请律师的
Well, we talked about doing it without lawyers.

455
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,940
我妹妹已经让我见了几位
My sister had me meet a bunch of them already,

456
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,170
我讨厌他们
and I... just... hated them.

457
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,710
打给诺拉
Call Nora.

458
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,710
她挽救了我的人生
She saved my life.

459
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,300
抱歉  我...
Sorry, I...

460
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,600
看起来这么邋遢
look so schleppy.

461
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,590
我刚参加完孩子在学校的活动
I had an event at my kid's school.

462
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,890
我就直说了吧
Let me get this out of the way.

463
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,670
我觉得你是个很出色的演员
I think you're a wonderful actress.

464
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,890
谢谢
Thank you.

465
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,730
我很喜欢《情迷少女》
I loved All Over The Girl,

466
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,210
还有那些戏剧...
but the theater stuff too...

467
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,480
你看过我的剧
You saw the theater stuff?

468
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,920
我去年在纽约宣传我的书
I was in New York last year for my book,

469
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,050
对了  记得问我要一本
which, remind me to give you a copy,

470
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,810
我的出版商带我去看的
and my publisher took me.

471
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,590
太好了
Great.

472
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,460
-谢谢  -你太厉害了
- Thank you. - You are awesome.

473
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,840
-是查理导演的  -我知道

474
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,520
他很有才
He's very talented.

475
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,340
是的
He is.

476
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,380
他们要去百老汇演出了
They're moving it to Broadway.

477
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,340
当然  不带我
Well, without me, of course.

478
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,250
有你这样的妻子是他的福气
He was lucky to have you.

479
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,000
你还好吗
How are you doing?

480
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,800
抱歉
Sorry.

481
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,090
亲爱的
Honey...

482
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,250
深呼吸
You take some breaths.

483
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,170
与此同时  我做个自我介绍
And while you do, I'm going to tell you about myself.

484
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,980
如果你选择雇我
If you should choose to hire me,

485
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,440
我会不知疲倦地为你工作
I will work tirelessly for you,

486
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,090
你随时可以打电话或发短信联系我
and I'm always available by phone or text,

487
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,750
除了我带孩子的时候
except when I'm with my kids.

488
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,690
我坚持每天到学校接送孩子
I insist on doing drop off and pick up every day at school.

489
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,340
-我理解  -我也经历过这些
- I understand. - I've been through this myself.

490
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:58,710
谢谢  安妮  所以...
Thank you Annie. So...

491
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,130
我知道你的感受
I know how it feels.

492
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,880
-是吗  -是的
- You do? - Yes.

493
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,800
我和我前夫有个孩子  我前夫是个自恋的艺术家
I have a kid from my ex, who is a narcissistic artist...

494
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,300
还存在语言暴力
and verbally abusive.

495
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,210
我现在有个住在马里布的好男友
I'm now with a great boyfriend who lives in Malibu.

496
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,550
真好
Oh, good.

497
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,390
查理不坏的
Well, Charlie's not terrible.

498
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,960
当然了
No, of course not.

499
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,090
但他们起初为了得到你的欢心而对你关怀备至
But they ravish you with attention in the beginning...

500
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,190
等我们有了孩子  成了妈妈
and then once we have babies, we become the mom

501
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,480
他们就厌烦我们了
and... they get sick of us.

502
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,300
是的
Yeah.

503
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,420
你现在想住在哪  姑娘
Where do you want to live now, doll?

504
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,800
这个...
Well...

505
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,590
显然  我现在在这里
I'm here now, obviously.

506
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,920
我不知道试播集能不能拍成电视剧  但是
I don't know if the show will get picked up, but...

507
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,250
这里有家的感觉
it feels like home.

508
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,420
就是家
It is home.

509
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,750
这是我除了查理之外仅有的家了
It's the only home I've ever known without Charlie.

510
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,550
你想留在这里吗
You want to stay here?

511
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,210
查理不会愿意的  他...
Charlie's not going to want that. He...

512
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,480
他不喜欢洛杉矶
He hates LA.

513
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,710
我们关心的是你的想法
We're interested in what you want to do.

514
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,710
在我看来  你在纽约待得够久了
Sounds to me like you did your time in New York.

515
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,520
他也可以在这里住一段时间吧
He can do some time here, no?

516
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,500
他总说将来会的  但从未...
He always said we would, but he never...

517
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,420
做到
did.

518
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,170
你儿子多大了
How old is your son?

519
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,710
亨利八岁了
Henry's eight.

520
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,090
是的
Yeah.

521
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,420
他喜欢洛杉矶
He likes LA.

522
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,840
我不知道这对他公不公平
I don't know if it's fair to him.

523
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,880
你听我说
I want you to listen to me.

524
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,590
你现在做的是希望之举
What you're doing is an act of hope.

525
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,750
你明白吗
Do you understand that?

526
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,800
明白
Yeah.

527
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,420
你在说  "我希望自己过得更好"
You're saying, "I want something better for myself."

528
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,000
没错
I do.

529
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,380
现在是最难熬的时期
And this, right now, is the worst time.

530
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,750
以后只会越来越好
It will only get better.

531
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,210
汤姆·佩蒂不是唱过"等待最难熬"吗
Wasn't it Tom Petty who said "The waiting is the hardest part"?

532
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,460
我不知道
I don't know.

533
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,460
他离婚时  我是他妻子的律师
I represented his wife in their divorce.

534
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,590
我帮她拿到了那首歌一半的版权
I got her half of that song.

535
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,340
我不想要钱之类的
I don't want any money or anything.

536
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:01,090
我有点担心  因为我们之前说好不请律师  所以...
I just worry because we weren't going to use lawyers, so...

537
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,840
我不想太咄咄逼人
I don't want to be too aggressive.

538
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,630
我还想继续和他做朋友
I want to stay friends.

539
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,460
我们会尽可能缓和地处理
We'll do it as gently as possible.

540
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,550
好了
Now...

541
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,250
你能多和我说点目前的情况吗
Can you tell me a little more about what's going on?

542
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,690
因为我们要一起做的事就包括
Because part of what we're going to do together

543
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,630
讲述你的故事
is tell your story.

544
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,550
很难说清楚
It's difficult to articulate.

545
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:27,590
事情...
It's...

546
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,230
不像说不爱了那么简单
not as simple as not being in love anymore.

547
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,920
我懂
I understand.

548
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,210
不如从头说起吧  从哪都可以
Why don't you start at the beginning? Wherever that is for you.

549
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,550
好吧
Well, uh...

550
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,690
我之前和本订婚了
I was engaged to Ben

551
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,590
住在洛杉矶
and living in LA, you know?

552
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,590
我感觉  没错  我想和本拍电影并嫁给他
And I felt like yes, I want to make movies and marry Ben.

553
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,480
天啊  我当时也就二十岁左右
Jesus, I was only 19 or 20 at the time.

554
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,210
我这辈子从没觉得自己那么老过
I never felt older in my whole life.

555
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,890
总之  如果说实话
Anyway, if I was honest with myself,

556
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,130
我感觉内心有一小部分死去了
it was like a small part of me felt dead...

557
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,500
或者将死了
or dead-ish.

558
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,450
你告诉自己
You know, you tell yourself,

559
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:05,200
"没有完美之人  也没有完美恋情"
"No one's perfect, no relationship's perfect."

560
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,040
这茶真好喝
This tea is delicious.

561
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,160
是吧  加了麦卢卡蜂蜜
Isn't it? It's the Manuka honey.

562
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,240
总之  你刚刚问起查理
Anyway, uh, you were asking about Charlie.

563
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,990
所以
So, um...

564
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,580
所以  是的  我当时...我当时
So, yes. So, I was... I was...

565
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,410
和本在一起很幸福  也意识到自己心死了
happy with Ben and aware of the deadness,

566
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,370
我去了纽约
and I went to New York

567
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,080
去见一部太空电影的导演
to meet with this director for this space movie.

568
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:30,240
但这是一部对太空严肃对待的电影
But one where they take space seriously, like...

569
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,450
在太空进行性交易
sex trafficking in space.

570
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,790
有政治意义
You know, it was political.

571
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,830
至少他们想让我们这么觉得
Or at least they wanted us to think it was.

572
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,410
总之  那部电影...
Anyway, it just...

573
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,240
那部电影和某些糟糕的色情片一样
it was really fulfilling the same need

574
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,490
满足的是相同的需求
that certain fucked up porn does.

575
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,410
但总之
But anyway, so...

576
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,990
我去了之后
while I was there...

577
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,160
制片人
the producer...

578
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,080
邀请我去看一场戏剧
invited me to see a play.

579
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,870
在一个人的公寓里演的  把灯都打开了
It took place in someone's apartment with all the lights on.

580
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,240
我之前从未看过这样的剧
It was like nothing I'd ever seen before.

581
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,580
这种奇特的
This strange...

582
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,660
超现实的反乌托邦故事
surreal, dystopian story,

583
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,450
演得特别好
and it was so well-acted.

584
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,490
其中一位演员身材高大  邋邋遢遢
And one of the actors was this big shaggy bear

585
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,450
说台词的时候全程都盯着我
who played all his lines looking directly at me,

586
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,700
我知道不可能是这样  但我觉得是的
which I knew couldn't be the case, but it felt like it.

587
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,330
之后当然了  我了解到我当时的感觉是对的
And then later, of course, I learned that it was.

588
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,830
这饼干也很好吃
These cookies are really great too.

589
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,240
走的时候送你几盒
I'll send you home with some.

590
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,580
后来  我与演职人员认识了一下
Afterwards, I was introduced to the cast,

591
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,490
发现那个大高个还是导演
and the bear turned out to also be the director.

592
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,700
他和我说话
He talked to me and...

593
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,660
我也和他说话
I talked back.

594
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,950
我的心没有死去  只是暂时昏迷了
The dead part wasn't dead, it was just in a coma.

595
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,290
然后
And...

596
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,660
和他聊天  比性爱还美妙
it was better than the sex, the talking.

597
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,870
不过
Although the...

598
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,410
性爱也和聊天一样
the sex was also like the talking.

599
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,830
恋爱中的一切都很相似
You know, everything is like everything in a relationship.

600
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:50,870
你不觉得吗
Don't you find that?

601
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,740
然后
And, um...

602
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,370
我们两个
So, we spent...

603
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,910
一整夜和第二天都在一起  然后...
the whole night and the next day together and...

604
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,870
我就留下来了
I just never left.

605
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,290
是  说实话  所有的问题
Yes, to be honest, all the problems

606
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,290
在一开始就存在了
were there in the beginning too.

607
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,330
但我就接受了他和他的生活
But... I just went along with him and his life

608
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:10,660
因为活过来的感觉真是太好了
because it felt so damn good to feel myself alive.

609
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:15,200
一开始  我是演员  是明星
In the beginning, I was the actress, the star, and...

610
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,790
感觉还是很不错的
That felt like something, you know.

611
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,160
人们一开始都是冲着我来看剧的  但是
People came to see me at first, but...

612
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,620
我渐渐失去光彩了
the farther away I got from that and...

613
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,870
剧团越来越受欢迎
the more acclaim the theater company got,

614
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,410
我的分量也越来越轻
and I had less and less weight.

615
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,910
我就变成了那种
I just became...

616
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,330
"谁"
"Who?"

617
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:32,540
"就是当时演了那个的女演员"
"Well, you know, the actress that was in that thing that time."

618
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,080
他变成了招牌
And he was the draw.

619
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,490
那...
And... that...

620
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,120
本来还没关系  但是
would've been fine, but...

621
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,120
我变得越来越渺小
I got smaller.

622
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,990
我意识到我...
I realized I...

623
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,370
我从来没有为自己而活过来
I didn't ever really come alive for myself.

624
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,370
我只是成了他活着的养料
I was just feeding his aliveness.

625
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,240
然后
And...

626
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,490
你知道的
you know...

627
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,450
他那么聪明  又有创意  没...
he was so smart and creative, it...

628
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,740
没关系的
it was fine.

629
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,790
我会在家里私下告诉他一些事
You know, I would tell him things at home in private,

630
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,660
然后这些事
and they would work their way

631
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,160
会出现在公共谈话里  然后进入他的作品
into public conversation into his work, and...

632
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:14,700
有一段时间  我感觉满足了  我太...
For a while, that felt like enough. I mean, I was just so...

633
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:15,870
太...
so...

634
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,540
太受宠若惊  像他这样的人
so flattered that someone like him would...

635
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,660
会觉得我的想法值得一试
would find an idea I had worth trying

636
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,490
觉得我的评论值得重复
or a comment I made worth repeating and...

637
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,240
然后我怀孕了
and then, I got pregnant.

638
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,370
我以为生孩子这件事
And I thought that having a baby

639
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,120
可以是我们的  是真正属于我们俩的
could be ours, could really be ours,

640
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,910
但也是属于我自己的
but also really mine.

641
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,990
他非常激动
And... you know, he was so excited.

642
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,950
所以挺好的
So, it was nice.

643
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,240
持续了一段时间
For a while.

644
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,370
孩子...
I mean, kids, they...

645
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,910
属于他们自己  就好像
they belong to themselves. It's like...

646
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,870
孩子离开你的身体一瞬间  就是
the instant they leave your body, it's just...

647
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,910
孩子离开你的过程...
the process of them going away...

648
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,700
而我并不属于我自己
And I didn't belong to myself.

649
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,080
小事  蠢事  大事都由不得我
And it was small stuff, stupid stuff, and big stuff.

650
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,700
我们家所有的家具
All the furniture in our house

651
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,790
都是他挑的
was his taste.

652
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,950
我都不知道自己的品味是什么了
I didn't even know what my taste was anymore

653
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,490
因为没人征求过我的意见
because I had never been asked to use it.

654
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,490
我们的公寓都不是我选的  我直接搬到了他家
I didn't even pick our apartment. I just moved into his.

655
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:08,490
我也表达过想搬回洛杉矶的想法  但是
And I made noises about wanting to move back to LA, but...

656
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,830
犹如石沉大海
they came to nothing.

657
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,410
我们会在节假日过来  因为他喜欢我的家人
And we'd come here on holidays because he liked my family.

658
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,370
但如果我提出来在这住一年什么的
But if I suggested we do a year or something,

659
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,450
他只会敷衍我
he'd just put me off.

660
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,660
我会...
It would be...

661
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,700
措手不及  如果他突然问我
strange if he turned to me and said,

662
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,790
"你今天想做什么"
"And what do you want to do today?"

663
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,330
我刚看完那部乔治·哈里森的纪录片
You know, I just watched that documentary on George Harrison,

664
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,330
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}披头士乐队主音吉他手

665
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,200
我就想  "认了
and I thought, "Own it.

666
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,830
认了
Just own it.

667
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,330
像乔治·哈里森的妻子那样
Be like George Harrison's wife.

668
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,740
做个贤妻良母  这就够了"
Being a wife and a mother, that's enough."

669
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:40,290
结果我发现我想不起她的名字
Yeah, then I realized I couldn't remember her name, so...

670
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,410
然后我接到了试播集的邀约
This pilot came along.

671
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:47,580
在洛杉矶拍摄  报酬丰厚
It shot in LA and it paid so much...

672
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,830
就好像有一根小小的求生索扔到我面前
And it was like there was this little lifeline thrown to me.

673
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:54,290
有一片属于你的天地
Here's this bit of earth that's yours, and...

674
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,290
为此我在他面前
I was embarrassed about it

675
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,410
觉得有点丢脸  但还有另一种感觉...
in front of him, but it was also like...

676
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,240
这就是真正的我  这就是我的价值所在
yeah, this is who I am, and this is what I'm worth.

677
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,540
或许是挺蠢的  但至少是属于我的
And maybe it's stupid, but at least it's mine.

678
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:11,700
如果他能给我个大大的拥抱  对我说
And if he had just taken me into a big hug and said,

679
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,200
"宝贝  我为你的冒险感到无比激动
"Baby, I'm so excited for your adventure.

680
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,160
我当然想让你拥有一片属于自己的天地"
Of course I want you to have a piece of earth that's yours."

681
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,330
那么...
Then...

682
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,910
那么我们可能就不必离婚了
Well, then, we might not be getting divorced.

683
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,990
但是
But...

684
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,330
他嘲笑了我的梦想
he made fun of it and...

685
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:28,200
和平时一样心怀妒忌
was jealous like he is, and...

686
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,080
然后他想起了钱的事
then he realized about the money.

687
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:34,620
然后他跟我说我可以把钱投回剧团
And he told me I could funnel it back into the theater company.

688
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,580
那时我才意识到
And that's when I realized...

689
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,330
他
he...

690
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,080
眼里真的没有我
truly didn't see me.

691
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,080
他没有把我看作是独立于他的个体
He didn't see me as something separate from himself.

692
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,330
我让他说出我的电话号码
And I asked him to say my phone number.

693
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,660
他居然不知道
He didn't know it.

694
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,540
所以我离开了
So, I left.

695
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,990
而且我觉得他跟舞台监督玛丽·安有一腿
Also, I think he slept with the stage manager, Mary Ann.

696
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,120
那个混球
That fucking asshole.

697
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,490
Seventy-five...

698
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,990
就是70
just 70,

699
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,620
那两个0
those two zeros,

700
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,080
-75.00...  -"如果铁路无主
- seventy-five point zero zero... -"If railroad is unowned...

701
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,450
-意思就是0分  -你可以从银行买下来"
- that's zero cents. - ...you may buy it from the bank."

702
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,080
"移动到伊利诺...
"Advance to Illios...

703
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,620
-伊利诺伊  -伊利诺伊大道"
- Illinois. - ...Illinois Avenue."

704
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,990
"移动"  是什么意思
"Advance..." what does that mean?

705
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,160
意思是你得去伊利诺伊大道
It means you've got to go to Illinois Avenue.

706
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,450
那伊利诺伊大道在哪
So where is Illinois Avenue?

707
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,240
那个
That one.

708
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,830
{\an8}范肖-齐默-肯普律所
至  查理·巴伯

709
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,540
凯西  查理到了之后
So Cassie, when Charlie gets here,

710
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,740
你就把信封递给他
you're going to hand him the envelope.

711
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,870
为什么非要让我给他
Why do I have to do it?

712
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,040
因为妮可非常擅长
Because Nicole is very good at

713
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,620
让别人帮她办事
getting people to do things for her.

714
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,740
{\an8}才不是这样
That's not what this is.

715
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,740
她九岁之前  我一直帮她擦屁股
I wiped her butt until she was nine years old.

716
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,620
她很擅长这一套
She's very seductive that way.

717
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,950
不  妈妈  法律规定不能由我递交他
No, Mom, legally, I can't be the one who serves him.

718
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,120
但我说的还是大实话
But still, what I'm saying is true.

719
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,200
我真的得给他递信封吗
Do I have to actually hand him the envelope?

720
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,910
是的  但我会提前告诉他
Yes, but I'm going to tell him in advance

721
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,160
里面是离婚文件
that they're divorce papers.

722
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,120
诺拉说不必如此正式  亨利在哪
Nora says it doesn't have to be so formal. Where's Henry?

723
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:01,330
他跟山姆  朱尔斯和莫莉在客厅玩
He's playing in the living room with Sam, and Jules, and Molly.

724
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,290
让他们上楼去吧  查理很快就到了
Let's get them upstairs. Charlie's going to be here soon.

725
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,490
山姆  上楼去
Sam, go upstairs.

726
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,990
我会告诉查理是怎么回事
So, I'll tell Charlie what's happening,

727
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:10,080
然后凯西  你把信封给他
and, Cassie, you then hand him the envelope.

728
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,870
好吧
Okay...

729
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,330
我好紧张
I just get nervous.

730
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,830
你能撤销递交吗
Well, can you un-serve?

731
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,410
-什么意思  拿回来吗  -对
- What do you mean? Like take it back? - Yeah.

732
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,660
应该可以
I think so.

733
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,160
-你应该去确认一下  -以防我们改主意
- You should check. - In case we change our minds...

734
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,200
{\an8}我不会改主意的
I'm not going to change my mind.

735
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,540
或者我们觉得他太可怜
...or we feel too bad for him.

736
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,290
以防我不小心做错了
Maybe in case I do something wrong.

737
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,290
你们俩现在让我觉得难受  知道吗
Now you're both just making me feel bad, okay?

738
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,990
抱歉  抱歉  我真的很紧张
Sorry, sorry, I'm nervous!

739
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,950
我们都紧张
Well, we all are.

740
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,910
我们都很爱查理
And we love Charlie.

741
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,830
你不能再爱他了  妈妈
You have to stop loving him, Mom.

742
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,910
也不能再跟他做朋友
You can't be friends with him anymore.

743
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:39,580
我跟查理的关系
Charlie and I have our own relationship...

744
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,700
独立于你们的婚姻
independent of your marriage.

745
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,240
就像我现在和
Just like I'm still friends

746
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,410
凯西的前任杰夫还是朋友
with Cassie's ex, Jeff.

747
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,990
你还在和杰夫见面吗
Are you still seeing Jeff?

748
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,830
偶尔吃顿午餐
An occasional lunch.

749
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,870
我简直不敢相信
I can't believe you!

750
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,910
对了  他还是想把相机要回去的
He still wants his camera back, by the way.

751
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:55,330
听着  没有什么关系可以独立于我们的婚姻
Listen, nothing can be independent of our marriage right now.

752
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,990
我不敢相信连这个还要我解释
I can't believe I even have to explain this to you.

753
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,490
站在我这边  好吗
Just be on my side, okay?

754
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,160
-好吧  -还有
- Okay. - And...

755
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,990
别再和杰夫见面了
stop seeing Jeff!

756
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,160
凯西  你负责递交
Cassie, you're the server.

757
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,740
让我再多练习几次
Just let me practice a few times.

758
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,370
试演时  我的表现一向很糟糕
I was never a good auditioner.

759
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,330
因为你太想拿到角色了
That's because you wanted it too badly.

760
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,330
这可不是试演
It's not an audition.

761
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:17,330
-我来扮演查理  -我的手紧张地出汗
- I'll play Charlie. - It's just my palms are so perspired.

762
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,700
亲爱的  你把信封都弄湿了
Sweetie, you're blotting the envelope.

763
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,740
或许应该让妮可扮演你
Maybe Nicole should play you.

764
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,870
你听听自己说的话
Did you really just say that?

765
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:25,740
我们不需要练习  这又不是表演
We don't need to practice. This is not a performance.

766
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,160
上一瓶酒已经喝完了吗
Did we finish the other wine already?

767
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:27,990
-是的  -是的
- Yeah. - Yeah.

768
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:30,910
好吧  我去接他
Okay, let me get him.

769
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,410
-好的  -你们俩都去另一个房间
- Okay. - You both go in the other room.

770
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:33,990
凯西  你去确保亨利
Cassie, you make sure that Henry

771
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,290
跟莫莉和朱尔斯一起上楼了
goes upstairs with Molly and Jules.

772
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,450
这就去
Happening now.

773
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:40,490
-妈  -我来拿我的酒
- Mom! - I'm getting my wine.

774
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,790
-怎么了  -亨利在楼下的洗手间拉屎
- What? - Henry's pooping in the bathroom downstairs.

775
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,200
能让他上楼拉吗
Can we transfer him to the one upstairs?

776
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,290
他应该正在拉
I think it's mid-poop.

777
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,080
等他出来立刻带他上去
Just grab him when he comes out.

778
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,240
-凯西  -怎么了
- Cassie? - What?

779
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,870
我把信封放在烤面包机旁边了
I'm... I'm putting the envelope over here by the toaster.

780
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,950
收到
Copy you.

781
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,240
-亨利在哪  -他在拉屎
- Where's Henry? - Uh, he's pooping.

782
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,870
亨利
Hi, Henry!

783
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,490
能用这沙发吗
Does this couch still open?

784
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,540
嗯
Yeah.

785
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,540
我下飞机后收到了短信
I got off the plane to a text,

786
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,080
但先别告诉别人  这还是个秘密
but don't tell anyone yet. It's still a secret.

787
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,990
好的
Okay.

788
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,290
我获得了麦克阿瑟天才奖
I won a MacArthur grant.

789
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,160
查理
Charlie!

790
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,870
天呐  太棒了
Oh, my God, that's great!

791
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,080
祝贺你
Congratulations.

792
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,330
你自己不能说这话  我帮你说
I'll say it because you can't,

793
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,490
这是天才奖  你是天才
it's the genius grant. You're a genius.

794
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,490
我真为你感到高兴  这是你应得的
I'm really happy for you. You deserve it.

795
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:31,080
这个奖也是属于你的  我们共同的功劳
It's yours too. We did all of this together.

796
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,200
谢谢  但是...
Thank you, but...

797
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,790
奖是你的  查理  好好享受吧
it's yours, Charlie, you enjoy it.

798
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
我饿死了
I'm starving.

799
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,950
奖金很丰厚  五年分期支付
It's good money, and they parse it out over five years.

800
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,290
不过这样我就能给所有的剧团成员发薪水
But it means I can keep everyone in the theater company employed,

801
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,290
还上信用卡欠款
pay my credit card debt.

802
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:42,990
太棒了
So great.

803
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,790
当然了  我立刻觉得"从现在起要走下坡路了
Of course, I went instantly to, "It's all downhill from here.

804
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:48,830
-我的百老汇首演一定会失败"  -不会
- Now my first Broadway play has to fail." - No.

805
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,660
我们刚开始重新排演  我也不知道
We just started rehearsals again, and I don't know.

806
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,290
每次开演前你都是这样  最后都很顺利
You always don't know at this point, and then, it gets there.

807
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,950
是吗  我不记得了
Do I? Because I don't remember.

808
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,080
我知道  是真的  放心吧
I know, it's true, it'll be great.

809
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,910
好吧  希望你说得没错
Okay, I hope you're right.

810
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,450
大家都问候你
Everyone says hi.

811
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,870
帮我问候他们  我想他们了
Tell them hi. I miss everyone.

812
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,870
等你回去就能看到他们了
You'll see them again when you come back.

813
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,040
麦克阿瑟天才奖  百老汇
A MacArthur, Broadway...

814
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,580
太让人激动了
It's so exciting.

815
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,700
祝贺你  查理
Congratulations, Charlie.

816
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,490
哪个洗手间
Which bathroom?

817
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,700
-什么  -他不是在拉屎吗
- What? - Is he pooping?

818
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,330
楼下的
Downstairs.

819
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,330
你妈在家吗
Is your mom home?

820
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,290
嗯  她在楼上
Yeah, she's upstairs.

821
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:34,040
-怎么样了  -还没拉出来
- How's it going? - Nothing yet.

822

妈妈也要送我礼物
Mom's getting me a present too.

826
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,120
-为什么  -拉屎的奖励

827
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,870
-我爱你  -我爱你
- I love you. - I love you.

828
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,870
我觉得我们不该再为拉屎这件事给他奖励了
I don't think we should reward him for pooping anymore.

829
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,700
我知道  但他一周没拉了
I know, but he holds it in and it's going on a week.

830
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,700
-拉出来就算奖励了  外婆  -小查理
- It's its own reward. G-ma! - Charlie-bird!

831
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,200
不  别这样
Oh! No! Stop it!

832
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,620
天呐  我个头很大的
Oh, God, I'm huge!

833
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,200
-你像羽毛一样轻  -妈
- You're as light as a feather. - Mom?

834
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,080
你怎么不回我上一封电邮
Why didn't you respond to my last email?

835
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,200
你的电邮太有文采了
Well, your emails are so articulate.

836
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,040
我被吓到了
I get intimidated.

837
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,120
-妈  你能不能...  -现在换我把你举起来了
- Mom, can you... - Now, I'm going to lift you!

838
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:12,740
妈
Mom?

839
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,830
妈
Mom?

840

844
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,700
查理
Hey, Charlie.

851
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,370
能帮我叫下妈妈吗
Can you ask Mom to come?

852
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,120
他让你过去
He wants you.

853
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,740
那是什么派
What kind of pie is that?

854
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,240
是...
It's...

855
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,950
山核桃派

856
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,120
-你做的吗  -我不知道

857
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,990
不是  是商店买的
No, it's store bought.

858
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,740
你知道第三大街的乔安家吧
You know Joan's on Third?

859
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,870
-知道  很好吃对吧  -什么
- Yeah. It's good, right? - What?

860
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,410
那家店吗  对
The store? Yeah.

861

你应该会喜欢的
I-I think you'd like it.

867
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,700
这个剧本从没登上过舞台
It's a great unproduced play

868
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,870
是一个很有趣的英国编剧写的

869
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,950
-所以你要演英国口音的  -对

870
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,540
偏英格兰北部口音
It's more northern England.

871
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,200
让我听听
What does that sound like?

872
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,410
你要来杯茶吗
You want a cup of tea, do ya?

873

是马尼拉纸信封  亲爱的

-我能再来一遍吗  -上面写着我的名字
- Can I start over? - It has my name on it.

878
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:58,870
天啊
Jesus.

879
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,160
抱歉  递交你了

递交你了
You're being served.

883
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:12,040
你们要离...我不知道  抱歉
You guys are getting a div... I don't know, I'm sorry.

884
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,200
我本来想提前告诉你的  以免把事情闹大  抱歉
I was going to warn you so it didn't become a thing. I'm sorry.

885
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,790
我感觉像是在做梦

886
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,080
我们的婚姻已经不存在了
We don't have a marriage anymore.

887
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,580
我知道你不想婚姻破裂
I-I know you don't want the disruption,

888
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,740
但你也不想要这段婚姻
but you don't want to be married.

889
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,990
可有可无
Not... really.

890
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,490
但我不想这样
But I don't want this.

891
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:53,490
你指望会怎样
What did you expect was going to happen?

892
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,410
我不知道  我可能还没想明白
I... I don't know, I guess I didn't think it through,

893
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:03,290
我以为我们说好了不找律师的
but I thought we agreed we weren't going to use lawyers.

894
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,370
我想要的...
I want...

895
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,370
我不知道  我想尽量用
I don't know, I'm trying to say this

896
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,950
不夸张的方式说出来
as undramatically as possible.

897
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,370
我想要的...
I want...

898
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:14,160
是一种完全不同的生活
an entirely different kind of life.

899
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,330
我们等你拍完试播集回纽约再说吧
Let's wait until you finish this pilot and come back to New York.

900
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,490
我们回到家再一起解决这件事
Let's figure it out there, at home, together.

901
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:21,330
诺拉是出了名的公平
Nora's known for being very fair.

902
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,620
{\an8}我们不需要通过信件来沟通
We don't need to do it with envelopes.

903
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:22,990
-这是诺拉发来的  -是
- This is Nora? - Yeah.

904
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,580
她非常棒  我觉得我们可以和她成为朋友
She's great. I feel like we could be friends with her.

905
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,120
我怎么觉得不会呢
Why do I feel like that won't happen?

906
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,660
只是走个形式
It's just a formality.

907
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,580
-为什么...  -你不必马上回复
- Why... - You don't have to respond right away.

908
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,330
为什么凯西拿了个派来
Why did Cassie have a pie?

909
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:35,200
那是她带的派  跟这个没关系
The pie was hers. The pie wasn't part of it.

910
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,950
你确定吗
Are you sure?

911
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,990
一个派能有什么关系呢
I mean, what would the pie have to do with anything?

912
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,620
我不知道  感觉它使事情更糟糕了
I don't know. It somehow makes it worse.

913
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,290
抱歉  派就只是派
I'm sorry, but the pie was just a pie.

914
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,240
那  怎么
So, what...

915
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,080
我要怎么做
What do I do?

916
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,120
你也找个律师
You get a lawyer too.

917
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,660
我想我得行动起来了
Well, I guess I better be going.

918
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:03,620
"斯图尔特从沟里爬出来  钻进车里
"Stuart rose from the ditch, climbed into his car...

919
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,740
出发上路  一路向北
and started up the road that led toward the north.

920
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:10,580
这时太阳刚刚从右边的小山坡升起
The sun was just coming up over the hills on his right.

921
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,910
他凝视着前方绵延宽阔的大地
As he peered ahead into the great land that stretched before him,

922
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,830
道路一眼望不到尽头
the way seemed long...

923
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,120
天空一片明亮
but the sky was bright.

924
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:22,740
他感觉自己正朝着正确的方向前行"
And he somehow felt he was headed in the right direction."

925
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,370
我都忘了故事结局是这样的
I forgot it ended that way.

926
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:32,120
是啊  斯图尔特真的反应过度了  不是吗
Yeah, wow, Stuart really overreacted, didn't you think?

927
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,660
他为船的事难过
He was upset about his boat.

928
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,370
爸爸  你走吧
Dad, you go away.

929
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,370
妈妈  你留下
Mom, you stay.

930
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,660
-爸爸才刚来  -没关系
- Hey, Daddy just got here. - It's okay.

931
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:48,700
爱你
Love you.

932
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,450
你可以等会再过来  叫醒我
You can come back, and wake me up,

933
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:57,160
读故事给我听  好吗  爸爸
and read to me later, Daddy, okay?

934
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,120
好的
Okay.

935
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:03,290
你等会可以来我床上睡吗
Will you come sleep in my bed later?

936
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,040
好的
Yeah.

937
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,700
坚持住  小查理
Hang in there, Charlie-bird.

938
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,790
谢谢  外婆
Thanks, G-ma.

939
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,450
{\an8}婚姻场景

940
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:49,830
-他现在处于粘妈的阶段  -没事
- He's in a mommy phase right now. - It's okay.

941
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:02,240
不好意思  我喝多了
I'm sorry. I drank too much wine.

942
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,200
-可以想象  -晚饭也没吃
- I can imagine. - And didn't eat dinner.

943
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,700
压力太大
Stressful time.

944
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,160
希望亨利没看出来
I hope Henry didn't notice.

945
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,040
他肯定没看出来
I'm sure he didn't.

946
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,660
我当了妈以后才意识到
Now that I'm a parent, I realize my parents

947
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,370
我爸妈带我的时候大概一直在喝酒
were probably drunk all the time with me.

948
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:13,120
是啊
Yeah.

949
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,740

谢谢
Thanks.

951
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:19,490
你要住哪里
Where are you staying?

952
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,120
那个  我...
Well, I...

953
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:27,620
还没...
hadn't...

954
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,790
那我就...
I guess I'll...

955
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,540
高地那里有家新开的酒店
There's a new hotel on Highland that's...

956
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,950
据说不会很贵  而且挺不错的
supposedly not too expensive and... and pretty nice.

957
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,080
好的  我去看看
Okay, I'll check it out.

958
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:46,490
再次祝贺你获得麦克阿瑟天才奖
Again, that's great about the MacArthur.

959
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,040
谢谢
Thanks.

960
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,160
-查理  -怎么
- Charlie? - Yeah?

961
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:01,620
谢谢
Thanks.

962
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,040
该死
Fuck.

963
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,200
-怎么了  -她找的律师是诺拉
- What? - She's being represented by Nora.

964
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,870
听说她以公平著称
She's supposedly very fair?

965
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,790
好吧  事实是这样的  杰克
All right, here's the fact, Jack.

966
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,240
我每小时收费九百五十美元
I charge $950 an hour.

967
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,080
泰德收四百
Ted is 400.

968
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,290
如果你要问愚蠢的问题  找泰德
If you have a stupid question, you call Ted.

969
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:29,580
首先  我们要收两万五千美元的预付费
To start, we'll need a $25,000 retainer.

970
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,120
-我付不起这么多  -还有你所有的财务状况
- That's more than I can... - And all your financials.

971
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,950
我们要进行司法会计鉴定
We need to do a forensic accounting.

972
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:36,790
这个费用预计要一万到两万美元
Which runs anywhere from ten to twenty thousand dollars.

973
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,910
要是我们能立马达成协议  应该不会太贵
But if we can all agree right away, it shouldn't get too bad,

974
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,580
-对吧  -你是在洛杉矶登记结婚的吗
- right? - You were married here in LA?

975
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,490
是的  因为她妈妈和妹妹在这里
Yes... because her mom and sister are out here

976
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:45,700
我跟我的家人不大来往
and I'm not close with my family.

977
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,410
你儿子是在这里出生的吗
Your son was born out here?

978
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:48,620
是的  也是因为
Yes, because, again,

979
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,830
她妈妈和妹妹住在这里  我和...
her mom and sister are out here and I'm not...

980
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:52,660
也就是说  你在这里结的婚
So, you got married here,

981
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:54,540
你的孩子在这里出生
your kid was born here...

982
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,540
而且她在这里向你递交了文件
and she served you here?

983
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,450
对  但我们之前住在纽约
Yeah, but we lived in New York.

984
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:00,910
怎么了
Why?

985
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,990
-有什么问题吗  -我们得换个说法
- Is there a problem? - We'll have to reshape the narrative.

986
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:08,910
如果你真想让你的孩子跟你回纽约
If you're serious about having your child in New York,

987
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:10,700
我的建议是
this is what I suggest.

988
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,910
带你的孩子...你是不是说他叫弗莱德
You take your kid... D-Did you say his name was Fred?

989
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:15,160
亨利
Henry.

990
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:16,200
亨利
Henry?

991
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,540
那我怎么会说弗莱德
Why did I say Fred?

992
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,950
我有个儿子叫弗莱德
I have a kid named Fred.

993
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:22,620
你现在马上带亨利跟你回纽约
You take Henry to New York with you right now.

994
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:25,330
我们在纽约起诉
Then we file an action in New York.

995
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:26,910
把它变成纽约的案件
We make this a New York case.

996
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:29,080
我们要主张你们家在纽约
We need to make an argument that you're a New York-based family.

997
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:29,660
我们就是
Well, we are.

998
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,740
否则你以后可能
Otherwise, you'll probably never

999
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,950
只能在洛杉矶见到你儿子了
see your kid outside of LA again.

1000
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:34,740
真的吗  不行
Really? No.

1001
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,990
很难说服法院让孩子搬家
It's very hard to convince the courts to move a kid.

1002
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:41,450
一旦你让老婆孩子离开纽约
As soon as you let your wife and child leave New York,

1003
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:44,160
你就是在给自己挖坑
you made life very difficult for yourself.

1004
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,620
是  但正如我说的
Yes, but as I said,

1005
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,290
我们家在纽约  这是事实
we're a New York family, that's just a fact.

1006
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:51,120
她只是暂时待在这里
She's... here temporarily.

1007
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,910
那你觉得她为什么要在这里向你递交文件
Then why do you think she served you out here?

1008
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:58,990
我不知道  但是亨利想回纽约
I don't... know, but Henry wants to go back to New York.

1009
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,790
别管你孩子说了什么
Don't quote your kid.

1010
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:03,740
他只是挑你想听的话说
He's just telling you what you want to hear.

1011
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:07,370
相信我  他跟她说的是另一套
And trust me, he's telling her the opposite.

1012
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:08,950
把巴伯的材料给我
Let me have the Barber file!

1013
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,080
给你
It's right here.

1014
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,240
把我的午餐改到一点半
Move my lunch to 1:30.

1015
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,790
什么是
What's...

1016
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,490
"退场羊"
"Exit Goat"?

1017
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:24,330
退场幽灵  是我剧团的名字
Exit Ghost. It's the name of my theater company.

1018
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:25,540
你是导演
You're a director?

1019
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,990
戏剧导演  是的
Theater director, yeah.

1020
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,370
有我看过的剧吗
Anything I've seen?

1021
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:29,790
我不知道  你看过什么剧
I don't know. What have you seen?

1022
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,790
我们的《厄勒克特拉》要到百老汇演出了
Our production of Electra is moving to Broadway...

1023
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:36,740
我们很激动
which is exciting.

1024
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:39,200
我们得保护好这笔钱
We have to make sure that money is protected.

1025
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,740
搞戏剧赚不到多少钱的
I mean, it's theater, so it's not a lot of money.

1026
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:44,990
我基本上把赚的钱都投到剧团里了
I basically put whatever money I make back in the theater.

1027
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:48,330
我在想  我们是不是该要抚养费
I wonder, do we ask for support?

1028
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,200
-有意思  -让妮可给吗
- Interesting. - From Nicole?

1029
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,620
我不会这么做的
I'm not going to do that.

1030
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:53,990
你妻子家里有钱吗
Does your wife's family have money?

1031
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,830
她母亲以前演电视剧赚了些钱
Her mother has some from her TV career.

1032
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:59,290
她父亲去世了
And her father died.

1033
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:03,990
我们可以主张不让她母亲见孩子
Well, we could say that we don't want her mother to see the kid,

1034
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:05,370
把她拉进这个案子
draw her into the case.

1035
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:09,080
那样的话  她母亲可以付你的诉讼费用
In that instance, her mother could pay your legal fees.

1036
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:09,790
不行
No.

1037
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,370
我跟她母亲关系很好
I'm very close to her mom.

1038
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,700
妮可的家人就是我的家人
Nicole's family has been my family...

1039
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,490
是  但以后就不是了
Yeah, but that's going to change.

1040
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:17,660
我建议你赶紧接受这个现实
And I suggest you get used to it.

1041
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,580
我们要雇个私家侦探
We need to hire a private investigator.

1042
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,080
真的吗  我是说
Really? I mean...

1043
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:26,240
-真的要这样吗  -你妻子吸毒吗
- Really? - Does your wife do drugs or anything?

1044
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:27,290
可卡因
Coke?

1045
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:28,910
吸得不多
Not in any real way.

1046
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:31,580
如果她是个完美的母亲我们就赢不了了
Well, we're not going to win if she's the perfect mother.

1047
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:33,910
有一阵子她吃胃药上瘾
She was addicted to Tums for a while.

1048
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,370
那不算什么  她一天最多吃一瓶
It wasn't nothing. She was up to a tube a day.

1049
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:40,410
你有注意到有人跟踪你吗
Have you noticed anyone following you?

1050
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:41,120
没有
No.

1051
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,950
那多留意一下
Well, keep an eye out.

1052
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:46,080
你要做好准备
Look, you need to be prepared for the fact

1053
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:50,700
诺拉会把你描绘成一个忽略孩子  不顾家的父亲
that Nora is going to portray you as a neglectful, absent father.

1054
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:53,080
-我并不是  -你住在纽约
- But I'm not. - You live in New York.

1055
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,120
你工作很忙
You're consumed with your work.

1056
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:58,700
她和你的孩子独自留在这里  生活得很艰难
She and your kid are out here, struggling.

1057
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,950
诺拉会采取这个策略  我肯定
Nora's going to use that strategy. I'm sure of it.

1058
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:03,330
但是妮可不会说谎的
But Nicole's not going to lie.

1059
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:06,370
听着  如果我们讲理
Listen, if we start from a place of reasonable,

1060
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:08,740
他们不讲理
and they start from a place of crazy,

1061
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:12,830
达成协议时  我们就会介乎讲理和不讲理之间
when we settle, we'll be somewhere between reasonable and crazy.

1062
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:13,830
仍然是不讲理
Which is still crazy.

1063
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,580
半不讲理就是不讲理
Half of crazy is crazy.

1064
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:16,490
俗话说
You know what people say,

1065
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:18,450
"刑事辩护律师看的是坏人最善良的一面
"Criminal lawyers see bad people at their best,

1066
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:20,790
离婚律师看的是好人最丑陋的一面"
divorce lawyers see good people at their worst."

1067
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:23,700
这一切还没结束  你就会开始恨我和泰德
Before this is all over, you're going to hate me and Ted,

1068
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,490
因为我们代表着你生活中最丑陋的一面
just because of what we represent in your life.

1069
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:27,450
我相信你说的
I'm sure you're right.

1070
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:30,700
再跟我说一遍你的故事  你来这里看孩子
So tell me the story again. You came out here to see your kid.

1071
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,240
-也许我没解释清楚  -她向你递交了文件
- Maybe I'm not explaining this well. - She serves you.

1072
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,120
我们很友好  我们很好
We're friendly, we're fine.

1073
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,420
-真是个婊子  -我们就想把问题解决了
- What a bitch. - We're just trying to figure this out.

1074
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,700
她不是婊子
She's not a bitch.

1075
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,490
谢谢  但这不是...
Thanks, but this isn't...

1076
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:38,990
我们换个方式解决
We're doing it a different way.

1077
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:40,200
{\an8}吃  喝  再婚

1078
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,080
再说费用这么贵我根本付不起
And... I can't even close to afford this.

1079
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,370
我得回纽约了
I've got to get back to New York.

1080
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:46,410
我还要排演百老汇的剧呢
I have a Broadway play in rehearsals.

1081
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:53,790
我那时可是大红人
I was the hot shit at that time.

1082
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:58,580
年轻  特别性感  一头秀发
Young, very sexy, with a great head of hair.

1083
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:01,490
我非常感激查理给了我这个机会
I just so appreciate that Charlie gave me this opportunity.

1084
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:03,120
或者我应该感激妮可
Or maybe I should thank Nicole.

1085
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,540
我听说妮可的试播集要拍成电视剧了
I heard Nicole's pilot went to series,

1086
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:05,830
所以她要搬去洛杉矶了
so she's moving to LA.

1087
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:07,450
他们把亨利送去了那边的学校
And they put Henry in school out there.

1088
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:08,740
查理也要搬去吗
Well, is Charlie moving too?

1089
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,990
查理不去
Not Charlie.

1090
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:11,120
他不会抛弃我们的
He won't abandon us.

1091
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,990
而且剧团在洛杉矶也搞不起来
And you can't do theater in LA.

1092
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,330
查理说她拍完剧就会和亨利一起
Charlie said she and Henry are coming back to New York

1093
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,240
搬回纽约
when she finishes filming her show.

1094
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,830
我觉得不一定
I wouldn't be so sure.

1095
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,580
显然妮可一直不想留在纽约
Nicole was never going to stay in New York, that was obvious.

1096
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,660
她可能早就在计划这次搬家了
She was probably planning this move all along.

1097
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:27,410
相信我  她会抓住一切机会
When she sees an opportunity, believe me, she takes it.

1098
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:29,620
洛杉矶挺好的
Well, LA is nice.

1099
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,290
空间大
The space.

1100
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:33,950
获得四次奥斯卡的影后  舔我的...
Miss Four Time Oscar winner, sucking my...

1101
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:36,240
大家今天还好吗
Okay, how is everyone today?

1102
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,540
别靠太近  我被唐娜传染了感冒
Nobody get too close. I think I caught Donna's cold.

1103
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,290
-抱歉  查理  -我在等亨利跟我视频
- Sorry, Charlie. - I'm expecting a Skype call from Henry,

1104
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:43,120
一会儿可能要失陪一下
so I might have to step out.

1105
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,830
查理  你现在经受的事
So, Charlie, what you're going through now

1106
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:50,200
会很可怕  但总会结束的
is going to be horrible, but it will be over.

1107
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,450
谢谢  弗兰克
Thanks, Frank.

1108
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:52,990
-还有一件事  -什么
- Another thing. - Yeah?

1109
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:57,450
趁现在多找几个人上床
Fuck as many people as you can right now.

1110
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:59,950
女人  男人都行
Women, men.

1111
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,790
-你认真考虑一下  -绷带可能得找人帮缠一下
- Take what I said seriously. - You might need help wrapping gauze.

1112
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:05,870
-得紧一点  -好吧  我搞不太清楚
- It needs to stay tight. - Okay, I'm... I'm confused.

1113
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:07,990
这套隐形人服装是哪一幕用的
What... scene is the Invisible Man outfit for?

1114
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:09,990
不  那是我的万圣节服装
No, that's my Halloween costume.

1115
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:12,740
科学怪人服装是给亨利的
And the Frankenstein is for Henry.

1116
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:15,410
他这周末要来
He's coming here this weekend.

1117
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:17,450
我们要去公园坡讨糖
We're going to trick or treat in the Slope.

1118
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:19,910
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}二人均为导演
均拍摄过科学怪人改编影片

1119
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:19,910
我做的更接近詹姆斯·怀勒版本  而非肯尼斯·布拉纳
I made it more James Whale than Kenneth Branagh.

1120
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:21,870
-很好  -我能跟你谈谈吗
- Perfect. - Can I talk to you?

1121
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:24,580
行  去...
Yeah, over...

1122
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:27,200
我已经把前两次排练的走位都打出来了
I've typed up the blocking from the last two rehearsals,

1123
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,370
这是七十年代丹麦版的导演注释
and here are the director notes from that Danish production from the '70s.

1124
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,040
你在哪里找到的
Where'd you find it?

1125
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,910
图书馆
The library, duh.

1126
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,370
我今晚能过去吗
Can I come over tonight?

1127
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,490
玛丽·安  现在太艰难了
Mary Ann, it's too hard now.

1128
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:42,330
我现在没法和任何人在一起
I just can't be with anyone right now.

1129
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,830
但你还没离婚我们就做过
But we did it when you were married

1130
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:45,490
那时我们就不该做的
and we shouldn't have done it.

1131
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:47,990
现在你已经离婚了  我们不该做吗
And now that you're not married, shouldn't we be doing it?

1132
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:51,410
我现在还没有离婚
I'm not not married yet.

1133
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:53,040
你这是在折磨自己
You're torturing yourself.

1134
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,580
你盯着剧团别出乱子就行
Just make sure everything doesn't go to hell.

1135
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:58,950
-我就指望你了  好吗  -好
- I'm relying on you, okay? - Fine.

1136
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,620
-谢谢  -我希望你能多接受别人的好意
- Thanks. - I wish you'd accept generosity better.

1137
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,080
等等  让我...
Hold on. Let me...

1138
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,080
-你好  -是查理·巴伯吗
- Hello? - Is this Charlie Barber?

1139
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,450
是
Yes.

1140
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:08,370
你好  我是诺拉·范肖
Hi, this is Nora Fanshaw.

1141
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:10,200
我是你妻子妮可·巴伯的代理律师
I represent your wife, Nicole Barber.

1142
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,580
-你好  -你现在找到律师了吗
- Hi. - Do you have an attorney yet?

1143
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,290
没有
No.

1144
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:15,910
那么我可以直接和你谈话  好吗
Okay, then it's okay for me to talk to you directly, okay?

1145
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:16,700
好
Okay.

1146
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,370
我打电话来是因为
I'm calling because we haven't

1147
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:20,700
我们还没收到你的回复
received your response to our filing.

1148
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:22,160
我最近一直忙于排演戏剧
Yeah, I've been rehearsing this play

1149
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,790
还有坐飞机来回往返洛杉矶
and flying back and forth to LA.

1150
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:26,740
你必须作出书面回复
You're going to need to file your response.

1151
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,290
妮可说不用着急
Nicole said there was no rush.

1152
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:30,950
你收到我方文书
It's been more than 30 days

1153
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:32,040
已超过三十天
since you were served.

1154
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,830
法律规定你应当在三十天内回复
By law, you're meant to respond within 30 days.

1155
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:35,370
我不喜欢我第一次约见的律师
I didn't like the first lawyer I met.

1156
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:37,790
你收到的文件上写得很清楚
It says that very clearly on the document you were given.

1157
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:38,870
你看过了吗
Did you read it?

1158
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:40,740
看了  但我以为只是字面上说说
Yeah, but I thought that's just what it says.

1159
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,870
我们本来没打算请律师
We weren't even going to do it with lawyers.

1160
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:46,120
查理  我觉得我不应该把我的衬衫塞进去
Charlie, I think I shouldn't tuck in my shirt.

1161
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,540
妮可说我可以慢慢来
Nicole said I could take my time.

1162
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:48,620
我们已经让你慢慢来了
And we've let you take your time.

1163
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:51,030
-拍床戏时它总是跑出来  -你能等等吗
- It comes out during the love scene. - Could you hold a second?

1164
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:52,080
什么床戏
What love scene?

1165
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,490
我抱贝丝那一幕
When I hug Beth.

1166
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,660
你没有抱贝丝的戏
You don't hug Beth.

1167
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,120
我想我们应该在这里拓展一下
I think it's something we should explore.

1168
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,910
你就不能塞得更紧点  或者让唐娜别个别针吗
Can't you just tuck it in tighter or get Donna to safety pin it?

1169
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:01,830
而且我很讨厌
I also have a kind of a thing

1170
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:04,280
-把东西塞进去  -查理
- about tucking things in. - Charlie?

1171
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,970
如果你不书面回复
If you don't file your response,

1172
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:08,840
我们就将申请对你进行缺席审判
we're going to file a request for default judgment against you.

1173
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,070
...我对自己的身材缺乏自信
...insecurities about my figure.

1174
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:12,700
-查理  -在  抱歉
- Charlie? - Yes, sorry.

1175
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,650
缺席审判  那是什么意思  别抱贝丝
Default judgment, what does that mean? Don't hug Beth.

1176
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:17,080
我们能够索要想要的一切
We'll be able to lay claim to whatever we want.

1177
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,970
什么意思  你们想要什么一切
W-What do you mean, whatever you want of what?

1178
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:21,510
你的公寓  你的东西  你拥有的一切
Your apartment, your things, everything you own.

1179
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,270
我们...
We...

1180
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:25,410
我和她已经讨论过这点了  我们没多少东西
She and I already discussed this. We don't own that much stuff.

1181
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:26,570
她想拿走什么都行
She can have pretty much whatever she wants.

1182
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:27,820
这意味着我们能申请
And it means we'll set the number

1183
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,510
最高标准的儿童抚养费
for child support at its highest level

1184
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:31,790
并且主张孩子的完全监护权
and claim full custody of your child.

1185
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,230
完全监护权
Full custody?

1186
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,550
-那不...  -法律是这样规定的
- I mean, that's not even... - This is what the law says.

1187
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,510
妮可不会那么做的  不会的
Nicole's not going to do that. I mean, she won't.

1188
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,450
不  查理  我代表妮可
No, Charlie, I represent Nicole,

1189
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,490
我告知你的每句话她都知晓
and she's aware of everything I'm saying to you.

1190
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:49,410
我今早才跟她聊过
I just spoke to her this morning.

1191
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:52,270
我打来电话的五分钟前刚跟她聊过
Well, I spoke to her five minutes before I got on the call.

1192
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:56,910
好吧  那我该怎么做
Okay, so what do I do?

1193
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:59,290
你得找个律师  然后立刻回复
You need to get a lawyer and respond immediately.

1194
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:01,130
妮可想要和平解决这件事
Nicole wants to do this amicably,

1195
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:02,810
但你让我们别无选择
but you're leaving us no other option.

1196
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:04,390
我会找律师的  我能在这里找吗
I'll get a lawyer. Can I get a lawyer here?

1197
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,830
-我不知道"这里"是哪里  -纽约
- I don't know where "Here" Is. - New York.

1198
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:09,330
怪不得有这么多喇叭声
That's what all that honking is?

1199
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,670
不行  你得来洛杉矶  在洛杉矶找律师
No, you'll have to come to LA and meet people in LA.

1200
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:12,720
我在排演...
I'm rehearsing a...

1201
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:14,560
如果你不在周五前于洛杉矶做出回复
If you don't respond in Los Angeles by Friday,

1202
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,910
我们就别无选择了
you'll leave us no choice.

1203
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:18,220
哪条线
Wh... which line?

1204
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:21,110
我得接个电话  你能稍等片刻吗  查理
I have to take this. Can you hold on a second, Charlie?

1205
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:51,320
我和妈妈正在玩超级秘密寻宝游戏
Me and Mommy are in the middle of a super secret treasure hunt.

1206
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:54,770
-我以为飞机九点到  -你穿的是什么
- I thought the plane landed at nine. - What are you wearing?

1207
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:55,890
连裤袜
Sock pants.

1208
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,510
的确是九点到  连裤袜是什么
It did. What are sock pants?

1209
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:59,680
他不喜欢风吹在腿上的感觉
He doesn't like to feel the breeze on his legs.

1210
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:00,850
他自己穿的
He dressed himself.

1211
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,570
那他可以穿长裤  我能跟你谈谈吗
There are long pants. Can I talk to you?

1212
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,380
都快中午了
It's almost noon.

1213
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:04,480
堵车  我们得走了
There was traffic. We've got to get going.

1214
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,270
我们为什么从来没玩过寻宝
Why don't we ever do a treasure hunt?

1215
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:07,470
亨利  你能等等吗
Henry, can you wait a minute?

1216
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:08,640
不许私下谈话
No talking alone.

1217
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,170
就谈一会  然后我就过去
Just one bit of talking alone, then I'll be right there.

1218
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:12,960
我接到了你律师打来的电话
I got a call from your lawyer.

1219
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:15,430
她说如果我不回复
She said you'd take everything and...

1220
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:18,590
你就会拿走一切以及孩子的抚养权
custody and everything if I didn't respond.

1221
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:20,570
我们最好让律师处理这事
It's better if we just let the lawyers do this.

1222
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:22,490
对  但我觉得她说的话不是你的本意
Yeah, but she's saying things I don't think you mean.

1223
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,530
亨利  我们得走了
Henry, we need to get going.

1224
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:26,000
我现在不想走
I don't want to go now.

1225
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,520
-你找到律师了吗  -我来这里就是为了这事
- Have you gotten a lawyer yet? - That's what I'm here to do.

1226
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:30,000
快来  亨利  我赶时间
Come on, Henry. I'm in a rush.

1227
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:31,300
我还有三个线索
I have three more clues.

1228
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,390
你为什么要在我快到的时候
Why did you start a treasure hunt

1229
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:33,940
开始玩寻宝游戏
or whatever so close to my arrival?

1230
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:36,040
-真酷  -你迟到了  我们在打发时间
- Cool. - You were late. We were killing time.

1231
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,120
宝贝  快来  我们回头再玩寻宝游戏
Honey, come. We're going to finish the treasure hunt later.

1232
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,650
-我要发财了  -好
- I'm going to be rich! - Okay.

1233
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,300
你跟着爸爸  会很好玩的
You're going to go with your daddy, it's going to be fun.

1234
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,790
我准备了礼物  回来就奖励给你
And I've got a present for you when you get back as a reward.

1235
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:47,880
他又不是去看牙医
He's not going to the dentist.

1236
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,690
-我就是想帮忙  -我要留在这里
- I'm trying to help. - I'm staying here.

1237
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:50,620
走吧
Come on.

1238
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:55,510
亨利
Henry?

1239
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:03,640
-装了儿童增高座椅吗  -装了
- Got the booster? - I have a booster.

1240
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:07,300
等一下  没弄好
Oh, wait, no, it's not in.

1241
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:08,470
什么没弄好
What's not in?

1242
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,910
座椅没固定好
The seat's not connected.

1243
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,710
我让租车公司装了
I asked the rental company to install it.

1244
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:18,630
他们不能装  装了就要担责任了
Yeah, I think they can't for liability reasons.

1245
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,880
-你知道要怎么...  -我来...你把...
- Do you know how these things... - Let me just... if you...

1246
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,020
-应该可以卡住的  -底下...
- There should be a clip to clip onto. - ...dig...

1247
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,060
妈的
Fuck!

1248
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,900
-为什么骂人  -扎到我了
- Why "Fuck?" - Something sharp.

1249
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:33,540
-我不能和妈妈待在一起吗  -不行
- Can't I stay with Mom? - No.

1250
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:34,220
为什么不行
Why not?

1251
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:36,520
轮到我陪你了  我飞了快五千公里过来
It's my time with you. I just flew 3,000 miles.

1252
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,360
我不想去
I don't want to.

1253
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,030
亨利  赶紧上车
Henry, get in the fucking car!

1254
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:43,480
抱歉  但是赶紧上车
I'm sorry, but Jesus, get in the fucking car.

1255
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,770
乐高生化战士怎么拼
How do you spell Lego Bionicles?

1256
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:52,960
那是两个词  乐高是哪个字母开头的
That's two words. What does Lego start with?

1257
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,040
告诉我嘛
Just tell me.

1258
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,420
-你不想学吗  -不想
- Don't you want to learn it? - No.

1259
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,250
-反正就印在盒子上  -是"L"
- It's on the box, anyway. - L...

1260
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:58,260
然后呢
Then what?

1261
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:01,490
是"E"  剧团的人都托我跟你打招呼
E... you know, everyone at the theater says hi.

1262
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:02,980
然后是什么
Then what?

1263
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,810
是"咯"声的字母
A "G-g-g" sound.

1264
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:07,020
-你期待万圣节吗  -是"J"吗
- Are you excited for Halloween? - J?

1265
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:07,770
是"G"
G.

1266
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:09,630
-然后呢  -然后是"欧"的音
- Then what? - And an "O" Sound.

1267
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:11,610
-"O"吗  -你期待万圣节吗
- O? - Are you excited for Halloween?

1268
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:12,370
期待
Yeah.

1269
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:14,050
我带了我们俩的服装
I brought both our costumes.

1270
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:16,390
我要穿商店买来的忍者装
I'm going as a store-bought ninja.

1271
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:18,890
但我们说好了  我让唐娜给你做了科学怪人服装
But we agreed. I had Donna make you a Frankenstein.

1272
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:21,280
我不想扮成科学怪人了
I don't want to be a Frankenstein anymore.

1273
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,350
你确定吗
Are you sure?

1274
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:25,250
先看看再说
Maybe just look at it.

1275
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:27,980
很棒的  我们会扮成科学怪人和隐形人
It's awesome. We'll be Frankenstein and the Invisible Man.

1276
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:30,140
妈妈给我买了忍者服
Mom bought me a ninja costume,

1277
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,860
它更好  因为更贵
which is better because it costs more.

1278
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,520
理论上来说  把唐娜花的时间
Technically, the Frankenstein cost more

1279
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,810
还有材料算进去的话  科学怪人服装更贵
when you factor in Donna's time and the materials.

1280
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,770
表兄妹们也要扮成忍者
The cousins are also going to be ninjas.

1281
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,800
可是我们花了那么大力气  亨利
But Henry, we went through all this trouble.

1282
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:45,240
好吧
Okay.

1283
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:46,600
随便你吧
Whatever you want.

1284
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,560
请取票
Please take the ticket.

1285
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,890
-爸爸  你离太远了  -我知道
- Dad, you're too far. - I know.

1286
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,480
请取票
Please take the ticket.

1287
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:11,860
我不放心把包留在车上
So, I'm not comfortable leaving the bags in the car

1288
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:13,950
因为我把车钥匙给了不认识的人
where I've given the key to someone I don't really know.

1289
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:15,170
我来过这里
I've been here.

1290
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:16,250
这是个办公楼
It's an office building,

1291
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:18,770
你肯定去过类似的地方
so you've been to places like this before.

1292
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,770
我记得这些鱼
I remember those fish.

1293
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,260
鱼看起来都差不多
A lot of fish look the same.

1294
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:24,640
有什么事吗
Can I help you?

1295
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,420
我是查理·巴伯  和丹·科恩约了一点半
I'm Charlie Barber. I have a 1:30 with Dan Cohen.

1296
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:29,290
你的玩偶在哪
Where's your little man?

1297
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:32,520
我这次没带  我把骷髅放在我妈妈家
I don't have it this time. I keep my skeletons at my mom's.

1298
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,640
好吧
Okay.

1299
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,230
好的
Okay.

1300
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,290
抱歉  我们尝试过联系你
I'm sorry. We tried to reach you.

1301
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:40,200
科恩先生想让我代他道歉
Mr. Cohen wanted me to apologize.

1302
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,590
他不能见你  因为显然你妻子
He can't see you because apparently your wife

1303
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:45,820
已经和他在8月7日见面谈过代理一事了
already met with him on the 7th of August about representation.

1304
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,070
但她雇了别人
But she hired somebody else.

1305
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:50,510
-诺拉  -范肖吗
- Nora... - Fanshaw?

1306
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,140
但很遗憾  因为她已经找科恩先生咨询过
But unfortunately, because she consulted with Mr. Cohen already,

1307
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,160
根据法律  他不能再为你辩护
he's legally barred from representing you.

1308
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:57,970
-我们来喂鱼吧  -好
- Should we feed the fish? - Yeah.

1309
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:01,630
-这种事情很常见  -是吗
- It happens all the time. - Really?

1310
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:03,580
你有停车票的话我可以帮你免去停车费
If you have a ticket, I can validate your parking.

1311
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,370
人们尽可能多地见律师是很常见的
You know, it's common that people meet with as many lawyers as possible

1312
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:10,480
这样他们配偶的选择就会很有限
so that their spouse has limited options.

1313
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,570
我不认为她会故意那么做
I don't think she would've done it deliberately.

1314
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:13,820
你太天真了
You'd be surprised.

1315
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,930
它们出水能呼吸吗
Can all of them, like, breathe out of the water?

1316
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:20,400
你和妈妈去了很多办公室吗
Did you go to a lot of offices with your mom?

1317
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:21,950
没有特别多
Not so many.

1318
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:24,380
十一个吧
Like 11.

1319
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,430
我不认为会有人偷包  爸爸
I don't think anyone would have stealed the bags, Daddy.

1320
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:28,640
我今天得找到律师
I need somebody today.

1321
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,310
如果我明天还不回复  她说我会失去监护权
If I don't respond by tomorrow, she said I could lose custody.

1322
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:32,680
我不知道该打给谁了
I didn't know who else to call.

1323
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,250
肯定有她没找过的律师
There's got to be someone she didn't meet.

1324
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,630
我知道一个人
I have a name for you.

1325
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:38,480
伯特·斯皮茨
Bert Spitz.

1326
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:42,680
他曾是罗伯托经纪公司的娱乐业律师
He was the entertainment lawyer at Roberto's agency.

1327
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,490
太好了
Great.

1328
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:47,290
但他几年前被逼退休
But then he kind of got pushed into retirement a few years ago,

1329
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:49,280
然后转向了家庭法领域
and he went into family law.

1330
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,200
-我联系了他  -谢谢你  外婆
- I called him. - Thank you, G-ma.

1331
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,390
-他今天三点能见你  -妈的
- He can see you today at three. - Shit.

1332
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:57,160
我们从未有过这次谈话  小查理
We never had this conversation, Charlie-bird.

1333
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,570
没问题  我爱你
You got it. I love you.

1334
00:58:58,650 --> 00:58:59,490
爸爸
Dad!

1335
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:02,230
-我得再买一个汉堡  -为什么
- I need a new burger. - Why?

1336
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:05,510
因为你让我们俩扛着包进餐厅
Because you made us carry your bags into the restaurant,

1337
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:06,620
我把汉堡弄掉了
I dropped it.

1338
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:10,240
没事  把我的给你  上车吧
That's fine. I'll give you mine. Get in the car.

1339
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:13,510
你今天不能和我玩为什么还带上我
Why did you bring me today if you couldn't hang out with me?

1340
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:15,160
因为我之前一直不在  我想见你
Because I've been away and want to see you.

1341
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:19,520
杰米·蒂贝有个妹妹
Jamie Tuber has a little sister

1342
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,160
叫莉莉·蒂贝
named Lily Tuber.

1343
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,860
-嗯  -莉莉·蒂贝真的很蛮横
- Yeah. - And Lily Tuber is really bossy.

1344
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:27,930
带着孩子离婚
Getting divorced with a kid

1345
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:30,190
可能会是你做过最艰难的事
can be one of the hardest things you'll ever do.

1346
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:34,130
就像是没有尸体的死亡
It's like a death without a body.

1347
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:39,330
我有切身体会  我经历过四次
I know personally. I've been there four different times.

1348
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:40,860
你离了四次婚吗
You've been divorced four times?

1349
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:42,670
结了四次婚
Married four times.

1350
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:43,920
离了三次
Three divorces.

1351
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:47,210
上帝保佑最后一次会长久
This last one will stick, God willing.

1352
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,920
这正是我转向家庭法领域的原因
That's why I graduated into family law,

1353
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:52,500
帮助人们熬过这段痛苦的时间
to help people survive this painful time.

1354
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,330
我是这么看的
Here's how I see it.

1355
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:59,740
如果我们一直纠缠于"谁做了这个谁做了那个"
If we get bogged down in "Who did this," and "Who did that,"

1356
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:01,330
还有"我不想付那两美元"
and "I don't want to pay the two dollars,"

1357
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:04,360
这只会让你花费更多钱与时间
it'll just cost you more money and time and...

1358
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:06,300
还有情感压力
emotional stress,

1359
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:08,750
可能最终还是同样的结果
and you'll probably end up with the same result anyway.

1360
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:09,780
没错
Right.

1361
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,120
我认同这一看法  我相信她也是
I mean, I agree with that philosophy. She does too, I'm sure.

1362
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:16,160
我总是依照事实  不管结果会如何
And I always go with the truth, no matter where that takes us.

1363
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,630
我这行大多人伪造事实
You know, most people in my business make up the truth

1364
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:20,280
以实现自己的目的
so they can get where they need to go.

1365
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,980
你对他们来说只是交易
You're just transactions to them.

1366
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,910
我喜欢把你们当人看
I-I like to think of you as people.

1367
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,090
挺好的
Okay, good.

1368
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:28,170
不只是你  她也是
And not just you, her too.

1369
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:29,100
对
Yes.

1370
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,120
这过程可能会闹得很难看
You know, this can be a really ugly process.

1371
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:34,220
但我也相信不必闹得不可收场
But I also believe it doesn't have to be terrible.

1372
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:35,800
我很高兴听你这么说
I'm glad to hear you say that.

1373
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:40,380
我想尽可能减少开支
I'd love to keep expenses down as much as possible.

1374
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:41,420
当然
Of course you do.

1375
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:45,940
我收费是每小时四百五十美元  需要一万预付金
I charge 450 an hour and I need a $10,000 retainer to start.

1376
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:49,580
我看看能不能预支百老汇的收入
I'll see if I can get an advance on the Broadway transfer.

1377
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:52,440
记住了  你还得付她的律师费
And keep in mind, you'll have to pay for her lawyer.

1378
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:53,960
我不...
I didn't...

1379
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,440
-什么  -至少一部分
- What? - Well, at least part of her.

1380
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,110
这没道理  是不是
It doesn't make sense, does it?

1381
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:03,630
你这么做是因为爱孩子
I mean, you're doing this because you love your kid.

1382
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:07,530
可这么做的同时却消耗了用于孩子教育的钱
And in doing so, you're draining money from your kid's education.

1383
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:09,560
-太荒谬了  -确实
- It seems ridiculous. - It is.

1384
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:10,890
确实  年轻人
It is, boy.

1385
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,310
我们必须马上回复
We'll have to respond right away.

1386
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:17,600
你儿子在这里上学吗
Your son goes to school out here?

1387
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,990
是的  暂时的  我们说好了
Yeah, temporarily. We agreed.

1388
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:22,940
她的试播集要拍成电视剧了  我想迁就她
Her pilot went to series and I wanted to accommodate her,

1389
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:25,140
因为她经常觉得我们总按我的想法做
as she's often felt we do things on my terms.

1390
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,290
在离婚时做个更好的丈夫
Be a better husband in divorce.

1391
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,350
大概吧  但我们住在纽约
I guess something like that, but we live in New York.

1392
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,500
因为你孩子在这里上学
Well, with your kid going to school out here,

1393
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,140
法庭可能不会这么认为
the court may see it differently.

1394
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:36,170
我们会上法庭吗
Will we go to court?

1395
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:38,200
不  我们可不想上法庭
No, no, we don't want to go to court.

1396
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,410
加州的法庭就是灾难
The courts in California are a disaster.

1397
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:42,270
不  我们只是得考虑到这一点
No, that's just how we have to think about it.

1398
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,750
这应该不是我的眼镜
I'm not sure these are my glasses.

1399
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:46,860
你在这里时住哪
Where are you living while you're here?

1400
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:48,320
我现在住在酒店
I'm in a hotel right now.

1401
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,690
不  酒店看起来不太妙
No, a hotel doesn't look good.

1402
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:51,080
-谁看  -法庭
- To who? - The court.

1403
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:53,260
你刚刚说我们不会上法庭
You just said we weren't going to go to court.

1404
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:54,180
不  当然  当然
No, of course, of course.

1405
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:57,140
我们必须做好上庭的准备  希望不会上庭
We have to prepare to go to court, hoping we don't go to court.

1406
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:58,110
好吧
Okay.

1407
01:01:58,290 --> 01:01:59,780
你应该在洛杉矶找个住处
You should get a place in LA.

1408
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:03,250
在她附近的房子  对争夺监护权更有利
And get a place near her. It looks better for custody reasons.

1409
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,410
她住在西好莱坞  房租很贵
She's in West Hollywood. That'll be expensive.

1410
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:07,260
我想我可以把我们在纽约的公寓租出去
I-I guess I could rent our New York apartment.

1411
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:08,360
不要出租
Don't rent it.

1412
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:11,080
你必须继续证明你们是住在纽约的
You have to continue to prove New York residence.

1413
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,980
当然  如果你在洛杉矶有住处
And of course, if you have a place in LA,

1414
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:15,640
就很难证明你们都住在纽约  是吧
it's hard to show you all live in New York, isn't it?

1415
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:16,610
那...
So...

1416
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:18,520
我该怎么做
what do I do?

1417
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:22,310
我建议你尽可能多地陪伴你儿子
I recommend you spend as much time as you can with your son.

1418
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,020
许多人争取监护时间
Many people fight for that time,

1419
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:26,510
然后又根本不用
then they don't even use it.

1420
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:28,580
他们只是想赢
They just want to win.

1421
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:30,760
事情没那么复杂  对吧
This shouldn't be that complicated, right?

1422
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:32,630
我们家住在纽约
I mean, we're a New York family.

1423
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:35,880
我觉得一切都很清楚  不是吗
I think it's all pretty straightforward. Right?

1424
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:37,550
我希望是
I hope so, yes.

1425
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:40,250
我觉得没理由...
I see no reason...

1426
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:43,210
你们两个都爱孩子
You both love your child.

1427
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:45,490
你们尊重对方
You respect each other.

1428
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:47,810
这过程没理由会很痛苦
Why this shouldn't be relatively pain-free.

1429
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:48,750
没错
Right.

1430
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,900
你戴的应该是我的眼镜
I think you have my glasses.

1431
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:54,630
怪不得
That makes sense.

1432
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:58,170
-你在做什么  -看这本杂志
- What have you been doing? - Reading this magazine.

1433
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,380
你在看《加州律师》吗
You were reading California Lawyer?

1434
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:01,330
是的
Yeah.

1435
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:02,790
好  我就快结束了
Okay, I'm almost done.

1436
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:06,460
我不会对那只猫期待太高
I wouldn't expect too much from that cat.

1437
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:11,260
-你想养什么宠物  -不知道
- What kind of pet do you want? - I don't know...

1438
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:14,050
我希望你知道这一切终究会结束
I want you to know that eventually this will all be over,

1439
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:16,050
不管我们这次是赢是输
and whatever we win or lose...

1440
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:19,510
都该是你们两个人一起解决这事
it'll be the two of you having to figure this out together.

1441
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:20,770
谢谢你
Thank you.

1442
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:24,760
你是这个过程中第一个把我当人看的
You're the first person in this process who's spoken to me like a human.

1443
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,790
你让我想起第二段婚姻中的自己
You remind me of myself on my second marriage.

1444
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,250
快过来  快过来
Come! Come! Come! Come!

1445
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:40,260
你和爸爸玩得开心吗
You have fun with Daddy?

1446
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:42,150
我们转了好几个办公室
We drove around to offices.

1447
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:45,680
想看看你的忍者服吗  在外婆床上
Do you want to see your ninja costume? It's on G-ma's bed.

1448
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,110
-好呀  -好
- Yeah! - Yeah.

1449
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:51,730
我让唐娜给他做了这件科学怪人服装
You know, I had Donna build him this whole Frankenstein thing

1450
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:53,420
带插头什么的
with the plugs and...

1451
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:55,850
他的表兄妹们都扮忍者  所以他也想...
Yeah, well, the cousins are ninjas, so he wanted to do that...

1452
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:57,510
但我和他一起决定了扮这个
But he and I had decided together.

1453
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:59,650
我不能逼他扮科学怪人
Well, I can't make him be Frankenstein.

1454
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:01,630
我没让逼他  只是你或许能帮我一下
I'm not asking you to, but maybe you can help me out a little.

1455
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:02,720
我把这科学怪人服装留在这里
I'll leave the Frankenstein here,

1456
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,520
或许你能劝他穿这个
maybe you can nudge him in that direction.

1457
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,040
我会试试
I'll try.

1458
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:08,900
你...
What's the...

1459
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:11,910
你又染头发了吗  是为了拍戏吗
Did you dye your hair again? Is that for your show?

1460
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:15,060
不  我就是这样  之前见你就是这样
No, this is me. It was this way when I saw you before.

1461
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,740
我知道  但我那时没说什么
I know, but I didn't say anything then.

1462
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:19,100
你不喜欢吗
You don't like it?

1463
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:20,530
不是  其实还好
No, I guess it's fine.

1464
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:22,910
剪短了吗  我更喜欢长点  不过...
Is it shorter? I prefer longer but...

1465
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,900
抱歉  有点可笑
Sorry, it's just absurd.

1466
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:29,340
没事吧
Is everything okay?

1467
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:31,100
没事  怎么了
Yeah. Why?

1468
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:34,220
你看着...像有事...
You seem, I don't know, like something is...

1469
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:35,310
一切都好
Everything's fine.

1470
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,110
好吧  我去酒店办理入住
Okay, I'm going to check in at the hotel,

1471
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:41,990
不过应该能五点或五点半来找你们
but I should be able to get to you guys by 5:00, 5:30...

1472
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:45,110
我们要去凯西家  在帕萨迪纳
We're going to Cassie's in Pasadena

1473
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:46,320
和他的表兄妹们一起去讨糖
and trick-or-treating with the cousins.

1474
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,640
凯西现在住在帕萨迪纳了吗
Cassie lives in Pasadena now?

1475
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:50,140
是的  她和山姆几个月前搬去了那里
Yes. She and Sam moved there a couple months ago.

1476
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,630
好吧  我对帕萨迪纳不怎么熟
Okay, I don't really know Pasadena.

1477
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:52,290
我会搞清楚
I'll figure it out.

1478
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:54,170
-因为我妈很期待  -地址在哪
- Because my mom is looking forward to it... - What's the address?

1479
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:56,170
-凯西和山姆生气了  -我给山姆发短信
- and Cassie and Sam are mad. - I'll text Sam.

1480
01:04:56,410 --> 01:04:57,800
-生谁的气  -你
- Mad at who? - You.

1481
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:00,220
-凯西和山姆吗  -你能理解吧
- Cassie and Sam? - You can understand that.

1482
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:02,870
所以我想我们应该各自过万圣节
So, I think we should probably do separate Halloweens.

1483
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:05,220
可是你没意见  他们不也该没意见吗
But if you're okay with it, then shouldn't they be okay with it?

1484
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:07,400
-我们这次就这么做吧  -你不想让我去吗
- Let's do it this way this time. - Do you not want me there?

1485
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:08,360
我没问题
I'm fine with it.

1486
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,360
-好吧  -这对他来说是好事
- Okay. - It'll be nice for him.

1487
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:11,860
他可以过两次万圣节
He'll have two Halloweens.

1488
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:14,520
第二次万圣节我要和他做什么
What am I going to do with him for second Halloween?

1489
01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:16,040
逛日落大道吗
Walk around Sunset Boulevard?

1490
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,620
或许酒店会有什么活动
Maybe the hotel has something.

1491
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:20,000
或者你可以开车去别的社区
Or you can drive to a different neighborhood.

1492
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,540
太阳永远落下了
The sun sets forever.

1493
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:31,670
再也不会有黎明
There shall never be another dawn.

1494
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:32,770
不
No!

1495
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:35,620
小姐
Lady...

1496
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:39,700
我需要阴影
I require the solace of the shadows...

1497
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,140
和黑暗的抚慰
and the dark!

1498
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:04,730
准备好过万圣节了吗
Okay, ready for Halloween?

1499
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:07,160
挺精致嘛
Elaborate.

1500
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,180
宝贝  别忘了穿外套
Sweetheart, don't forget to wear your jacket.

1501
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:09,950
天变冷了
It's getting colder.

1502
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:11,780
-这里不错  -准备好再次出门了吗
- This is a nice house. - Ready to go back out?

1503
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:13,450
-他得尿尿  -不用尿
- He has to pee. - No, I don't.

1504
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:14,490
他得尿尿
He does.

1505
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,160
他的一些玩偶在里面  还有一只玩具熊
Some of his men are in here and also Bear-Bear.

1506
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,070
那只玩具熊可以归你  因为我还有一只
You can keep that Bear-Bear, because I got another one.

1507
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:20,720
他知道有两只玩具熊吗
Does he know that there are two Bear-Bears?

1508
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:21,630
那就是他的主意
It was his idea.

1509
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:23,790
你是大卫·鲍伊吧  《站台》
David Bowie, right? Station to Station?

1510
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:23,790
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}英国摇滚歌手及其专辑

1511

起舞吧
Let's Dance.

1512
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:28,600
亨利  和爸爸好好享受万圣节  好吗
Henry, have a great Halloween with Daddy, okay?

1513
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,220
玩得开心
Have fun.

1514
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:36,390
快去尿尿  然后我们再出去
Go pee and then we're going back out.

1515
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:38,440
我太累了
I'm too tired.

1516
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,870
去尿尿  我们要开车出去过万圣节
Go pee, and then we're going to go drive to Halloween.

1517
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,350
这条街看起来有戏
This block looks promising.

1518
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:45,450
真希望万圣节结束了
I wish Halloween was over.

1519
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:47,110
还没结束
Well, it isn't.

1520
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:49,700
我们要是在纽约  就可以步行
If we were in New York, we could be walking.

1521
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:52,980
但现在坐着挺好的  我喜欢坐着
But I like that we're sitting right now. I like to sit.

1522
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:56,840
没错  洛杉矶的人确实喜欢坐着
That's true, Los Angeles does have sitting going for it.

1523
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,610
我想这就是我更喜欢洛杉矶的原因
I think that's why I like Los Angeles better.

1524
01:06:59,610 --> 01:07:00,770
因为你能坐着吗
Because you get to sit?

1525
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:02,910
不  因为我更喜欢这里的朋友
No, because I like my friends here better.

1526
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:04,240
这不是真的
That's not true.

1527
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:07,450
霍雷肖和波比呢
What about Horatio and Poppy?

1528
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:09,630
霍雷肖不喜欢我了
Horatio doesn't like me anymore.

1529
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,360
我不喜欢波比
And I don't like Poppy.

1530
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:13,120
我在这里有阿克塞尔
Here, I have Axel.

1531
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:16,120
阿克塞尔很有趣  你会喜欢他的  爸爸

大家都睡着了
Everyone's asleep.

1535
01:07:57,890 --> 01:08:05,230

我要尿尿
I need to pee!

1537
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:50,370
这打火机是谁给的
Who gave you a lighter?

1538
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,510
把坐垫掀起来
Lift the seat.

1539
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:02,900
我周一得回纽约
I'm going to have to go back to New York on Monday.

1540
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:04,200
冲水了吗
Did you flush?

1541
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:11,930
洗手
Wash your hands.

1542
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,160
你能陪我玩吗
Will you play with me?

1543
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:17,800
我累了  宝贝
I'm tired, honey.

1544

你听到了吗  我要回纽约
Did you hear me? I have to go back to New York.

1545
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:34,990
小心  嗖  我要掉下来了
Watch out! Whoosh! I'm falling!

1546
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:40,120
你没接住我
You didn't catch me.

1547
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:43,540
怎么样
Okay?

1548
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,980
你为什么不在这里待久一点
Why aren't you here more?

1549
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:48,940
我得工作
I have to work.

1550
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:51,540
你知道我的剧要在百老汇上演了
You know my play is opening on Broadway.

1551
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:54,480
是因为你不想待在妈妈身边吗
Is it because you don't want to be near Mom?

1552
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,590
不是  我们聊过这事了
No. You know, like we talked about,

1553
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,260
我们俩决定不管在哪  都不会在一起了
we both decided not to be together no matter where we are,

1554
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:00,970
但我们都想跟你在一起
but we both want to be with you.

1555
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,250
但你要是回纽约  就不在我身边了
But you're not near me if you're in New York.

1556
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:06,580
我们都还住在纽约
Well, we all still live in New York.

1557
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,170
嗯  但我在这里上学
Yeah, but I go to school here.

1558
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,790
暂时如此
Just for right now.

1559
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,190
就像那次我去导演戏剧  我们一家住在哥本哈根
Like that time we were in Copenhagen for my play.

1560
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:15,980
还记得那些在桶里的小孩吗
Remember all those kids in buckets?

1561
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:17,790
我喜欢在这里上学
I like my school here,

1562
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:20,500
妈妈说如果我们愿意  就可以留在这里
and Mom says we could stay here if we want.

1563
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:23,020
什么意思
What do you mean?

1564
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,260
她这么说吗
She said that?

1565
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,300
对
Yeah.

1566
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:57,160
-喂  -你要搬到洛杉矶吗
- Hello? - Are you moving out here?

1567
01:10:58,660 --> 01:10:59,720
你找到律师了吗
Did you find a lawyer?

1568
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,440
找了  亨利说你要搬到这里
Yes. Henry says you're moving here.

1569
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:02,800
让你的律师打给诺拉吧
Have your lawyer call Nora.

1570
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,180
我想以我们的身份谈谈这件事
I want to talk about it as us.

1571
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:05,290
"我们"算什么
Who the fuck is "us"?

1572
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:07,770
我们坐下来谈谈吧  就我们俩
Let's just get in a room, you and me.

1573
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:09,020
我们一直都说要这么做的
That's what we always said we'd do.

1574
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:10,410
-我的律师不让我  -由不得他们
- My lawyers wouldn't let me - It's not up to them.

1575
01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:12,600
-签任何东西 -我们说了算  是我们离婚
- sign anything. - It's up to us. It's our divorce.

1576
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,500
他们说我之后可以控告他们渎职
They say I could later sue them for malpractice.

1577
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,100
我惹上了什么麻烦
What am I walking into?

1578
01:11:16,150 --> 01:11:17,580
你惹上了什么麻烦
What are you walking into?

1579
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:19,350
对  这他妈怎么回事
Yes, what the fuck is going on?!

1580
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:23,340
我看了你的电邮  查理  我都看了
I read your fucking emails, Charlie! I read them all.

1581
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,300
-什么时候  -不知道  就在最近
- When? - I don't know, recently.

1582
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:26,790
-靠  -你个死的骗子
- Shit. - You're a fucking liar.

1583
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:28,100
你上了玛丽·安
You fucked Mary Ann!

1584
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,470
那是在我睡沙发之后
It was after I was sleeping on the couch.

1585
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:31,310
你说要解决我们的问题都是屁话
All this bullshit about working on us.

1586
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:33,190
你知道吗  我一直在努力解决
You know what? I have been working.

1587
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:34,900
我一直在孤军奋战
I've been doing the work alone.

1588
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:36,330
你怎么能看到我的电邮
How did you read my emails?

1589
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:38,890
我黑了你的账号  蠢蛋
I hacked into your account, you dumb fuck!

1590
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:39,960
那是非法的
I think that's illegal!

1591
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:42,740
别他妈对搬到洛杉矶感到惊讶
Don't give me this shit about being surprised about LA.

1592
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:44,630
想不到吧  我有自己的想法
Surprise! I have my own opinions.

1593
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:45,870
你怎么知道如何黑我的账号
How do you even know how to do something like that?

1594
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:48,270
想不到吧  我想要的东西不是你想要的
Surprise! I want things that aren't what you want,

1595
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:50,710
因为想不到吧  你上了别的女人
because, surprise, you were fucking another lady.

1596
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:53,920
就那一次  我觉得你把两件事混为一谈了
It was one time! I think you're conflating two different things.

1597
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,580
玛丽·安和洛杉矶没关系
Mary Ann has nothing to do with LA.

1598
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:57,250
我就是在混为一谈  混蛋
I am conflating, motherfucker!

1599
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:58,870
你就看着我无理取闹吧
You watch me conflate!

1600
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:04,680
你刚刚是跺脚了吗
Did you just stamp your foot?

1601
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:08,060
我之前从没这么干过  我只是太生气了
I don't think I've ever done that before. I'm just so angry.

1602
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,700
看来你需要喝一杯
You look like you needed one.

1603
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:12,810
没错  谢谢
Yes, I do, thanks.

1604
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:15,140
日本人正在调制
You know, the Japanese are making

1605
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:17,480
非常有意思的龙舌兰酒
really interesting tequila right now.

1606
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,050
听起来挺刺激
That's exciting, I guess.

1607
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:23,000
-什么事让你这么生气  -我那混账前夫
- What are you so angry about? - My fucking ex-husband.

1608
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:26,900
我一直都心怀愧疚  他却只想着自己
I spent all this time feeling guilty, and he's so self-absorbed.

1609
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,060
这毫无意义
It's pointless.

1610
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,330
就像是和自己玩游戏
It's a game I'm playing with myself.

1611
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:34,160
我叫帕布罗  我们见过...
Pablo. Uh, we met at...

1612
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:36,700
-你是那个拿反光板的  -撩妹的器械师
- You held the bounce board. - The flirty grip.

1613
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:42,710
-按我说的来  好吗  -什么
- Here's what I want you to only do, okay? - What?

1614
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,070
-我要你用手指插我  -什么
- I want you to finger me. - What?

1615
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:47,110
-用手指就行  -好
- Just finger me. - Okay.

1616
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:49,970
我们只用手  好吗
That's all we're going to do, just fingering. Okay?

1617
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:52,100
我要改变我的人生
I'm changing my whole fucking life.

1618
01:12:58,610 --> 01:13:01,910
妮可和查理的儿子亨利在洛杉矶出生
Nicole and Charlie's son, Henry, was born here in Los Angeles.

1619
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:05,300
目前就读于月桂谷的月桂小学
He currently attends Laurel Elementary in Laurel Canyon,

1620
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,080
妮可在好莱坞工作
and Nicole works in Hollywood

1621
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,930
同时也承担起了母亲的全部责任
while also maintaining a full schedule as a mother

1622
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:12,830
上游泳课  美术课
with classes of swim, art,

1623
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:15,990
体育课  音乐课和活动小组
gym, and music, as well as play groups.

1624
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:19,910
妮可是亨利的主要监护家长
Nicole is Henry's primary custodial parent,

1625
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:24,380
查理如果想行使所定的监护时间
and to the extent that Charlie would like to exercise his custodial time,

1626
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:27,840
就应该来加州探望亨利
he should be making efforts to visit Henry here in California.

1627
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,660
诺拉  你好像忽视了
Nora, you seem to be ignoring the fact

1628
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:33,000
他们在纽约住了十年这一事实
that they lived in New York for ten years.

1629
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,320
没错  我的委托人在纽约工作了几年
My client worked in New York for several years, that's true.

1630
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,930
但妮可生长于洛杉矶
But Nicole was born and bred right here in LA.

1631
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:42,540
她和查理在多数假期和暑期都会来这里
She and Charlie would come here most holidays and summers

1632
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:45,520
和她住在洛杉矶的家人们共度时光
to spend time with her family, who all live in LA.

1633
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,110
他们是在洛杉矶结婚的
She and Charlie were married in LA.

1634
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:49,970
你要看看当时的照片吗
Would you like to see the photos?

1635
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:52,080
不  我不必看照片
No, I don't need to see the photos.

1636
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:54,340
不过照片一定拍得很好看
Although I'm sure they both look beautiful.

1637
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:57,920
我的委托人以为
It's my client's expectation

1638
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,570
在拍完这部电视剧之后
that after this TV show is completed,

1639
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:02,370
双方就会搬回纽约
the parties will move back to New York

1640
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:04,330
他们在那里有一所公寓
where they currently keep an apartment.

1641
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:07,740
据我所知  查理向妮可保证过
And it's my understanding that Charlie promised Nicole

1642
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:11,080
他们在婚内会多来洛杉矶
that they would spend more time in Los Angeles during the marriage.

1643
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:14,150
但由于他坚称他得留在纽约工作
But because of his insistence that his work keep them in New York,

1644
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:18,160
妮可最终在纽约待的时间比预期的更长
Nicole ended up staying there much longer than she ever anticipated.

1645
01:14:19,550 --> 01:14:21,550
事实上  早在几年前
In fact, a few years ago,

1646
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:25,040
查理就收到了在格芬剧院的驻留项目邀约
Charlie was offered a residency at the Geffen Playhouse

1647
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:28,290
能够将工作和家庭
that would have taken his work and his family

1648
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:30,350
转来洛杉矶一年
to Los Angeles for a year.

1649
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:32,520
而他...
And he, um...

1650
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:33,800
拒绝了这个机会
turned it down.

1651
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:36,420
尽管那是妮可的愿望
Even though that was Nicole's desire.

1652
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:40,550
他想为家庭和孩子维持稳定
He wanted to maintain consistency for his family and his child.

1653
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:42,750
这与他为了能导演一部戏剧
Was this the same consistency he wanted to maintain

1654
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:44,820
举家搬去哥本哈根半年
when they went to Copenhagen for six months

1655
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:46,230
是同一种稳定吗
so he could direct a play?

1656
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:49,750
我知道查理住在纽约
Now, while I understand Charlie lives in New York...

1657
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,540
与工作安排不冲突的时候
and when it's convenient to his work schedule,

1658
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:54,410
他就会飞来看儿子
he flies out to see his son...

1659
01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:56,600
他一有机会就飞过来  花费巨大
He flies out here every chance he gets, at great expense.

1660
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,610
我不明白你为什么不能一直住在这里
I don't see any reason you can't be out here full time.

1661
01:14:58,610 --> 01:15:00,140
他要在纽约谋生
He makes his living in New York.

1662
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:02,950
-抱歉  要考虑一下午餐吗  -好主意
- Sorry, do we want to contemplate lunch? - Good idea.

1663
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:05,060
我现在订餐  等我们都饿了正好送到
I'll order now so it'll come when we're all hungry.

1664
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:06,060
好
Yeah.

1665
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:08,550
-曼宁餐厅可以吗  -我很喜欢
- Everyone good with Manny's? - I'd love Manny's.

1666
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:10,370
你吃过曼宁餐厅吗
Have you had Manny's?

1667
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,020
你会喜欢的
You'll love it.

1668
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:15,070
有非常美味的三明治和沙拉
Just really yummy sandwiches and salads.

1669
01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:16,530
我要培根生菜番茄三明治
I'll have the BLT.

1670
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:17,530
爸
Dad?

1671
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:18,780
换成火鸡的
Turkey.

1672
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:20,500
我要培根生菜番茄三明治
I'll have the BLT.

1673
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,530
-你要羽衣甘蓝对吗  -羽衣甘蓝沙拉
- You'll have the kale? - Kale salad.

1674
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:41,760
我不知道吃什么  抱歉
I don't know, sorry.

1675
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:45,240
查理要...
Charlie will have, um...

1676
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:48,560
希腊沙拉
the Greek salad,

1677
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:51,830
把希腊酱换成柠檬和橄榄油
but with lemon and olive oil instead of the Greek dressing.

1678
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:52,640
好
Okay.

1679
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,040
-我要中式鸡肉沙拉  -好的
- I'll have the Chinese chicken salad. - Okay, sure.

1680
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,280
-谢谢  -客气
- Thank you. - Yeah.

1681
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:02,620
查理  恭喜你获奖了  妮可跟我说了
Congratulations, Charlie, on your grant. Nicole told me.

1682
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:03,740
谢谢
Thank you.

1683
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:05,340
他是个天才
He's a genius.

1684
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:09,400
我跟妮可说  我很喜欢你的戏剧
Well, I told Nicole I loved your play.

1685
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,030
-谢谢  -真的很喜欢
- Thanks. - Really.

1686
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:13,430
你是个人才
You are one smart cookie.

1687
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:15,440
谢谢
Thanks.

1688
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:17,120
我真想
I would just love to...

1689
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:20,350
钻进你的脑袋里
crawl inside that brain.

1690
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:25,340
有那么一刻可以闻到你的天才气息  闻得到
There was that one moment when you smell the toast, smell.

1691
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:29,050
真的是我那年看过的最爱的剧
It was literally my favorite thing that I saw that year.

1692
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:31,440
-谢谢  -实至名归
- Thanks. - Truly genius.

1693
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:32,380
谢谢你
Thank you.

1694
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:35,320
听说这部剧在百老汇停演了  我很遗憾
I was sorry to hear it closed on Broadway.

1695
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,080
他们感受不到天才气息
They couldn't smell the toast.

1696
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:40,140
这部剧非常有感染力
It was so emotional.

1697
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,690
我想竞争一定很激烈吧
It's very competitive, I imagine.

1698
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:48,650
查理在洛杉矶期间
Now, when Charlie is in Los Angeles,

1699
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:52,300
妮可当然赞成对于亨利来说
Nicole, of course, agrees that it will be best for Henry

1700
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:55,050
见到父母的时间一样多是最好的
that he see each parent equally.

1701
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:00,260
洛杉矶很不错的  查理  你应该试试
It's very nice out here, Charlie. You should give it a chance.

1702
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:02,730
对  这里空间广阔  无处可比
Yeah, and the space... you can't beat it.

1703
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:04,140
我也喜欢这里
I love it too.

1704
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:08,090
但撇开我们对这两座城市的个人感受不谈
But all of our personal feelings about the two cities aside,

1705
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:09,810
我们不同意你们主张的
we don't share your assertion

1706
01:17:09,810 --> 01:17:12,440
这对夫妇是住在洛杉矶的说法
that the couple is an LA-based family.

1707
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:14,870
很明显  他们的协议是
It was very clearly their deal

1708
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:18,150
在妮可拍完这部电视剧之后搬回纽约
that they would go back to New York after Nicole finished her show.

1709
01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:19,920
我可没听说有什么协议
I'm not aware of any deal.

1710
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:22,480
我没有写成书面协议
Well, I didn't get it in writing.

1711
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:28,240
查理  这个协议和你答应的
Charlie, is this like the deal that you made

1712
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:31,800
你们在婚内会多来洛杉矶的协议一样吗
that you and Nicole would spend more time in LA during your marriage?

1713
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,870
那不是协议  我们只是讨论过
We didn't have a deal. It was something we discussed.

1714
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,010
但是...
But...

1715
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:38,810
所以你的要求就是协议
So, it's a deal when it's something you want

1716
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,040
而妮可的要求就是讨论
and a discussion when Nicole wants it?

1717
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:45,220
请求私下商量
Sidebar...

1718
01:17:46,230 --> 01:17:47,580
诺拉  有空办公室
Nora, do you have a spare office

1719
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,200
让我跟查理私下商量吗
where Charlie and I can sidebar?

1720
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,260
当然
Sure.

1721
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:52,240
-你能...  -我带你们去
- Can you, um... - I can show you.

1722
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:53,250
走吧
Come on.

1723
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:02,550
诺拉是位很棒的律师
Nora is a very good lawyer.

1724
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:05,270
-强势  对吗  -对
- Tough, right? - Yeah.

1725
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,520
而你现在进退两难
And you're in a bind

1726
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,400
因为你已经表明了你愿意飞到这里
because you've shown you're willing to fly out here

1727
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,200
租间公寓来看儿子
and rent an apartment to see your son.

1728
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:12,020
-是你叫我这么做的  -我知道
- You told me to do that. - I know that.

1729
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,180
而且我这么做是因为想见儿子
And I'm doing that because I want to see my kid,

1730
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:15,310
不是为了开创先例
not to set a precedent.

1731
01:18:15,310 --> 01:18:18,380
对  但不幸的是  你确实在开创先例
Yes, but unfortunately, you are setting a precedent.

1732
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:20,440
而且法官也可能会这么看
And a judge might look at it that way.

1733
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:21,600
还有什么别的办法吗
What's the alternative?

1734
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,720
我待在纽约再也不来这里行吗
I stay in New York and never come out here?

1735
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:25,850
不行  因为那样会让法庭觉得
No, because then it would look to the court

1736
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:27,730
你不在乎见不见儿子
like you don't care about seeing your son.

1737
01:18:27,730 --> 01:18:29,480
到底上不上法庭  别一下说"上法庭"
Court or no court? Stop saying

1738
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:31,120
一下又说"不上法庭"
"court" and then "never court."

1739
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,810
照这个趋势下去  我们很可能要上法庭
Well, the way this is going, we may have to go to court.

1740
01:18:34,330 --> 01:18:37,280
-你知道你这话听上去有多疯狂吗  -知道
- Are you aware of how maddening you sound? - I am.

1741
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,570
而且我知道看起来不公平
And I know it seems unfair.

1742
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:45,500
但想像一下如果你是一位
But imagine if you were...

1743
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:49,250
被丈夫抛弃的可怜母亲
a poor mother whose husband abandons her,

1744
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:51,380
而且他还拒绝支付任何费用
and then refuses to pay anything.

1745
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:55,820
政府就是要保护人们免于陷入这种困境
That's what the system is trying to protect people from.

1746
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:58,980
听着
Listen...

1747
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,010
如果由我来代理你
if I were representing you...

1748
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:02,130
你是在代理我啊
You are representing me.

1749
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:04,100
对  不  当然  不
Right, no, of course. No...

1750
01:19:04,450 --> 01:19:08,490
我觉得法官不会让这孩子离开加州
I don't see a judge moving this child from California.

1751
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:10,640
我们今天应该尽量达成和解
I think we try and settle today.

1752
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,970
怎么和解
Settle meaning what?

1753
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,380
孩子留在洛杉矶
She gets LA.

1754
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:16,290
不行  伯特
No, Bert, just...

1755
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:18,160
不行
No.

1756
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:20,170
我们必须得赢
I mean, we have to win this.

1757
01:19:20,170 --> 01:19:22,940
别忘了  对亨利最好的做法才叫赢
Remember, the win is what's best for Henry.

1758
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:25,410
如果你们上法庭  就会把他也卷进来
And if you guys go to court, he's going to get pulled into it.

1759
01:19:25,410 --> 01:19:28,800
但如果他住在这里而我住在纽约
But if he stays here and I stay in New York, that's just...

1760
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,200
那我就无法...
then I won't...

1761
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:32,610
我再也无法当他的父亲了
I'll never get to really be his parent again.

1762
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:33,560
会是不一样的父亲
It'll be different.

1763
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,090
会是不存在的父亲
It won't exist.

1764
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:36,920
那也许你应该搬过来
So maybe you move here.

1765
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:38,820
你也听到阿米尔说这里空间广阔了
You heard what Aamir said about space.

1766
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:41,570
去他的空间  伯特  去他的空间
Fuck the space, Bert! Fuck the space!

1767
01:19:41,570 --> 01:19:45,080
我会照你说的做  但我的建议就是这样
I'll do whatever you want me to do, but this is my advice.

1768
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,440
我见过这种事情没完没了地拖下去
I've seen these things go on and on,

1769
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:50,160
而这种争斗所造成的负担是无法估量的
and the burden of these battles is immeasurable.

1770
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,910
我曾有个客户得了结肠癌
I had a client get colon cancer

1771
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:54,430
他一直到死都没有跟妻子达成协议
and die before he and his wife came to agreement.

1772
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:56,010
那在纽约起诉呢
What about filing in New York?

1773
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:57,310
太晚了
It's too late.

1774
01:19:57,410 --> 01:19:59,540
而且即使去纽约  我觉得也无济于事
And even if you did, I don't think it would matter.

1775
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:01,440
她们在财务上的要求挺合理的
They're being reasonable financially, you know?

1776
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:04,060
她们没要走一半奖金  你已经很幸运了
You're... You're lucky they didn't ask for half your grant money.

1777
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:04,800
她不会那么做的
She wouldn't do that.

1778
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,860
她知道我把所有的钱都投回剧团里了
She knows I put all that money back in my theater.

1779
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:08,870
如果事情发展下去  她可能会的
If this continues, she might.

1780
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:11,280
演员和工作人员都靠那笔钱养活
The actors and crew all rely on that money.

1781
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,290
法庭也不会同意的  对吗
The court would never agree with this, right?

1782
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:16,350
不管他们同不同意  你都要花一半的奖金
Whether they do or not, it'll cost you half your grant money

1783
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:18,280
在法庭上证明这一点
to go to court and prove it.

1784
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:22,260
我感觉自己就像个罪犯
I feel like a criminal.

1785
01:20:22,810 --> 01:20:24,430
但你没犯过任何罪
But you didn't commit any crime.

1786
01:20:24,430 --> 01:20:25,970
感觉并不是那样
It doesn't feel that way.

1787
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:28,440
如果我们现在在洛杉矶的事上做点妥协
If we give on LA right now,

1788
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,380
然后尽可能达成一个最有利的协议
and then try to make the best deal possible,

1789
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:32,660
我们就可以让她在其他方面做点让步
I think we can get her to give on other fronts.

1790
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:34,780
根本没有其他方面
There are no other fronts!

1791
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:36,980
这才是关键
This is the thing!

1792
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,230
他得知道我为他争取过
He needs to know that I fought for him!

1793
01:20:39,230 --> 01:20:40,610
他会知道的
He'll know.

1794
01:20:55,210 --> 01:20:57,530
我就不该让她带亨利到这里来
I should never have let her come out here with Henry.

1795
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:58,860
就算没有洛杉矶和纽约的问题
If it wasn't LA and New York,

1796
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:00,000
也会有别的问题
it'd be something else.

1797
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,930
你们会争房子  学区或...
You'd be fighting about a house, or a school district, or...

1798
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:06,360
你知道这是什么情况吗
You know what this is like?

1799
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,330
这就像那个女人和发型师的笑话
This is like that joke about the woman at the hairdresser,

1800
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:10,220
她要去罗马
she's going to Rome.

1801
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:12,000
-你知道这个笑话吗  -不知道
- Do you know this? - I don't.

1802
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:14,130
有个女人跟她的发型师说
This woman is at her hairdresser and she says,

1803
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:15,790
"我要去罗马度假"
"I'm going to Rome on holiday."

1804
01:21:15,790 --> 01:21:18,300
然后他说"是吗  你要乘哪家公司的航班"
And he says, "Oh, really? What... what airline are you taking?"

1805
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:20,000
她说"意大利航空"
She says, "Alitalia."

1806
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,260
他说"意大利航空  你疯了吗
He says, "Alitalia? Are you crazy?

1807
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:24,400
那是最差的  糟透了  别选那家"
That's the worst... That's terrible. Don't take that."

1808
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,010
他又问"你要住哪家酒店"
He says, "Where are you going to stay?"

1809
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:27,760
她说"我要住哈斯勒酒店"
She says, "I'm going to stay at the Hassler."

1810
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,920
"哈斯勒  什么  你在开玩笑吗
"The Hassler? What, are you kidding?

1811
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,500
哈斯勒酒店在装修
They're renovating the Hassler.

1812
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,090
你整晚都会听到敲墙声
You'll hear hammering all night long.

1813
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:35,010
根本睡不着觉  你要去哪个景点"
You won't sleep. What are you going to see?"

1814
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:37,590
她说"我要去梵蒂冈"
She says, "I think I'm going to try to go to the Vatican."

1815
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:40,020
"梵蒂冈  你会整天排队
"The Vatican? You'll be standing in line all day long.

1816
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,170
什么都看不到..."
You'll never get to see anything..."

1817
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:43,680
抱歉  伯特  我付钱是听笑话的吗
I'm sorry, Bert, am I paying for this joke?

1818
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:48,490
不管现在发生什么  都只是暂时的
Whatever happens here, it's temporary.

1819
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:52,430
他会长大  他会对这件事有自己的看法
He's growing up. He's going to have opinions on the subject.

1820
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,730
时间对你有利  查理
Time is on your side, Charlie.

1821
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:58,540
也许他会去东海岸上大学
Maybe he'll do college on the East Coast.

1822
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:09,520
我把大部分硬币放在爸爸家
I have most of my coins,

1823
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:09,040
{\an9}应付  25087.50美元

1824
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,420
比如25美分和10美分
like my quarters and dimes at Daddy's...

1825
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:13,420
-好  -但我要把一块的
- Right. - but I'm keeping my dollars

1826
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:15,880
还有一张20块放在你家  行吗
and my one twenty at yours, okay?

1827
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:20,470
那就是20加上50  是多少钱
So, that is one twenty plus 50, what is that?

1828
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,520
{\an9}查理·巴伯
支票收款人  伯特·斯皮茨
两万五千...
摩根大通银行

1829
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:22,060
该死的
Goddamn it.

1830
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:23,180
"该死的"是什么
What's "Goddamn it"?

1831
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:25,090
你们那里停电了吗
Did you guys lose power where you are?

1832
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:27,580
爸爸  我们停电了吗
Dad? Did we lose power?

1833
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:29,140
没有
No.

1834
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:32,100
山庄这里在轮流停电  而现在...
There's rolling blackouts in the hills and now...

1835
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:35,190
该死  现在门关不上了
Damn it. Now the gate won't close.

1836
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:37,140
她的门关不上了
Her gate won't close.

1837
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:43,490
妈妈
Mom!

1838
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:49,310
-我们能去看我的房间吗  -当然可以
- Can we go see my room? - Yeah, of course.

1839
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:51,080
-你试了所有的...  -我什么都试过了
- You tried all the... - I tried everything.

1840
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:52,890
抱歉让你跑一趟
Sorry I made you come out.

1841
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:53,960
没事
It's fine.

1842
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:55,930
-我只是...  -你不想敞着大门
- I just... - You don't want your gate open.

1843
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,250
对
Right.

1844
01:22:57,370 --> 01:22:58,940
应该有个仪表板什么的
There should be a panel or something...

1845
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:00,870
也许是那边那个
Maybe this is something here.

1846
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,520
-房子不错  -是啊
- It's a cute house. - Oh, yeah.

1847
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,140
至少外面看起来不错
I mean, from what I can see.

1848
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:07,330
谢谢
Thanks.

1849
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:12,450
你头发乱蓬蓬的
You're getting shaggy.

1850
01:23:12,450 --> 01:23:15,220
是啊  我得找个理发师
Yeah, I have to find a hair cutter.

1851
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,750
要我帮你剪吗
You want me to cut it?

1852
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:19,750
好
Okay.

1853
01:23:30,230 --> 01:23:31,560
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

1854
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:37,590
他睡着了
He's out.

1855
01:23:37,730 --> 01:23:39,730
也许他今晚应该住下来
Maybe he should stay here tonight.

1856
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,070
今晚他归我
It's my night.

1857
01:24:10,950 --> 01:24:12,440
过来  我们走
Hey, come on. We're going.

1858
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:13,480
来  我们去走走  好吗
Come on. Let's take a walk. Right?

1859
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:14,670
好  我们去走走
Yeah, we're going to take a walk.

1860
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:16,690
-我们去走走  -好  行  她疯了
- We're taking a walk. - Fine, all right. She's crazy.

1861
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:18,610
我们已经商量得差不多了
We're mostly finished.

1862
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:22,040
伯特和我已经敲定了百分之九十的细节
Bert and I hammered out 90 percent of the details,

1863
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:24,590
还有几件小事没定
and there's a couple minor things hanging,

1864
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:26,220
但应该也没什么难的
but it should be easy.

1865
01:24:26,970 --> 01:24:29,290
然后法官就正式判你们离婚了
And then the judge makes your divorce official.

1866
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,670
那太好了
That's good.

1867
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:36,060
-我操  -怎么了
- Fuck me. - What?

1868
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,390
那是谁
Who's that?

1869
01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:40,710
查理不应该这么做
Charlie shouldn't have done this.

1870
01:24:40,710 --> 01:24:42,410
什么意思  伯特去哪了
What do you mean? Where's Bert?

1871
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:46,270
这意味着我们说好的一切现在都不作数了
This means that everything we've agreed upon now is off the table.

1872
01:24:46,270 --> 01:24:47,680
留在洛杉矶还作数  对吗
We've got LA, right?

1873
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:50,190
如果由杰伊·马洛塔代理他就不一定了
Not with Jay Marotta representing him.

1874
01:24:50,330 --> 01:24:52,130
现在要打恶战了
This is a street fight now.

1875
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:53,730
我会要求一些通常情况下
And I'm going to have to ask for things

1876
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:55,860
不会要求的东西
that we wouldn't normally ask for.

1877
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:58,900
这个体制总是奖励卑劣行径
This system rewards bad behavior.

1878
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:00,720
杰伊
Jay.

1879
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:04,600
我那天晚上在马蒂奥餐厅看到米里亚姆了
I saw Miriam at Madeo the other night.

1880
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,280
-是吗  -她漂亮极了
- Yeah? - Looking very handsome.

1881
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:09,340
你应该来参加我们的"勇敢面对癌症"活动
You know, you should come to our Stand Up To Cancer event.

1882
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:11,690
-约翰·传奇会来献唱  -我喜欢他
- John Legend's going to play. - Oh, love him.

1883
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,570
好吗  在比佛利希尔顿酒店
Okay? It's going to be at the Beverly Hilton, I think.

1884
01:25:13,570 --> 01:25:14,530
-棒极了  -好吗
- Great. - Okay?

1885
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:16,540
她说你大部分时间都在马里布
She said you're spending more time in Malibu.

1886
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:18,080
-真的吗  -我也是
- Really? - Me too.

1887
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:18,890
自从那栋楼成了
I haven't seen her since

1888
01:25:18,710 --> 01:25:20,970
{\an9}巴伯婚姻
案件编号

1889
01:25:18,890 --> 01:25:20,730
国际创新管理公司我就没见过她了
that building was ICM.

1890
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:22,730
先说段历史
A little history...

1891
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:28,000
十年前  查理冒了很大的风险
Ten years ago, Charlie takes a risk when he first hires Nicole

1892
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,180
请妮可出演他在纽约的第一部戏剧
as an actress in his play in New York City.

1893
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:35,990
他是一位声名鹊起的前卫派新晋导演
He's a well-regarded up-and-coming director of the avant-garde.

1894
01:25:35,990 --> 01:25:39,340
而她却是以在青春情色片里
And she's known as the girl in that college sex movie

1895
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:41,540
脱掉上衣而闻名的女孩
who takes her top off.

1896
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:43,380
-我的当事人不应该因为  -十年来
- My client will not be slut-shamed... - Ten years on...

1897
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:44,440
艺术选择而受到荡妇羞辱
for an artistic choice.

1898
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:47,530
她出演了许多著名的戏剧角色
and many prestigious theater roles later...

1899
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:50,570
才成为备受尊崇的女演员
she becomes an actress of great credibility.

1900
01:25:50,570 --> 01:25:52,950
正因为这些声望
And it's because of that credibility,

1901
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:56,860
她才得到了当红电视剧主角的邀约
that she's offered the lead role in a major television show.

1902
01:25:56,860 --> 01:26:00,330
所以这个新机遇也是拜查理所赐
This new opportunity is thanks to Charlie.

1903
01:26:00,330 --> 01:26:04,590
法官阁下  这样说来我们根本不该付抚养费
Your Honor, we shouldn't have to pay support money at this point.

1904
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:09,280
事实上  查理有权分得她电视剧收入的一半
In fact, Charlie is entitled to half her TV money,

1905
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:12,380
包括这个剧现在和将来的收入
present and future earnings of the show.

1906
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:18,820
查理刚刚收到了麦克阿瑟天才奖支付的
Charlie's just received the enormous sum of $650,000

1907
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:20,270
总额65万美元的巨额奖金
in the form of a MacArthur grant.

1908
01:26:20,270 --> 01:26:22,000
-这笔钱是  -这是因为他在婚姻存续期间
- Of which he gets - This is for the theater work...

1909
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,110
-分期付款  -所进行的戏剧工作而获得的
- in 125,000 installments - he conducted during the marriage.

1910
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:26,360
每笔12.5万  分五年支付
over five years.

1911
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:28,080
{\an8}他用这些钱去
He uses the money

1912
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:28,320
所以根据杰的逻辑  这些工作
So by Jay's same logic, this is work

1913
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:30,800
{\an8}雇佣演员和剧团工作人员
to employ actors and crew members

1914
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,800
妮可在许多方面也做出了贡献
that Nicole contributed to in numerous ways.

1915
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:31,620
请一个一个说
One at a time, please.

1916
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:34,110
并偿还剧团公司累积的债务
and to pay debts that he's accumulated

1917
01:26:34,110 --> 01:26:37,230
也就是让她妻子担任主角的剧团公司
with his theater company that stars his wife.

1918
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:42,140
-长命百岁  -她为了在他的小剧团演出
- Bless you. - Not only did she turn down a lucrative

1919
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:44,350
不仅拒绝了收益颇丰的工作机会
and successful career in movies

1920
01:26:44,350 --> 01:26:46,900
和在银幕上大获成功的机会
to perform in his little theater,

1921
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,230
实际上  她还在查理起步时
but she actually supplied charlie

1922
01:26:49,230 --> 01:26:51,250
借了他一笔钱帮他走出困境
with a loan early on to help out.

1923
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:52,200
这笔钱他已经还了
Which he paid back.

1924
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,630
她让他在广告上用她的名字
She lent her name to the marquee,

1925
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:55,910
这也是人们来剧团看剧的主要原因
which was the principle reason people came to the theater.

1926
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:58,300
十年前可能是这样
That may have been true ten years ago.

1927
01:26:58,610 --> 01:27:02,560
她转而帮助查理建立起了名声
And in turn, she helped establish Charlie's reputation.

1928
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:04,070
在接下来的十多年里
Now, over the next ten years,

1929
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:07,430
她陆续接到很多电影和电视剧角色的邀约
she was subsequently offered parts in movies, TV shows,

1930
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:10,200
因为查理想让她做贤妻良母并出演他的戏剧
most of which she turned down at Charlie's behest

1931
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,930
她拒绝了大部分的邀约
to be a mom and act in his plays.

1932
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:17,200
所以虽然我们说了抚养费好商量
So, while we are willing to be flexible on support,

1933
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,420
但我们主张查理的奖金
we contend that half of Charlie's grant money

1934
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:20,880
应该由双方平分
be split between the parties.

1935
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:23,510
明明是因为他才华横溢而获得的奖金
I don't see how you can claim that she gets half a grant

1936
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:25,300
为什么你觉得她应该分得一半
dedicated to his genius.

1937
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:27,360
他是在这段婚姻中变得有才华的
He became a genius during the marriage.

1938
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,170
得了吧  诺拉
Come on, Nora.

1939
01:27:28,170 --> 01:27:31,110
查理在听到他得奖的消息后
Charlie himself, upon hearing that he received the prize,

1940
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:33,620
亲口告诉妮可这奖也属于她
told Nicole that it belonged to her too.

1941
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:36,300
人们在得奖后都会那样说
That's what people say when they win awards.

1942
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:39,250
不  他说的是事实
No, he was implying what was true.

1943
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:43,260
他的才华是这段婚姻造就的无形财产
His genius was an intangible asset built during the marriage.

1944
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:46,270
诺拉  我觉得你对查理剧团的形容很有意思
Nora, I like how you refer to Charlie's theater

1945
01:27:46,270 --> 01:27:48,860
当你在争夺抚养权时
as a ramshackle downtown dump

1946
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:50,470
剧团是闹市区中摇摇欲坠的垃圾堆
when you're arguing custody,

1947
01:27:50,470 --> 01:27:52,680
而当你想争得更多财产时
but when you want more money,

1948
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:55,270
查理又成了有钱的百老汇天才大导演
he's a big, rich, genius Broadway director.

1949
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:56,600
便宜不能都让你给占了
You can't have it both ways.

1950
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,140
真的吗  为什么不行
Really? Why not?

1951
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:00,700
杰伊  无论你觉得这样分配是否公平
And whether you think it's fair or not, Jay,

1952
01:28:01,050 --> 01:28:03,680
麦克阿瑟天才奖支付的第一笔奖金
the first monetary installment from the MacArthur grant

1953
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:05,620
被存进了夫妻联名账户
was put into a joint marital account,

1954
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:07,800
因此是二人的共同财产
and thus became communal property.

1955
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:09,250
{\an8}操  你不该把那笔钱存进联名账户里
Fuck. You shouldn't have put that money in a joint account.

1956
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:10,940
反正也不会有钱剩下来
There's not going to be anything left, anyway.

1957
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:12,190
我把奖金全用在打离婚官司上了
I'm using it all to divorce her.

1958
01:28:12,190 --> 01:28:14,840
诺拉  我不得不说  你描述的这段婚姻
Nora, I have to say that your account of this marriage

1959
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:17,900
好似发生在另一个世界
takes place in an alternate reality.

1960
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:20,360
由于妮可突然搬到洛杉矶
By suddenly moving to LA

1961
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:23,610
并且坚持要留在洛杉矶居住
and insisting on an LA residence,

1962
01:28:23,610 --> 01:28:25,820
她目前实属扣留亨利...
Nicole is withholding Henry...

1963
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:28,620
-律师  请坐下  -使他与他的父亲疏远
- Counsel, please be seated. - alienating him from his father,

1964
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:31,630
把查理的生活搅得天翻地覆
which has turned Charlie's world upside down.

1965
01:28:31,630 --> 01:28:32,960
-律师  -这根本就是个圈套
- Counselor? - It amounts to an ambush.

1966
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:33,860
杰伊  真的吗
"Witholding," Jay?

1967
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:35,730
你竟然用"扣留"和"疏远"这种字眼
Really? "Alienating"?

1968
01:28:35,730 --> 01:28:37,470
你是想激怒我才故意这样说
Well, those are fighting words,

1969
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:38,710
而且这完全是一派胡言
and it's simply false and

1970
01:28:38,710 --> 01:28:41,070
对于和解没有任何帮助
does nothing to further this settlement.

1971
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:44,460
你对案情的回顾很荒唐
Your recap of this situation is outrageous.

1972
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:47,660
尽管加州支持无过错离婚
And although California is, without doubt, a no-fault state,

1973
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:50,980
本着准确回顾案情的原则  我想要指出的是
it bears mentioning in the accurate recap of this situation

1974
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:52,780
查理曾经有过数次婚外情
that Charlie had had extramarital affairs.

1975
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:55,500
-只是一次婚外情  -你真想要较真吗
- An extramarital affair. - Do you really want me to go there?

1976
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,680
-没错  我们就是要较真  -那好吧
- Yeah, let's go there. - Okay.

1977
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,900
妮可承认她黑进了查理的电脑
Nicole has admitted to hacking Charlie's computer

1978
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:02,300
读了他的电邮
and reading his emails,

1979
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:04,970
如果确属实情  那可是重罪
which, if proven, is a felony.

1980
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:06,860
诺拉  我猜如果我问起平日晚上
And, Nora, I don't think you'd be too happy

1981
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:10,220
妮可的酗酒情况  你就不会那么得意了
if I ask Nicole about her alcohol consumption in the evenings.

1982
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:10,810
你说什么
What?

1983
01:29:10,810 --> 01:29:13,920
她最近一个晚上曾告诉查理
She confided in Charlie one night recently,

1984
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,400
她刚把亨利哄睡着
having just carried Henry to bed,

1985
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:21,100
就没法好好站稳走下楼梯了
that she was having trouble standing while walking down the staircase.

1986
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:24,800
依我的理解来看  这不是一起偶发事件
And from what I understand, this is not an isolated event.

1987
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,730
所以诺拉  如果你真想来这一套的话
So you let me know, Nora,

1988
01:29:26,730 --> 01:29:28,220
我会奉陪到底
and we will go there as needed.

1989
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:29,660
查理
Charlie?

1990
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,190
我问你
Can I ask you,

1991
01:29:31,190 --> 01:29:33,270
你现在都不抓紧机会
how do you expect to have more time with Henry

1992
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:35,780
负起责任陪伴亨利
when you don't exercise the time you already have,

1993
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:38,400
怎么能指望争得更多的监护时间呢
and exercise it responsibly?

1994
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:41,400
在查理最近一次来洛杉矶时
On a recent visit to Los Angeles,

1995
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:45,070
我们无法通过任何通讯方式或手段联络到他
after failing to call, text, communicate in any way,

1996
01:29:45,070 --> 01:29:46,530
无论是打电话还是发短信
shape, or form,

1997
01:29:46,530 --> 01:29:48,260
他最后迟到了两个小时
Charlie finally arrived two hours late

1998
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:50,100
才来到妮可母亲家里接亨利
to pick up Henry at Nicole's mother's house.

1999
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:52,180
那时  查理向妮可保证的
At that point, the car seat,

2000
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:55,920
已由专业人士安装在车后座的儿童安全座椅
which he had assured Nicole had been professionally installed,

2001
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,550
显然没有固定好
was clearly not even belted in.

2002
01:29:57,550 --> 01:29:58,770
安全座椅只是放在后座上
It was just sitting in the back seat.

2003
01:29:58,770 --> 01:30:00,410
你必须得自己把安全座椅扣好
You have to buckle in the car seat.

2004
01:30:00,410 --> 01:30:01,330
-我知道  -这是法律规定
- I know. - It's the law.

2005
01:30:01,330 --> 01:30:02,470
我原以为租赁公司已经装好了
I thought the rental place did it.

2006
01:30:02,470 --> 01:30:03,820
他们不能帮你装  不然他们得担责
They can't. It's a liability.

2007
01:30:02,950 --> 01:30:03,950
{\an8}我现在知道这点了
I know that now.

2008
01:30:03,950 --> 01:30:05,980
我们当时发现座椅是松的  就立刻把它装好了
Once we discovered that, we fixed it.

2009
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:07,410
双方律师
Counsel?

2010
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:09,240
你们也看到了我的法庭里坐满了人
You can see my courtroom is full

2011
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:10,780
尽管他们没你们的客户有钱
and there are people who don't have

2012
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:13,600
但他们也在等候案件审理
the resources your clients have,

2013
01:30:13,690 --> 01:30:16,960
我也很确信你们双方就这起抚养权的争夺案件
and I'm fairly certain you haven't exhausted, in good faith,

2014
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,370
仍有很多话要说
the arguments in the case of this child.

2015
01:30:19,370 --> 01:30:21,950
与此同时  我们维持现状
In the meantime, we'll keep the status quo.

2016
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:25,720
目前这家人依然住在洛杉矶
This remains an LA family for the time being.

2017
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:28,650
我最近才接手这个部门
I took over this department recently,

2018
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:31,380
目前依然在了解案件详情的过程中
and I'm still becoming acquainted with the cases.

2019
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:35,740
所以我决定指派一名
So, I'm going to appoint an expert evaluator

2020
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:39,160
比我更了解小孩的专业评估员
who knows much more about young children than I do.

2021
01:30:39,410 --> 01:30:41,830
一旦评估完成
Once the evaluation is done,

2022
01:30:41,830 --> 01:30:44,930
我们会视情况对裁定作出修订
we'll modify the orders where necessary.

2023
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:52,900
亨利人呢
Hey, where's Henry?

2024
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:55,760
凯西带他和自家小孩去玩镭战游戏了
He's with Cassie and her kids at Laser Tag.

2025
01:30:56,430 --> 01:30:57,540
你想要喝点什么吗
You want something to drink?

2026
01:30:57,540 --> 01:31:01,500
我有未经过滤的自来水  啤酒  果汁
I have unfiltered tap water, beer, and some juice boxes.

2027
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:03,130
给我来盒果汁吧
I'll take a juice box.

2028
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:10,670
你没在墙上挂点什么东西吗
You don't have anything on the walls?

2029
01:31:10,670 --> 01:31:12,770
我还没找到能挂上去的东西  除了亨利的画
I don't have anything to put on them except Henry's art,

2030
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:14,010
目前正在装裱
which is being framed.

2031
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:18,140
我可以给你些照片  直到你自己买到挂画
I can give you some stuff, you know, until you get some things.

2032
01:31:18,290 --> 01:31:21,660
那张亨利在史丹顿岛渡轮上的美照如何
How about that great picture of Henry on the Staten Island Ferry?

2033
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:23,270
你不也在那张照片里吗
Aren't you in that one?

2034
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:25,670
我猜...你得...
I guess I... You could...

2035
01:31:25,670 --> 01:31:28,580
-把我抠掉  -我得提前一天走  22号就回纽约
- cut me out. - I have to leave a day early to New York on the 22nd.

2036
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:31,050
所以那个周五能不能由我来带亨利
So I was wondering if I could take Henry that Friday.

2037
01:31:31,210 --> 01:31:34,270
22号走  那你是指21号那天吗
The 22nd. So, that's the 21st?

2038
01:31:35,150 --> 01:31:36,550
那天我们已经有安排了
We have plans, actually.

2039
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:37,150
亨利和他的
We're going to, um,

2040
01:31:37,150 --> 01:31:40,000
表兄妹们要去洛杉矶郡艺术博物馆参加活动
some thing at LACMA with the cousins.

2041
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,450
那你能不能改变下安排  那天让我来带他呢
But could you change it so I could take him?

2042
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:44,150
只在那天晚上才有
It's just one night.

2043
01:31:44,150 --> 01:31:45,730
-亨利很想去  -真的吗
- He's looking forward to it. - Really?

2044
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,570
我们说好了的  查理  那晚他归我
It's my night, Charlie, we negotiated it.

2045
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:50,150
好吧
Okay, fine.

2046
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:51,890
你到底想说什么
But what?

2047
01:31:51,890 --> 01:31:53,840
我只是想问问你能不能迁就一下
No, I'm just asking you to be flexible.

2048
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:54,450
我已经很迁就你了
I am flexible.

2049
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:55,360
你来去匆匆
You come in and out

2050
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:56,880
我都是依据你的日程表来调整我的安排
and I adjust based on your schedule.

2051
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,080
就这一个晚上  票都买好了...
This one night we have tickets to...

2052
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,980
可不止这一个晚上  不过没关系
It's not only this one night, but fine.

2053
01:32:00,170 --> 01:32:01,890
亨利的老师想见我们
Henry's teacher wants to meet with us.

2054
01:32:01,890 --> 01:32:03,510
你是指他在洛杉矶的老师吗
You mean his LA teacher?

2055
01:32:03,510 --> 01:32:06,770
你能不能回下电邮  我们好约个时间
Can you, uh, answer the email so we could set a time?

2056
01:32:06,770 --> 01:32:08,740
好  我最近太忙了没顾得上看
Yeah, I've been distracted.

2057
01:32:09,350 --> 01:32:10,930
我完全理解
I understand.

2058
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:12,290
老师们想就他的阅读障碍问题
They just want to rule out everything,

2059
01:32:12,290 --> 01:32:13,520
找找所有可能的原因
you know, with his reading.

2060
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,000
我觉得他只是有些太焦虑了
I just think he's a little over-anxious.

2061
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,010
我觉得他是因为太想读懂而读不懂
I think he wants it too much.

2062
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:19,290
老师们说他的数学成绩很好
They said he's off the charts in math.

2063
01:32:19,290 --> 01:32:21,630
他遇到难题时  太轻易就放弃
He quits too easily when things aren't easy for him.

2064
01:32:21,630 --> 01:32:23,550
他这点像我们俩  顽固不化
You know, he's like us, he's stubborn.

2065
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:25,600
他到现在还是个很差劲的大富翁玩家
He's still a lousy Monopoly player

2066
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,460
因为他总是把钱都存起来不花
because he tries to save all his money.

2067
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:34,220
那个...
So...

2068
01:32:34,910 --> 01:32:37,850
我觉得我们应该谈谈
I thought we should talk.

2069
01:32:37,850 --> 01:32:40,040
我感觉目前的做法有些过头了
I feel like maybe things have gone too far.

2070
01:32:40,730 --> 01:32:42,840
我妈把房子抵押贷了款
I mean, my mom's taking out a loan against the house

2071
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:43,950
帮我付诺拉的律师费
to help me pay Nora.

2072
01:32:43,950 --> 01:32:45,370
我以为诺拉的律师费要我出
I thought I paid Nora.

2073
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:47,240
她的费用你出三成
You pay 30 percent of Nora.

2074
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:49,940
如果能让你感觉好点的话  其实我也要破产了
Well, I'm going broke too, if that's any help.

2075
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:52,140
我刚答应要导演两部很差劲的戏剧
I've just agreed to direct two shitty plays,

2076
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:54,780
给亨利攒大学学费的事更是没戏了
and we can forget putting anything away for Henry's college.

2077
01:32:54,830 --> 01:32:56,540
只是到现在为止
It's just that up until now,

2078
01:32:56,540 --> 01:32:58,350
我们一直没让亨利受这事的影响
we've been able to keep Henry somewhat removed,

2079
01:32:58,350 --> 01:33:00,020
但是这场官司会把他也牵扯进来
and this will change that.

2080
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,110
我们必须保护他
We have to protect him.

2081
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:02,960
我同意
I agree.

2082
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:06,520
诺拉说评估员会到我们家里来
Nora says that the evaluator will come into our homes,

2083
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:09,100
他们不仅要跟我们面谈  还要和亨利
they're going to interview Henry in addition to us,

2084
01:33:09,180 --> 01:33:12,410
我们的朋友  家人  仇敌们进行面谈
our friends, family, enemies,

2085
01:33:12,410 --> 01:33:13,950
他们还会观察我们与亨利如何相处
and then they'll observe us with him,

2086
01:33:13,950 --> 01:33:15,570
我们作为父母的表现如何
how we are as parents.

2087
01:33:15,570 --> 01:33:17,350
-听起来糟透了  -可不是嘛
- Sounds awful. - I know.

2088
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,910
我觉得如果有人随机抽查我作为母亲是否合格
I feel like if anybody observed me on any given day as a mom,

2089
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:21,530
我肯定得不到监护权
I'd never get custody.

2090
01:33:23,670 --> 01:33:25,110
那只是句玩笑话
That was a joke.

2091
01:33:25,110 --> 01:33:27,560
-我懂  我也有同感  -那就行
- I know. I feel the same way. - Right.

2092
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:28,930
那么...
So...

2093
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:32,400
也许我们两个应该自己想个办法了结
Maybe we can figure something out between us.

2094
01:33:32,530 --> 01:33:34,610
我一开始就是这么跟你说的  你还记得吗
You remember I said this to you at the beginning?

2095
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:36,920
我知道你说过这话  但如今情况不同
I know you did, but these are different circumstances.

2096
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:39,250
我就知道会闹到这一步
I was anticipating these circumstances.

2097
01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:41,730
不管怎样  我们试下好吗
Anyway, shall we try this?

2098
01:33:41,730 --> 01:33:43,080
好啊
Okay.

2099
01:33:57,230 --> 01:33:58,760
我不知要如何开头
I don't know how to start.

2100
01:34:00,710 --> 01:34:03,120
你知道我为什么想留在洛杉矶吗
Do you understand why I want to stay in LA?

2101
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:04,260
不知道
No.

2102
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:05,500
你要是这样可就...
Well... That's not...

2103
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:08,200
查理  你要是这样回答可就没意思了
Charlie, that's not a useful way for us to start.

2104
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:09,780
我不明白你为什么想留下来
I don't understand it.

2105
01:34:11,370 --> 01:34:13,800
你不记得我们说好了要在这里待上一段时间吗
You don't remember promising that we could do time here?

2106
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:15,550
我们讨论过很多事情
We discussed things.

2107
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:17,100
我们当时感情正浓  说了很多有的没的
We were married, we said things.

2108
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:18,840
我们还说过要移居欧洲呢
We talked about moving to Europe.

2109
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:20,490
还说过要买一个...
About getting a...

2110
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:23,440
餐边柜...还是什么来着
sideboard, or what do you call it?

2111
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:26,140
储物柜  来填补沙发背后的空隙
A credenza, to fill the empty space behind the couch.

2112
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:27,470
但我们也都只是说说而已
We never did any of it.

2113
01:34:27,470 --> 01:34:29,220
你拒绝了格芬剧团的驻留项目邀约
You turned down the residency at the Geffen

2114
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:31,340
我们本可以借此机会来洛杉矶住上一年
that would've brought us here for a... a year.

2115
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:32,670
我对那个项目并不感兴趣
It wasn't something I wanted.

2116
01:34:32,670 --> 01:34:33,820
我们当时经营着一家不错的剧团
We had a great theater company

2117
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:35,850
生活也很美好
and a great life where we were.

2118
01:34:35,850 --> 01:34:38,020
-你管那叫美好生活吗  -你懂我的意思
- You call that a great life? - You know what I mean.

2119
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:39,490
我并不是指我们的婚姻幸福美满
I don't mean we had a great marriage.

2120
01:34:39,490 --> 01:34:41,250
我是说布鲁克林的生活很不错
I mean, life in Brooklyn.

2121
01:34:41,710 --> 01:34:42,820
事业上很不错
Professionally.

2122
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:43,860
我也说不清
I don't know.

2123
01:34:43,860 --> 01:34:45,860
说实话  我从未考虑过另一种不同的生活
Honestly, I never considered anything different.

2124
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:47,590
这正是问题所在  不是吗
Well, that's the problem, isn't it?

2125
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:48,850
我是你的妻子
I mean, I was your wife.

2126
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:50,620
你本该为我的幸福着想
You should've considered my happiness, too.

2127
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:52,280
得了吧  你以前过得很开心
Come on, you were happy.

2128
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:54,770
你只是现在突然改口说自己以前不快乐
You've just decided you weren't now.

2129
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,290
好吧  好吧
Okay. Okay.

2130
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,630
我们先...
Let's...

2131
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:02,560
目前我在这儿工作  我的家人也住在这里
M-My work is here now, my family is here.

2132
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,310
我是考虑到你要在这儿拍戏
And I agreed to put Henry in school here

2133
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:05,600
才同意让亨利暂时在此就读
because your show went to series.

2134
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:06,820
我之所以会同意是因为我们说好了
I did that knowing that

2135
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:08,560
当你拍完戏以后  亨利就会回到纽约
when you were done shooting, he'd come back to New York.

2136
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:09,660
亲爱的  我们从未这样说过
Honey, we never said that.

2137
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:10,770
你可能是那么以为的
That may have been your assumption,

2138
01:35:10,770 --> 01:35:12,160
但是我们从未明确地讲过那番话
but we never expressly said that.

2139
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:14,900
-我们肯定说过那番话  -我们什么时候说的
- We did say it. - When did we say it?

2140
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:17,650
我也不记得是什么时候说过  但我们肯定说过
I don't know when we said it, but we said it.

2141
01:35:17,650 --> 01:35:18,720
-我本想着...  -我们是那次在电话里说的
- I thought... - We said it that time on the phone!

2142
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:20,070
亲爱的  让我把话说完
Honey, let me finish.

2143
01:35:20,070 --> 01:35:21,470
抱歉  我改不过口
Sorry. I keep saying that.

2144
01:35:21,470 --> 01:35:24,770
我本想着如果亨利在这儿过得很开心
I thought that if Henry was happy here,

2145
01:35:24,770 --> 01:35:25,700
我的戏也能继续拍下去的话
and my show continued,

2146
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:27,630
我们也许可以在洛杉矶待上一段时间
that we might do LA for a while.

2147
01:35:27,630 --> 01:35:30,260
你可没跟我说过你有这样的打算
I was not privy to that thought process.

2148
01:35:30,330 --> 01:35:31,780
我们之前没能住在洛杉矶
The only reason we didn't live here

2149
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:34,710
就是因为你从不考虑别人想要什么
is because you can't imagine desires other than your own,

2150
01:35:34,710 --> 01:35:36,010
除非现实逼得你没得选择
unless they're forced on you.

2151
01:35:36,010 --> 01:35:37,790
行了  你希望你没有嫁给我
Okay, you wish you hadn't married me,

2152
01:35:37,790 --> 01:35:39,000
你希望你过着一种不同的生活
you wish you'd had a different life,

2153
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,580
但事已至此
but this is what happened.

2154
01:35:41,410 --> 01:35:43,250
-那我们该怎么做  -我也不知道
- So, what do we do? - I don't know.

2155
01:35:45,070 --> 01:35:47,000
诺拉说如今已经没有回头路可走
Nora says there's no coming back from this.

2156
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:47,860
去他妈的诺拉
Fuck Nora!

2157
01:35:47,860 --> 01:35:50,590
我恨死了诺拉说我一直住在洛杉矶
I hate fucking Nora telling me I always lived in LA

2158
01:35:50,590 --> 01:35:52,790
尽管我从没住过这里
even though I never lived in LA.

2159
01:35:53,370 --> 01:35:55,000
你怎么能让她那么说我呢
How could you have her say those things about me?

2160
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,430
杰伊也对我恶语相加
Jay said them about me too.

2161
01:35:57,660 --> 01:35:59,070
你就不该炒掉伯特
You shouldn't have fired Bert.

2162
01:35:59,070 --> 01:36:00,870
我也得有个无赖律师
I needed my own asshole.

2163
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:04,220
我俩还是都承认
Let's just both agree both of our lawyers

2164
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:06,020
我们的律师说了恶心的话
said shitty stuff about both of us.

2165
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:07,570
诺拉更过分
Nora was worse.

2166
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:09,290
杰伊说我是酒鬼
Jay called me an alcoholic.

2167
01:36:09,290 --> 01:36:10,540
你打了我个措手不及
You pulled the rug out from under me

2168
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:11,460
让我痛苦得像下地狱
and you're putting me through hell.

2169
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:13,310
我们的婚姻中  你让我痛苦得像下地狱
You put me through hell during our marriage.

2170
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:14,770
所以我们的婚姻就是炼狱是吗
Is that what that was, hell?

2171
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:16,550
你现在要让亨利也经受这种折磨
And now you're going to put Henry through this horrible thing

2172
01:36:16,550 --> 01:36:18,380
就为了再次达到你的目的
so you can yet again get what you want!

2173
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:19,530
这不是我的目的
It's not what I want.

2174
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:22,290
这是我想要的  但是这曾经...
I mean, it's what I want, but it's what was...

2175
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:23,730
曾经...
was...

2176
01:36:23,730 --> 01:36:24,960
对他来说是最好的
what's best for him.

2177
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,150
我还在想
Oh, well, I was wondering

2178
01:36:26,150 --> 01:36:28,640
你什么时候去问问亨利  看他想真正想要什么
when you'd get around to Henry and what he actually wants.

2179
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:29,650
你滚
Fuck off!

2180
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:30,720
不  你滚
No, you fuck off!

2181
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,150
要是你听你儿子的话  听别人的话
If you'd listen to your son, or anyone,

2182
01:36:33,150 --> 01:36:34,790
他会告诉你  他情愿在这儿生活
then he'd tell you that he'd rather live here!

2183
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:36,630
别再给亨利强加你对我的感情了
Stop putting your feelings about me onto Henry.

2184
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:38,470
他告诉我他更喜欢这里
He tells me he likes it better here.

2185
01:36:38,470 --> 01:36:40,540
他那么说  是因为他知道你愿意听
He tells you because he knows it's what you want to hear!

2186
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:41,960
他告诉我  你无时无刻不在讲电话
He tells me you're on the phone all the time.

2187
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:42,940
你都不跟他玩
You don't even play with him.

2188
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:44,630
因为我在洛杉矶办离婚
Because I'm going through a divorce in LA

2189
01:36:44,630 --> 01:36:46,540
还想导一部纽约的戏
and trying to direct a play in New York!

2190
01:36:46,540 --> 01:36:48,900
那部戏泡汤了  因为我不在
Which closed because I wasn't there.

2191
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:49,850
本来是个多好的机会...
It was a huge opportunity for me...

2192
01:36:49,850 --> 01:36:51,440
你都不想陪他  为什么还要争
You're fighting for something you don't even want!

2193
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:52,930
我让所有人失望了
And I let everyone down.

2194
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:55,190
你这样太像你爸了
You're being so much like your father.

2195
01:36:55,740 --> 01:36:57,160
别拿我跟他比
Do not compare me to my father!

2196
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:59,550
我没有  我说你这种行为像他
I didn't compare you to him. I said you were acting like him.

2197
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:00,760
你跟你妈一模一样
You're exactly like your mother.

2198
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:02,820
你之前抱怨她的一切  你现在就跟她一样
Everything you were complaining about her, you're doing.

2199
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:04,250
你要把亨利逼疯了
You're suffocating Henry.

2200
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:07,100
首先  我爱我妈  她是个超棒的妈妈
First of all, I love my mother. She was a wonderful mother.

2201
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:07,900
我不过是复述你的话
I'm just repeating what you told me.

2202
01:37:07,900 --> 01:37:11,360
第二  你怎么敢说我当妈当得像我妈
Secondly, how dare you compare my mothering to my mother!

2203
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:14,370
我也许像我爸  但我不像我妈
I may be like my father, but I am not like my mother!

2204
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:15,490
你就是像
You are!

2205
01:37:15,490 --> 01:37:17,060
而且你还像我爸
And you're like my father!

2206
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:18,580
你也像我妈
You're also like my mother!

2207
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:21,230
你集这四位的缺点于一身
You're all the bad things about all of these people!

2208
01:37:21,230 --> 01:37:22,590
但最主要是像你妈
But mostly your mother.

2209
01:37:22,590 --> 01:37:23,730
我们躺在一张床上的时候
When we would lie in bed together,

2210
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:26,770
有时我看着你就想到她  一阵恶心
sometimes I would look at you and see her and just feel so gross!

2211
01:37:26,770 --> 01:37:29,520
-你摸我的时候我简直反胃  -你个懒蛋
- I felt repulsed when you touched me! - You're a slob.

2212
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:31,040
床铺都是我收拾  柜子也是我关
I made all the beds, closed all cabinets...

2213
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,770
我一想到跟你上床
The thought of having sex with you

2214
01:37:32,850 --> 01:37:34,560
就想剥掉自己的皮
makes me want to peel my skin off.

2215
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:36,960
你永远都不会幸福  不管是在洛杉矶还是哪儿
You'll never be happy, in LA or anywhere.

2216
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:39,640
你以为你能找到与我迥然不同的更好的人
You'll think you found some better opposite guy than me,

2217
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:42,150
几年后  你就会反抗他
and in a few years, you'll rebel against him

2218
01:37:42,150 --> 01:37:45,410
因为你必须要表达  但你又不要发言权
because you need to have your voice, but you don't want a voice.

2219
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:47,690
你只想抱怨你不能发声
You just want to fucking complain about not having a voice!

2220
01:37:47,690 --> 01:37:49,310
我思考过嫁给你这件事
I think about being married to you,

2221
01:37:49,310 --> 01:37:51,490
结果发现我根本不认识当时那个女人
and that woman is a stranger to me.

2222
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:54,170
-我们结婚结得太早了  -你退化了
- I mean, we had a child's marriage. - You've regressed.

2223
01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:56,820
你回到遇到我之前的生活了  真可悲
You've gone back to your life before you met me, it's pathetic.

2224
01:37:56,820 --> 01:37:58,200
人们曾经总跟我说
People used to tell me that

2225
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:00,660
你太自私  成不了大器
you were too selfish to be a great artist.

2226
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:02,490
我还总帮你说话
And I used to defend you.

2227
01:38:02,490 --> 01:38:03,860
他们说得太对了
They were absolutely right.

2228
01:38:03,860 --> 01:38:05,450
你的最佳表演都已成为过去
All your best acting is behind you.

2229
01:38:05,450 --> 01:38:07,020
你已经退化成劣等艺术家了
You're back to being a hack!

2230
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:10,070
你操纵了我  你个恶人
You gaslighted me! You're a fucking villain!

2231
01:38:10,070 --> 01:38:11,660
你想以受害者形象示人
You want to present yourself as a victim

2232
01:38:11,660 --> 01:38:13,430
因为这种法律策略得人心
because it's a good legal strategy?

2233
01:38:13,430 --> 01:38:16,950
行  但你我都知道  这种生活是你自己选的
Fine, but you and I both know you chose this life!

2234
01:38:17,210 --> 01:38:19,490
你改变心意之前都心甘情愿
You wanted it until you didn't!

2235
01:38:20,090 --> 01:38:22,160
你利用我逃出洛杉矶
You used me so you could get out of LA.

2236
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:23,480
我没有
I didn't use you.

2237
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:26,090
你有  然后却反过来责怪我
You did, and then you blamed me for it!

2238
01:38:26,090 --> 01:38:28,450
你总是提醒我做错了什么
You always made me aware of what I was doing wrong,

2239
01:38:28,450 --> 01:38:29,850
我有多少不足
how I was falling short!

2240
01:38:29,850 --> 01:38:31,780
跟你一起过真是太无趣了
Life with you was joyless!

2241
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:33,900
怎么  那你就得操别人
What, so then you had to go and fuck someone else?

2242
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:35,640
我操她你不应该难过
You shouldn't be upset that I fucked her!

2243
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:38,140
你该难过的是我跟她笑得开怀
You should be upset that I had a laugh with her!

2244
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:39,010
你爱她吗
Do you love her?

2245
01:38:39,010 --> 01:38:40,270
不
No.

2246
01:38:40,270 --> 01:38:42,460
但她不恨我  你恨我
But she didn't hate me. You hated me.

2247
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:43,960
是你恨我
You hated me.

2248
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:45,690
你操了我们的同事
You fucked somebody we worked with.

2249
01:38:45,690 --> 01:38:48,350
你去年就不跟我做了
You stopped having sex with me in the last year.

2250
01:38:48,350 --> 01:38:49,700
我从来没出过轨
I never cheated on you.

2251
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:51,260
那就是出轨
That was cheating on me!

2252
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:53,100
但本来  我能做的有那么多
But there was so much I could have done.

2253
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:55,890
我本来是个毫无名气的二十来岁的导演
I was a director in my twenties who came from nothing

2254
01:38:55,890 --> 01:38:59,000
突然就上了《纽约生活志》的封面
and was suddenly on the cover of fucking Time Out New York!

2255
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,080
我成了大红人  看谁都想上  但是我没有
I was hot shit and I wanted to fuck everybody and I didn't.

2256
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,430
因为我爱你  我不想失去你
And I loved you and I didn't want to lose you.

2257
01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:07,480
但当时我二十多岁  不想失去放荡年华
But I'm in my twenties, and I didn't want to lose that too,

2258
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:09,090
但我却算是错过了
and I kinda did!

2259
01:39:09,290 --> 01:39:11,870
你想要的那么多  那么快
And you wanted so much so fast.

2260
01:39:11,870 --> 01:39:13,810
我都不想结婚
I didn't even want to get married.

2261
01:39:13,810 --> 01:39:15,450
去他的
And fuck it!

2262
01:39:15,470 --> 01:39:17,590
有那么多我都错过了
There's so much I didn't do.

2263
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:20,370
-那我谢谢你  -不客气
- Thanks for that! - You're welcome!

2264
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:23,620
真不敢相信我这辈子都甩不掉你了
I can't believe I have to know you forever!

2265
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:25,710
你他妈疯了
You're fucking insane!

2266
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:28,710
你他妈还赢了
And you're fucking winning!

2267
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,940
你逗我吗
Are you kidding me?

2268
01:39:31,190 --> 01:39:33,240
我想结婚
I wanted to be married.

2269
01:39:33,310 --> 01:39:35,100
我就已经输了
I'd already lost!

2270
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:37,720
我爱你比你爱我多
You didn't love me as much as I loved you!

2271
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:41,390
那跟洛杉矶有什么关系
What does that have to do with LA?

2272
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:44,000
怎么了
What?

2273
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,780
你沉浸于你的自私之中
You're so merged with your own selfishness,

2274
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:51,240
你都不觉得那是自私了
you don't even identify it as selfishness anymore!

2275
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:53,680
你真混蛋
You're such a dick!

2276
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:56,300
每天我醒来都希望你死了
Every day I wake up and I hope you're dead!

2277
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:59,460
死掉  如果我能保证亨利没事
Dead, like if I could guarantee Henry would be okay,

2278
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:03,500
我真希望你重病  然后被车撞死
I'd hope you'd get an illness, and then get hit by a car and die!

2279
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:25,370
天啊
Oh, God!

2280
01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:36,380
对不起
I'm sorry.

2281
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,250
我也是
Me too.

2282
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:07,260
好  我们可以布置得漂漂亮亮的
Okay. No, we can make this nice.

2283
01:41:08,150 --> 01:41:11,250
我会把小一些的植物放在窗边
I would take the smaller plants and put them by the window.

2284
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:14,030
你有没有什么能挂在墙上的
And, uh, do you have things we can put on the walls?

2285
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:35,860
好了  没事了  非常感谢
All right, that's it. Thank you very much.

2286
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:38,560
我们很想你  你家看起来很棒  真的
We miss you, and it looks great, really.

2287
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:39,920
-有进展就讲给我们听  -好
- Let us know how it goes, okay? - All right.

2288
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:42,340
我们周一见
I'll see you guys on, uh... on Monday.

2289
01:41:42,340 --> 01:41:44,870
-爱你  -我也爱你  再见
- Love you. - All right, love you too. Bye.

2290
01:42:09,450 --> 01:42:11,720
为什么一下子多了这么多植物
Why do we have so many plants all of a sudden?

2291
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:13,080
有些之后要还回去的
We'll have to return some of this stuff,

2292
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:14,250
所以别跟它们相处得太投入
so don't get too used to it.

2293
01:42:14,250 --> 01:42:16,190
我觉得植物有点可怕
I find plants kind of scary.

2294
01:42:16,190 --> 01:42:17,910
这些植物是正义的那方
These plants are good guys.

2295
01:42:19,890 --> 01:42:21,180
过来
Come here.

2296
01:42:23,090 --> 01:42:24,360
怎么了
Yeah?

2297
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:29,090
明天  有个女的会来家访
Tomorrow, this woman is going to come and visit us...

2298
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:32,180
我们吃晚餐时陪着我们
and be with us while we eat dinner.

2299
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:34,540
-是你女朋友吗  -不是
- Is it your girlfriend? - No, no.

2300
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:35,830
是妈妈的男朋友吗
Is it Mommy's boyfriend?

2301
01:42:35,830 --> 01:42:37,560
不是  怎么  妈妈有男朋友吗
No. Why? Does Mommy have a boyfriend?

2302
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:39,670
我不知道  她有吗
I don't know. Does she?

2303
01:42:39,670 --> 01:42:42,440
-我不知道  -我不知道
- I don't know. - I don't know.

2304
01:42:43,630 --> 01:42:45,560
为什么有人要看着我们吃饭
Why is someone watching us eat dinner?

2305
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:47,210
我懂  确实好奇怪
I know, it's weird.

2306
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:49,550
我们必须得这么做
It's just something we have to do.

2307
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:51,510
这件事关系到...
Which has to do with...

2308
01:42:51,610 --> 01:42:54,200
我和妈妈把一切理清楚
Mommy and me figuring out everything...

2309
01:42:54,890 --> 01:42:56,490
我们未来将会如何
and how we're going to be.

2310
01:42:59,060 --> 01:43:00,370
明白吗
You know?

2311
01:43:01,070 --> 01:43:02,760
读书给我听好吗
Will you read to me?

2312
01:43:03,450 --> 01:43:04,940
好  拿书吧
Sure. Grab your book.

2313
01:43:05,730 --> 01:43:07,590
你吸毒或者喝酒吗
Do you use drugs or alcohol?

2314
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:09,410
我喝酒
I drink alcohol.

2315
01:43:09,630 --> 01:43:11,400
喝多少
How much alcohol do you drink?

2316
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:16,130
我不确定  晚餐时喝一杯红酒
I don't know, a glass of wine with dinner.

2317
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:18,480
-有时会多一些  -多多少
- Sometimes more. - How much more?

2318
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:22,130
这个...有时候...
It's... Sometimes a...

2319
01:43:22,390 --> 01:43:23,750
多喝几杯
a few...

2320
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,460
我有时候跟其他人分着喝一瓶红酒
I... sometimes split a bottle of wine with someone.

2321
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:29,440
-你跟谁分着喝  -我...
- Okay, who do you split it with? - I mean...

2322
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:33,180
我和别人一起吃晚餐  我们会点一瓶红酒
if I'm having dinner with someone and we order a bottle of wine.

2323
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:35,420
-嗯  -比如下馆子的时候
- Okay. - You know, like at a restaurant.

2324
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:36,670
你会说
When you say,

2325
01:43:36,670 --> 01:43:39,610
"你们是想按杯点  还是我们一起点一瓶"
"Do you want to go by the glass or do we get a bottle?"

2326
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:43,260
-你会点一瓶  -有时会
- You get a bottle? - Well, sometimes.

2327
01:43:44,490 --> 01:43:47,000
有时我也会按杯点
I mean, sometimes I go by the glass.

2328
01:43:47,350 --> 01:43:48,930
看情况
You know, it depends.

2329
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:54,960
你是说我这辈子吸过毒吗
Did you mean drugs ever?

2330
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,430
我吸过毒
I have done drugs.

2331
01:43:57,470 --> 01:43:58,960
大学的时候
In college.

2332
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:02,390
-你当妈妈之后有没有...  -我不经常吸
- Anything since you've been... - I... I don't do it regularly.

2333
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:03,800
你当妈妈之后有没有吸过
Anything since you've been a mother?

2334
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:07,820
抽过几次大麻
Pot a few times.

2335
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:11,770
有一次在派对上吸过可卡因  亨利没跟我在一起
Coke once at a party. I mean, Henry wasn't with me.

2336
01:44:14,390 --> 01:44:17,430
你觉得自己作为家长有什么优势
What would you say are your strengths as a parent?

2337
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:26,220
我倾听
I listen.

2338
01:44:27,770 --> 01:44:28,640
我跟他玩
I play.

2339
01:44:31,110 --> 01:44:33,340
我投入时间  我...
I-I put in the time. I...

2340
01:44:34,450 --> 01:44:35,220
爱...
love...

2341
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:37,660
照顾他
taking care of him...

2342
01:44:38,690 --> 01:44:40,020
看着他长大
watching him grow.

2343
01:44:42,310 --> 01:44:43,260
有时候
And sometimes...

2344
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:47,640
人们说"时光飞逝"  这是真的  但是...
what they say about "It goes so fast" is true, but...

2345
01:44:49,170 --> 01:44:50,130
有时并不是
sometimes it's not.

2346
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:53,180
有时过得太慢了  真的
Sometimes it goes too slow, honestly.

2347
01:44:54,710 --> 01:44:56,050
你的弱点呢
What are your weaknesses?

2348
01:44:59,230 --> 01:45:01,970
我太一丝不苟  我太过关心
I'm too precise. I care too much.

2349
01:45:02,690 --> 01:45:03,900
这些是弱点吗
Are those weaknesses?

2350
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:07,480
也许不算
Maybe not.

2351
01:45:10,650 --> 01:45:13,070
他有时候会犯浑
You know, he can be an asshole and...

2352
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:15,360
我会动真气
I can get really pissed off,

2353
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:16,820
我会骂他混蛋
and I'll call him on being an asshole...

2354
01:45:16,820 --> 01:45:17,930
我打断你一下
I'm going to stop you there.

2355
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:20,420
你真正回答的时候  千万别那么说
When you do this for real, don't ever say that.

2356
01:45:20,730 --> 01:45:22,820
人们不接受一个喝大酒
People don't accept mothers who drink too much wine

2357
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:25,130
冲孩子大吼  管他叫混蛋的母亲
and yell at their child and call him an asshole.

2358
01:45:25,130 --> 01:45:26,780
我懂你  我也这么做
I get it. I do it too.

2359
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:29,530
人们都能接受不完美的爸爸
We can accept an imperfect dad.

2360
01:45:29,530 --> 01:45:30,110
面对现实吧
Let's face it,

2361
01:45:30,110 --> 01:45:33,960
"好爸爸"的概念大概三十年前才被发明出来
the idea of a good father was only invented like 30 years ago.

2362
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:37,360
在那之前  爸爸们就该是沉默的
Before that, fathers were expected to be silent

2363
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:41,260
不顾家的  不靠谱的  自私的
and absent and unreliable and selfish,

2364
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:43,860
我们当然想让他们有所改变
and can all say we want them to be different.

2365
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:47,020
但我们内心其实是接受他们的
But on some basic level, we accept them.

2366
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:49,200
我们爱他们的不靠谱
We love them for their fallibilities,

2367
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:53,240
但如果母亲有弱点  人们是绝对不会接受的
but people absolutely don't accept those same failings in mothers.

2368
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:54,550
不管是从结构上
We don't accept it structurally

2369
01:45:54,550 --> 01:45:56,330
还是从精神上
and we don't accept it spiritually.

2370
01:45:56,330 --> 01:46:00,070
因为我们犹太教与基督教什么的基础
Because the basis of our Judeo-Christian whatever

2371
01:46:00,070 --> 01:46:03,750
就是耶稣之母  圣母玛利亚  而她是完美的
is Mary, Mother of Jesus, and she's perfect.

2372
01:46:03,870 --> 01:46:06,700
她是个生了孩子的处女
She's a virgin who gives birth,

2373
01:46:07,030 --> 01:46:09,420
坚定地支持她的孩子
unwaveringly supports her child and

2374
01:46:09,420 --> 01:46:11,580
孩子死后还抱着他的尸体
holds his dead body when he's gone.

2375
01:46:12,190 --> 01:46:14,970
当爸的根本没露面  生孩子他连屌都没掏出来
And the dad isn't there. He didn't even do the fucking.

2376
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:16,440
上帝在天堂
God is in heaven.

2377
01:46:17,430 --> 01:46:21,600
上帝就是父亲  他没有出现
God is the father and God didn't show up.

2378
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:23,130
所以你必须完美
So, you have to be perfect,

2379
01:46:23,130 --> 01:46:25,700
而查理就算是个废物也没关系
and Charlie can be a fuck up and it doesn't matter.

2380
01:46:26,810 --> 01:46:30,220
你总是会被要求达到不同的  更高的标准
You will always be held to a different, higher standard.

2381
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:33,640
狗屁标准  但现实就是这样
And it's fucked up, but that's the way it is.

2382
01:47:01,300 --> 01:47:04,170
我好像按错门铃了  我是南茜·卡茨
I think I rang the wrong bell. Nancy Katz.

2383
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:05,610
你好  我是查理·巴伯
Hi, I'm Charlie Barber.

2384
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:07,660
亨利正在他的房间里玩
Henry's just playing in his room.

2385
01:47:09,260 --> 01:47:10,430
南茜  要喝点什么吗
Nancy, can I get you anything?

2386
01:47:11,330 --> 01:47:13,760
我都可以  来杯水吧
I'm easy. A glass of water?

2387
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:23,920
我们刚搬过来
It's a new apartment.

2388
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:32,090
我们去那边吧
Shall we go in here?

2389
01:47:32,490 --> 01:47:33,260
好的
Sure.

2390
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:53,510
你们俩平时怎样度过一天
What's a day like for the two of you here?

2391
01:47:54,010 --> 01:47:56,420
如果他要上学  我就送他去
Well, if he has school, I take him there, of course,

2392
01:47:56,420 --> 01:47:58,640
然后去接他  如果可以的话
and pick him up, assuming I can do both.

2393
01:47:58,740 --> 01:48:00,760
如果你接不了他  会是什么原因呢
What prevents you from picking him up?

2394
01:48:02,630 --> 01:48:03,690
工作  你懂的
You know, work.

2395
01:48:03,690 --> 01:48:05,920
我在为过几个月要导演的一部戏剧做准备
I'm preparing a play I'm directing in a few months.

2396
01:48:06,430 --> 01:48:07,240
什么剧
What is that?

2397
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:10,710
厄登·冯·霍尔瓦特的《卡西米尔和卡罗利妮》
Kasimir and Karoline by Ödön von Horváth.

2398
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:12,510
我们要在纽约的巴洛街剧院演出
We're doing it at the Barrow in New York.

2399
01:48:12,850 --> 01:48:14,270
所以你要离开家吗
So, you have to be away?

2400
01:48:14,590 --> 01:48:17,470
对  最近是这样  因为妮可在洛杉矶拍戏
Yes, recently, since Nicole's been working on the show in LA,

2401
01:48:17,470 --> 01:48:19,130
我经常来回跑
I come back and forth a lot.

2402
01:48:19,130 --> 01:48:21,520
-听上去挺辛苦的  -确实辛苦
- That sounds difficult. - It is.

2403
01:48:22,130 --> 01:48:25,210
而且很贵  我有时也试着把他带在身边
And expensive. I'll try to take him with me some of the time,

2404
01:48:25,210 --> 01:48:27,180
但妮可不想让他到处飞来飞去
but Nicole doesn't like for him to fly so much.

2405
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:30,640
坐飞机对孩子来说很辛苦  空气不流通
Well, that can be hard on a child, all that recycled air.

2406
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,250
他挺健壮的

2407

有些父母连餐厅都不敢带孩子去
Some parents won't take their kids to a restaurant

2408
01:48:36,980 --> 01:48:38,950
担心感染超级病菌
because of these superbugs.

2409
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,560
我发现有一次你来洛杉矶  是周日到达
I noticed on one visit to Los Angeles, you came on a Sunday

2410
01:48:46,570 --> 01:48:48,130
周四离开

2411
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:49,980
为什么不留下来过周末
Why not stay for a weekend?

2412
01:48:51,670 --> 01:48:55,640
那次我要回纽约处理《厄勒克特拉》的技术问题
On that time, I had tech for Electra in New York.

2413
01:48:55,950 --> 01:48:56,820

2414
01:48:58,030 --> 01:48:59,600
那是我在百老汇的首演
It was my Broadway debut.

2415
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:02,070
我不明白的是"技术问题"
I don't know what "tech" is.

2416
01:49:02,150 --> 01:49:04,220
就是剧作排演的技术环节
It's the technical part of the production.

2417
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:05,680
你要考虑灯光怎么布局

2418
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:07,820
而周一是剧团的休演日
And Monday's our day off in the theatre.

2419
01:49:06,020 --> 01:49:07,550
{\an8}你们周末一般怎么过

2423
01:49:16,860 --> 01:49:18,730
接着  如果有电影可看的话...

抱歉  他的教练叫罗恩
Sorry, his coach's name is Ron.

2430
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:31,400
瑞克是他在纽约的牙医

纽约离这里很远

其实是他妈妈送给我的

这样...
So...

2579
01:58:24,550 --> 01:58:26,900
因为查理放弃了搬回纽约的要求
because Charlie dropped his claim to New York,

2580
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:28,010
我们就要成功了

And we're not taking any money, right?

2584
01:58:34,050 --> 01:58:36,040
我们放弃了平分麦克阿瑟奖金
We withdrew our claim for the MacArthur,

2585
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:38,140
顺便说一句  我觉得我们是可以争取到的
which I think we could have gotten, by the way,

2586
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:40,900
而他们也不要电视剧的钱了
and they're not asking for any of the show.

还有
And...

01:58:54,050 --> 01:58:55,460
要是查理来洛杉矶了
whenever Charlie is in LA,

2592
01:58:55,460 --> 01:58:58,610
我把监护权细分成了55比45
I got the custody breakdown to be 55/45.

2593
01:58:58,980 --> 01:59:02,150
也就是每两周你都能多陪亨利一天
So you'll have Henry an extra day every two weeks.

2594
01:59:02,330 --> 01:59:03,600
我们不是对半分了吗
I thought we made it equal.

2595
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:05,480
我在最后时刻做了点微调
I tweaked it at the last minute.

2596
01:59:05,480 --> 01:59:08,550

I just didn't want him to be able to say he got 50/50,

2597
01:59:08,550 --> 01:59:10,080
