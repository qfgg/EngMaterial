{\fs12}Amazing burn, Atticus. - It's not a good burn.

128
00:08:37,747 --> 00:08:40,396
他爸两次酒驾 只能搭火车上班
{\fs12}His dad has two DUIs and has to take the train to work.

129
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:41,565
这才嘲
{\fs12}That's a good burn.

130
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:43,907
奶嘴娃 给我们唱首歌
{\fs12}Sippy Cup, sing us a song.

131
00:08:43,987 --> 00:08:44,568
不
{\fs12}No.

132
00:08:44,645 --> 00:08:47,835
来首"一闪一闪小精精"如何
{\fs12}How about "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Bitch"?

133
00:08:48,205 --> 00:08:50,277
奶嘴娃 奶嘴娃
{\fs12}Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup!

134
00:08:50,357 --> 00:08:51,107
不 不 兄弟们
{\fs12}No, no, guys.

135
00:08:51,185 --> 00:08:53,876
他会唱的 但他要多考虑下
{\fs12}He'll do it, but he just needs more time to think.

136
00:08:53,955 --> 00:08:55,645
奶嘴娃 奶嘴娃
{\fs12}Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup!

137
00:08:59,016 --> 00:08:59,747
拜
{\fs12}Bye.

138
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:05,228
千层面 配苏打水
{\fs12}Lasagna and soda?

139
00:09:05,556 --> 00:09:08,229
你给我吃这个 别告诉我爹妈
{\fs12}Don't tell my parents you gave me this.

140
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:10,697
这孩子很逗
{\fs12}This kid is hilarious.

141
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:13,537
我们要离婚
{\fs12}We're getting a divorce.

142
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,770
你们什么意思
{\fs12}Wh-What do you mean?

143
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,700
好 其实一切都不变
{\fs12}Okay, okay, I'll tell you. Everything gonna stay the same.

144
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:19,733
我们保证
{\fs12}We promise.

145
00:09:20,354 --> 00:09:22,437
还会全家共看《我们这一天》吗
{\fs12}Will we still watch This Is Us together?

146
00:09:22,513 --> 00:09:23,642
当然会 -是
{\fs12}Yes, of course. - Yes.

147
00:09:23,723 --> 00:09:24,644
那是我们最爱的剧
{\fs12}That's our favorite show.

148
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:25,677
那是我们的家庭剧
{\fs12}That's our family show.

149
00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:28,648
区别就是你现在得用两台电视看
{\fs12}Except now you're gonna see it on two-two different TVs, you know.

150
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:30,042
在两个不同的家里
{\fs12}In two different houses.

151
00:09:30,122 --> 00:09:31,778
所以你一集得看两遍
{\fs12}So you're gonna have to watch the episode twice.

152
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:34,080
星期二卷饼日怎么办
{\fs12}What about Taco Tuesday?

153
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,587
卷饼日仍照旧
{\fs12}Taco Tuesdays are still going down.

154
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,657
其实你每周两次卷饼日
{\fs12}Matter of fact, you're gonna have two Taco Tuesdays,

155
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:39,558
星期三多一次
{\fs12}just one on Wednesday now.

156
00:09:40,055 --> 00:09:41,153
乐趣翻倍
{\fs12}Twice the fun.

157
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:42,987
乐趣翻倍 卷饼翻倍
{\fs12}Twice the fun, twice the tacos.

158
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,389
所以一切照旧
{\fs12}It's... everything's gonna stay the same, so...

159
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:46,624
一切照旧 我和你妈妈
{\fs12}Everything gonna be the same. Me and your mom, you know,

160
00:09:46,702 --> 00:09:48,358
我们还是最好的朋友
{\fs12}we're still best friends, right?

161
00:09:51,348 --> 00:09:54,639
全家共吃卷饼很好 但我有个建议
{\fs12}I mean, it would've been nice to have tacos together as a family, but how about this?

162
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,602
卷饼日改成星期三
{\fs12}We could change it to Wing Wednesday...

163
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:22,732
索尔 灵感 天使之声
{\fs12}Thor, inspired, voice of an angel, man.

164
00:10:35,556 --> 00:10:37,037
感觉不好吗
{\fs12}♪ And don't it feel good. ♪

165
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,846
感觉确实不错
{\fs12}It does feel good, don't it?

166
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,015
怎么了
{\fs12}What's wrong?

167
00:10:41,095 --> 00:10:42,978
那首歌总让我难过
{\fs12}That song always makes me sad.

168
00:10:43,056 --> 00:10:46,456
别忘了 摇滚年代试演是明天
{\fs12}Don't forget, Rock of Ages auditions are tomorrow.

169
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:47,847
这是我最喜欢的音乐剧
{\fs12}It's my favorite musical.

170
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:49,726
我现在改变很大 自从
{\fs12}I did make some pretty big changes, though,

171
00:10:49,803 --> 00:10:51,592
我在好莱污走红以来
{\fs12}based on my time in Holly-weird.

172
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:56,876
我的事迹 一定能鼓舞有梦的人
{\fs12}I think it'll really inspire those of you who dare to dream.

173
00:10:57,327 --> 00:10:57,925
变态
{\fs12}Sick.

174
00:10:58,003 --> 00:11:01,628
于是我看着她 但她看向另一侧
{\fs12}So, I looked at her, but she was looking the other direction.

175
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,467
但后来她看我
{\fs12}But then she looked at me,

176
00:11:03,548 --> 00:11:05,129
我却换了一个方向
{\fs12}and I was looking the other direction.

177
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:07,633
所以总有一天 我们会对上眼
{\fs12}So I think that someday we're gonna make eye contact.

178
00:11:07,712 --> 00:11:08,467
酷
{\fs12}That's cool.

179
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:11,089
这部音乐剧要火

181
00:11:11,956 --> 00:11:13,337

00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,888

别听阿提库斯的
{\fs12}Don't listen to Atticus.

190
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,769
他爸都不交税
{\fs12}His dad doesn't even pay taxes.

191
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:39,703
阿提库斯说什么 并不重要
{\fs12}Doesn't matter what Atticus says.

192
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,872
我小时候就不想唱了
{\fs12}I've been thinking about quitting singing ever since I was young.

193
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,343
快 鱼糕要被吃完了
{\fs12}Come on. We're gonna miss fish sticks.

194
00:11:57,782 --> 00:11:59,815
我见过的最佳午餐
{\fs12}Whoa. That's the best lunch I've ever seen.

{\fs12}It looks cute on you. - Max, I'm not going for cute.

202
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,809

205
00:12:24,657 --> 00:12:25,973
好像被感染了
{\fs12}It looks infected.

206
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:31,679

208
00:12:33,225 --> 00:12:34,455
还吹箫他妹妹
{\fs12}and blow-jobbed his sister.

209
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:36,216
他吹自己亲妹妹?
{\fs12}He blow-jobbed his own sister?

210
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:38,252
不 他吹的是德里克的妹妹

{\fs12}I heard you sipped a beer like a fucking champ.

215
00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:08,452
对 我喝了一大口

号外 这是亲嘴趴
{\fs12}Also, gonna be a kissing party.

225
00:13:32,704 --> 00:13:34,325

226
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,370

{\fs12}Yeah, dawg.

231
00:13:47,262 --> 00:13:50,285

{\fs12}He's not gonna start sitting with the popular kids, is he?

232
00:13:51,271 --> 00:13:53,663
不 如果有人坐那边 该是我
{\fs12}No. If anyone should be over there, it's me.

233
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,156
听说你被叫奶嘴娃
{\fs12}We heard kids were calling you Sippy Cup,

234
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,559
之所以告诉你
{\fs12}and we just wanted to let you know

235
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:01,934
是因为反霸凌联盟随时欢迎你
{\fs12}you can always call on the Student Coalition Against Bullying for protection.

236
00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:04,890
这像奶嘴杯吗
{\fs12}Does this look like a sippy cup?

237
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:07,040
非也 这是果汁盒
{\fs12}No, it's a fucking juice box.

238
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:09,503
因为我不是小屁孩
{\fs12}'Cause I'm not a fucking child.

239
00:14:09,788 --> 00:14:10,942
别无礼
{\fs12}That's so rude.

240
00:14:11,361 --> 00:14:13,835
等下 索尔和卢卡斯能玩趴吗
{\fs12}Wait. Can I bring Thor and Lucas?

241
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,218
太不着调
{\fs12}So random.

242
00:14:18,297 --> 00:14:19,611
不 他们很酷
{\fs12}No, they're cool.

243
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:21,545
我要男女均衡
{\fs12}I'm trying to keep it half girls, half guys.

244
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:22,889
懂我吗
{\fs12}You feel me, dawg?

245
00:14:22,968 --> 00:14:24,857
我懂 但
{\fs12}I feel you, dawg, but...

246

他们是我最佳老友
{\fs12}they're my best friends.

247
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:28,587
我们什么都一起 我们是精豆小子
{\fs12}We do everything together. We're the Bean Bag Boys.

248
00:14:29,907 --> 00:14:31,228
这名字酷毙了
{\fs12}That's a dope-ass name.

249
00:14:32,326 --> 00:14:33,931
那带他们来
{\fs12}Fuck it. Bring 'em.

250
00:14:34,294 --> 00:14:35,932

251
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:38,001

索伦刚邀请明天我们参趴
{\fs12}Soren just invited us to his party tomorrow.

255
00:14:46,122 --> 00:14:47,945
索伦 -是啊
{\fs12}Soren? - Yeah.

256
00:14:48,024 --> 00:14:50,307
他有提起我名字"索尔"吗
{\fs12}He said my name? He said "Thor"?

257
00:14:50,593 --> 00:14:52,850
差不多 -赞
{\fs12}Pretty much, yeah. - Sweet.

258
00:14:53,413 --> 00:14:55,718
那里会有女生 懂意思吗
{\fs12}Oh, there's also gonna be girls there. You know what that means?

259
00:14:55,914 --> 00:14:57,329
逢场作戏
{\fs12}Drama.

260
00:14:57,699 --> 00:14:58,620
亲嘴
{\fs12}Kissing.

261
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,421
你们懂亲嘴吗
{\fs12}So, do you guys know how to kiss?

262
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:06,995
完全不懂 -不懂
{\fs12}I have no fucking clue. - No.

263
00:15:07,076 --> 00:15:08,524
一点不懂
{\fs12}No, not at all.

264
00:15:10,728 --> 00:15:11,899
键入"亲嘴"
{\fs12}Type "kissing."

265
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,972
不不不 键入"胸部"
{\fs12}Ooh. No, no, no. "Boobs."

266
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:17,539
"乳腺癌研究"
{\fs12}"Breast cancer research."

267
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:19,808
"如何匹配合适胸罩"
{\fs12}"How to find a bra that fits."

268
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:21,744
我有个主意
{\fs12}I have an idea.

269
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:31,718
"年满18岁?"
{\fs12}"Are you 18 or older?"

270
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,054
我要点击"是"
{\fs12}I'm gonna click "yes."

271
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:34,720
我们未满18岁
{\fs12}We're not 18 or older.

272
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,891
会被永久记录的
{\fs12}This could go on our permanent record.

273
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,889
我是你的继母 不能偷看我洗澡
{\fs12}I'm your stepmother. You are not supposed to be looking at me in the shower.

274
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:42,697
别告诉我爸
{\fs12}Don't tell my dad.

275
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:43,790
他会逼我退出运动队
{\fs12}He'll make me quit the sports team.

276
00:15:43,868 --> 00:15:45,866
起来 起来
{\fs12}Get up. Get up.

277
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:47,291
他有麻烦了
{\fs12}He's in trouble.

278
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:48,927
必须惩罚你
{\fs12}You deserve a punishment.

279
00:15:49,005 --> 00:15:50,394
短裤拉下来
{\fs12}Pull down your shorts.

280
00:15:51,246 --> 00:15:53,333
后妈就是这样的吗
{\fs12}Is that what happens when you get a stepmom?

281
00:15:56,274 --> 00:15:58,305
那可不合适啊
{\fs12}No way that's gonna fit in there.

282
00:15:58,381 --> 00:15:59,570
滚出去 女人
{\fs12}Get out of there, girl!

283
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,306
他的手哪去了
{\fs12}Where did his hand go?

284
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:02,613
哎呀 -天哪
{\fs12}Ew! - Oh, my God!

285
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:07,772
没人亲过嘴
{\fs12}Nobody even kissed.

286
00:16:08,876 --> 00:16:11,143
起码不是嘴
{\fs12}Yeah, not on their mouths at least.

287
00:16:12,085 --> 00:16:13,723
我爹妈有个心肺复苏娃娃
{\fs12}My parents have a CPR doll.

288
00:16:13,803 --> 00:16:15,284
我们可去练亲嘴
{\fs12}We can go practice kissing on that.

289
00:16:15,364 --> 00:16:16,386
来吧
{\fs12}Come on.

290
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:26,261
超漂亮的心肺复苏娃娃
{\fs12}This is a really pretty CPR doll.

291
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:30,033
我先来
{\fs12}I guess I'll go first.

292
00:16:34,007 --> 00:16:34,571
停
{\fs12}Stop.

293
00:16:34,856 --> 00:16:36,404
你在做什么
{\fs12}What are you doing?

294
00:16:36,658 --> 00:16:37,645
亲她
{\fs12}Kissing her.

295
00:16:37,724 --> 00:16:39,709
未经允许 你不能乱亲
{\fs12}You can't kiss someone without their permission.

296
00:16:39,787 --> 00:16:41,444
开过大会的 记得吗
{\fs12}Remember from assembly?

297
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:42,844
假装它是柏丽
{\fs12}Pretend it's Brixlee.

298
00:16:42,923 --> 00:16:44,879
绅士点 -好
{\fs12}Try to be a gentleman. - Okay.

299
00:16:44,957 --> 00:16:46,749
柏丽 我能亲你吗
{\fs12}Brixlee, can I kiss you?

300
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:48,582
为什么
{\fs12}Why?

301
00:16:49,104 --> 00:16:50,993
为什么 -对
{\fs12}Why? - Yeah.

302
00:16:51,072 --> 00:16:52,686
你喜欢我什么
{\fs12}What do you like about me?

303
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,054
那个
{\fs12}Well...

304
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,225
你很甜 你很好味
{\fs12}you're sweet. You smell good.

305
00:16:57,794 --> 00:16:58,766
你也很聪明
{\fs12}You're smart, too.

306
00:16:58,886 --> 00:17:01,735
你总帮推亨利的轮椅 尽管他超级损
{\fs12}You always push Henry in his wheelchair even though he's super mean.

307
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,173
滑板公园那次 我正想表白
{\fs12}And just when I think I've got you figured out,

308
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:06,074
但你玩滑板而经过
{\fs12}you go ahead and start skateboarding.

309
00:17:06,153 --> 00:17:07,667
我同意了
{\fs12}I consent.

310
00:17:16,657 --> 00:17:18,440
如何啊 -粘
{\fs12}How was it? - Sticky.

311
00:17:21,383 --> 00:17:23,756
为什么她嘴里有毛发
{\fs12}Why does she have hair in her mouth?

312
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,059
知道吗 这没用
{\fs12}You know what? This isn't teaching us anything.

313
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:27,827
我们要看真人亲嘴
{\fs12}We need to see real people kissing.

314
00:17:27,905 --> 00:17:29,788
只有这样 才知对错
{\fs12}That's the only way to know if we're doing it right.

315
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,399
我邻居是纵色狂
{\fs12}My neighbor is a total nymphomaniac.

316
00:17:32,477 --> 00:17:34,233
她男友总是换
{\fs12}Her boyfriend's always over.

317
00:17:34,528 --> 00:17:36,000
她纵火?
{\fs12}She starts fires?

318
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:39,297
不 她不纵火 她纵色 女色魔的意思
{\fs12}No, that's a pyromaniac. She's a nymphomaniac.

319
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,732
海陆双响炮喔
{\fs12}Someone who has sex on land and sea.

320
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,835
不会吧
{\fs12}Seriously?

321
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:46,937
本想明天给你惊喜
{\fs12}Okay, I was gonna wait till tomorrow to surprise you,

322
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:48,603
要不告诉你吧
{\fs12}but can I just tell you?

323
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,409
不 不用 -不 你想知道的
{\fs12}Nah, I'm good. - No, you want to know.

324
00:17:51,794 --> 00:17:53,309
我什么都看不见
{\fs12}Ugh. I can barely see anything.

325
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:54,711
我们腻得不够多
{\fs12}I know we haven't been hanging out much,

326
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,344
因为自从我遇见本吉
{\fs12}you know, ever since I met Benji,

327
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:57,611
但我想弥补你
{\fs12}but I want to make it up to you.

328
00:17:58,068 --> 00:17:59,345
所以明天我逃学
{\fs12}So, tomorrow, I'm skipping school,

329
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:01,551
我们开车进城看肯德里克·拉马尔演出
{\fs12}and we're driving to the city to see Kendrick Lamar.

330
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:03,552
闭嘴 -还要服用莫莉
{\fs12}Shut up! - And we're gonna do Molly.

331
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,799
你全都策划好了 -那当然
{\fs12}You thought of everything. - Of course I fucking have.

332
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:06,889
会很好玩的
{\fs12}It's gonna be amazing.

333
00:18:07,176 --> 00:18:08,456
我来混音
{\fs12}Remix!

334
00:18:10,812 --> 00:18:12,462
本吉给我们弄到了莫莉
{\fs12}Well, Benji got us the Molly.

335
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:15,130
本杰明 -谢谢
{\fs12}Benjamin. - Oh, thank you!

336
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:16,664
看
{\fs12}Look.

337
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:20,467
这不行 我们去爬树吧
{\fs12}This isn't working. Maybe we could go climb a tree.

338
00:18:20,922 --> 00:18:22,136
不行 会被他们看见的
{\fs12}No, they'd see us.

339
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:23,837
我指的是纯爬树
{\fs12}No, I just meant let's go climb a tree.

340
00:18:24,225 --> 00:18:25,213
兄弟 等等
{\fs12}Dude, wait.

341
00:18:25,876 --> 00:18:28,110
我有个办法 能看他们亲嘴
{\fs12}I know a way we can see them kiss.

342
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,751
我不能
{\fs12}I can't.

343
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:40,027
上边有摄像头 全都能看到
{\fs12}It has a camera. We could see everything.

344
00:18:40,106 --> 00:18:41,621
我们可以学技术
{\fs12}We can learn technique.

345
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,065
这是他爸工作用的 这不是玩具
{\fs12}It's for his dad's work. It's not a toy.

346
00:18:44,143 --> 00:18:47,032
当然是玩具 玩具店有卖
{\fs12}Of course it's a toy. They sell it at toy stores.

347
00:18:47,112 --> 00:18:49,035
我叔叔在部队驾驶无人机
{\fs12}My uncle flew a drone for the Army,

348
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:52,039
现在他睡梦里会大喊 还拉肚子
{\fs12}and now he yells in his sleep and has crazy diarrhea.

349
00:18:52,116 --> 00:18:54,240
他居然把无人机留在家里 太糟了
{\fs12}It's messed up that he even keeps it in the house.

350
00:18:54,321 --> 00:18:56,603
你每天都会路过无人机
{\fs12}You have to walk by it every day.

351
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,668
他在折磨你 -说的没错
{\fs12}He's torturing you. - It's true.

352
00:18:57,748 --> 00:18:59,938
就像你表妹穿着比基尼走
{\fs12}It's like when your cousin walks around in a bikini

353
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:01,273
她还嘲笑你
{\fs12}and she taunts you.

354
00:19:01,352 --> 00:19:03,184
如果你被发现 你会被禁足的
{\fs12}If he finds out, you'll be grounded.

355
00:19:03,261 --> 00:19:04,775
你再也去不了索伦家了
{\fs12}You won't be able to go to Soren's.

356
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:07,477
更惨的是 你爸不再信你了
{\fs12}And even worse, you'll lose your father's trust.

357
00:19:07,865 --> 00:19:08,613
说的也没错
{\fs12}It's true, too.

358
00:19:08,691 --> 00:19:10,482
她只爱你的本性
{\fs12}She'll love you for who you are.

359
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,349
对 猥琐亲嘴者 还记得之前的毛片吗
{\fs12}Yeah, a shitty kisser. Remember the porn from earlier?

360
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:15,052
那家伙都不懂亲嘴
{\fs12}That guy didn't even know how to kiss.

361
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:16,854
他舔那女人的屁眼
{\fs12}He was just licking that woman's asshole.

362
00:19:16,932 --> 00:19:19,655
你想亲屁眼吗 麦克斯 -绝不
{\fs12}You want to kiss an asshole, Max? - No.

363
00:19:19,735 --> 00:19:23,762
麦克斯 别听他的 他想去 因为他迷上了万人迷
{\fs12}Max, don't listen to him. He just wants to go because he's obsessed with popular boys.

364
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:24,829
相信我 麦克斯
{\fs12}Believe me, Max.

365
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:27,643
不懂亲嘴的话 你不会想去索伦家的
{\fs12}You don't want to go to Soren's not knowing how to kiss.

366
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,774
等明天你们两女生腻完之后
{\fs12}So, tomorrow, after you get some girl time,

367
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:37,908
不如腻我这个男生
{\fs12}why don't you come over for some man time?

368
00:19:38,268 --> 00:19:40,458
不 说了这周末我要和莉莉出去玩
{\fs12}No, I told you I'm hanging out with Lily this weekend.

369
00:19:40,536 --> 00:19:45,414
对 我很难不见你 因为你是我最好的朋友
{\fs12}Yeah, it's just... you know, it's hard for me not to see you, 'cause you're my best friend.

370
00:19:45,704 --> 00:19:47,348
但莉莉是我最好的朋友
{\fs12}But Lily's my best friend.

371
00:19:47,428 --> 00:19:49,452
明白 非常明白
{\fs12}Yeah, I get it. Totally, totally get it.

372
00:19:51,874 --> 00:19:54,364
我还是找前任玛格丽特玩得了
{\fs12}I'll probably just hang out with my ex, Margaret.

373
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:56,365
你想我嫉妒吗
{\fs12}Are you trying to make me jealous?

374
00:19:56,443 --> 00:19:58,526
没有啊 为什么 你嫉妒吗
{\fs12}Uh, no. Why? Are you jealous?

375
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,296
这招没用
{\fs12}Yeah, this isn't working out.

376
00:20:02,593 --> 00:20:05,041
我知道你自觉不够辣 所以没信心
{\fs12}I know. You're not hot enough to be acting like this,

377
00:20:05,313 --> 00:20:08,202
下次你寻思 好男人都去了哪儿
{\fs12}so the next time that you're wondering where all the nice guys went,

378
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,991
记住 你现在放跑了一个好男人
{\fs12}ber that you let one walk right out the door.

379
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:15,142
什么
{\fs12}What?

380
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:16,776
我什么都没说
{\fs12}I didn't say anything.

381
00:20:17,646 --> 00:20:19,077
我再也不想见你了
{\fs12}I never want to see you again.

382
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:23,182
你没事吧
{\fs12}Are you okay?

383

等等 那小子去哪儿了
{\fs12}Wait, where'd the guy go?

384
00:20:28,175 --> 00:20:29,891
谁管 女生在抱抱
{\fs12}Who cares? The girls just hugged.

385
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,890
她们肯定会亲的
{\fs12}They are definitely gonna kiss.

386
00:20:32,244 --> 00:20:33,565
更近一点
{\fs12}We might need to get closer.

387
00:20:34,062 --> 00:20:35,093
你听到没有
{\fs12}Do you hear that?

388
00:20:36,213 --> 00:20:37,761
那是什么
{\fs12}What is that?

389
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:39,932
在监视我们
{\fs12}It's fucking spying on us.

390
00:20:40,011 --> 00:20:42,135
好 轮到我飞了 -给我
{\fs12}All right, it's my turn to fly. - Give it!

391
00:20:43,055 --> 00:20:44,278
我想吵吵她们 -不
{\fs12}I just want to buzz 'em. - No!

392
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:46,970
会被你弄坏的
{\fs12}Hey, you're gonna break it.

393
00:20:47,191 --> 00:20:48,907
你想要吗 好
{\fs12}You want it? Fine!

394
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,281

{\fs12}Shit!

395
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,681
不
{\fs12}No!

396
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,983
妈的 见鬼 索尔 -我们两个都有错
{\fs12}Shit! What the hell, Thor? - That was both of our faults.

397
00:21:01,062 --> 00:21:02,986
我爸会杀了我 现在怎么办
{\fs12}Well, Dad's gonna kill me. What do I do now?

398
00:21:06,008 --> 00:21:06,862
搞什么鬼
{\fs12}Whoa! - What the hell?!

399
00:21:06,942 --> 00:21:08,297
就说有人闯入 -什么
{\fs12}We say there was a break-in. - What...?

400
00:21:08,378 --> 00:21:10,301
他们捣毁了这里 拿走了无人机
{\fs12}They trashed the place and took the drone.

401
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:12,628
有史以来最傻的想法
{\fs12}That's the most stupid fucking idea I've ever heard!

402
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:13,996
兄弟们
{\fs12}Guys, guys.

403
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:15,931
我们只需去那边
{\fs12}All we have to do is just go over there

404
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,302
说出实话 上帝会支持我们的
{\fs12}and tell the truth, then God will be on our side.

405
00:21:25,342 --> 00:21:27,142
嗨 有事吗
{\fs12}Hey. Can I help you?

406
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,576
确实有事 姐姐
{\fs12}Uh, I hope so, madam.

407
00:21:28,656 --> 00:21:31,146
我们在用无人机跟踪乌龟一家
{\fs12}We were using our drone to follow a family of turtles,

408
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:33,682
无人机可能坠毁在你家后院
{\fs12}and we thought it might have crashed in your backyard.

409
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,550
没错 它在这里 快进来
{\fs12}Oh, yeah, yeah, it's here. Come on in.

410
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,632
你们喜欢乌龟吗 -是
{\fs12}So, you guys like turtles? - Yeah.

411
00:21:43,711 --> 00:21:46,334
太棒了 -时间到 混蛋
{\fs12}That's awesome. - Time's up, motherfuckers.

412
00:21:46,412 --> 00:21:47,627
妈的 是陷阱
{\fs12}Shit! It's a trap.

413
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:49,531
你以为我会在乎什么乌龟?
{\fs12}You think I give a fuck about turtles?

414
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,532
对不起 我们只想学亲嘴
{\fs12}We're sorry. We just wanted to learn how to kiss.

415
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,479
卢卡斯 这与她们无关
{\fs12}Lucas, it's none of their business.

416
00:21:53,557 --> 00:21:54,967
我们该说真话
{\fs12}We should have just told the truth.

417
00:21:55,046 --> 00:21:56,502
我们要去亲嘴趴
{\fs12}We're going to a kissing party,

418
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,570
我们谁也没有亲过 我们怕
{\fs12}and none of us have ever kissed, and we're scared.

419
00:21:58,648 --> 00:21:59,970
妈的 卢卡斯
{\fs12}Goddamn it, Lucas.

420
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:03,943
我做过爱 但我没有亲过女人
{\fs12}I've had sex before, but I've never kissed a girl.

421
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,453
上网 输入"如何亲嘴"即可
{\fs12}Just go online and type in "how to kiss."

422
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:08,053
人尽皆知
{\fs12}That's what everyone does.

423
00:22:10,334 --> 00:22:11,581
这很容易
{\fs12}It's very easy.

424
00:22:11,661 --> 00:22:13,417
能把无人机还我们吗
{\fs12}Look, can we please have the drone back?

425
00:22:13,495 --> 00:22:14,783
天雷滚滚号 是我爸的
{\fs12}It's a BD Rolling Thunder. It's my dad's.

426
00:22:15,096 --> 00:22:17,662
他工作上用的 能还我吗
{\fs12}He needs it for work. Can I please have it back?

427
00:22:17,742 --> 00:22:20,225
我很需要它 拜托 -没有的事
{\fs12}I really need it. Please. - I don't think so.

428
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:22,724
如果不还 我告诉我爸是你们偷的
{\fs12}If you don't give it back, I'll tell my dad you stole it.

429
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:24,470
我告诉他你是变态
{\fs12}And I'll tell him that you're a pervert.

430
00:22:24,548 --> 00:22:25,502
还要告诉全校
{\fs12}We'll tell the whole school.

431
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,031
这是性骚扰
{\fs12}This is sensual harassment.

432
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:29,301
还要昭告天下 说你厌女
{\fs12}We'll tell everyone that you're a misogynist.

433
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:30,982
我没按摩过谁
{\fs12}I never massaged anyone.

434
00:22:31,062 --> 00:22:32,510
(按摩/厌女 同音)

435
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,406
你不尊重女性 就会这样
{\fs12}This is what happens when you don't respect women.

436
00:22:35,484 --> 00:22:37,973
我尊重女人 我妈是我最好的朋友
{\fs12}I respect women. My mom's my best friend.

437
00:22:38,778 --> 00:22:39,609
那我呢
{\fs12}What about me?

438
00:22:41,638 --> 00:22:42,903
天哪 这下我死定了
{\fs12}Oh, God, I'm so fucked.

439
00:22:42,983 --> 00:22:44,447
我爸会杀了我
{\fs12}My dad's gonna kill me.

440
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,916
你非要偷窥她们 好一个女权主义者
{\fs12}You had to snoop on them. You're such a feminist.

441
00:22:46,995 --> 00:22:49,751
我不是女权主义者 我爱女人
{\fs12}I'm-I'm not a feminist. I love women.

442
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:51,918
我父母肯定会通知你父母
{\fs12}And my parents are definitely gonna call your guys' parents.

443
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:53,489
我们都会被禁足
{\fs12}We're all gonna get grounded.

444
00:22:53,568 --> 00:22:55,225
忘了索伦的趴吧 我们完了
{\fs12}Forget Soren's party. We're fucked.

445
00:22:55,545 --> 00:22:57,827
你笑什么 都怪你
{\fs12}Why are you smiling? This is actually your fault.

446
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:00,663
这是战利品
{\fs12}This is leverage.

447
00:23:06,622 --> 00:23:07,636
宾果

450
00:23:12,578 --> 00:23:16,078
干什么用的 -女人塞屁股的 防止婴儿掉出来
{\fs12}What's it for? - Girls shove it up their buttholes to stop babies from coming out.

451
00:23:16,155 --> 00:23:17,811
某八年级生告诉我的
{\fs12}An eighth-grader told me that.

452
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:20,414
人体真是迷
{\fs12}The human body is truly a mystery.

453
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:23,850
她们居然还在吃口香糖
{\fs12}Can't believe they still eat chewables.

454
00:23:23,928 --> 00:23:25,316
软糖好吃多了
{\fs12}The gummies are so much better.

455
00:23:25,396 --> 00:23:27,621
我喜欢口香糖 给我一个

467
00:24:13,374 --> 00:24:15,063

{\fs12}I promise you we were gonna give the drone back.

471
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:25,119
不可能 她们还会骗我们
{\fs12}No way. They could trick us again.

472
00:24:25,393 --> 00:24:26,907
或用暴力
{\fs12}Or overpower us.

473
00:24:27,295 --> 00:24:29,878
天哪 万一他们拿走莫莉
{\fs12}Oh, my God. What if they take the Molly?

474
00:24:30,203 --> 00:24:31,646
那我们就没办法吃了
{\fs12}Then we wouldn't be able to take it.

475
00:24:31,726 --> 00:24:33,716
不 他们是孩子 会死的
{\fs12}No, they're children. They would die.

{\fs12}So, put the drone on the slide, and count back from a hundred,

488
00:25:33,925 --> 00:25:35,139
闭上眼睛
{\fs12}and close your eyes.

{\fs12}When you attack one of us,

563
00:28:28,086 --> 00:28:29,640
等于攻击我们所有人

{\fs12}If we don't get a new drone by then, I'm grounded.

577
00:29:01,851 --> 00:29:04,340
你们也会被禁足 意思玩不成趴了
{\fs12}Which means we're all grounded, which means no party,

578
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:05,741
也就没有柏丽

635
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:41,179
为什么要武器
{\fs12}I still don't get why we need weapons.

636
00:31:41,257 --> 00:31:42,445
他可能是恋童癖
{\fs12}He could be a pedophile.

637
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,022
但他不能骚扰我们三人
{\fs12}He can't molest all three of us.

638
00:31:44,101 --> 00:31:45,851
他只需要一人
{\fs12}All he needs is one.

639
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:50,244
(肛门珠)

640
00:31:50,324 --> 00:31:51,756
铝制珠?
{\fs12}"An-al beads"?

641
00:31:52,575 --> 00:31:54,966
又名双节棍 混蛋
{\fs12}Aka nunchucks, motherfucker.

642
00:31:56,864 --> 00:31:58,764
这不是玩具
{\fs12}Yeah! - It's not a toy.

643
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:01,431
惨
{\fs12}Oh, shoot.

644
00:32:04,437 --> 00:32:05,802
一股屎味
{\fs12}They smell like shit.

645
00:32:12,829 --> 00:32:15,785
嗨 我在找卢卡斯
{\fs12}Hello. Uh, I'm looking for Lucas.

646
00:32:15,863 --> 00:32:18,080
是我 -我是克劳德
{\fs12}That's me. - I'm Claude.

647
00:32:18,566 --> 00:32:19,520
嗨
{\fs12}Hey.

648
00:32:20,085 --> 00:32:21,449
那是我妈
{\fs12}That's my mom back there.

649
00:32:21,904 --> 00:32:23,151
你好
{\fs12}Hi-ya!

650
00:32:25,087 --> 00:32:26,963
废话少说 你是恋童癖吗
{\fs12}Let's cut the shit. Are you a pedophile?

651
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:28,663
什么 不
{\fs12}What? No.

652
00:32:28,742 --> 00:32:29,997
卢卡斯 如果你是恋童癖
{\fs12}Lucas, if you were a pedophile

653
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:32,627
站在三个单身男孩前 你会承认吗
{\fs12}standing in front of three single boys, would you admit it?

654
00:32:33,197 --> 00:32:34,035
可能不会
{\fs12}Probably not.

655
00:32:34,114 --> 00:32:35,328
那他为什么要承认
{\fs12}Then why would he?

656
00:32:35,408 --> 00:32:36,629
拜托
{\fs12}Oh, come on.

657
00:32:36,951 --> 00:32:38,399
我像恋童癖吗
{\fs12}Do I look like a pedophile?

658
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:39,800
像 -绝对 -百分之千
{\fs12}Sure do. - Yes, absolutely. - 1,000%.

659
00:32:39,987 --> 00:32:40,967
不像话
{\fs12}That's not fair.

660
00:32:41,047 --> 00:32:44,305
你比谁都像恋童癖
{\fs12}You look more like a pedophile than anyone I've ever seen.

661
00:32:44,384 --> 00:32:47,208
我不是恋童癖 我是好人
{\fs12}Look, I'm not a pedophile. I'm a cool guy.

662
00:32:48,028 --> 00:32:51,144
好 你可以进来 但请脱鞋
{\fs12}Fine. You can come in, but please take your shoes off.

663
00:32:51,224 --> 00:32:53,655
我找遍全世界求这张卡
{\fs12}You know, I've searched the world for this.

664
00:32:53,732 --> 00:32:55,688
你为什么带彩弹枪
{\fs12}Why are you bringing the paintball gun?

665
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:57,485
万一有人敢搞我们
{\fs12}In case anyone fucks with us.

666
00:32:57,562 --> 00:32:59,585
这张卡很精致
{\fs12}This card is exquisite.

667
00:33:00,724 --> 00:33:02,748
你怎么弄到的 -那个夏天我搬家
{\fs12}How'd you get it? - The summer I moved here,

668
00:33:02,825 --> 00:33:05,564
我 麦克斯和索尔 开始洗狗
{\fs12}me, Max and Thor started a dog-washing business.

669
00:33:05,644 --> 00:33:09,937
我们赚了八块钱 用钱买了卡牌增强包 内含这张卡
{\fs12}We earned eight bucks, and we used the money to buy an Ascension pack, and this card was in it.

670
00:33:10,015 --> 00:33:11,362
你很幸运
{\fs12}Well, you got very lucky.

671
00:33:11,442 --> 00:33:13,666
真正幸运是遇见麦克斯和索尔
{\fs12}The real luck was meeting Max and Thor.

672
00:33:13,745 --> 00:33:14,367
非常好
{\fs12}Fascinating.

673
00:33:14,445 --> 00:33:16,436
我们开始自称为精豆小子
{\fs12}We started calling ourself the Bean Bag Boys.

674
00:33:16,654 --> 00:33:19,644
知道为什么吗 -因为你们小而弥坚
{\fs12}You know why? - Because you had some beanbags?

675
00:33:19,723 --> 00:33:21,606
没错 -天才
{\fs12}That's right. - Yeah. Genius.

676
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,580
成交
{\fs12}You got yourself a deal.

677
00:33:26,097 --> 00:33:28,180
来吧 达成交易
{\fs12}Let's go. Let's make it happen.

678
00:33:30,644 --> 00:33:32,584
不 我不能
{\fs12}No, I can't do this.

679
00:33:33,665 --> 00:33:34,352
对不起
{\fs12}Sorry.

680
00:33:34,468 --> 00:33:36,620
卢卡斯 给我过来
{\fs12}Lucas, get your butt over here right now.

681
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,730
不好意思 12岁孩子就这么干吗
{\fs12}Excuse me, is this how all 12-year-olds conduct business?

682
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,863
怎么回事
{\fs12}What the hell just happened?

683
00:33:40,944 --> 00:33:42,125
我以为你同意的
{\fs12}I thought you were cool with this.

684
00:33:42,203 --> 00:33:44,593
你说只要有一个人不同意 我们就不干
{\fs12}You said we wouldn't do this if one of us wasn't on board.

685
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,229
我不同意 -你在乎什么
{\fs12}I'm not on board. - Why do you care so much?

686
00:33:47,308 --> 00:33:48,864
为什么不在乎
{\fs12}Why don't you care?

687
00:33:49,052 --> 00:33:50,532
这张卡充满了回忆
{\fs12}This card has a lot of memories,

688
00:33:50,651 --> 00:33:54,144
你就为了亲普通女生而卖掉这张卡吗
{\fs12}and you're just gonna throw it all away because you want to kiss some basic girl?

689
00:33:54,222 --> 00:33:55,136
野蛮人
{\fs12}Savage.

690
00:33:55,216 --> 00:33:56,940
柏丽不是普通女生
{\fs12}Brixlee isn't just some girl.

691
00:33:57,017 --> 00:33:58,473
我们很可能会结婚
{\fs12}We're probably gonna get married.

692
00:33:58,553 --> 00:34:00,776
每段婚姻都以离婚告终
{\fs12}Every marriage ends in divorce.

693
00:34:01,229 --> 00:34:03,712
卢卡斯 你出局了
{\fs12}Lucas, you're outvoted.

694
00:34:04,132 --> 00:34:06,322
你先息怒
{\fs12}Listen, I can tell you're lashing out with anger,

695
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:08,124
但柏丽可能是我一生挚爱
{\fs12}but Brixlee is probably the love of my life.

696
00:34:08,203 --> 00:34:10,486
对不起 太太 我能喝杯水吗
{\fs12}Excuse me, ma'am. Can I get a glass of water, please?

697
00:34:12,073 --> 00:34:12,887
你好
{\fs12}Hello?

698
00:34:17,365 --> 00:34:18,358
兄弟们
{\fs12}Hey, guys?

699
00:34:23,683 --> 00:34:25,138
她有什么幕后故事
{\fs12}What can you tell me about her backstory?

700
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,300
她从哪儿来
{\fs12}Where is she supposed to be from?

701
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:27,333
很有异国情调
{\fs12}She seems quite exotic.

702
00:34:28,538 --> 00:34:29,503
给我听好了
{\fs12}Okay, listen carefully,

703
00:34:29,581 --> 00:34:31,470
因为我只说一遍
{\fs12}'cause I'll make this offer only once.

704
00:34:31,755 --> 00:34:33,812
400块 转让给我
{\fs12}400 bucks to take her off your hands.

705
00:34:34,126 --> 00:34:36,742
不 550美元
{\fs12}No. We need 550, U.S.

706
00:34:37,162 --> 00:34:38,918
滚了 什么啊
{\fs12}Fuck off. What?

707
00:34:38,997 --> 00:34:40,920
那是我全部零用钱
{\fs12}That's my entire allowance.

708
00:34:40,999 --> 00:34:43,589
听着 克劳德 废话少说
{\fs12}Listen, Claude, let's just cut the bullshit.

709
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:47,008
我是女商人之子 大家没意见吧
{\fs12}I'm the son of a businesswoman, and I think we both know,

710
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:48,725
如果你不想买娃娃
{\fs12}if you didn't want to buy the doll,

711
00:34:48,806 --> 00:34:49,887
你早就走了
{\fs12}you would've left already.

712
00:34:50,242 --> 00:34:53,058
别把我们当孩子 我们懂生意经
{\fs12}Stop treating us like kids. We know how things work.

713
00:34:53,137 --> 00:34:55,928
买不买心肺复苏娃
{\fs12}So, do you want to buy the CPR doll or not?

714
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:03,234
傻子们 我本来想付1000的
{\fs12}Fools. I'd have paid a thousand.

715
00:35:03,787 --> 00:35:05,937
有没有人感觉他要干娃娃
{\fs12}Anyone else feel like he's gonna fuck that doll?

716
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:29,563
该补充水分
{\fs12}We should hydrate.

717
00:35:29,643 --> 00:35:31,532
骑了14分钟有了
{\fs12}We've been biking for almost 14 minutes straight.

718
00:35:31,846 --> 00:35:33,803
从未离家这么远
{\fs12}I don't think I've ever been this far from home.

719
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:36,706
我在这里想出了"猫"的旋律
{\fs12}I think I did a production of Cats around here.

720
00:35:36,783 --> 00:35:38,842
你真不再唱了吗
{\fs12}You're really not gonna sing anymore?

721
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:41,871
对 从来没这么高兴过
{\fs12}Yeah. I've never been happier.

722
00:35:44,993 --> 00:35:46,642
把药给我们 -干
{\fs12}Just give us the drugs. - Fuck.

723
00:35:46,718 --> 00:35:48,007
你怎么找到我们的
{\fs12}How'd you find us?

724
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,118
她的手机有跟踪程序
{\fs12} Her phone.They tracked us.

725
00:35:50,197 --> 00:35:51,913
不会给你们的
{\fs12}We're not giving you these drugs.

726
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:53,914
要交给消防队
{\fs12}We're giving them to firefighters.

727
00:35:54,768 --> 00:35:55,516
去喊人吧
{\fs12}Get help.

728
00:35:56,352 --> 00:35:58,426
走 -我们开的是汽车 傻小子
{\fs12}Go! - We're in a car, dipshits.

729
00:35:58,504 --> 00:35:59,751
跑不过我们的
{\fs12}You're not gonna outrun us.

730
00:35:59,831 --> 00:36:01,589
我们骑的是超速自行车 呆子
{\fs12}Not on my fast bike, nerds.

731
00:36:06,312 --> 00:36:09,195
有本事开车过来 鲁蛇
{\fs12}Good luck getting your car in here, losers!

732
00:36:10,508 --> 00:36:11,137
妈的
{\fs12}Shit.

733
00:36:18,323 --> 00:36:19,437
你要去哪
{\fs12}Where are you going?

734
00:36:50,986 --> 00:36:53,176
你别想拿回药
{\fs12}You're not getting these drugs back!

735
00:36:53,257 --> 00:36:55,673
把性药给她
{\fs12}Just give her the sex drugs!

736
00:36:57,869 --> 00:36:58,707
分头走
{\fs12}Peel off!

737
00:36:59,895 --> 00:37:01,049
我不会让你毁了你的...
{\fs12}I won't let you destroy your li...

738
00:37:07,585 --> 00:37:08,550
你没事吧
{\fs12}Are you okay?

739
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:09,992
你没事吧 -卢卡斯 你没事吧
{\fs12}Are you okay? - Lucas, are you okay?

740
00:37:10,072 --> 00:37:11,153
怎么回事
{\fs12}What the hell happened?

741
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:13,788
我们要逃离保姆 她想摸我们的老二
{\fs12}We were running away from our babysitter 'cause she was trying to touch our penises.

742
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:14,961
他们在瞎说
{\fs12}What? That is not true.

743
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,593
没瞎说 -是瞎说 -我没有
{\fs12}Yes, it is. - Yes, it is. - I wasn't.

744
00:37:16,673 --> 00:37:17,897
你就是的 -我没有
{\fs12}Yeah, you were. - I wasn't...

745
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,069
走走走 -又怎么了
{\fs12}Go, go, go, go, go! Go, go! - What happened?

746
00:37:22,149 --> 00:37:23,271
走 走
{\fs12}Go, go!

747
00:37:23,352 --> 00:37:25,501
卢卡斯 你没事吧
{\fs12}Lucas, are you okay?

748
00:37:26,223 --> 00:37:27,668
应该没事
{\fs12}I-I think I'm fine.

749
00:37:28,356 --> 00:37:31,045
你的手臂 -不
{\fs12}Your arm. - Oh, hell no.

750
00:37:35,061 --> 00:37:35,815
我打911
{\fs12}Yo, I'm-a call 911.

751
00:37:35,894 --> 00:37:37,016
救命 -不不不 没事的
{\fs12}Help! Help! - No, no, no. It's okay.

752
00:37:37,096 --> 00:37:37,950
经常这样
{\fs12}This happens all the time.

753
00:37:38,031 --> 00:37:39,219
我们得走了
{\fs12}Come on, we got to go. We got to go. Go.

754
00:37:39,297 --> 00:37:40,812
救命 -我们得... 快
{\fs12}Help! Ow! - We got... Come on.

755
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:41,813
我去拿自行车
{\fs12}I'll get the bikes.

756
00:37:44,785 --> 00:37:47,009
好 我把她们的手机扔进了灌木丛
{\fs12}Okay. I threw their phone in a prickle bush.

757
00:37:47,206 --> 00:37:48,962
所以她们不能再追踪我们了
{\fs12}So they can't track us anymore.

758
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:50,262
好痛
{\fs12}Oh, the pain!

759
00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:51,862
卢卡斯 你必须安静
{\fs12}Lucas, you have to be quiet.

760
00:37:51,943 --> 00:37:53,524
有冰块吗
{\fs12}Okay, do we have any ice?

761
00:37:53,642 --> 00:37:55,264
没有 我们在马路上
{\fs12}No, we're in a fucking alley.

762

{\fs12}I just ran off without my family's bikes.

874
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,775
两轮周末搞砸了 -兄弟们

00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,929
目前的处境
{\fs12}Well, we wouldn't be in this position right now

883

过高速公路就行
{\fs12}All we have to do is cross the highway,

886
00:44:04,982 --> 00:44:06,557
车流都没动
{\fs12}and the cars aren't even moving.

887
00:44:06,636 --> 00:44:09,741
我们是五年 还是六年级生
{\fs12}Now, are we fifth-graders, or are we sixth-graders?

888
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:27,232
我要回树林
{\fs12}Well, I'm going back into the woods.

889
00:44:27,312 --> 00:44:28,994
我靠雨水和松鼠而活
{\fs12}I'll live off of rainwater and squirrels.

890
00:44:29,072 --> 00:44:30,260
我不干了

954
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:10,782

抱歉 借过
{\fs12}Excuse me. Got to get through.

961
00:47:31,235 --> 00:47:32,057
抱歉
{\fs12}Sorry.

962
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:38,175
我们打过电话来 关于天雷滚滚
{\fs12}Hey. We called about the BD Rolling Thunder.

963
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:40,512

{\fs12}Jesus. - I'm gonna kill your family, and then they're gonna come alive... - Ease off the sugar, huh?

970
00:47:54,569 --> 00:47:56,083
把你全家变成僵尸 -麦克斯
{\fs12}...and turn your whole family into zombies! - Max!

971
00:47:56,162 --> 00:47:59,111
我刚想说 我还没说完
{\fs12}I was gonna say... you didn't let me finish...

972
00:48:00,642 --> 00:48:02,465
她们留了纸条
{\fs12}they left a note for you.

973
00:48:08,749 --> 00:48:10,672
这样走路什么意思
{\fs12}Why are they walking like that?

974
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,106
我不知道
{\fs12}I don't know.

975
00:48:15,739 --> 00:48:17,304
你们是怎么追踪我们的
{\fs12}How'd you guys track us?

976
00:48:17,384 --> 00:48:18,606
我们把包扔进灌木丛
{\fs12}We threw your bag in prickle bushes.

977
00:48:18,793 --> 00:48:22,718
笨蛋 你自己说 没有天雷滚滚号 你就完了
{\fs12}Dumbass, you told us that your life would be over if you didn't get a BD Rolling Thunder,

978
00:48:22,796 --> 00:48:26,587
这家店 儿童骑车最远到此了 -好
{\fs12}and this is the only place a child could get to on a tricycle. - Okay.

979
00:48:26,667 --> 00:48:28,717
我有药 无人机给我
{\fs12}I have the drugs. Now give me the drone.

980
00:48:32,772 --> 00:48:34,328
开什么玩笑
{\fs12}Are you fucking kidding me?

981
00:48:36,554 --> 00:48:39,026
这什么鬼 软糖维生素而已
{\fs12}What in the actual fuck? These are just gummy vitamins.

982
00:48:39,103 --> 00:48:40,566
妈的 -早就说她会检查
{\fs12}Shit. - Told you she was gonna check.

984
00:48:41,815 --> 00:48:43,631
在哪儿 -警察拿了
{\fs12}Where is it? - A cop has it.

985
00:48:43,708 --> 00:48:46,232
你把药给了警察
{\fs12}You gave our drugs to a cop?

986
00:48:46,311 --> 00:48:47,398
等下 听着
{\fs12}Wait. Look.

987
00:48:47,476 --> 00:48:49,000
我知道你不认识我们
{\fs12}I know you don't know us

988
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:50,566
认为我们是傻小子
{\fs12}and you think we're just stupid kids,

989
00:48:50,788 --> 00:48:51,776
但听我说
{\fs12}but just listen to me.

990
00:48:51,857 --> 00:48:53,478
不管你们有什么问题
{\fs12}Whatever problems you're having,

991
00:48:53,558 --> 00:48:54,846
吃药不是答案
{\fs12}drugs are not the answer.

992
00:48:55,743 --> 00:48:57,850
毒品只能给你虚假的现实感
{\fs12}Drugs just give you a false sense of reality.

993
00:48:57,929 --> 00:48:59,852
也许你自认生活糟糕
{\fs12}You may think your lives are bad,

994
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:02,714
但你有家人和朋友爱你
{\fs12}but you have family and friends who love you.

995
00:49:02,793 --> 00:49:03,781
你能闭嘴吗
{\fs12}Can you shut the fuck up?

996
00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:06,089
我刚花了600买了无人机
{\fs12}I just spent $600 on a fucking drone.

997
00:49:06,169 --> 00:49:08,178
你毁了我的激情演讲
{\fs12}You ruined my passionate moment.

998
00:49:08,255 --> 00:49:10,522
太蠢了 -今天算是完了
{\fs12}Well, it was stupid. - This day is fucked.

999
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:12,285
只有本吉手里有莫莉
{\fs12}Benji is the only one who has Molly,

1000
00:49:12,363 --> 00:49:13,462
他不会卖给我们的
{\fs12}and he won't sell it to us.

1001
00:49:14,026 --> 00:49:14,997
我好抱歉
{\fs12}Okay. Well, I'm sorry.

1002
00:49:15,078 --> 00:49:15,859
我们完了
{\fs12}We're fucked.

1003
00:49:16,612 --> 00:49:19,363
交给我们 我们去拿回药
{\fs12}We'll do it. We'll get your drugs.

1004
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:22,808
鬼才去 -你又在干什么
{\fs12}The fuck we will. - What the hell, dude?

1005
00:49:23,401 --> 00:49:24,706
他会卖药给儿童吗
{\fs12}Do you think he would sell to kids?

1006
00:49:24,787 --> 00:49:26,408
我们不是儿童
{\fs12}We're not kids.

1007
00:49:26,489 --> 00:49:27,577
我们是少年
{\fs12}We're tweens.

1008
00:49:28,203 --> 00:49:29,671
反正我们也没损失
{\fs12}What do we have to lose?

1009
00:49:32,061 --> 00:49:33,752
成交吗
{\fs12}So, it's a deal?

1010
00:49:35,532 --> 00:49:36,920
麦克斯 疯了
{\fs12}Max, this is fucking insane.

1011
00:49:37,415 --> 00:49:39,173
你去受罚
{\fs12}Just take your goddamn punishment.

1012
00:49:39,251 --> 00:49:40,689
卢卡斯和我去参趴
{\fs12}Lucas and I will go to the party.

1013
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,793
我们会阻止任何人靠近柏丽
{\fs12}We'll cock-block anyone that gets near Brixlee.

1014
00:49:44,156 --> 00:49:45,354
他们没有邀请你
{\fs12}They didn't invite you.

1015
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:47,322
什么
{\fs12}What?

1016
00:49:48,224 --> 00:49:50,158
万人迷只邀请了我
{\fs12}The popular kids only invited me.

1017
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:52,033
你是什么意思
{\fs12}What do you mean?

1018
00:49:52,113 --> 00:49:54,903
他们认为你有点不着调
{\fs12}They think you're kind of... random.

1019
00:49:55,767 --> 00:49:57,038
但没事的
{\fs12}Oh. - But it's okay,

1020
00:49:57,118 --> 00:49:59,101
因为一旦那些人熟悉你
{\fs12}'cause once those guys get to know you,

1021
00:49:59,179 --> 00:50:01,236
他们视你会如我 你没有不着调
{\fs12}they'll see what I see, that you're not random.

1022

你好独特
{\fs12}That you're specific.

1023

{\fs12}I'll do all the talking. I just need your height in there.

1026
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,179
我们之中唯有你 像是大学生
{\fs12}You're the only one of us that looks like they could be in college.

1027
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:14,209
各位
{\fs12}Guys.

1028
00:50:15,022 --> 00:50:16,947
干还是不干
{\fs12}Are you in or out?

1029
00:50:18,784 --> 00:50:21,173
你们的目的 是为了亲嘴趴
{\fs12}So, you guys did all of this for a kissing party?

1030
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,607
不 那里也有很酷的男生
{\fs12}No. There's also gonna be cool boys there.

1031
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,749
我记得我第一次亲嘴趴
{\fs12}I remember my first kissing party.

1032
00:50:26,055 --> 00:50:28,854
那是马努斯·帕特尔家 六年级后的暑假
{\fs12}It was the summer after sixth grade at Manush Patel's house.

1033
00:50:28,934 --> 00:50:30,021
你亲谁了
{\fs12}Who'd you kiss?

1034
00:50:30,102 --> 00:50:31,691
马努什的妹妹
{\fs12}Uh, Manush's sister.

1035

等下子 你没同去吗
{\fs12}Wait, you weren't there?

1036
00:50:34,195 --> 00:50:35,558
没去 我们那会儿还不熟
{\fs12}No, we didn't really know each other then.

1037
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:37,429
虽同一年级
{\fs12}I mean, we were in the same grade,

1038
00:50:37,507 --> 00:50:39,430
但直到八年级 我们才亲密
{\fs12}but we didn't really become close until eighth grade.

1039
00:50:40,056 --> 00:50:43,202
我以为你们早就认识了
{\fs12}Oh. I just figured you guys knew each other for longer.

1040
00:50:43,281 --> 00:50:45,470
对 最好的朋友都在幼儿园
{\fs12}Yeah, everybody knows you meet your best friends in kindergarten.

1041
00:50:45,748 --> 00:50:49,608
你们成了朋友 只是因为住的近
{\fs12}The only reason you're friends with people back then is 'cause you live close to each other.

1042
00:50:49,687 --> 00:50:51,176
或因为 你们父母是朋友
{\fs12}Or, because, like, your parents are friends.

1043
00:50:51,255 --> 00:50:52,979
不 我们不是这样的
{\fs12}No. That's not true for us.

1044
00:50:53,057 --> 00:50:54,980
我们是朋友 是因为我们相互喜欢
{\fs12}We're friends because we like each other.

1045
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:58,650
我们住的也很近 -我们父母是朋友
{\fs12}And we live close together. - And our parents are friends.

00:57:02,802 --> 00:57:04,524
好 给我就行
{\fs12}Okay, just-just give it to me.

1147
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:12,249
你们还超屌的
{\fs12}Wow, you guys are little badasses.

1148
00:57:12,642 --> 00:57:14,864
因为我们是精豆小子
{\fs12}'Cause we're the Bean Bag Boys.

1149
00:57:15,537 --> 00:57:16,702
什么意思
{\fs12}I don't know what that means.

1150
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,235
我们小而弥坚
{\fs12}We have beanbags.

1151
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:21,973
是真货
{\fs12}It's been real, guys.

1152
00:57:23,151 --> 00:57:24,940
亲嘴趴开心
{\fs12}Have fun at your kissing party.

1153
00:57:25,019 --> 00:57:26,341
谢谢
{\fs12}Thank you.

1154
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,218
还1.7英里远
{\fs12}Oh. We're only 1.7 miles away.

1155
00:57:37,323 --> 00:57:38,152
怎么了
{\fs12}What's wrong?

1156
00:57:38,231 --> 00:57:39,421
我们拿到了无人机 一切解决
{\fs12}We got the drone. Everything worked out.

1157
00:57:39,501 --> 00:57:40,456
麦克斯
{\fs12}Max.

1158
00:57:41,269 --> 00:57:43,460
我脸上挨了一拳 好吗
{\fs12}I got punched in the fucking face, okay?

1159
00:57:44,205 --> 00:57:45,728
我们买了毒
{\fs12}We bought drugs.

1160
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:48,294
现在能回家吗
{\fs12}Can we just go home now?

1161
00:57:59,951 --> 00:58:01,643
兄弟们 是我爸
{\fs12}Guys, it's my dad.

1162
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,008
爸
{\fs12}Hey, Dad.

1163
00:58:04,089 --> 00:58:05,378
我提早上飞机
{\fs12}Hey, buddy. I got on the early flight,

1164
00:58:05,459 --> 00:58:07,448
我15分钟后到家
{\fs12}so I'll be home in 15 minutes.

1165
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:10,149
15分钟后 还是延误15分钟
{\fs12}15 minutes from now or 15 minutes from later?

1166
00:58:10,229 --> 00:58:11,920
哈哈 好笑
{\fs12}Ha-ha, funny guy.

1167
00:58:11,997 --> 00:58:13,386
一会儿见
{\fs12}I'll see you soon.

1168
00:58:14,401 --> 00:58:16,222
我爸15分钟后就到家
{\fs12}My dad will be home in 15 minutes.

1169
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,791
也许他不会注意到无人机不见了
{\fs12}M-Maybe he won't notice that the drone's gone.

1170
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:20,794
他会注意到的 他很细心
{\fs12}He'll notice. He's very observant.

1171
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,797
所以我妈爱上他
{\fs12}That's why my mom fell in love with him.

1172
00:58:23,508 --> 00:58:25,431
无人机必须在你爸之前到家
{\fs12}The drone has to be home before your dad.

1173
00:58:26,468 --> 00:58:27,298
我知道
{\fs12}I know.

1174
00:58:27,377 --> 00:58:29,734
只无人机 不是你
{\fs12}Just the drone. Not you.

1175
00:58:30,166 --> 00:58:31,771
只无人机
{\fs12}Just the drone.

1176
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:37,141
好
{\fs12}Okay.

1177
00:58:41,324 --> 00:58:42,113
来吧
{\fs12}Here we go.

1178
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:44,348
爽
{\fs12}Yes! - Yes!

1179
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:50,055
小心 -我知道
{\fs12}Careful. - I got this, I got this. Oh!

1180
00:58:52,133 --> 00:58:53,424
像风一样飞 麦克斯
{\fs12}Fly like the wind, Max.

1181
00:58:54,569 --> 00:58:56,627
此处右转
{\fs12}Yeah, uh, take a right up here.

1182
00:58:58,964 --> 00:59:00,528
我能看见你家 -就在那儿
{\fs12}I can see your house. - There it is. There it is.

1183
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,496
窗户关着
{\fs12}The windows are closed.

1184
00:59:02,576 --> 00:59:04,468
该怎么办 -走烟囱
{\fs12}Shit. What do I do? - The chimney.

1185
00:59:10,352 --> 00:59:12,776
非常窄 -你能行
{\fs12}It's very tight. - You got this.

1186
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,475
该死 我看不见
{\fs12}Shit! I can't see. I can't see.

1187
00:59:14,556 --> 00:59:16,379
摄像头沾了灰
{\fs12}There's ash all over the camera.

1188
00:59:16,457 --> 00:59:17,511
使用原力
{\fs12}Use the Force.

1189
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:18,778
不不 我能做到
{\fs12}No, no, I can do this. - Uh...

1190
00:59:18,859 --> 00:59:19,747
我熟我家
{\fs12}I know my house perfectly.

1191
00:59:19,828 --> 00:59:21,784
我闭眼都行 -好
{\fs12}I can do this with my eyes closed. - Okay.

1192
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:23,316
别搞破坏
{\fs12}Don't break anything.

1193
00:59:23,397 --> 00:59:25,220
信我 我行
{\fs12}Trust me, I got this.

1194
00:59:42,313 --> 00:59:44,169
耶 -你做到了
{\fs12}Yeah! - You did it! You got it!

1195
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:46,240
耶 -我是最佳飞行员
{\fs12}Yes! - I'm the best pilot ever!

1196
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:47,406
耶
{\fs12}Yes!

1197
00:59:56,327 --> 00:59:57,648
我们是成功了 -是
{\fs12}I think we did it. - Yeah.

1198
00:59:57,729 --> 00:59:59,520
任务完成
{\fs12}Mission accomplished.

1199
01:00:00,856 --> 01:00:01,754
爸
{\fs12}Hey, Dad.

1200
01:00:02,734 --> 01:00:04,230
你安全回家了吗
{\fs12}Did you get home safe?

1201
01:00:04,468 --> 01:00:07,091
我居然信任你
{\fs12}Cannot believe I trusted you!

1202
01:00:07,169 --> 01:00:08,224
我明确告诉你
{\fs12}I explicitly told you,

1203
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:09,493
别碰无人机
{\fs12}do not touch the drone! - Uh-huh.

1204
01:00:09,574 --> 01:00:12,263
天哪 -我爱你
{\fs12}Oh, my God. - I love you.

1205
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:13,532
爸
{\fs12}Dad?

1206
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:17,100
爸 请回说"我爱你"
{\fs12}Dad, please... say "I love you" back.

1207
01:00:17,605 --> 01:00:18,770
我想听
{\fs12}I need to hear it.

1208
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,005
喂
{\fs12}Hello?

1209
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:26,642
我爸说我被禁足了
{\fs12}My dad said that I'm grounded.

1210
01:00:27,113 --> 01:00:29,512
我再也不能亲柏丽了
{\fs12}Now I'm never gonna be able to kiss Brixlee.

1211
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:32,181
没事的 麦克斯 会有其他趴的
{\fs12}It's okay, Max. There'll be other parties.

1212
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:34,584
卢卡斯 你不明白 -他是对的 卢卡斯
{\fs12}Lucas, you don't get it. - He's right, Lucas.

1213
01:00:34,663 --> 01:00:36,319
这次趴会改变我们的生活
{\fs12}This party could change our lives,

1214
01:00:36,397 --> 01:00:37,585
你却不在乎
{\fs12}and you don't even care.

1215
01:00:37,666 --> 01:00:39,356
一点也不酷
{\fs12}It's not cool at all.

1216
01:00:39,434 --> 01:00:41,190
你会知道什么不酷
{\fs12}Yeah, you would know what's not cool.

1217
01:00:41,268 --> 01:00:42,523
几个意思
{\fs12}What the fuck does that mean?

1218
01:00:42,604 --> 01:00:44,460
去啜啤酒 奶嘴娃
{\fs12}Go sip a beer, Sippy Cup.

1219
01:00:44,539 --> 01:00:47,462
我喜欢啤酒 所以我会去
{\fs12}I love beer, so yes, I will.

1220
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:50,000
你自以为成熟 但事实是
{\fs12}And you may think you're so mature, but the truth is

1221
01:00:50,078 --> 01:00:52,368
你没有阴毛 我有六根
{\fs12}you don't have pubes, and I have six.

1222
01:00:53,037 --> 01:00:56,471
你说有阴毛还喝啤酒 我知道你没有
{\fs12}You say you have pubes, but you also say you drink beer, and I know you don't.

1223
01:00:56,549 --> 01:00:57,871
别吵了
{\fs12}Stop arguing!

1224
01:00:57,951 --> 01:01:01,208
承认你不去试演 是因为你觉得很逊
{\fs12}Just admit you skipped the audition because you thought it wasn't cool

1225
01:01:01,287 --> 01:01:02,867
虽然你有天赐声线
{\fs12}even though your voice is a fucking gift.

1226
01:01:02,946 --> 01:01:05,678
你总大放厥词 却一无是处
{\fs12}And you always talk a big game, and you never back it up.

1227
01:01:05,758 --> 01:01:08,247
如同高速公路那次 -抱歉
{\fs12}Like on the freeway. - Oh, sorry.

1228
01:01:08,328 --> 01:01:11,688
我不想穿过12条车道 只为你亲小骚货
{\fs12}I didn't want to cross 12 lanes of traffic so you can kiss some skank.

1229
01:01:12,398 --> 01:01:14,187
该死 -她不是骚货
{\fs12}Oh, shit. - She's not a skank.

1230
01:01:14,266 --> 01:01:16,189
她是我一生挚爱 你收回此话
{\fs12}She's the love of my life. You take that back!

1231
01:01:16,266 --> 01:01:17,588
禁止空手道
{\fs12}Hey, no karate.

1232
01:01:18,195 --> 01:01:19,592
别打了
{\fs12}Stop fighting!

1233
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:22,259
你不该称女人为"骚货"
{\fs12}You should never call a woman a skank.

1234
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:25,196
你不该乱称呼女人
{\fs12}You should never call a woman anything.

1235
01:01:26,068 --> 01:01:27,264
还有你
{\fs12}And you...

1236
01:01:27,344 --> 01:01:30,234
你让我们逃学 带着毒品到处跑
{\fs12}You made us ditch school, run around with drugs,

1237
01:01:30,314 --> 01:01:35,473
还把警察锁在便利店 用假阳具当门栓
{\fs12}and lock a cop in a convenience store with what I now suspect is a dildo!

1238
01:01:37,064 --> 01:01:39,812
你看什么 甘道夫
{\fs12}What the fuck are you looking at, Gandalf?!

1239
01:01:40,514 --> 01:01:42,479
你们屁都不懂
{\fs12}You guys don't understand shit.

1240
01:01:42,558 --> 01:01:44,448
我体内有荷尔蒙
{\fs12}I have hormones flowing through my body,

1241
01:01:44,527 --> 01:01:46,183
逼我疯狂
{\fs12}making me do crazy things.

1242
01:01:46,263 --> 01:01:51,356
你们明白用树来摩擦的感受吗
{\fs12}Do you even know what it feels like to want to rub up against a tree all the time?

1243
01:01:51,435 --> 01:01:52,456
你以为好过我们
{\fs12}You think you're better than us.

1244
01:01:52,534 --> 01:01:54,292
不是好过 是更成熟
{\fs12}Not better, just more mature.

1245
01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:56,627
我喜欢浪漫 喜欢当大人
{\fs12}I'm into romance and grown-up shit,

1246
01:01:56,706 --> 01:01:58,797
你们还很幼齿
{\fs12}and you guys are still into little kid stuff.

1247
01:01:58,875 --> 01:02:00,799
我们如何还能是朋友
{\fs12}I don't even know why we're still friends.

1248
01:02:28,335 --> 01:02:31,661
现在取消你的一切最爱
{\fs12}Everything you like is now canceled.

1249
01:02:31,738 --> 01:02:35,229
生日被取消 假期被取消
{\fs12}Birthdays are canceled. Holidays are canceled.

1250
01:02:35,565 --> 01:02:37,299
取消所有暑假
{\fs12}Summers, canceled.

1251
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:38,634
寒假要来了
{\fs12}Winter is coming.

1252
01:02:38,812 --> 01:02:40,601
抱歉 爸 -不不不
{\fs12}I'm sorry, Daddy. - No, no, no.

1253
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,706
你不能再喊我为爸
{\fs12}You are no longer allowed to call me Daddy.

1254
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:46,249
叫我安德鲁 或纽曼先生 或典狱长
{\fs12}Call me Andrew or Mr. Newman or Warden.

1255
01:02:46,743 --> 01:02:49,976
你那天使小脸底下 魔鬼在其中
{\fs12}Underneath that cherubic face, Devil lives inside you.

1256
01:02:50,981 --> 01:02:54,417
我会永远爱你 因为你是我儿子
{\fs12}I will always love you because you are my son,

1257
01:02:55,721 --> 01:02:57,680
但我不再喜欢你了
{\fs12}but I no longer like you.

1258
01:03:04,469 --> 01:03:08,462
索尔 我刚和麦克斯母亲通电话
{\fs12}Thorny. I just got off the phone with Max's mom.

1259
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:12,562
你知道他逃学还擅自骑车去商场吗
{\fs12}Did you know he skipped school and biked to the mall by himself?

1260
01:03:13,068 --> 01:03:14,331
他说的吗 -对
{\fs12}He said that? - He did.

1261
01:03:14,669 --> 01:03:18,302
答应我 你永远别犯那种蠢 好吗
{\fs12}Promise me you'll never do something as stupid as that, okay?

1262
01:03:18,381 --> 01:03:19,638
我保证
{\fs12}I-I promise.

1263
01:03:23,263 --> 01:03:24,808
我们穿越高速公路
{\fs12}And then we ran across the highway,

1264
01:03:24,887 --> 01:03:26,443
我手臂脱臼
{\fs12}my arm got ripped out,

1265
01:03:26,523 --> 01:03:29,147
有个假女人弹出车外
{\fs12}and a fake woman shot out of a car.

1266
01:03:29,459 --> 01:03:30,914
但性药还在我们手里
{\fs12}But we still got the drugs.

1267
01:03:30,993 --> 01:03:32,784
但后来 我们用药换了无人机
{\fs12}But then we traded the drone for it,

1268
01:03:32,862 --> 01:03:34,777
麦克斯毁了他自己家
{\fs12}and-and Max destroyed his house with it.

1269
01:03:34,854 --> 01:03:37,419
所有这一切只因他想娶柏丽
{\fs12}But it was only because he wanted to marry Brixlee,

1270
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,756
现在他娶不成了 因为他被永久禁足
{\fs12}and now he can't because he's grounded for life.

1271
01:03:39,834 --> 01:03:41,090
我们大吵一顿
{\fs12}And we got into a huge fight,

1272
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:42,691
精豆小子解散
{\fs12}and the Bean Bag Boys are broke up, and...

1273
01:03:42,772 --> 01:03:44,561
我有没有麻烦 -好 儿子
{\fs12}Am I in trouble? - Okay, son.

1274
01:03:44,637 --> 01:03:48,865
现在听着 我也喜欢嘴炮说故事 好吗
{\fs12}Now, look, I love a good story with a bunch of gibberish just as much as anybody, okay?

1275
01:03:48,944 --> 01:03:50,700
我知你正经历压力期
{\fs12}And I know you're going through a stressful time.

1276
01:03:50,778 --> 01:03:53,301
但这不足以你对我们扯谎
{\fs12}But it doesn't give you a reason to tell us fibs.

1277
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:54,601
我没扯谎
{\fs12}I'm not fibbing.

1278
01:03:54,679 --> 01:03:56,839
我百分百肯定你扯谎
{\fs12}I'm 100% sure you're fibbing to me.

1279
01:03:56,918 --> 01:04:00,411
我没扯谎 -好 我都明白了
{\fs12}I'm not fibbing. - Okay. I think I understand what's happening here.

1280
01:04:00,721 --> 01:04:02,210
你以为你失去了我们
{\fs12}You think you're losing us,

1281
01:04:02,723 --> 01:04:05,412
现在你担心还会失去朋友
{\fs12}and now you're worried you're gonna lose your friends, too.

1282
01:04:05,917 --> 01:04:06,880
看我
{\fs12}Look at me, man.

1283
01:04:06,961 --> 01:04:08,751
我们会永远在 对吗 我是说 看看
{\fs12}We'll always be there, right? I mean, and look,

1284
01:04:08,827 --> 01:04:09,550
别误会我
{\fs12}don't get me wrong.

1285
01:04:09,628 --> 01:04:12,651
我和你妈 不同于初初相见那会儿了
{\fs12}You know, me and your mom are not the same people we were when we first met.

1286
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,189
有时想分开
{\fs12}Tend to grow apart sometimes.

1287
01:04:15,269 --> 01:04:16,557
但没事的
{\fs12}But-but it's okay.

1288
01:04:16,904 --> 01:04:18,424
还记得你的寄居蟹吗
{\fs12}You remember your hermit crab?

1289
01:04:18,504 --> 01:04:20,761
赫尔曼? 记得 -对 赫尔曼
{\fs12}Herman? Yeah. - That's right. Herman.

1290
01:04:20,839 --> 01:04:23,628
还记得它为什么死吗 -那个混...
{\fs12}And you remember why he died? - Oh, son of a...

1291
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:25,433
你说蟹逃了的
{\fs12}You told me he ran away!

1292
01:04:25,511 --> 01:04:28,167
没错 它是逃了 但后来死了
{\fs12}Technically, yes, he ran away, but then he died.

1293
01:04:28,246 --> 01:04:29,763
天哪 怎么死的
{\fs12}Oh, my gosh. How?

1294
01:04:29,843 --> 01:04:33,509
赫尔曼之死 是因为寄居蟹长大了
{\fs12}Herman died because hermit crabs grow out of their shells,

1295
01:04:33,585 --> 01:04:35,243
它们得找新壳
{\fs12}and they need to find new,

1296
01:04:35,321 --> 01:04:37,711
海滩上 有更大的贝壳可供居住
{\fs12}bigger seashells on the beach to grow into,

1297
01:04:37,823 --> 01:04:39,513
不然会死 基本如此
{\fs12}or they die, and we didn't know that.

1298
01:04:39,591 --> 01:04:42,049
赫尔曼是因你们而死的?
{\fs12}So, Herman died because of you guys?

1299
01:04:42,127 --> 01:04:43,748
重点是
{\fs12}The point is...

1300
01:04:43,827 --> 01:04:46,219
你和你朋友在成长变化
{\fs12}you and your friends are growing and changing,

1301
01:04:46,298 --> 01:04:48,187
你们都要找更大的壳
{\fs12}and y'all need to find bigger shells.

1302
01:04:48,264 --> 01:04:49,754
这并没错
{\fs12}And there's nothing wrong with that.

1303
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,691
你得怪宠物店主
{\fs12}Okay, look, you need to blame those pet store owners,

1304
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:57,773
因为他们没教怎么养好寄居蟹
{\fs12}okay, because they did not give us the information about hermit crabs...

1305
01:05:11,187 --> 01:05:12,476
我是卢卡斯
{\fs12}It's Lucas.

1306
01:05:14,381 --> 01:05:15,644
你吓屎我了
{\fs12}You scared the shit out of me.

1307
01:05:15,723 --> 01:05:17,748
我不想你父母看到我脸
{\fs12}I didn't want your parents to see my face.

1308
01:05:18,893 --> 01:05:20,115
你为什么来
{\fs12}Why are you even here?

1309
01:05:20,195 --> 01:05:22,453
刚才两小时 我成熟了很多
{\fs12}I've grown a lot in the last two hours.

1310
01:05:22,531 --> 01:05:24,621
我父母离婚 确实的改变了我
{\fs12}My parents' divorce has really changed me.

1311
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:26,981
如果精豆小子不一起成长
{\fs12}If the Bean Bag Boys don't grow together,

1312
01:05:27,059 --> 01:05:28,122
就得分开
{\fs12}they'll grow apart.

1313
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:29,756
我不想那样
{\fs12}I don't want that.

1314
01:05:30,697 --> 01:05:32,562
我不想和你离婚
{\fs12}I don't want to get a divorce from you.

1315
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,696
那你得去索伦的趴
{\fs12}Then you need to go to Soren's party.

1316
01:05:34,774 --> 01:05:37,531
你偷溜出去 -我不能 我被禁足
{\fs12}You need to sneak out. - I can't. I'm grounded.

1317
01:05:37,611 --> 01:05:39,867
此外 柏丽的项链还在窑里
{\fs12}Besides, Brixlee's necklace is still in the kiln.

1318
01:05:39,946 --> 01:05:41,837
项链交给我
{\fs12}Let me worry about the necklace.

1319
01:05:41,915 --> 01:05:44,506
你父母能怎样 双重禁足你么
{\fs12}And what are your parents gonna do, double-ground you?

1320
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,011
柏丽到底是不是你的永远
{\fs12}Is Brixlee your forever or not?

1321
01:05:49,682 --> 01:05:51,705
那你现在跟我走
{\fs12}Then you need to come with me now.

1322
01:05:52,283 --> 01:05:55,447
好 我去 但我不向索尔道歉
{\fs12}Fine, I'll go, but I'm not apologizing to Thor.

1323
01:05:55,528 --> 01:05:57,553
他不来了 -很好
{\fs12}He's not coming. - Good.

1324
01:05:58,529 --> 01:06:00,152
操那个婊子
{\fs12}Fuck that bitch.

1325
01:06:00,231 --> 01:06:01,720
我去拿外套
{\fs12}I'll go get my jacket.

1326
01:06:02,767 --> 01:06:04,758
麦克斯 -怎么
{\fs12}Hey, Max. - Yeah?

1327
01:06:05,203 --> 01:06:06,592
带上鸡巴
{\fs12}Bring that dick.

1328
01:06:12,976 --> 01:06:15,833
你说索尔不来的
{\fs12}You said Thor wasn't coming.

1329
01:06:15,914 --> 01:06:17,074
他来是闹哪样
{\fs12}What the hell is he doing here?

1330
01:06:17,153 --> 01:06:18,546
你们俩 由我监管
{\fs12}I Parent-Trapped your asses.

1331
01:06:18,626 --> 01:06:21,685
瞧 现在我们共享一具更大的寄居蟹壳
{\fs12}See, now we're all in a bigger hermit crab shell together.

1332
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,776
我终于理解父母的话了
{\fs12}It made sense when my parents said it.

1333
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:26,777
所以你是怪我们
{\fs12}So, you took the blame for us, huh?

1334
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:30,582
对 我预测了你 然后反其道行之
{\fs12}Yeah. I thought about what you would do, and did the opposite.

1335
01:06:30,913 --> 01:06:33,585
这趴 将是史诗狂欢
{\fs12}This party, it's gonna be an epic rager.

1336
01:06:33,897 --> 01:06:35,152
好的 奶嘴娃
{\fs12}Okay, Sippy Cup.

1337
01:06:35,232 --> 01:06:37,024
别阻挡我 麦生棉条
{\fs12}Just stay out of my way, Maxi Pad.

1338
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,057
(Maxi Pad 一种卫生棉条)

1339
01:06:48,955 --> 01:06:51,567
可爱仔喔
{\fs12}Aw, don't you boys look cute.

1340
01:06:51,646 --> 01:06:53,338
大家都在地下室
{\fs12}Everybody's in the basement.

1341
01:06:53,416 --> 01:06:55,771
我都不想知下面什么场面
{\fs12}I don't even want to know what's going on down there.

1342
01:06:55,850 --> 01:06:57,406
进来吧 小伙子们
{\fs12}Come on in, fellas.

1343
01:06:57,976 --> 01:06:59,307
嗨

1346
01:07:24,936 --> 01:07:27,170
麦克斯 她是柏丽
{\fs12}Max, I want you to meet Brixlee.

1347
01:07:27,814 --> 01:07:29,805

1349
01:07:32,877 --> 01:07:34,642
很高兴终于见到你
{\fs12}It's nice to finally meet you.

1350
01:07:35,179 --> 01:07:35,842

{\fs12}Cool jacket.

1352
01:07:38,215 --> 01:07:39,146

{\fs12}Thank you.

1353
01:07:39,223 --> 01:07:42,213
我一个人选的 和我妈
{\fs12}I got it all by myself, with my mom.

1354
01:07:42,694 --> 01:07:45,084
我也和妈妈一起购物
{\fs12}I go shopping with my mom, too.

1355
01:07:46,089 --> 01:07:47,653
春风得意啊
{\fs12}This is going so well.

1356
01:07:49,459 --> 01:07:50,958
你带了项链吗
{\fs12}Did you bring the necklace?

1357
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:54,728
柏丽 这是给你的
{\fs12}Brixlee, this is for you.

1358
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:57,597
谢谢 很漂亮
{\fs12}Oh, thanks. It's pretty.

1359
01:07:57,942 --> 01:07:58,996
这些是铝珠
{\fs12}They're an-al.

1360
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,596
奇妙
{\fs12}Ooh, fancy.

1361
01:08:04,037 --> 01:08:05,902
我以后再戴
{\fs12}I'm gonna wear this later.

1362
01:08:05,982 --> 01:08:07,105
谢了 麦克斯
{\fs12}Thanks, Max.

1363
01:08:07,717 --> 01:08:09,974
如何呀 奶嘴娃
{\fs12}What's up, Sippy Cup?

1364
01:08:11,178 --> 01:08:12,167
还行
{\fs12}Not much.

1365
01:08:12,245 --> 01:08:16,114
和一堆人干架 还偷了啤酒
{\fs12}Just, uh, got into a fight with a bunch of men and, uh, stole a beer.

1366
01:08:17,584 --> 01:08:20,050
奶嘴娃不会喝的
{\fs12}There's no way Sippy Cup is gonna drink it.

1367
01:08:20,854 --> 01:08:22,686
我不仅要喝
{\fs12}Not only am I gonna drink it,

1368
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,589
还要打破纪录
{\fs12}I'm gonna break the record.

1369
01:08:26,192 --> 01:08:28,092
我要喝四口
{\fs12}I'm gonna take four sips.

1370
01:08:28,169 --> 01:08:29,725
四口 不可能
{\fs12}Four is impossible.

1371
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:32,327
索伦都破不了四 -闭嘴
{\fs12}Soren can't even do four. - Shut up.

1372
01:08:33,532 --> 01:08:34,296
喝
{\fs12}Drink.

1373
01:08:51,959 --> 01:08:53,147
一
{\fs12}That's one.

1374
01:08:53,952 --> 01:08:55,652
小事儿
{\fs12}Big deal.

1375
01:08:58,523 --> 01:08:59,755
二
{\fs12}That's two.

1376
01:09:00,966 --> 01:09:02,089
继续
{\fs12}Mm-kay.

1377
01:09:07,939 --> 01:09:09,160
三
{\fs12}That's three!

1378
01:09:09,666 --> 01:09:10,996
疯了吧
{\fs12}This is insane.

1379
01:09:12,411 --> 01:09:13,367
他会吐的
{\fs12}He's gonna barf.

1380
01:09:13,447 --> 01:09:15,170
来人 拿奶嘴给他
{\fs12}Somebody get him a sippy cup.

1381
01:09:15,705 --> 01:09:17,905
奶嘴娃 奶嘴娃
{\fs12}Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup!

1382

{\fs12}Oh, fuck!

1387
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,649
索尔 索尔 索尔 索尔
{\fs12}Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor!

1388
01:09:32,728 --> 01:09:34,651
索尔 索尔 索尔
{\fs12}Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor!

1389
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:36,854
我是死酒鬼
{\fs12}I'm a fucking alcoholic!

1390
01:09:39,702 --> 01:09:40,256
不会吧
{\fs12}No way!

1391
01:09:40,335 --> 01:09:42,258
四口 猛啊
{\fs12}Four sips. Badass.

1392
01:09:42,636 --> 01:09:43,894
敬索尔
{\fs12}Mad respect to Thor.

1393
01:09:44,732 --> 01:09:45,762
看过来
{\fs12}Eyes up here.

1394
01:09:46,114 --> 01:09:48,545
不同意亲嘴 没问题
{\fs12}If you don't consent to kissing, that's cool.

1395
01:09:49,003 --> 01:09:50,734
你可以上楼打电玩
{\fs12}You can go play VR upstairs.

1396
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:52,235
但如果你留下
{\fs12}But if you're staying down here,

1397
01:09:52,572 --> 01:09:53,537
