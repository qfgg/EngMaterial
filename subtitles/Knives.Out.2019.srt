00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,780
你们关系非常好
You two were very close.

148
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,280
我们俩有专属的秘密沟通方式
We... We had our own secret way of communicating.

149
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,590
每个人都会有和爸爸相处的秘诀
I mean, you had to find that with dad.

150
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,790
得有个可以跟他一起玩的游戏
You had to find a game to play with him,

151

要是你找到了  并且遵守他的规则...
and if you did that, and you played by his rules...

Everyone idolizes their dad, right?

154
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,400
我不知道  是吗

也不尽然
Very much not.

156
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,980
不知道我刚刚为什么这么说
Don't know why I said that.

157

但我妻子  琳达  就是这样

哈兰用一部生锈的打字机开始了写作

你父亲的出版公司是你在经营吗

他笔下的情节就像...

我就不给你剧透了  但是...
Like, I won't spoil it for you but...

177
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,290
就比如《千支利刃》

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,620
还有《奶牛和猎枪》

爸爸说这些情节

都是完整地从他脑中蹦出来的

182
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,230
这对他来说很容易
It was the easy part for him.

183
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,070
你当晚也在场  对吗

184
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,870
你们可能都是差不多时间到的

我们都是八点左右到的
We all got here around 8:00.

我妻子  唐娜  她是我的主心骨
My wife, Donna, she's my rock.

在政治方面非常活跃

那孩子就是个不折不扣的纳粹
The boy is literally a Nazi.

191
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,990
他就是个另类右派键盘侠
He's an alt-right troll dipshit.

192
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,760
现在的孩子有了互联网  都非同小可
Kids today with the Internet, it's amazing.

193
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,300
所以那晚一切都挺好的
So the night went well?

194
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,270
我们当然都很伤心  但是
I mean, we're all gutted, but,

195
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,300
我很高兴能跟他一起度过那样一晚
I was happy to have that night with him.

196
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,010
能陪在他身边  回想我们的书

197
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,040
以及我们凭借它们赢得的一切
and what we've accomplished with them.

198
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,610
我仿佛还能感觉到他的手放在我的肩膀上
It's like I can still feel his hand on my shoulder.

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,580
把他的火炬传承给我

Harlan Thrombey's daughter-in-law?

203
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,990
是的  我嫁给了他儿子  尼尔
Yeah, I married his son, Neil.

我们有一个女儿  梅格

后来  尼尔十五年前去世了
And then Neil passed on 15 years ago.

206
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,360
但你仍然跟斯隆贝家的人很亲近
But you remained close to the Thrombeys?

207
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,600
他们就是我的家人

208

他们既让我感到自由

又让我感到被支持着

210
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,920
这种对立的平衡正是弗拉姆的可贵之处
It's that balance of opposites that's the nugget of Flam.

211
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,080

是的  是做护肤的
Yeah, it's skincare,

216

但它推崇的是一整套生活方式

这就是弗拉姆

但它也是哈兰的理念

So by "manner of death," you mean if someone killed him?

00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,600
可能是我们中的一个杀了他

布兰克先生不是警局的人
Mr. Blanc is not with the police department

也没有正式参与这个案子

但他会作为顾问提供意见

00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,690
应该是吧
I guess.

285
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,790
哈兰雇她待在身边
Harlan hired her to be around to take care

286
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,790
以应对各种医疗需求
of whatever medical needs popped up.

287
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,190
但说实话  她就像我们家的一员
But really, she's like part of the family.

288
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,600
她是个好女孩
Good kid.

289
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,500
也成了哈兰的好友
Been a good friend to Harlan.

290
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,300
家里是从巴拉圭来的
Family's from Paraguay.

291
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,000
琳达非常赞赏她的职业操守
Linda really likes her work ethic.

292
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,870
"我们移民  干活很靠谱"
"Immigrants. We get the job done."

293
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,510
-我...  -音乐剧《汉密尔顿》里的
- I... - From Hamilton.

294
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,910
《汉密尔顿》啊
Oh, Hamilton.

295
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,380
太棒了  真棒
It's so good. It's so good.

296
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,580
我在纽约公共剧院看的
I saw it at The Public.

297
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,380
我能不能...
May I just, um...

298
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,720
我马上就消失  但在此之前
Then I'll recede, but...

299
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,820
我自己也是白手起家
As a self-made man myself,

300
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,590
我必须表达我的钦佩之情
I have to express my admiration

301
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,660
你如此稳扎稳打地追随你父亲的脚步
for how you followed in your father's footsteps.

302
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,470
-谢谢  -太棒了
- Thank you. - Just marvelous.

303
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,430
你们整个家族都是
You know, the whole family, too.

304
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,400
琼妮有她的事业
And Joni with her thing,

305
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,340
沃尔特有他的出版帝国
and Walt with his publishing empire...

306
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,310
真是...
It's...

307
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,110
这个嘛
Well...

308
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,580
当然  沃尔特做得很好
Yes, I mean, Walt, he's done well

309
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,050
毕竟有爸爸给他的资源
with what dad gave him.

310
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,320
当然这不重要
Not that it matters.

311
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,290
但说真的  爸爸每年给他两本书
But really, dad hands him a book twice a year

312
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,960
而沃尔特就拿去出版
and Walt publishes it.

313
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,720
我跟他可不太一样
It's just not the same.

314
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,900
但沃尔特肯定还经营周边产品  改编权
But surely Walt runs the merchandising, adaptations,

315
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,800
影视化版权...
film and television rights, I mean...

316
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,100
你是在套我的话吗  侦探
Are you baiting me, Detective?

317
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,640
你明知道他根本没做那些
You know he doesn't.

318
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,540
如果你觉得我蠢到
And if you think I am dumb enough

319
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,710
能被人套出关于家族生意的话
to be baited into talking family business,

320
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,210
或者我弟弟的坏话
into shit-talking my baby brother,

321
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,850
而且是在一个警探
in front of a police detective,

322
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,180
和一个警员面前...
and a state trooper...

323
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,320
沃尔特什么都不经营
Walt doesn't run shit.

324
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,020
因为根本就没有什么影视化版权
Because there are no TV and film rights.

325
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,050
哈兰从不允许对他的书进行任何改编
Harlan never allowed any adaptations of his books.

326
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,220
他不喜欢这想法
Hated the idea.

327
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,190
不会吧
No.

328
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,390
真的
Yeah!

329
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,260
让沃尔特很抓狂
Drives Walt nuts.

330
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,230
因为那才是真正赚钱的部分
'Cause that's where the real money is.

331
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,870
每当沃尔特借酒壮胆
When Walt would get a little Irish courage in him,

332
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,930
他就会去纠缠哈兰
he'd get into it with Harlan.

333
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,570
他在派对上有"纠缠"吗
Did he "get into it" at the party?

334
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,240
我的天
Oh, my God!

335
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,010
拜托  爸
Come on, Dad!

336
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,010
他根本不肯让他清闲  可怜的家伙
Wouldn't leave him alone, the poor guy.

337
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:03,440
{\an8}网飞那些人  他们的商务代表...
The Netflix guys, their business affair guy...

338
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,180
哈兰最终不得不炒了他
Harlan finally had to give him the hook.

339
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,610
我没听到他具体说了什么
I didn't hear what he said,

340
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,250
但他肯定是把他踢出局了
but he must've really handed him his lunch.

341
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,880
因为沃尔特后面整晚都像只受伤的小狗一样
'Cause Walt was like a wounded puppy the rest of the night.

342
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,290
什么  理查德说了什么
What? Richard said what?

343
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,390
不  天啊  我们没有"纠缠"
No. Jesus. We did not get "into it."

344
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,790
我只是想有个准确的画面
I'm just trying to get an accurate impression.

345
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,290
哈兰在派对上把你叫到了一旁
Harlan took you aside at the party.

346
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,400
你回来后懊悔至极
When you returned, you were chastened.

347
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,670
哈兰到底对你说了什么
What did Harlan say to you?

348
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,870
网飞那些人  他们的商务代表
The Netflix guys, their business affair guy.

349
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,840
他送了点东西过来  这次的开价不错
He sent something over. It's hard numbers this time,

350
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,880
我觉得过了这个村
and I just think this is a window

351
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,210
就没这个店了
that's not gonna stay open.

352
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,410
我们要牢牢抓住
We need to take advantage of it

353
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,310
你只要看看价钱就好
and then you just need to look at the numbers!

354
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,350
-是  沃尔特...  -爸  爸
- Yeah, Walt, look... - Dad! Dad!

355
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,220
是你让我负责我们的书
You... You put me in charge of our books.

356
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,090
就让我做主  让我做这个吧  求你了
Let me be in charge! Let me do this! Please!

357
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,420
儿子  那不是我们的书
They're not our books, son.

358
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,360
是我的书
They're my books.

359
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,000
我也不希望我们谈着谈着就吵起来
And this is not how I wanted to have this conversation.

360
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,330
但是你说得对  很对
But you're right, you're right.

361
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:02,270
我栓着你做不该你管的事情
It's unfair of me to keep you tethered

362
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,370
是不公平的
to something that isn't yours to control.

363
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,110
什么
What?

364
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:10,310
对  我严重地伤害了你
No, I've done you a grave disservice.

365
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,380
这么多年来
All these years,

366
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,420
我一直阻碍了你
I've kept you from building something

367
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,220
建立属于自己的事业
of your own that was yours.

368
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,490
但是你很快就不再负责
But you're not going to be running

369
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,090
出版社的业务了
the publishing house anymore.

370
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,660
你自由了
You're free of it.

371
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,930
爸  你是把我给炒了吗
Dad, are you firing me?

372
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,570
不
No...

373
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,100
我们明天再谈细节
We'll talk details tomorrow.

374
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,210
我心意已决
My mind's made up.

375
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,840
好孩子
Good boy.

376
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,550
我们谈了谈  关于电子书业务
We talked. We had a business discussion about e-books.

377
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,790
天啊  没什么
Jesus. It was nothing.

378
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,260
你要是说吵架的话
You want to talk about an argument,

379
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,290
兰森跟他吵了一架
hell, Ransom had an argument with him.

380
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,190
兰森  就是
Ransom, that's, uh,

381
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,960
理查德和琳达的儿子
Richard and Linda's son?

382
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,900
我们都爱兰森  他是个好孩子  我们爱他
Look, we all love Ransom, he's a good kid. We love him.

383
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,600
但是
But?

384
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,810
但他一直都是家里的害群之马
But he's always been the black sheep of the family.

385
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,610
我不是想...
And I'm not trying to...

386
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,580
通常而言  家丑不可外扬
I like to keep stuff like this in the family.

387
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,710
但是兰森  他从来不工作
But with Ransom, he's never had a job.

388
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,220
而我爸  不知道为什么
And Dad, for some unknown reason,

389
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,790
还一直养着他
always supported him.

390
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,560
他们之间爱恨交加  总吵架
They have this love-hate bond. They fight.

391
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,960
但是那天晚上  天啊  吵翻天了
But that night, God, they had a blowout.

392
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,630
因为什么
About what?

393
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,560
你是不是疯了
Are you goddamn insane?

394
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,130
猜不出来是什么  但是很激烈
Couldn't make it out really, but it was huge.

395
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,840
奇怪的是  他们是去另外一个房间吵的
And it's strange they went into another room to do it.

396
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,000
通常他们就喜欢当着全家人的面
Usually they like to stoke up drama

397
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,640
针锋相对
in front of the whole family.

398
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,040
说到"纠缠"
Speaking of getting into it...

399
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,450
你提前抵达了  帮忙准备派对  你...
You were at the house early, to help the caterers set up. Did...

400
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,750
你当时跟哈兰有过谈话吗
Did you converse with Harlan at that time?

401
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,290
他在场  我们肯定说过话
Well, he was there. We must have spoke.

402
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,790
在他的书房里呢
In his study?

403
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,270
没有
I don't think so.

404
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,010
我今天早晨问过承办人
You see, I spoke with the caterer this morning,

405
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,750
她没看见你帮她的员工
she didn't see you helping her staff.

406
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,350
倒是听到哈兰那天下午
She did hear Harlan in a screaming match

407
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,420
跟人在书房里吵了一架
with somebody that afternoon in his study.

408
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,150
是的  我不...
Yeah, I don't...

409
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,860
吵了一架
Screaming match?

410
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,690
不
No.

411
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,100
但是琼妮也在
But Joni was here, too.

412
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,330
她来得早  可能是跟她
She was early, so it might have been her.

413
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,570
你们可以问问她
You can maybe ask her.

414
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,600
是两个男人的声音
These were two male voices.

415
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,670
哈兰喊道
Harlan shouted the phrase...

416
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,010
你去告诉她  不然我亲自去
You tell her or I will!

417
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,040
"你去告诉她
"You tell her

418
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,580
不然我亲自去"
or I will!"

419
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,410
想起来了吗
Bells ringing?

420
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,060
这不关你的事
That's none of your business.

421
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,160
你别插手我的婚姻
You stay out of my marriage.

422
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,330
我了解我女儿  她会想要知道的
I know my daughter, and she would want to know.

423
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,960
我已经都写在这封给她的信里了
I've put all of it in this letter to her.

424
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,500
明天  她就能看到
Tomorrow, she gets it.

425
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,270
哈兰  我警告你
Harlan, I'm warning you.

426
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,040
-不  她有权知道  -别插手我的婚姻
- No, she deserves to know. - You stay out of my marriage.

427
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,000
她有权知道  你来告诉她
She deserves to know, and you're gonna tell her.

428
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,240
-我绝不  -你去告诉她  不然我亲自去
- The hell I am! - You tell her or I will!

429
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,150
是的  我知道
Yes. I know.

430
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,710
是的
Yes.

431
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:25,160
哈兰终于下定决心要把他妈妈送到养老院
Harlan had finally decided to put his mom in a nursing home

432
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,490
琳达一直都反对这事
and Linda had always opposed that.

433
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,990
我想要等到
And I wanted to wait until we got back

434
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,060
我们回到波士顿再告诉琳达
to Boston, uh, to tell Linda,

435
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,760
免得大闹一场
so, to avoid a whole scene,

436
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,970
但是哈兰想让我当时就告诉她
and Harlan wanted me to tell her then.

437
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,570
就这事
That was it.

438
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,340
对不起  忘了
Sorry. Forgot.

439
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,470
房子
The house?

440
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,140
到得早  理查德说你在场
Early. Richard said you were there.

441
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,850
我确实来得早
I was at the house early.

442
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,220
为了见哈兰
To see Harlan?

443
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,650
为了见哈兰
To see Harlan.

444
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,090
是的
Yes.

445
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,320
你找哈兰什么事
What were you seeing Harlan about?

446
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,430
关于梅格的学费
It was just a mix-up with the, uh,

447
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,460
付款方面出了差错
the payment for Meg's tuition.

448
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,930
我...  我...
I'm... I'm...

449
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,230
抱歉我要问细点
I'm sorry to press,

450
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,900
究竟是什么差错呢
but what kind of mix-up?

451
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,940
学校还没收到支票
Yeah, the school hasn't got the check yet.

452
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,040
我不知道艾伦为什么没寄出
I don't know why Alan didn't mail it.

453
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,570
艾伦没寄出
Well, Alan didn't mail it

454
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,780
是因为他发现有出入
because he caught a discrepancy.

455
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,950
艾伦的办公室一直都是按你的要求
Alan's office has been wiring tuition directly to the school

456
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,580
把学费直接汇给学校的
as per your request.

457
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,990
但是负责你每年生活费的菲利斯办公室
But Phyllis's office that handles your yearly allowance

458
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,120
也一直都在直接给你汇学费款
has been wiring tuition monies directly to you as well.

459
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,630
你一直都收着双份的梅格学费
You have been double-dipping Meg's tuition

460
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,360
从我这偷钱
and stealing from me.

461
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,030
每年十万
$100,000 a year,

462
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,800
偷了四年
for the past four years.

463
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,040
哈兰  我不知道怎么会出这种差错
Harlan, I don't know how this mix-up happened,

464
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,470
-但我发誓  -现在我给你开这张学费支票
- but I swear to God... - So, now I am writing this tuition check,

465
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,010
但是你要知道  这是你和梅格
but you must know that this is the last money

466
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,510
从我这拿到的最后一笔钱了
you or Meg will get from me.

467
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,810
别这样  你不了解...
Please, you don't understand...

468
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,550
琼妮  我知道你会难受
Joni, I know it'll hurt,

469
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,850
但这都是为了你们好
but it's all for the best.

470
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,720
我心意已决
My mind's made up.

471
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,030
是跟学校办公室之间
It was, uh, a money wiring issue

472
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,660
汇款出了差错
with the office at the school.

473
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,860
所以我让哈兰为这学期的学费开张支票
So I had to ask Harlan to cut a check for the semester.

474
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,370
没什么大事
No big deal.

475
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,230
好吧
Well...

476
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,130
我们还是
Why don't we, uh,

477
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,100
先休息一下  然后再...
just take a little break and we'll resu...

478
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,470
不...
Oh, no...

479
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,570
她走了
She's gone.

480
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,550
理查德
Richard!

481
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,620
琼妮  你见到理查德了吗
Joni, have you seen Richard?

482
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,220
没有  警察刚问完我
No, I was, uh, just done with the, um...

483
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,420
好的  谢谢
Okay, thanks.

484
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,890
没见到
No.

485
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,430
该死  理查德
Damn it. Richard!

486
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,500
理查德
Richard?

487
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,160
混蛋
Son of a bitch.

488
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,440
可能我期望过高了
See, I might be a victim of my own expectation here,

489
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,440
但是当大名鼎鼎的贝努瓦·布兰克
but when the great Benoit Blanc

490
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,910
来敲我门的时候
comes knocking at my door,

491
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,880
我就期待着能有什么
I expect it's going to be about something,

492
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,880
就算不离奇
if not extraordinary,

493
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,180
至少也是有趣的事
then at least interesting.

494
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,280
但是  恕我直言
But... I'm sorry,

495
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,390
这明摆着是一起自杀案
this is an open-and-shut case of suicide

496
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,290
说实话  贝尼  我们得谈谈
and, uh, quite frankly, Benny, we're getting to the point

497
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,890
我们究竟是在干什么
where I need to know what we're doing here.

498
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:48,930
自杀方式
The method?

499
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,130
割喉
Throat slit?

500
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,330
是典型的自杀方式吗
Typical for a suicide?

501
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,300
是  我知道  是有点夸张
Yes, I mean, that's dramatic.

502
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,530
但是你看看周围
But look around.

503
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,870
老爷子简直是活在推理游戏中
I mean, the guy practically lives in a Clue board.

504
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,150
拜托  贝尼  跟我说说行吗
Come on, Benny, talk to me, all right?

505
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,120
你让我把所有人请回来
Now, you tell me to invite all of these people back

506
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,520
再问一遍  我懂
for questioning all over again. I get it.

507
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,450
我已经派人在这个郡
Listen, I've had boots on the ground

508
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,890
巡逻了好一阵了
in this county for a while now.

509
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,190
大家都跟表面上看起来差不多
People are generally what they seem to be.

510
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,360
凶手不在这家人中
You're not gonna find murderers in this family.

511
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,460
这家人家庭和睦
This is a pleasant family

512
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,730
偶尔争吵
with the usual quarrels,

513
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,760
但是没有杀人动机
but no possible motives for murder.

514
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,130
你要去哪
Where are you going?

515
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,670
哈兰·斯隆贝的护士  玛塔...
Harlan Thrombey's nurse. Marta...

516
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,910
-卡布瑞拉  -玛塔·卡布瑞拉
- Cabrera. - Marta Cabrera.

517
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,470
-卡布瑞拉小姐  请在里面等  -这边请
- Miss Cabrera, you can just wait inside... - Please.

518
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,140
-我们很快就...  -卡布瑞拉小姐
- and we'll be with you in... - Miss Cabrera.

519
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,050
我做了一点调查
I've been doin' a little pokin'.

520
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,380
你是一名注册护士
You were hired on a part-time basis

521
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,650
在这里兼职  对吗
as a registered nurse, yes?

522
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:52,090
是的  我没有加入家访护士协会
Yes. I don't work for a VNA.

523
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,690
直接受雇于哈兰
Harlan hired me directly.

524
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,260
请坐吧
Take a seat, please.

525
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,060
你拿的是固定工资
And you're paid a flat rate

526
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,400
一周工作几小时
for how many hours a week?

527
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:05,670
最初每周十五小时  后来他...
Well, I started at 15, and then he...

528
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,670
他需要更多帮助
He needed more help.

529
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,970
医疗方面的吗
Medical help?

530
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,210
他需要一个朋友
He needed a friend.

531
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,380
有善心就能成为好护士吗
Does having a kind heart make you a good nurse?

532
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,320
好了  布兰克  你不能...
All right, Blanc, I mean, this is...

533
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,090
知道了  玛塔  我们刚说到
Yeah, yeah. Marta? We were just discussing

534
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,260
家庭成员是否有杀人动机
possible motives in the family.

535
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,790
我猜哈兰应该会对你坦言
I suspect that Harlan has told you

536
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,360
每个人的真实情况
much unfiltered truth about each of 'em.

537
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:34,200
根据我所掌握的信息
And a little bird has told me,

538
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,900
该怎么委婉地表达呢
how shall I put this delicately...

539
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,840
说谎会使你产生
You have a regurgitative reaction

540
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,870
反胃反应
to mistruthin'.

541
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,340
谁告诉你的
Who told you that?

542
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,680
是真的吗
Is it true?

543
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,180
是的
Yes.

544
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,450
我从小就这样
It's something I've had since I was a kid.

545
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,220
是生理反应
It's a physical thing that I...

546
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,260
一想到说谎
Just the thought of lying...

547
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,920
我就会呕吐
Yeah, it makes me puke.

548
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,060
真的吗
Really?

549
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,570
理查德是不是出轨了
Is Richard havin' an affair?

550
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,670
男人为什么总是
Why do men instinctively

551
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:18,580
本能地自寻死路
pull at loose threads on their parachutes?

552
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,110
什么
What?

553
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,220
理查德
Richard?

554
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,990
-出轨  -对
- An affair? - Yeah.

555
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,830
只要回答是或不是就行
A yes or no will do.

556
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,760
不是
No.

557
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,470
我去
Shit!

558
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,300
-天啊  -姑娘  抱歉
- Oh, my god! - Dear girl, I'm sorry.

559
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,340
我以为你只是比喻
I assumed you were speaking figuratively.

560
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,670
-我车上有湿巾  -好了  给你
- I have Wet-Naps in the car. - All right, here, here.

561
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,310
喝口水
Just take a sip of this.

562
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,480
拿着
Take that.

563
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,810
不可思议
That's quite somethin'.

564
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,680
-谢谢  -但我显然猜对了
- Thanks. - But I was obviously right.

565
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,620
理查德确实出轨了
Richard is having an affair.

566
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,020
他的岳父发现后当面与他对峙
His father-in-law found out and confronted him.

567
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,320
"你去告诉她  不然我亲自去"
"You tell her or I will."

568
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,490
好  就算是这样  他...
Okay, but even if that were the case, he...

569
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,560
你还好吗
You all right?

570
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,490
-我没事  -就算是这样
- Yeah. - Even if that were the case, I mean,

571
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,060
为了防止出轨被曝光而起杀心
protecting a relationship as a motive,

572
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,560
这动机不够充分  你应该清楚
that's weak sauce. You know that.

573
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,970
还有琼妮
Well, then there is Joni.

574
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,170
-琼妮  -琼妮
- Joni? - Joni?

575
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,500
养生大师琼妮
Lifestyle guru Joni?

576
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,170
不可能  哈兰在资助她们母女
No, Harlan was supporting her and her daughter

577
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,240
她们不可能想让他死
and that's the opposite of a motive.

578
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,970
那如果资助有中断的风险...
And if that support was threatened...

579
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,170
卡布瑞拉小姐  请稍等
Miss Cabrera, one moment, please.

580
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,670
我只是想去漱漱口
Yes, I just wanna get some Scope.

581
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,040
卡布瑞拉小姐
Miss Cabrera...

582
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,980
哈兰是不是打算中断琼妮的生活费
Was Harlan plannin' on cutting off Joni's allowance?

583
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,890
琼妮啊
Oh, Joni.

584
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,420
怎么了
What's up?

585
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,620
我的天
Oh, my God.

586
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,890
如果你又想吐
All right, don't answer that

587
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:43,690
就别回答了  拜托
if you're gonna puke again, please.

588
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,260
梅格说他是直接向学校汇款的
Meg said he paid the school directly.

589
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,430
琼妮说他是把钱汇给自己的
Joni said he sent the money to her.

590
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,770
两人说的都是真话
Both were true.

591
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,100
她私吞了第二笔钱
She was pocketing the double payment.

592
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,070
哈兰发现后
Harlan found out,

593
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,700
就一分也不给她了
and cut her off without a cent.

594
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,540
对吗
Yes?

595
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,240
所以她就为了分得遗产把他杀了
So she bumps him off for the inheritance?

596
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,180
得了吧  你看过她的社交媒体主页吗
Come on, no, have you seen her Insta?

597
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,250
她是网络红人
She's an influencer.

598
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,080
对  为了生活费而杀人
No, allowance as a motive?

599
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,580
这同样说不通
Again, more weak sauce.

600
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,250
你给出的动机都不够强烈
You're just dumpin' that vat of weak sauce on me.

601
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,650
同意  但她说谎了
Granted. But she lied to me.

602
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,650
他们三个都说谎了
All three of them did.

603
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,420
三个
Three?

604
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,160
沃尔特
Walter.

605
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,660
我明白你的意思了
I see where you're going with this.

606
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,460
哈兰之前就拒绝过沃尔特出售影视化版权
Harlan had turned Walter down before regarding film rights,

607
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,270
但那天晚上  哈兰又说了什么话刺激了他
but that night, somethin' Harlan said shook him.

608
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,870
看看他的行为模式
Now we look at the pattern.

609
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,970
哈兰在清理门户
Harlan was cleanin' house.

610
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,770
怪不得
No wonder.

611
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,770
他是不是准备开除沃尔特
Did he plan to fire Walter?

612
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,680
我能不能在里面等
Can I just wait inside?

613
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,610
我好像不应该待在这里
I feel like I shouldn't be here.

614
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,240
好  请在里面等吧
Yeah, please, just wait inside.

615
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,480
别走太远  好吗
Stay close, all right?

616
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,690
你很有耐心  我的朋友
You have been very patient, my friend.

617
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,460
是的
And yes,

618
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,220
你说得对
you are right.

619
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,630
不论是薄弱的不在场证明还是家庭纷争
None of these weak alibis and domestic squibbles

620
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,190
都无法回答你的问题
answer your question...

621
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,960
"贝努瓦·布兰克为什么会来"
"Why is Benoit Blanc here?"

622
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,900
我来告诉你原因
Well, now I will tell you why.

623
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,470
我来这里是因为今天早上
I'm here because this mornin',

624
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,740
有人回避了一个非常重要的问题
someone dodged a very important question.

625
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,340
谁
Who?

626
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,180
我
Me.

627
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,710
琳达问我是受谁委托
Linda asked who hired me.

628
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,850
你是受谁委托
Well, who hired you?

629
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,950
我不知道
I do not know.

630
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,820
昨天我收到了一个装满现金的信封
An envelope of cash showed up at my apartment yesterday

631
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,060
和斯隆贝死讯的新闻剪报
with a news clippin' of Thrombey's death.

632
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,960
一个信封就把你招来了
An envelope? That worked?

633
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,360
装满现金的信封
An envelope of cash.

634
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,860
这就说明有人怀疑其中有鬼
So somebody suspects foul play

635
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:31,000
费尽心思隐瞒身份
and goes through this ha cha dance of hiring me,

636
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,800
雇我查案
of staying anonymous.

637
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,970
这根本说不通
It makes no damn sense.

638
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,810
却让我无法抗拒
Compels me, though.

639
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,580
再说一遍案发时
Walk me through everyone's whereabouts

640
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,080
每个人的行踪
at the time of death.

641
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,590
派对结束时大约是十一点半
We know that the party ended around 11:30.

642
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,590
-晚安  琼妮  -晚安
- Good night, Joni. - 'Night.

643
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,050
玛塔陪哈兰上楼
Marta took Harlan upstairs

644
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,490
帮他注射药物
to give him his meds.

645
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,390
通向哈兰卧室和阁楼办公室的楼梯
The stairs leading up to Harlan's bedroom

646
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,100
踩上去会发出很响的吱嘎声
and his attic office creak horribly

647
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:01,430
而琳达睡觉很浅
and Linda is a light sleeper.

648
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,400
所以我们掌握了
So we know every time

649
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,470
当晚所有上下楼梯的记录
someone took the stairs that night.

650
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,570
第一次是琼妮听到
The first was when Joni heard a ka-thunk

651
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,510
楼上某个地方发出"咣当"一声
from somewhere above her in the house.

652
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,950
她担心哈兰
She's concerned about Harlan,

653
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,090
所以上楼查看情况
so she goes up to investigate...

654
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,920
吵醒了琳达
Waking Linda.

655
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,990
哈兰和玛塔在阁楼办公室
Harlan was in his attic office with Marta.

656
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,730
-你好  琼妮  -我好像...你好
- Hi, Joni. - I thought... Hi.

657
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,730
他解释说他们刚刚把围棋棋盘打翻了
He explained that they had just knocked over the Go board.

658
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,400
我刚刚打翻了围棋棋盘  所以...
I just knocked over the Go board, so...

659
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,370
就是格子棋盘石头棋子的那种棋
You know, that game with the grid and stones?

660
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,530
他们每晚都会下
They play it every night.

661
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,870
他没事  "回去睡吧"
He was fine. "Go to bed."

662
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,440
回去睡吧  琼妮
Go to bed, Joni.

663
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,810
-爱你  晚安  -爱你
- Love you. 'Night. - Love you.

664
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,070
-于是她照做了  -再见
- So she did. - Bye.

665
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,740
十分钟后
Ten minutes later,

666
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,850
琳达再次被吵醒
Linda is awoken a second time...

667
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,110
玛塔离开了
By Marta leaving.

668
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,550
沃尔特  我走了
Walt, I'm leaving.

669
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,720
沃尔特在门廊抽雪茄  他儿子也在
Walt was smokin' a cigar on the porch with his son.

670
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,860
他看到她出门  开车离开
He saw her leave and drive off.

671
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,960
他看了下时间
Noted the time.

672
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,030
是午夜
Midnight.

673
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,100
十五分钟后
Fifteen minutes later,

674
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,000
琳达第三次也是最后一次被吵醒
Linda is awoken for the third and final time...

675
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,670
是有人下楼梯
By someone coming down the stairs.

676
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:20,210
是哈兰  下楼吃夜宵
Harlan, who came down for a midnight snack.

677
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,840
爸爸  回去睡觉
Dad, go back to bed.

678
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,150
沃尔特试图劝阻他
Which Walt tried to discourage.

679
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,650
基于以上事实
Based on this,

680
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,680
法医判定死亡时间
the medical examiner determined the time of death

681
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,790
在凌晨十二点一刻和两点之间
to be between 12:15 and 2.00 a.m.

682
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:34,720
沃尔特十二点半左右抽完雪茄  梅格回家了
As Walt was finishing his cigar at about 12:30, Meg came home.

683
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,130
她直接回房间睡觉了
She went straight to bed.

684
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,730
沃尔特和雅各布很快也回去睡觉了
Walt and Jacob turned in shortly after that.

685
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,130
那天夜里晚些时候
And sometime later that night,

686
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:46,000
时间不确定  但可能是凌晨三点左右
it's undetermined, but possibly near 3:00 a.m.,

687
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,910
梅格被外面的狗叫声吵醒
Meg woke up because the dogs were barking outside.

688
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,780
她上了洗手间  又继续睡了
She used the bathroom, went back to bed.

689
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,180
就是这样
That's it. All right?

690
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,210
每个人的说法都吻合
Now, everyone's stories matched,

691
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,080
每个时间点都能对应
every moment accounted for.

692
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:02,290
没有其他楼梯通往哈兰的房间吗
And there is no other staircase up to Harlan's room?

693
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,120
没有  就那个嘎吱响的
None. Just the creaky one.

694
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,390
有意思
Interesting.

695
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:08,190
我们知道不是兰森干的
So, we know that Ransom didn't do it

696
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,630
因为他不在场
because he wasn't there.

697
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,460
玛塔也不可能
Marta couldn't have.

698
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,930
她离开时哈兰还活着
Harlan was still alive when she left.

699
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,400
-没错  -梅格
- Yeah. - Meg...

700
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,830
梅格在死亡时间段内
Meg came home during the window

701
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,130
-回家的  不是吗  -听着  这...
- of the time of death, right? - Now look, look, it was a...

702
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,300
但这确实是自杀  好吗
Except it was a suicide, all right?

703
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,500
哈兰割开了自己的颈动脉
Harlan slit right through his carotid.

704
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:24,610
我们看到血迹喷溅形态完全未遇阻挡
We saw from the blood splat patterns that they were uninterrupted,

705
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,780
意味着当时几乎不可能
meaning, it's almost impossible for anyone

706
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,510
有人在他身旁
to have been around him at the time.

707
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,850
是他自己割了喉  好吗
He's the one who cut his own throat, all right?

708
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,380
我不明白为什么还要一遍遍调查
I don't know why we keep goin' over this.

709
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:36,790
物证推断出的案情也可能是完全错误的
Physical evidence can tell a clear story with a forked tongue.

710
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,090
-什么  -从今天早上的情况可以看到
- What?  - And as we can see from this mornin',

711
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,360
每个人都会撒谎
everyone can lie.

712
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,800
几乎每个人
Well, almost everyone.

713
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,970
卡布瑞拉小姐
Miss Cabrera...

714
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,470
我们让你等了一下午
We kept you waiting all afternoon,

715
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:56,010
是因为我想听你最后一个说
because I wanted to hear from you last.

716
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:00,480
我需要在脑海中构建那晚完整的故事线
I needed an entire picture of the evening in my head,

717
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,320
而你那部分是其中最关键的
and your piece of it is at its very center.

718
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,920
所以不着急  慢慢讲
So, please take your time.

719
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:15,290
你十一点半送斯隆贝先生上楼
You took Mr. Thrombey upstairs at 11:30

720
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,290
并于午夜离开
and left at midnight.

721
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,530
仔细回想
Think very carefully

722
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:23,030
越详细越好
and with as much detail as possible.

723
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,670
告诉我们那半个小时里发生了什么
Tell us what happened in that half hour?

724
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,680
-上上上  我可以  -你可以吗
- Up, up, up, I got it. - Yeah, you got it?

725
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,450
上上上  我可以  上上上  我可以
Up, up, up, I got it. Up, up, up, I got it.

726
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,780
-上上上  我可以  -好的
- Up, up, up, I got it. - Okay, that's...

727
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,580
哈兰
Harlan...

728
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,880
-上上上  我可以  -我们...
- Up, up, up, I got it. - Let's...

729
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,350
上上上  我可以
Up, up, up, I got it.

730
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,190
-好了  -不要犹豫
- Okay. - No second thoughts.

731
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,890
不  不  不不不
No. No, no, no, no.

732
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,690
-上来  -我喝了一杯香槟
- Get up here! - I had a glass of champagne.

733
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,060
-哈兰  听我说  -我们...
- Harlan, listen to me. - We are...

734
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,760
-很晚了  我喝了...  -你只喝了一杯
- It's late. I had... - You've only had one glass.

735
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,560
-没错  一杯香槟  我不能  -我们不能
- Exactly. A glass of champagne. I don't... - We are not breaking

736
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,660
在我生日这天打破传统
tradition on my birthday!

737
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,000
你能快点用药然后去睡觉吗
Can you just take your goddamn medicine and go to bed?

738
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,070
如果你想把那瓶破药注入我体内
If you're gonna put that vile shit in me,

739
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,470
就得付出努力
you have to earn it.

740
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,100
今天是我生日
On my birthday.

741
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,670
-老天  -85岁生日
- Oh, God. - Eighty-fifth birthday.

742
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:06,240
-好吧  天啊  -我这么老了
- Fine. Jesus! - I'm so old.

743
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,780
-我这么老了  -你是真喜欢搞事情啊
- I'm so old. - You really love drama, huh?

744
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:09,910
玛塔
Marta.

745
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,880
来吧  用九乘九的格子
Okay, let's do this. Nine-by-nine.

746
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,980
-好  -你准备好了吗
- Right. - You ready?

747
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,480
-我会吊打你  -你确定吗
- I'll whip your ass. - Are you sure?

748
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,090
当然  当然
Yeah. Yeah.

749
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,320
口气挺大
How dare you.

750
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,690
我知道结局会如何
I know how this is gonna end.

751
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,160
这是什么路数
What is that?

752
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,100
为什么我下围棋总赢不了你你
Why can't I beat you at this game?

753
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,430
因为我下棋不是为了赢你
Because I'm not playing to beat you.

754
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,270
我是要摆出美丽图案
I'm playing to build a beautiful pattern.

755
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,770
你这是虐待老人
That's elder abuse.

756
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,370
我要打给退休人员协会
I'm gonna call the AARP.

757
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,970
别让我拿皮带捆你  老爷爷
Don't make me get the belt, abuelo.

758
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,570
基本已经输了
It's basically over.

759
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,640
我唯一的希望就是地震来袭
My only hope is that an earthquake will strike.

760
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,980
但这有多大可能呢
But what are the chances?

761
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,280
来人
Hello?

762
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,180
来人  来人
Hello? Hello?

763
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,250
有人吗  快躲门框下
Hello? Get under a door frame!

764
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,420
棒
Yes!

765
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:58,900
你真是输不起  打针然后睡觉去
Such a bad loser you are! Meds, then bed.

766
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,530
我受够你了
I'm done with you.

767
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,170
行吧
That's fair.

768
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:08,440
沃尔特在外面门廊吸他那恶心的雪茄
Walt is smoking that filthy cigar out there on the porch.

769
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,740
恶心还致死的玩意
Dead and nasty things.

770
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,680
今晚过得怎么样
How was tonight?

771
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,010
今晚还好
Tonight was good.

772
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,580
是吗
Yeah?

773
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,980
我知道你并不期待今晚
I know you weren't looking forward to it.

774
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,750
确实  但我做到了
No. But I did it.

775
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,720
我断了他们四个人的钱
I cut the line on all four of 'em.

776
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,860
是的
Yeah.

777
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,830
并不容易
Wasn't easy.

778
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,100
这该死的财富
This goddamn fortune.

779
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,670
有时我会想  我给家人的一切
You know, sometimes I think that everything I've given my family,

780
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:40,900
或许是不自觉
I've done maybe without knowing,

781
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,210
或许是为了让他们屈居我之下
or maybe to keep them beneath me.

782
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,210
我确实应该...
I certainly should have...

783
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:51,480
或许...鼓励沃尔特写自己的书
I don't know, encouraged Walt to write his own stories,

784
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,580
而不只是代管我的书
not just be a caretaker of mine.

785
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,420
就像你说的那样
Like you said I should.

786
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:01,210
当好琼妮的父亲而不只是给钱
And then be a father and not just a provider for Joni,

787
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,690
这也是你说的
like you also said.

788
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:06,160
我本可以对琳达和兰森更好
And I could have been kinder to Linda and Ransom...

789
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,370
老天  兰森
Jesus! Ransom.

790
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:14,500
那孩子跟我太像了
There's so much of me in that kid.

791
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,610
自信  愚蠢
Confident. Stupid.

792
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,610
还被保护得很好
I don't know, protected.

793
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,450
视人生如游戏  不计后果
Playing life like a game, without consequence.

794
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,550
直到甚至不能区分
Until you can't tell the difference

795
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,060
道具刀
between a stage prop

796
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,820
和真刀
and a real knife.

797
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,890
要知道  我不惧怕死亡
You know, I don't fear death.

798
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,100
但是  老天
But, oh, God,

799
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,900
我想在死前解决好一些事
I'd like to fix some of this before I go.

800
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,440
完美落幕
Close the book with a flourish.

801
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,840
我们就等着看吧
I guess we'll see.

802
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,980
是的
I guess we will.

803
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,430
你今天很累了
You had a long day.

804
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,930
想用点药吗
You wanna do drugs?

805
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,640
你是说好东西吗
You mean the good stuff?

806
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,800
要吗
Yeah?

807
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,110
快来  送我去极乐之境
Come on, send me to la-la land.

808
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,710
就一点  好吗
Just a tiny bit, okay?

809
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,850
为什么我人到中年才开始用吗啡
Why did I wait till my mid-age to become a morphine user?

810
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,640
真是个笨蛋
What a schmuck.

811
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,510
真是讨厌  这...
What a nudnik. This...

812
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,950
这东西是最棒的
This stuff is the best.

813
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,640
{\an8}吗啡

814
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:27,890
{\an8}痛力克

815
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,520
天啊
Oh, my God.

816
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,890
有什么问题吗
Is there a problem?

817
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,660
我刚刚给你注射了一百毫克这个
This is what I just gave you 100 milligrams of.

818
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,070
我搞混了
I messed up.

819
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,240
你给我注射了一百毫克好东西
You gave me 100 milligrams of the good stuff?

820
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:50,350
那个  好东西的用量应该是多少来着
Excuse me, what is the good stuff's dosage supposed to be?

821
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,450
别叫它好东西了  行吗
Let's not call it that right now, okay?

822
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,650
三毫克
Three milligrams.

823
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,250
那可少多了
Oh, that's much less.

824
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,920
那么接下来会怎样
So what happens?

825
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,760
我会给你紧急注射一针纳洛酮
I'm gonna give you an emergency shot of Naloxone,

826
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,430
否则你会在十分钟内死去
so you don't die in 10 minutes.

827
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,120
好吧  不用着急
Oh, well, no pressure.

828
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,030
你知道吗  这是个有趣
You know, this is an interesting

829
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,800
而且有效的杀人方法
and efficient method of murder.

830
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,660
我得把它记下来
I need to write this down.

831
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,370
所以  如果有人故意把药调包了
So, if someone switched the meds on purpose,

832
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,540
我就会在十分钟内死掉
I'd be dead in 10 minutes.

833
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,640
救不过来的那种死掉吗
Like stone-cold dead?

834
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,180
是的  你在五分钟内就会出现症状
Yes. You'll feel symptoms in five.

835
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,480
出汗  方向感迷失  然后...
Sweats, disorientation, and then...

836
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,250
对  那么大剂量  十分钟内  你的...
Yes. That big dose injected, within 10, your...

837
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:27,880
你的大脑...
Your brain...

838
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,320
是的  十分钟
Yes, 10 minutes.

839
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,420
从注射开始算
From the moment of injection?

840
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,390
现在还剩八分多钟了
It's eight-ish now.

841
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:37,000
即使受害者在刚出现症状时
And even if the victim called for an ambulance

842
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,260
就叫了救护车
when he first felt the symptoms

843
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:42,070
如果他住在像我们这样的乡下别墅
and if he lived in a great big country house like we do,

844
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:45,940
救护车至少得十五分钟才能到
the ambulance would take at least 15 minutes to arrive

845
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,630
那就为时已晚了
and it'd be too late.

846
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:52,570
如果受害者没有那个纳什么的药的话
If the victim didn't have the emergency Naxostuff.

847
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,840
玛塔
Marta?

848
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:59,080
-你有那个药吗  -有  我会找到它的
- Do you have the Naxostuff? - Yes, I'm gonna find it.

849
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,420
肯定有  因为它是医疗包自带的
I have it because it comes with the kit,

850
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,680
所以它应该在这里  肯定在
so it should be here. It has to be.

851
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,420
它就像...
It's like...

852
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,530
它不在这里  哈兰
It's not here, Harlan.

853
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,900
我不知道它为什么不在
I don't know why it's not here.

854
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,900
我得打电话了  好吗
So, I'm gonna use the phone, okay?

855
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,970
叫救护车
To call an ambulance.

856
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,550
你在做什么
What are you doing?

857
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,790
你在做什么
What are you doing?

858
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:45,000
玛塔	  听我说
Marta, listen to me.

859
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,420
-哈兰  我得叫救护车  -停下
- Harlan, I need to call the ambulance. - Stop this!

860
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,650
-停下  玛塔  -得让他们过来
- Stop this, Marta! - They need to get here.

861
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,130
-没时间了  你必须听好  -什么
- There's no time! You have to listen! - What?

862
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,360
我要把全家人都叫过来
I'm calling the family!

863
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,480
你在做什么
What are you doing?

864
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,980
-你疯了吗  -别出声
- Are you nuts? - Don't make a noise.

865
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,510
-哈兰  我们得叫救护车  -玛塔  听我说
- Harlan, we have to call the ambulance. - Marta, listen to me!

866
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,250
我们没时间了
We don't have time!

867
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,610
-到底怎么回事  -听我说
- What's going on? - Listen to me!

868
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,450
如果你说的没错  我就死定了
Now, if what you said is true, I'm gone.

869
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,320
没有办法救我的
There's no saving me.

870
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,310
不  不
No, no.

871
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,810
我们只有六分钟
We have six minutes.

872
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,690
-不  我  -不  我们得让你摆脱嫌疑
- No, I... - Wait, no. We have got to get you out of this!

873
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,250
想想你妈妈
Think of your mom.

874
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,150
我妈妈
My mom?

875
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,100
玛塔  到我身后去  我身后
Marta, get behind me, get behind me.

876
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,390
别出声
Don't make a noise.

877
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,330
哈兰
Harlan?

878
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,200
玛塔
Marta?

879
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,430
一切都好吗
Everything all right?

880
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,640
-你好  琼妮  -我好像...你好
- Oh, hi, Joni. - I thought... Hi.

881
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,440
我好像听到了什么声音  一切都好吗
I thought I heard something. Is everything okay?

882
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,340
没事  我们很好  很好
No, no. We're fine. We're fine.

883
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:34,680
我只是刚把围棋棋盘打翻了  不好意思
Well, I just knocked over this Go board. Sorry about that.

884
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,480
-你们都没事  -是的  我们很好
- Everyone's all right? - Yeah, fine.

885
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,710
没事  回去睡吧  琼妮
No, no. Go to bed, Joni.

886
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,010
好吧
Okay.

887
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,960
也许明天我们可以谈谈家里...
Maybe we can talk tomorrow about the family...

888
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,180
明天  没问题
Tomorrow's fine.

889
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,670
-晚安  爱你  -爱你  再见
- Goodnight. Love you. 'Night. - Love you. Bye.

890
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:51,840
过来
Come on.

891
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,670
现在仔细听我说
Pay attention, now.

892
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,580
你的妈妈
Your mom

893
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,650
现在仍然是非法移民
is still undocumented.

894
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,250
如果这事最终归咎于你
And if this is your fault,

895
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,760
那她的身份就会被发现并被驱逐出境
she'll be found out and at best deported

896
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,850
你的家庭就会破碎
and your family will be broken.

897
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,420
我们不会让这发生的  对吗
We're not gonna let that happen, are we, huh?

898
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,690
但你必须严格按我说的做
But you have to do exactly what I tell you.

899
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,560
你愿意吗  玛塔
Will you do this, Marta?

900
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,430
为我最后做一件事
This last thing for me?

901
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:18,830
也为你的家人
For your family?

902
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,970
你想让我做什么
What do you want me to do?

903
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:28,470
下楼的时候动静越大越好
Go downstairs as noisily as you can

904
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,250
然后大声地说再见
and then say goodbye loudly.

905
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,380
沃尔特  我走了
Walt, I'm leaving.

906
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,720
尽量让他们留意时间
Call attention to the time...

907
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,920
天啊  已经午夜了
God, it's midnight already.

908
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,950
如果可以的话
If you can.

909
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,020
开车出大门
Drive out the gate.

910
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,190
为避开监控摄像头
Then to avoid the security cameras,

911
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:43,560
在大象雕塑之前停车
pull off the road before the carved elephant.

912
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,770
等等  是在雕塑之前还是之后
Wait. Was it before or after?

913
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,030
在大象雕塑之后
After the carved elephant.

914
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,240
不  他说的是之前  对吗
No, he said before. Was it?

915
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,970
在大象雕塑前后
Beafterfore the carved elephant.

916
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,130
该死
Oh, shit.

917
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:00,240
停好车  步行回房子
Park, and come back on foot up to the house.

918
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:04,140
从小门走侧院小路进来
Take the side yard pass through the little gate.

919
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,410
狗都认识你  它们应该不会叫
The dogs will know you, they shouldn't bark.

920
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,760
你得在不被人发现的情况下
You've got to get up to the third floor

921
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,180
回到三楼
without being seen.

922
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,560
唯一的方法就是从侧面的棚架爬上来
And the only way is to climb the side trellis

923
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,260
然后通过走廊上的暗窗进入房子
and come in through the trick hall window.

924
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,860
你在开玩笑吧
You gotta be kidding me.

925
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,690
我没开玩笑  就这样做
I am not. Do it.

926
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,770
而且千万不要弄出任何动静
And for God's sake, don't make any noise!

927
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,790
你进来之后  就是棘手的部分了
Once you're inside, now this is the tricky part...

928
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:47,230
这才是棘手的部分
This is the tricky part?

929
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:50,330
到我卧室里找到我的睡袍和帽子
Get my robe and cap from my bedroom

930
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,060
把它们穿戴上
and put them on.

931
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,170
哈兰...
Harlan...

932
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:55,030
这太疯狂了  我觉得我做不到
This is crazy. I don't think I can do that.

933
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:58,070
不  我们必须要做到无懈可击
No, we need to make this so airtight that the average cop

934
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,540
让普通警察完全忽略你的嫌疑
will entirely dismiss you as a suspect.

935
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,970
这听起来很疯狂  但会管用的
It sounds crazy, but it'll work.

936
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,610
沃尔特在外面抽烟  他会看到你出来
Walt is smoking outside, and he'll see you

937
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,850
隔着釉面窗户
through the glazed window.

938
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,310
爸爸  回去睡觉
Dad? Go back to bed.

939
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,960
有人看到你离开了
You were seen leaving.

940
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,690
监控摄像头也拍到你开车离开了
The security cameras show you driving off.

941
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,060
而二十分钟后
And 20 minutes later,

942
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,330
我儿子看到我活得好好的
I'm seen alive and well by my son.

943
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:28,700
你看  你从头号嫌疑人
You see, you've gone from suspect number one

944
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,430
变成了不可能的凶手
to an impossibility.

945
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,160
原路返回
Leave the way you came

946
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:35,500
不要被发现
and don't be seen.

947
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:47,550
兰森
Ransom?

948
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,480
你又回来了吗
Are you back again already?

949
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,550
开车回家
Drive home.

950
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,230
接下来的几天内
And sometime in the next few days

951
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:00,400
警察会来询问你
the police will question you.

952
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,170
不  不  不  不  不
No. No, no, no. No!

953
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:04,560
我不能说谎
I can't lie!

954
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,710
你知道我不能说谎  我会吐的
You know I can't lie! I'll puke!

955
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:09,680
那就不要说谎  只说部分的真相
Well, then don't lie. Tell fragments of the truth.

956
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,670
严格按这个顺序说
In this exact order.

957
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,310
我送他上楼
I took him upstairs.

958
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,650
我们像平常每晚一样下了围棋
We played our nightly game of Go.

959
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,620
中途他把棋盘打翻了
At some point, he knocked the board over

960
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:31,160
然后琼妮上楼来查看我们的状况
and Joni came up to check on us.

961
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:36,300
我给他注射了止痛药
I gave him pain medication.

962
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,570
他上周把肩膀拉伤了
He pulled his shoulder last week.

963
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,700
然后我就离开了  他一个人留在书房里
And I left him in his study.

964
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,500
午夜时分
At midnight

965
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:47,270
我对沃尔特说再见
I said goodbye to Walt,

966
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,110
然后就回家了
went home.

967
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,010
你给了他什么药
What kind of medication did you give him?

968
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,990
他受伤之后  我一直在给他
Since his injury, I've been giving him

969
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:00,390
注射一百毫克的痛力克
a 100 milligram IV push of Toradol.

970
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,720
那是一种非麻醉性止痛药
It's a non-narcotic analgesic.

971
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,520
为了帮助他入睡
And to help him sleep,

972
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:07,260
我还给了他三毫克的吗啡
three milligrams of morphine.

973
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,070
他的家人知道这些吗
And the family was aware of this?

974
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:10,330
是的  他们当然知道
Yes, of course.

975
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,500
你有注意到他
Did you notice anything strange

976
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,330
有任何不同寻常的行为吗
or off about his demeanor?

977
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,210
没有
No.

978
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,480
听起来没问题
Well, that sounds about right.

979
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:28,150
谢谢你  卡布瑞拉小姐
Thank you, Miss Cabrera.

980
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:47,920
{\an8}我的宝贝

981
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,910
姐  大家快要过来
Hey, sis, people are gonna start getting here

982
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,640
参加纪念仪式了
for the memorial pretty soon.

983
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,770
你...
Are you...

984
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,640
你还好吗
Are you all right?

985
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:58,480
我只是在想爸爸的那些游戏
I was just thinking about Dad's games.

986
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,310
这一切就像是...
This all feels like one...

987
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,920
他笔下的情节  而非真实发生的事
Like something he'd write, not do.

988
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,720
我一直在等待揭示真相的时刻
I keep waiting for the big reveal.

989
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,130
到那时一切都说得通了
Where it'll make sense.

990
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:15,530
要是那样就好了
Wouldn't that be nice?

991
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,960
沃尔特
Oh, Walt.

992
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,740
我不觉得他是自杀的
I don't think he killed himself.

993
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,140
我不觉得  真不觉得
I don't. I really don't.

994
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,980
贺曼公司拍了一部电影
There's this Hallmark movie

995
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,280
叫《意外致死》  是丹妮卡·麦凯拉演的
called Deadly by Surprise with Danica McKellar.

996
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,920
她在里面演一个
And in it, she plays this wife

997
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,290
被丈夫下毒的妻子
who's getting poisoned by her husband,

998
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:34,990
但他是一点点下的毒
but he's doing it little by little,

999
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:35,990
所以她未曾察觉
so she doesn't know it

1000
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:38,520
后来她发了疯  自杀了
and she goes crazy, and she kills herself.

1001
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,990
我的表妹在法医办公室
And my cousin, who's a receptionist

1002
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,960
当接待员
at the medical examiner's office,

1003
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,960
她说这种事完全有可能发生
she says that stuff totally happens.

1004
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,800
其疯狂程度还不及
It's not even 3% as crazy

1005
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,400
她在那里见过的事情的百分之三
as the stuff she's seen come through there.

1006
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,930
所以我只是...
So, I'm just like...

1007
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:51,640
老天  没错
Oh, God, yeah!

1008
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,840
别因为你爱他就喜欢他
I mean, don't like him because you love him.

1009
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,780
不  我才不喜欢他  他就是个混蛋
No, I don't like him, he's an asshole.

1010
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,080
但说不定我们就需要一个混蛋呢
But maybe an asshole is what we needed.

1011
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,750
我的天  是啊
Oh, my God, yeah,

1012
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,380
德国人在三十年代那会儿
an asshole is what Germany needed

1013
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,420
-也需要一个混蛋  -又来了
- in 1930-whatever. - Here we go.

1014
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,420
得了  琼妮  这两件事压根不能相提并论
Come on, Joni, those two things don't even conflate.

1015
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,630
-问题在于...  -上帝啊
- There is the problem... - Oh, Jesus.

1016
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,860
政治话题结束前我还是消失好了
I'm gonna disappear until the politics talk is done.

1017
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,550
-你  我的朋友...  -要来点香槟吗
- You, my friend... - You want some champers?

1018
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,930
不行  严格来讲我在工作
I can't. I'm technically working.

1019
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:18,100
别维护特朗普了  理查德
Why don't you take off your red cap, Richard,

1020
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,160
看看你周围
and look around you?

1021
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:21,170
街上到处都是纳粹分子
The streets are literally flooded with Nazis.

1022
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:22,370
不不不  不不不
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1023
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:26,200
-我们正在失去我们的生活方式和文化  -正是
- We are losing our way of life and our culture. - That's right.

1024
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,010
上百万的墨西哥人正在涌入
There are millions of Mexicans coming.

1025
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:29,840
-天啊  你来真的吗  -这不是种族歧视
- Oh, God, really? - Don't make this a race thing.

1026
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,750
你们总觉得这是种族歧视  如果是欧洲移民
You always make this a race thing. I would say the same thing

1027
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:31,780
{\an8}没错  这不是种族歧视
Yeah, this is not about race.

1028
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,180
我也会说同样的话
if they were European immigrants.

1029
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,350
是吗  如果是瑞士人
Oh, yeah? So, if the Swiss were, like,

1030
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:38,180
-堵住了街道  -不不  我们接纳他们
- clogging in the streets... - No. No, no, we allow them in

1031
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,890
然后他们就反客为主了
and they think they own what's ours.

1032
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:42,650
他们把孩子们关在笼子里
They're putting children in cages!

1033
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:43,660
-简直就是集中营  -没错
- I mean, these are camps! - Yes.

1034
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:44,560
行了  琼妮
Come on, Joni,

1035
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,530
没人觉得那是什么好事
nobody's saying that isn't bad,

1036
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:48,260
但要怪就怪家长们
but the parents have some blame here.

1037
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,760
因为什么  因为想给孩子创造更好的生活吗
Oh, for what? For wanting a better life for their kids?

1038
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,380
-这不正是美国精神吗  -因为他们违法了
- Isn't that what America is... - For breaking the law!

1039
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,180
-你不会想听这话的  -老天
- And you're gonna hate hearing this, - My God.

1040
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:58,500
但这是实话  美国是属于美国人民的
but it's true, America is for Americans.

1041
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,440
别指着我
Don't point at me.

1042
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,810
玛塔去哪了  她还在这里吗
Where's Marta? Is she still here?

1043
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:01,740
-老天  别这样  -玛塔
- Oh, God, don't. - Marta!

1044
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,640
-过来  -别  理查德
- Come on over. - No, Richard.

1045
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,210
过来  玛塔  请你过来
Come on over, Marta. Please, come over.

1046
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:06,080
你开什么玩笑
You're shitting me.

1047
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,170
玛塔
Marta,

1048
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:11,450
你家里是乌拉圭的  但你用了正确的方式
your family is from Uruguay, but you did it right.

1049
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:13,890
我是说  他们是通过合法途径移民的
I mean, what I'm saying is they did it legally.

1050
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:15,770
她用了正确的方式
She did it the right way.

1051
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,290
你努力工作
You work hard,

1052
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:19,930
从零开始挣得财富
and you'll earn your share from the ground up.

1053
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:22,330
就像爸爸  像我们所有人一样
Just like Dad and like all the rest of us.

1054
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:24,030
我想你们都同意我说的话吧
And I'll bet you agree with me, right?

1055
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:26,470
别烦这可怜的姑娘了  理查德
Oh, just leave the poor girl alone, Richard.

1056
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:29,200
没事的  我只想听听她会怎么说
It's okay! I just wanna hear what she has to say!

1057
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,240
没事的  玛塔  你尽管说
It's okay, Marta, you can speak.

1058
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,040
亲爱的  你不一定要回答
Oh, sweetheart, don't feel pressure to answer.

1059
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,240
-这只是...  -听着
- This is just a... - Look...

1060
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,310
-请别这样  -如果你想成为美国人
- Please don't. - If you wanna become an American,

1061
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:38,880
可以走合法途径
there are legal ways to do it.

1062
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,310
但如果你违反了法律
But if you break the law,

1063
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:42,710
那么就算你的初心再好
it doesn't matter how good your heart is,

1064
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,380
也得承担后果
you gotta face the consequences!

1065
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,050
你他妈的是疯了吗
Are you goddamn insane?

1066
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:49,420
-我已经弄完了  -我警告你
- It's done. - I'm warning you.

1067
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:56,190
于是我问她说
That's when I ask her, I'm like,

1068
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,260
"托雅  说真的  人们都是怎么了"
"Tonya, what is wrong with people, literally?"

1069
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:01,290
天啊  玛塔  怎么了
Oh, my God! Marta, what?

1070
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:02,700
玛塔
Marta?

1071
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,130
怎么了
What's the matter?

1072
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:06,240
深呼吸
Whoa, whoa. Hey. Breathe.

1073
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,230
-我的天  -玛塔  你还好吗
- Oh, my gosh. - Marta, are you okay?

1074
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,770
弗兰  你还有藏货吗
Hey, Fran, do you still have your stash?

1075
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:18,950
你需要可以随时来拿
Take 'em whenever you need 'em.

1076
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:21,220
你给我那支电子烟后我就不怎么抽这些了
They're just drying out since you gave me that Juul.

1077
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,180
谢了  弗兰
Thanks, Fran.

1078
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,850
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1079
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,730
抱歉  我真的非常抱歉
I'm sorry. I'm just very, very sorry.

1080
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:29,330
-别再说抱歉了  老天  -我也不想这样
- Stop. Stop saying you're sorry. Jesus! - I hate this.

1081
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:31,230
老天  我的心脏无法停止地...
Oh, God, my heart won't stop...

1082
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:32,320
我无法...
I can't...

1083
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,490
就是所有事情都...不用  谢谢你
It's just everything... No, thank you.

1084
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,270
弗兰就把东西藏在这里吗
That's where Fran keeps her stash?

1085
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:43,500
谁会去查看一个座钟呢
Who's gonna open a clock?

1086
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:46,740
您想吃晚餐吗  奶奶
Do you want dinner, Nana?

1087
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,970
晚餐  吃晚餐
Dinner? To eat?

1088
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:51,080
-吃晚餐  -沃尔特
- To eat? - Walt?

1089
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:52,680
-奶奶  -沃尔特  沃尔特  她好得很
- Nana? - Walt, Walt, she's fine.

1090
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:55,150
她把三文鱼抹酱全吃光了
She ate the entire salmon spread already.

1091
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,420
沃尔特  你告诉玛塔我们刚刚谈的事情了吗
Walt? Did you tell Marta yet, what we all talked about?

1092
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:01,260
还没有  现在说合适吗
No, not yet. Is now a good time?

1093
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,560
是的  现在正好  就现在
Yes. Yes, a very good time, right now.

1094
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,860
好的
Oh, okay.

1095
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:06,790
好了  冷静
All right. Calm down.

1096
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,530
玛塔  我们好好谈了谈
Marta, we've been talking it over and, uh...

1097
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:17,840
-你是不是吸大麻了  -没有
- Have you been smoking grass? - No.

1098
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:19,710
快点
Come on.

1099
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:21,080
玛塔  我们好好谈了谈
Marta, we've been talking it over,

1100
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,510
我们全家
and, uh, the whole family,

1101
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,980
我们愿意照顾你
we'd like to take care of you.

1102
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,550
这话什么意思
What does that mean?

1103
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:31,820
我们都认为你应该得到些什么
We all think that you deserve something.

1104
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:34,220
我们愿意在经济上帮助你
Financially, we'd like to help you out.

1105
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:36,190
你对爸爸一直很好
You were never anything but good to Dad

1106
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,260
就凭这一点我们...
and because of that we...

1107
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:41,730
你可以依靠我们
You can count on us.

1108
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:43,630
好
Yeah.

1109
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:48,410
我觉得你应该来参加葬礼的
I thought you should've been at the funeral,

1110
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:50,540
但我少数不敌多数
by the way, I was outvoted.

1111
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:02,380
侦探
Detective.

1112
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,120
你还在这里
You're still here?

1113
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,930
你认识哈兰吗
Did you know Harlan?

1114
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:14,670
他认识我父亲
He knew my father,

1115
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:16,830
我父亲多年前是一名警探
who was a police detective years ago.

1116
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:21,070
他很敬重哈兰
My father respected Harlan.

1117
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,040
说明哈兰一定很值得敬重
That says quite a lot.

1118
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:24,800
这就是为什么你在这里吗
Is that why you're here?

1119
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:27,670
现在在这里吗
Here now, here?

1120
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:29,270
不是
No.

1121
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:32,680
我在这里是想和你多聊上几句
I stayed hoping to speak to you a little more.

1122
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:40,920
整件事背后另有隐情
Something is afoot with this whole affair.

1123
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,190
我知道
I know it.

1124
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,620
我想你也知道
I believe you know it, too.

1125
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:49,460
所以你打算一直查下去吗
So you're gonna keep digging?

1126
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,540
哈兰笔下的警探就会深查
Harlan's detectives, they dig.

1127
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,670
他们会翻找  搜寻
They riffle and root.

1128
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,240
就像寻找松露的猪一样
Truffle pigs.

1129
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,770
我期待着《万有引力之虹》的终章
I anticipate the terminus of Gravity's Rainbow.

1130
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:04,910
《万有引力之虹》
Gravity's Rainbow?

1131
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:06,550
是本小说
It's a novel.

1132
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:07,750
我知道
Yeah, I know.

1133
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:10,960
-不过我还没看过  -我也没有
- I haven't read it though. - Neither have I.

1134
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,020
没人看过
Nobody has.

1135
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,590
不过我喜欢这标题
But I like the title.

1136
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:18,920
它描绘了自然法则决定的事物轨迹
It describes the path of a projectile determined by natural law.

1137
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,290
也就是  我的方法
Et voila, my method.

1138
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:23,030
我观察客观事实
I observe the facts

1139
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,740
不受大脑或心灵的主观偏见影响
without biases of the head or heart.

1140
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,570
我找出轨迹的走向
I determine the arc's path,

1141
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:29,800
闲庭信步至其尽头
stroll leisurely to its terminus

1142
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,770
真相就出现在我眼前了
and the truth falls at my feet.

1143
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,750
法医已经打算将这起案子判定为自杀
The medical examiner was ready to rule this a suicide,

1144
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:42,180
但艾略特同意等48小时再做决定
but Elliott agreed to keep it pending for 48 hours.

1145
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,460
明天一早
Tomorrow morning,

1146
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,020
我就去房子及其周围搜查
I search the grounds and the house,

1147
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,720
开始我的调查工作
begin my investigation.

1148
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:50,160
我希望你能在边上辅助我
I want you to be by my side for it.

1149
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,560
-什么  -做我的知己
- What? - My confidante.

1150
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,360
我的耳目
My eyes and ears.

1151
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:54,370
等一下  侦探  为什么是我
Wait, wait, Detective. Why me?

1152
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:56,830
我相信你那颗善良的心
I trust your kind heart.

1153
00:51:58,700 --> 00:51:59,640
而且你是唯一一位
Also, you're the only one

1154
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,200
从哈兰的死中得不到任何好处的人
who had nothing to gain from Harlan's death.

1155
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,640
怎么样  华生
So how about it, Watson?

1156
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,740
侦探先生
Hey, Detective?

1157
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:09,170
以我对这一家人的了解
If you want my insight into the family...

1158
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:12,110
他们都不可能是凶手
None of them are murderers.

1159
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:13,910
这就是我的看法
That's my insight.

1160
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:15,110
然而
And yet,

1161
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,920
无论结果残忍还是令人欣慰
be it cruel or comforting,

1162
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:21,820
真相终究会准确无误地被揭开
this machine unerringly arrives at the truth.

1163
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,320
注定如此
That's what it does.

1164
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,690
一向如此吗
Always?

1165
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:29,390
明早八点
Tomorrow at 8:00.

1166
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:01,570
我肯定漏掉了什么
I know I've missed something.

1167
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:03,130
一定漏掉了什么
There's gonna be something I missed.

1168
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,970
-哈兰  -但我知道你能行的
- Harlan. - But I know you can do this.

1169
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:07,030
-我做不到  -你无需泯灭良知
- No, I can't. - Without losing your soul,

1170
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,970
你只是不得不这么做  才能...
you have to do what you have to do to...

1171
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:10,280
-不  -战胜这一切  赢得胜利
- No. - beat this and win.

1172
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,580
哈兰  我做不到
Harlan, I can't.

1173
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:14,640
-你能  而且必须做到  -不行
- You can. And you have to. - No.

1174
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:16,040
为了我
For me.

1175
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:17,840
快去
Right now!

1176
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,100
哈兰  我得去求助
Harlan, I have to get you help.

1177
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,230
只要照我说的做
You do as I say

1178
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,740
一切都会没事的
and everything will be just fine.

1179
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:47,850
不  不要
No. No.

1180
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,040
我保证
I promise.

1181
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:51,110
但...
But...

1182
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:03,110
五十年前我就在这庄园工作了
Fifty years ago, I worked this estate.

1183
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:06,140
要知道那时候的安保工作可不容易
You know, security back then was such that

1184
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:09,910
你得带着枪去巡查
you had to make the rounds with a 94

1185
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:12,260
要时刻保持警惕
and keep your ears open.

1186
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:16,370
但如今我们拥有这么多现代科技
Now you've got all this modern technology.

1187
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,360
监控录像在这里
Now, that's the video there.

1188
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,080
我把案发当晚的录像保存了下来
I saved the tape from that night.

1189
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,210
通常我会把录像带做消磁处理
Normally, I erase 'em with a magnetic degausser,

1190
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:28,850
但这晚的我想还是保存下来得好  对吧
but in this case, I thought I'd just save it, you know?

1191
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:30,570
以防万一
For security.

1192
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,660
这边是实时画面
Now, uh, that's a live feed there.

1193
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:36,700
为避开监控摄像头
To avoid the security cameras,

1194
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,540
在大象雕塑之后停车
pull off the road after the carved elephant.

1195
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,760
好的  能让我们看一下案发当晚的录像吗
All right, well, can we see the actual tape?

1196
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,570
当然可以
Well, of course you can.

1197
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:46,020
我全都录下来了
I recorded it SSLP.

1198
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,960
这盘录像带有八个小时的内容
There's eight hours in that tape.

1199
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,340
晚九点到早五点
9 p.m. to 5 a.m.

1200
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:56,670
{\an8}播放

1201
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:01,930
像日本恐怖片一样
Looks like a Japanese horror movie.

1202
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:04,170
能快进吗
You think we could scan forward on that?

1203
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:05,420
是不是看过后七天就会死亡
Are we all gonna die in seven days?

1204
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:06,600
怎么快进
How can we scan forward?

1205
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,470
按住播放键
Oh, yeah, just hold the play button down

1206
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:12,850
再按快进键  听到转动声就行了
and press FF until you hear it grind.

1207
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,470
好了  应该快到
All right. Should be coming up now

1208
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:22,640
派对结束的时间段了
to the time when the party ended.

1209
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:26,390
怎么回事
What happened?

1210
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:29,690
你得一直按着  不然带子就会弹出来
You gotta keep holding it down or else it'll eject.

1211
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,480
{\an8}监控录像

1212
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:31,880
这机器年久失修了
That thing eats tapes like popcorn.

1213
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,980
你的人能把这录像导入电脑
You think your guys can digitize this

1214
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,410
让我们仔细看一下吗
so we could scan it properly?

1215
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:37,150
应该没问题
Yeah, I think we can do that.

1216
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,050
我拿着
I got it.

1217
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:43,540
知道吗  这树林里的各种雕像
You know, all these statues that you see around here?

1218
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,870
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}儿童奇幻系列丛书

1219
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,980
都是按照《动物园悲剧》三部曲
They're all straight out of the series,

1220
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,870
里面的形象制作的
The Menagerie Tragedy Trilogy.

1221
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,820
-真酷  -棒极了
- Pretty cool. - Awesome.

1222
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,080
是啊
Yeah.

1223
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:52,700
贝尼  这地方是挺漂亮的
Benny, it's beautiful out here,

1224
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,670
但你真的认为有人闯进房子
but do you really think someone broke into the house

1225
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:55,480
谋杀了哈兰吗
and murdered Harlan?

1226
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,360
我们是为了这个来的吗
Is that why we're out here?

1227
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,210
我认为可能性不大
Oh, it is unlikely,

1228
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:00,570
但如果真是这样  一定会留下踪迹
but if they did, there will be traces.

1229
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:02,940
-我来拿着吧  -好
- Uh, I can hang on to that. - Yeah.

1230
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:14,560
瓦格纳  你联系上...
Hey, Wagner, you got any luck on...

1231
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:16,820
-那个谁没有  -兰森吗
- Uh, what's-his-name? - Ransom?

1232
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,690
-对  -没有
- Yeah. - No.

1233
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:21,470
只查到了地址
Did get an address though.

1234
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:24,750
-是吗  -肯诺克街10号
-Yeah? - 10 Kenoak Street.

1235
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,240
肯...肯诺克
Ken... Kenoak?

1236
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:28,670
肯诺克
Kenoak.

1237
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:32,410
读起来还挺带感的  是吧
It's a pleasant thing to say, isn't it?

1238
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:33,590
肯诺克
Kenoak.

1239
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:36,950
我在肯诺克街醒来
I awoke amid Kenoak.

1240
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:39,610
这么多落叶和泥巴
All these leaves and mud,

1241
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:42,410
我这双鞋算是没法要了
they're really gonna do a number on my boots, man.

1242
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:45,350
泥巴  上周下过雨吗
Mud. Did it rain the past week?

1243
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:47,620
-站住别动  -怎么了
- No, stay there! - What?

1244
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:49,540
别动
Okay.

1245
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,400
这里有脚印  所以...
We got footprints here, so, uh...

1246
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,130
我要...
I wanna, um...

1247
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:54,730
玛塔
Marta...

1248
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,410
-别走了  -什么
- Stop. - What?

1249
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:57,520
什么
What?

1250
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,040
玛塔  在那别动
Marta, stay there.

1251
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,130
-什么  -别  玛塔  别动  玛塔
- What? - No, Marta! Stay there, Marta.

1252
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:02,780
-别过来  -我听不清  再说...
- No! No! - I couldn't hear. If you...

1253
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,830
-你喊我了吗  -好吧
- Did you call me? - All right.

1254
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:04,550
-算了  -借过
- All right. - Excuse me.

1255
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:05,680
-没事  -过来
- All right. - Come here.

1256
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,250
瓦格纳  我们得联系下局里
Wagner, we're gonna need to call the boys,

1257
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,070
让他们派人过来
have 'em come down here,

1258
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:09,530
检查一下这些脚印
take a look at all these tracks.

1259
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:11,150
把脚印复制下来  往那边走
Get it taped off. Stay on that side.

1260
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:12,410
-真抱歉  -小心  小心
- I'm sorry. - Watch out. Watch out.

1261
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:13,770
好的
Okay.

1262
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:18,890
希希  希希
Hussie? Hussie, hey.

1263
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:22,240
狗能看透人的品性
Best judge of character is a dog.

1264
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:24,760
-好孩子  -此话不假
- Good boy. - I've found that to be true.

1265
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:32,260
小狗狗
My puppies!

1266
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:35,830
他们计划在十点左右宣读遗嘱
They've got plans to read the will at around 10:00,

1267
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:38,800
很快全家人就会到齐了
so, the whole family will be here soon.

1268
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:42,730
我从没参加过遗嘱宣读
I've never been to a will reading.

1269
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:44,340
也许
Oh, well...

1270
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:46,100
你以为会像游戏节目一样精彩
You think it'd be like a game show,

1271
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:50,890
但其实就像社区剧团演的报税会议一样无聊
but think of a community theater production of a tax return.

1272
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,400
有什么是我们需要留意的
So, what are we looking for?

1273
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,640
就是
Oh, you know,

1274
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,680
所有可疑的或者不寻常的事情
anything suspicious or out of the ordinary.

1275
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:00,690
你见到就会明白
You'll know it when you see it.

1276
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:02,950
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

1277
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,500
吓我一跳
Sweet beans!

1278
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,570
那...
Well...

1279
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:13,440
早上好  斯隆贝夫人
Good morning, Mrs. Thrombey.

1280
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,160
你准备好回到书房了吗
You think you could handle the study?

1281
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:36,070
你的医疗包在哪
Where's your medical bag?

1282
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:38,350
不知道  我放在这儿了
I don't know. I left it here.

1283
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:40,040
每天晚上我都放在哈兰这儿
I always leave it here with Harlan at night.

1284
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,170
一定是被作为证物拿走了
They must have taken it in as evidence.

1285
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:43,470
我问一下
I'll look into that.

1286
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:49,990
该死
Shit.

1287
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,860
围棋棋盘是怎么被打翻的
How'd the Go board get knocked over?

1288
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,030
玩闹的时候不小心碰掉的
We were just goofing around.

1289
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:00,180
你在想什么
What are you thinking?

1290
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:16,100
别闹 别闹
No! No, no, no!

1291
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,210
让我猜猜
Oh, let me guess.

1292
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:21,650
别闹了  停下
Hey! Stop. Stop.

1293
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,810
停下  停下
Stop. Stop.

1294
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:25,740
休·德莱斯戴尔
Hugh Drysdale?

1295
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:29,380
兰森  叫我兰森  我的中间名
Ransom. Call me Ransom, it's my middle name.

1296
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,130
只有佣人才叫我休
Only the help calls me Hugh.

1297
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,640
好吧
Okay.

1298
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,590
这位是瓦格纳警员
Uh, this is Trooper Wagner.

1299
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:36,250
我是艾略特警督
I'm Lieutenant Elliott.

1300
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:38,440
我们得问你几个问题
We just wanna ask a few questions.

1301
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:43,780
等一下
Excuse me?

1302
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:45,770
先生
Sir?

1303
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:47,650
我们是执法人员
We're officers of the law!

1304
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:49,660
你们要因为我不配合逮捕我吗
You gonna run me in? I don't feel like talking.

1305
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:51,110
正烦着呢
I'm distraught.

1306
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:53,530
贝尼  你要询问这家伙吗
Hey, Benny, you wanna ask this guy some questions?

1307
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:54,920
这是要干什么  有什么安排吗
All right, what is this? What's this arrangement?

1308
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,500
德莱斯戴尔先生
Mr. Drysdale.

1309
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:59,190
在拍《犯罪现场调查之南方乡巴佬篇》吗
CSI: KFC?

1310
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:05,280
弗兰妮
Hey, Frannie,

1311
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,790
麻烦你倒一杯冰牛奶
how about a glass of cold milk?

1312
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:08,410
混蛋
Hey, asshole.

1313
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:10,320
她不叫那个名字  也不干那种活
Not her name, not her job.

1314
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,440
梅格  你的激进社会正义学位读得怎么样了
Hey, Meg. How's the SJW degree coming?

1315
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,490
-靠信托基金过活的废物  -够了  各位
- Trust fund prick. - All right, guys.

1316
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:19,760
大家好
Hey. Everyone...

1317
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,590
我要去另一个房间做准备工作
I'm just gonna be in the other room, setting up.

1318
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:24,330
十分钟后开始宣读
Be ready in 10 minutes.

1319
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:31,860
挺有意思  兰森  你缺席了葬礼
Funny, Ransom, you skipped the funeral,

1320
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:34,100
却早早地到了遗嘱宣读会
but you're early for the will reading.

1321
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:37,740
别这样  大家悼念的方式不尽相同
Okay, people grieve in different ways.

1322
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:38,700
我们就不要...
Let's not...

1323
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,380
可笑的是  你居然还好意思过来
You know what? It's funny you're here at all.

1324
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:41,510
你费什么劲呢
Why are you even bothering?

1325
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:43,550
我不禁这样问自己
That's what I'm asking myself.

1326
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,970
这话是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

1327
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:46,540
他知道我什么意思
He knows what it's supposed to mean.

1328
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,490
等等  沃尔特  什么
Wait... Walt, what?

1329
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:53,910
派对当晚雅各布就待在那个洗手间里
Jacob was in that bathroom the night of the party.

1330
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:57,210
原来你整晚就待在那呢
Oh, that's where you were all night?

1331
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:59,760
你整晚待在洗手间干什么
What the hell were you doing in the bathroom all night?

1332
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,740
-什么也没干  -口诛笔伐叙利亚难民吗
- Nothing. - Swatting Syrian refugees?

1333
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:02,770
不  我没有
No, I was not.

1334
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:03,870
另类右派键盘侠
Alt-right troll.

1335
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:04,870
玻璃心自由派
Liberal snowflake.

1336
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:06,670
我都不知道你们说的是什么意思
I don't know what any of that means.

1337
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:08,370
意思是你儿子有点变态
It means your son's a little creep.

1338
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:11,010
是吗  我儿子变态吗
Oh! My son's a creep?

1339
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:12,700
各位  回到正题...
Guys, just...

1340
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,040
沃尔特  他当时在洗手间里
Walt, he was in the bathroom.

1341
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,450
对  他在洗手间里
Yeah, he was in the bathroom.

1342
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:18,970
对着死鹿的照片毫无快感地自慰
Joylessly masturbating to pictures of dead deer.

1343
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:21,390
你来劲了是吧  理查德
You know what, Richard?

1344
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:22,260
你想干一架吗
You wanna go?

1345
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:23,880
来啊  死瘸子  干一架
You bet, skippy, let's go.

1346
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,510
你想干一架是吧  来啊
You wanna go? Come on!

1347
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:26,260
你最好小心点  伙计
You better watch out, man.

1348
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,070
-沃尔特  马上住手  -狗娘养的
- Walt, stop it right now! - Son of a bitch!

1349
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:29,340
-住手  停下来  -住手
- Stop it! Just stop! - Stop it!

1350
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:30,020
放手  放开  理查德
Let go! Let go, Richard!

1351
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:32,030
我等这一天等了很久了
I have been waiting for this my whole life!

1352
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:34,330
-马上住手  -唐娜  我能控制住自己
- Stop it, right now! - Donna, I can handle myself!

1353
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:35,810
-住手  -我能控制住
- Stop it! - I can handle it.

1354
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:37,430
天啊
Oh, my God.

1355
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:39,370
我们得多像这样聚聚
We gotta do this more often.

1356
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,270
雅各布
Jacob.

1357
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:44,010
我们知道你们想干嘛
We know where this is going.

1358
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:46,130
你在哈兰办公室旁边的洗手间里
You were in the bathroom next to Harlan's office,

1359
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:47,850
那天晚上他和兰森在里面起了争执
where he had the fight with Ransom.

1360
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:49,390
你肯定听到了些什么
Now, you heard something.

1361
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:50,860
说吧
Spill it.

1362
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,350
我只听到了两句话
I just heard two things.

1363
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,360
我的遗嘱
...my will.

1364
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:00,880
"我的遗嘱"
"My will."

1365
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:04,020
然后又大嚷大叫了一番
And then there was more yelling.

1366
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,070
然后我就听到兰森说
And then I heard Ransom say...

1367
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,470
"我警告你"
"I'm warning you."

1368
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:14,510
兰森
Ransom...

1369
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:16,390
那句话是什么意思
What's that mean?

1370
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:19,140
我觉得那意味着我们的父亲终于醒悟过来
I think it means our father finally came to his senses

1371
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:22,060
打算把这个混账玩意儿从他的遗嘱里划掉
and cut this worthless little brat out of his will.

1372
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,020
看来你得卖掉宝马车
So I guess you're gonna have to sell the Beemer

1373
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:27,030
退出乡村俱乐部
and give your notice at the country club,

1374
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:29,410
戒掉那些高级毒品了
and kick whatever fashion drug you're on.

1375
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:30,800
因为要是你觉得
Because if you think

1376
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,890
在你跟家里人的关系闹成这么僵之后
that after all the bridges you've burned,

1377
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:34,140
在你说过那些混账话之后
after all the shit you said,

1378
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,360
就凭你在过去十年间对这个家的
after everything that you put this family through

1379
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,610
所作所为
for the last 10 years,

1380
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:40,270
你别以为我们中的任何一人还会支持你
that any of us are gonna support you

1381
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:42,330
或者给你分一杯羹
that any of us are gonna give you,

1382
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:44,120
就像老爸常说的
like Dad liked to say,

1383
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,440
就算是"一毛钱"
"A single red dime..."

1384
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,150
绝不可能
you're nuts!

1385
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:53,500
儿子
Son...

1386
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:55,790
父亲
Father.

1387
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:59,890
哈兰告诉过你他要把你从遗嘱中除名吗
Did Harlan tell you he was gonna cut you out of the will?

1388
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:02,980
没错
Yep.

1389
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,220
那他可算是做了我们都没有勇气做到的事情
Well, then he's done what none of us were strong enough to do.

1390
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:14,790
也许这件事终于能让你长大了
Maybe this might finally make you grow up.

1391
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:20,350
这可能是发生在你身上最好的事情
This might be the best thing... that could ever happen to you.

1392
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:22,870
谢谢  这就是我的母亲  女士们先生们
Thank you. My mother, ladies and gentlemen.

1393
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:25,320
听着  这对你来说肯定不容易
Look, this is not gonna be easy for you,

1394
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:27,100
但这是件好事
but it'll be good.

1395
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:29,440
良药苦口利于病
Nothing good is ever easy.

1396
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:30,740
放你妈的屁  琼妮
Up your ass, Joni.

1397
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:32,950
你吸我们家的血都吸了多久了
You've had your teeth in this family's tit for a long time.

1398
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:35,080
"放你妈的屁"  真是多谢夸奖
"Up your ass"? Oh, very nice.

1399
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,240
-我直说了  吃屎去吧  -天啊  兰森
- Matter of fact, eat shit. - Oh, my God, Ransom.

1400
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,510
-你说什么  -怎么样
- What? - How's that?

1401
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:40,070
-再直白点  -请别在我儿子面前说那种话
- In fact... - Please do not use that word in front of my son.

1402
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:42,010
-你吃屎  你也吃屎  -要不是我在练...
- eat shit. Eat shit. - If I wasn't practicing...

1403
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:43,480
-吃屎  -你这个混蛋
- Eat shit. - You entitled prick!

1404
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,230
我真想一巴掌扇翻你那该死的脸
I would slap that smug smile right off...

1405
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:46,820
-你必须得吃屎去  -扇掉那得意的奸笑
- Definitely eat shit. - ...of your goddamn face!

1406
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:49,070
你也吃屎  你们都吃屎去吧
Eat shit. You can all eat shit.

1407
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:53,830
我一点屎都不会吃
I'm not eating one iota of shit!

1408
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:58,050
是谁说遗嘱宣读会很无聊来着
What was that about will readings being boring?

1409
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:01,010
看来这次是例外了
The exception that proves the rule.

1410
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:04,470
混蛋
Asshole.

1411
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,350
"我警告你"
"I'm warning you."

1412
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,100
兰森说  "我警告你"
Ransom said, "I'm warning you."

1413
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,480
你刚刚也听到兰森说的了
Well, you heard Ransom in there.

1414
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,340
他这种人就是会说那种话
That's the kind of thing he says.

1415
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,670
你想要吗  你想要吗
You want this? You want this?

1416
01:05:20,010 --> 01:05:22,270
这是什么
What do we have here?

1417
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:31,180
这断面看起来还很新
This looks like a relatively fresh break.

1418
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,410
没错  就在那
Yep. Right there.

1419
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,240
等等
Wait a minute.

1420
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,400
这没道理啊
Well, that doesn't make sense.

1421
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,740
那扇窗户通向哪里
Where's that window?

1422
01:05:40,010 --> 01:05:42,250
再吃点饼干怎么样  休
How about some more cookies, Hugh?

1423
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:45,340
-你想再吃点饼干吗  -真好  太好了
- You want some more cookies? - That's great. That's great.

1424
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:48,510
说不定哈兰在遗嘱里给你留了一杯冰牛奶
Hey, maybe Harlan left you a cold glass of milk in his will.

1425
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:50,090
混蛋
Asshole.

1426
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:54,080
指给我看  但不要踩地毯
Show me. But stay off the carpet.

1427
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,430
是暗窗
It's the trick window

1428
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,460
是《四季谋杀》里的
from A Kill For All Seasons.

1429
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:14,620
警员  你可以拿一下这个吗
Trooper, here, will you? Take this.

1430
01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:29,300
干燥的泥土痕迹
Traces of dried mud.

1431
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:32,720
我怀疑整条走廊上都有这样的痕迹
I suspect they go the length of the hallway.

1432
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:34,900
有脚印吗
Footprints?

1433
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,670
没有  只有泥屑
No, just traces.

1434
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:39,530
根据这地毯最后一次清洗的时间推断
Yeah, depending on when this thing was last cleaned,

1435
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:42,700
这痕迹指不定是什么时候留下来的  对吧
this could have happened at any time, right?

1436
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:45,370
不对  这里也有类似的痕迹
No, that would not explain this.

1437
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:47,900
分析那上面的泥
Analyze that mud.

1438
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:49,640
肯定会跟这些泥痕相符
It will match these traces.

1439
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:50,360
把这个带去给杰米
Take this to Jamie.

1440
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:51,970
屋外肯定有类似的泥痕
And you will find similar samples

1441
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:54,630
沿着棚架一路分布到窗台
leading up the trellis on the outside of the house.

1442
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:56,570
在派对当晚
On the night of the party,

1443
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:59,550
一个不想被发现的人爬上了棚架
somebody who did not want to be heard climbing those steps,

1444
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:01,210
费了九牛二虎之力
went to a great deal of trouble

1445
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:03,560
闯进了哈兰·斯隆贝的房间
to break into Harlan Thrombey's rooms.

1446
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:07,260
游戏开始了  对吧  华生
The game is afoot, eh, Watson?

1447
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:20,810
感谢大家能像这样聚在一起
Well, thank you all for getting together like this.

1448
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:22,930
法律上没有如此必要
It isn't legally necessary,

1449
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:24,620
但我想因为你们都在城里
but I thought because you're all in town,

1450
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:26,160
而且你们中的一些人很快就要离开
and some of you are leaving soon...

1451
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,270
打扰一下
Excuse me.

1452
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:29,260
抱歉
Uh, I'm sorry.

1453
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:32,840
女士们先生们  我想礼貌地请你们
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to gently request

1454
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:36,900
在案件调查结束前都留在城里
that you all stay in town until the investigation is completed.

1455
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,680
他是在礼貌地请你们
Yeah, well, he's gently requesting,

1456
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,420
但我得命令你们待在城里
but I'm gonna have to make that an order.

1457
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:42,600
在我们调查清楚之前谁也不许走
No one move until we figure this all out.

1458
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,390
什么
What?

1459
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:44,680
我们能问为什么吗
Can we ask why?

1460
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,060
-案情有什么变化吗  -没有
- Has something changed? - No.

1461
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:48,110
是没有变化  还是我们不能问
No, it hasn't changed? Or no, we can't ask?

1462
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:49,650
斯蒂文斯先生...
Mr. Stevens...

1463
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:51,510
你可以继续了
You may continue.

1464
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:53,260
好  那么...
Right. Well...

1465
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:57,220
我认为大家应该齐聚一堂的另一个原因是
The other reason I thought this gathering would be, uh, beneficial

1466
01:07:57,220 --> 01:08:02,500
哈兰在死前一周更改了他的遗嘱
is because Harlan altered his will a week before he died.

1467
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:03,930
他把遗嘱密封了
He sealed it.

1468
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:06,240
他让我等到他死后
He asked me not to submit it to the courts

1469
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,970
再将遗嘱提交给法院认证
for probate until after his death.

1470
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:10,990
所以  如果谁对哪里有疑虑
So, if anyone is confused about anything,

1471
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:13,430
我们都聚在一起  可以当场讨论
we're all together, we can talk.

1472
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,520
尽管我并不认为
Although I don't imagine any of it

1473
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,400
遗嘱会有多么复杂的地方
is going to be that complicated.

1474
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,640
哈兰的资产包括...
Uh, Harlan's assets included...

1475
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:22,130
-这栋房子  -这栋房子
- The house. - The house,

1476
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:23,760
这完全归他所有
which he owned outright.

1477
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:25,910
六千万美金
$60 million.

1478
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:28,720
对  各种形式的总计六千万美金
Yes. $60 million in various cash accounts

1479
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,170
包括现金账户与投资
and investments.

1480
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:31,820
当然了  还有
And of course,

1481
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:33,750
真正的财产所在
the real asset,

1482
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:36,350
烈酒如血出版公司的全部所有权
sole ownership of Blood Like Wine,

1483
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:37,830
也就是他的出版公司
his publishing company.

1484
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:41,370
他变更遗嘱时还写了一份声明
He also wrote up a statement when he was making the changes

1485
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:43,320
他希望能先读这个
and he wanted that read first.

1486
01:08:45,810 --> 01:08:48,570
"亲爱的琳达  沃尔特和琼妮
"Dearest Linda, Walter, and Joni...

1487
01:08:48,570 --> 01:08:51,450
我做出的选择可能会让你们某些人吃惊
Some of you may be surprised by the choice I've made here.

1488
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:53,890
除名的过程并不好受
No pleasure was taken in the exclusion.

1489
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:55,730
并且这份遗嘱的目的
And its purpose was not to sow

1490
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:57,320
不是为了在这个家里埋下更深的分歧
greater discord in the family,

1491
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,120
恰恰相反
Quite the opposite.

1492
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,780
请从容地接受它  不要心怀怨怼
Please accept it with grace and without bitterness,

1493
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:03,220
但请你们接受它
But do accept it,

1494
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:05,520
这是最好的选择  爸爸"
It's for the best. Dad."

1495
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:21,950
好的  完全不复杂
Well, yeah, not too complex at all.

1496
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,980
读起来很快
This will be quick.

1497
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:28,710
"我  哈兰·斯隆贝  头脑清醒身体健康"
"I, Harlan Thrombey, being of sound mind and body"

1498
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:31,000
然后是一堆废话
and yada-yada-yada...

1499
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:33,840
"我特此将我的所有资产
"I hereby direct that all my assets,

1500
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,540
包括流动资产与固定资产
both liquid and otherwise...

1501
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:39,550
尽数留给玛塔·卡布瑞拉
I leave in their entirety to Marta Cabrera.

1502
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:43,740
我持有的烈酒如血出版公司全部所有权
My entire ownership of Blood Like Wine publishing,

1503
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:46,750
尽数留给玛塔·卡布瑞拉
I leave in its entirety to Marta Cabrera,

1504
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:48,670
公司的书目版权
The copyright of its catalogue likewise

1505
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:51,860
我也同样尽数留给玛塔·卡布瑞拉"
I leave in its entirety to Marta Cabrera."

1506
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:55,740
什么
What?

1507
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:02,820
-什么  -不
- What? - No.

1508
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,940
-这不...这不...  -不
- That's not... That's... No. - No.

1509
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:06,970
-这不可能  -不
- That can't be. - No.

1510
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:08,220
能让我看一看吗  艾伦
Can I see that please, Alan?

1511
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:09,330
-可以  没问题  -谢谢
- Yeah. It's right. - Please.

1512
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,960
这不可能合法
This can't be legal.

1513
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,500
它没问题
It's right.

1514
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:14,210
-你知道  他...  -老天
- You know, he was... - Oh, my God.

1515
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,390
就没有保护条例...
Aren't there safeguards...

1516
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:16,390
艾伦  肯定出错了
Alan, there's a mistake.

1517
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:17,130
我不知道该说什么
I don't know what to say.

1518
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:19,010
我们是他的家人  所以...
We're his family, so...

1519
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:20,670
这不可能
It's not possible.

1520
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:22,750
就没有防范这种情况的保护条例吗
Are there safeguards against this?

1521
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:25,270
思维清晰  某些...
Right mind. Something...

1522
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:27,090
-你知道  -艾伦  听我说...
- You know... - Alan, listen...

1523
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:27,990
-他在用药  -他死前的日子里
- He was on medication. - In his final days,

1524
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:29,500
他在使用大量药物
he was on a great deal of medication.

1525
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:30,710
吗啡吗  对  吗啡
Morphine? All right, morphine.

1526
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:32,320
-我不知道  -这真让人不解
- I mean, I don't know. - This is confusing.

1527
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,350
-她看似是家人  -艾伦  你可以...
- She seems like family... - Alan, you can take...

1528
01:10:34,350 --> 01:10:35,910
-但并不是真正的家人  -拿起这张纸
- but she's not our family. - this piece of paper

1529
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:38,790
擦擦你的屁股  然后滚出去了
and shove it right up your ass, and get out!

1530
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:40,470
还有你们这些警察  也滚出去
And, you cops, too, out.

1531
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:41,790
-琳达  -出去  马上
- Linda? - Out! Right now.

1532
01:10:41,790 --> 01:10:44,320
-琳达  -不  理查德  我们得谈谈
- Hey, Linda? - No, Richard, we need to talk.

1533
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,030
这件事我们要抗争到底  我们哪里也不去
We need to fight this thing. We're not going anywhere.

1534
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:48,820
我说了滚出去
I said get out!

1535
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:51,550
我们是斯隆贝家族  见鬼
We are the Thrombeys, God damn it!

1536
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:53,710
这还是我们的房子
This is still our house!

1537
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:02,410
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

1538
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:05,420
"同样地  在鹿生路2号的房子
"Likewise the house at 2 Deerborn Drive

1539
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:06,730
以及里面的所有财物
And all belongings therein,

1540
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:08,570
我也留给玛塔·卡布瑞拉"
I leave to Marta Cabrera."

1541
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:13,140
你这个小贱人
Oh, you little bitch!

1542
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,880
-你这个小贱人  -琳达
- You little bitch! - Linda?

1543
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:16,980
你早就知道这事吗
Did you know about this?

1544
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:18,220
你早就开始谋划这事了是吗
Were you in on this from the beginning?

1545
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:18,910
-这简直难以置信  -冷静
- This is unbelievable! - Easy.

1546
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:20,830
不不不  我只想知道  你做...
No, no, no! I just wanna know. What were you...

1547
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:23,460
你做了什么  你是不是在跟我父亲上床
What were you doing? Were you boinking my father?

1548
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:25,300
-"上床"  -不  不  不
- "Boinking"? - No, no, no.

1549
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,240
大家都应该冷静一点
I think everybody just needs to cool their jets.

1550
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,670
你和爷爷上床了  你这肮脏的非法移民后代
You had sex with my grandpa, you dirty anchor baby!

1551
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:30,870
控制住你们的情绪
Now hold your horses.

1552
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,870
同时  我建议你该跑了
And in the meantime, I'd maybe run.

1553
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:34,570
等等  等等  等等  玛塔
Wait, wait, wait, Marta?

1554
01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:35,370
好了  请你们...
Now, would you please...

1555
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:37,150
-各位  请留步  -玛塔  回答我们
- Ladies and gentlemen, please. - Marta, talk to us.

1556
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:38,810
玛塔
Marta?

1557
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:40,040
等一等
Wait a minute.

1558
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,930
我完全理解你现在的感受
I totally understand how you must be feeling right now.

1559
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:42,970
-你不能走  -你可以对我说
- You cannot leave! - You can talk to me.

1560
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:45,120
我不知道说什么  我不知道
I don't know what to say. I don't know.

1561
01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:47,560
-冷静  冷静  -玛塔  请你...
- Calm down. Calm down. - Marta, please...

1562
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,880
玛塔  听着  亲爱的...
Marta, listen, darling...

1563
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:52,930
我不知道怎么回事  我不知道他为什么...
I don't know what's happening. I don't know why he...

1564
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,980
各位  我也很困惑  我需要思考
Guys, I'm also confused. I need to think!

1565
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:58,100
玛塔  你在听吗
Marta! Are you listening?

1566
01:11:58,100 --> 01:11:59,630
我插不上话
I can't catch up!

1567
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:03,040
-我懂  我懂  -理查德  开门
- I understand. I understand. - Richard! Open the door!

1568
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,080
打开车门
Open up that door!

1569
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,910
-你们吓着她了  -我打不开门
- You are scaring her! - I can't open the damn door!

1570
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:07,700
玛塔  走  玛塔  走
Marta, go. Marta, go.

1571
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:09,600
玛塔  你得理解
Marta, you have to understand.

1572
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,540
他是我们的父亲
He is our father!

1573
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:13,750
-玛塔  听我说  -玛塔  别听他们的
- Marta, listen to me. - Marta, don't listen to them.

1574
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,580
我在这里
I'm here.

1575
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,680
我不用推特了
I'm not on Twitter anymore.

1576
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:19,760
在照片墙上私信我  好吗
So dm me on Instagram, okay?

1577
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,180
我想跟你谈谈
I wanna talk to you.

1578
01:12:26,230 --> 01:12:27,190
兰森
Ransom!

1579
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:29,100
到底是怎么回事
What the hell's going on?

1580
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:30,240
我认为这可能是
I think this could be the best thing

1581
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,830
发生在你们身上最好的事情
to happen to all of you!

1582
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:35,130
他那是什么意思
What does he mean by that?

1583
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,970
理查德  你怎么没拦住她
Richard, why didn't you stop her?

1584
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:39,980
我要怎么做
What am I supposed to do?

1585
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:41,600
用牙咬住保险杠吗
Grab the bumper with my teeth?

1586
01:12:52,230 --> 01:12:54,220
好了  不过说实在的  这是怎么回事
Okay, seriously, though, what the hell?

1587
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,120
再给我一个空碗
Hey. I'll take an extra bowl.

1588
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:01,660
没问题
Sure.

1589
01:13:09,110 --> 01:13:10,580
你看起来像是要晕过去了
You look like you're gonna pass out.

1590
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:11,830
你今天吃过东西吗
Have you eaten anything today?

1591
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:12,430
吃点
Eat.

1592
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:18,510
这就是个噩梦
This is a nightmare.

1593
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:21,880
所以为什么
So why?

1594
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:25,650
-为什么  -为什么
- Why? - Why?

1595
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:30,250
这可是全部财产
Hey. This is everything.

1596
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:33,100
肯定有个更重要的原因  你知道那个原因
There's gotta be a bigger reason why, and you know it.

1597
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:34,100
作出这个决定主要是因为你们
Well, how about it had to do more

1598
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:35,390
而非因为我  这个理由如何
with you guys than with me?

1599
01:13:37,810 --> 01:13:38,490
对
Yeah.

1600
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:41,530
对  这是唯一合理的解释
Yeah, it's the only thing that makes sense.

1601
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:48,270
他跟你说过什么吗
Did he tell you anything?

1602
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:50,400
只说了我一分钱都分不到
Only that I wasn't getting a cent.

1603
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:51,470
那是因为他希望
That's because he wanted you

1604
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:52,580
你能像你妈妈一样白手起家
to build something from the ground up

1605
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:53,990
-白手起家  -"白手起家"
- like your mom. - "To build something from the ground up."

1606
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:55,990
对  我妈妈是白手起家创业的
Yeah, my mother built her business from the ground up

1607
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:58,210
用的是我外公给的一百万美金借款
with a million-dollar loan from my grandfather.

1608
01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:01,380
我父亲没有任何股份  她让他签了婚前协议
My father owns none of it. She made him sign a prenup.

1609
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:02,820
他生活在恐慌中
He lives in fear.

1610
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:05,070
我知道我外公希望通过这样做
And I know that's what my grandfather was trying

1611
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:06,530
来防止我变成我爸那样
to protect me from by doing this

1612
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:08,270
我也知道我不该说这话
and I know I shouldn't say this out loud,

1613
01:14:08,270 --> 01:14:09,590
但他告诉我的时候  我...
but when he told me, I...

1614
01:14:11,810 --> 01:14:12,530
老天
Jesus.

1615
01:14:13,470 --> 01:14:14,530
我差点杀了他
I could have killed him.

1616
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:19,630
离开派对后   我开着车
After I left the party though, I was driving.

1617
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:23,200
漫无目的  在夜色深处  我的思绪突然
Nowhere, just in the night, and I had this, um...

1618
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:26,540
无比清明
Clarity.

1619
01:14:27,690 --> 01:14:28,590
我意识到从那一刻起
Like, from here on out,

1620
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:30,610
我得自己照顾自己了
I was gonna have to fend for myself.

1621
01:14:31,490 --> 01:14:32,550
而那感觉...
And that felt...

1622
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:34,980
很好
Good.

1623
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:37,990
那个老混蛋
The old bastard.

1624
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:44,130
玛塔  我知道三件事
Marta, I know three things.

1625
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:45,160
第一
One...

1626
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:47,130
我知道他不是自杀
I know he didn't commit suicide.

1627
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:51,500
-你为什么这么想  -这不是我想的
- What makes you think that? - I don't think it.

1628
01:14:52,050 --> 01:14:52,930
我就是知道
I know it.

1629
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:55,140
因为我了解我爷爷
Because I knew my granddad.

1630
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:57,050
或许只有你和我才了解他
Maybe you and I were the only two who knew him,

1631
01:14:57,050 --> 01:14:59,770
所以你不能在这件事上糊弄我  因为第二
so you're not gonna bullshit me on this because, two...

1632
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:02,380
我知道你撒谎时会吐
I know lying makes you puke.

1633
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:05,510
去年独立日玩杀人游戏时知道的
'Cause of that mafia game last Fourth of July.

1634
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:08,050
第三
And three...

1635
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:10,760
我知道你刚吃下了
I know you just ate

1636
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:12,950
一整盘的烤豆子和香肠
a full plate of baked beans and sausage.

1637
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:16,620
所以
So...

1638
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,260
看着我的眼睛
Look me in the eye

1639
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:23,900
告诉我爷爷究竟是怎么回事
and tell me what happened to my grandfather.

1640
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:28,800
-你这个混蛋  -玛塔
- You asshole. - Marta,

1641
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:31,870
都告诉我
tell me everything.

1642
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,620
艾伦  一定还有别的办法
Alan, there have got to be options here.

1643
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:38,150
没有
No.

1644
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:40,050
我不知道我还能重复多少遍
I don't know how many times

1645
01:15:40,230 --> 01:15:43,330
同样的两条信息
I can repeat the same two pieces of information.

1646
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:46,670
如果哈兰改变遗嘱时神志清醒
If Harlan was of sound mind when he made the changes,

1647
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:48,270
我们都确认了他是的...
and we all confirmed that he was...

1648
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:50,070
神志清醒会这么做
Would a sound mind do this?

1649
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:51,070
怎么会  怎么可能清醒
How... Sound, how?

1650
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:53,570
这种行为正证明了他并不清醒
The very action speaks to unsoundness.

1651
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:55,130
法律上来讲不是  不是的
Not legally. No.

1652
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:57,210
你们不喜欢他所做的
You not liking what he did

1653
01:15:57,210 --> 01:15:59,680
并不能证明他没有遗嘱能力
does not speak to testamentary capacity.

1654
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:02,120
那不当影响呢
What about undue influence?

1655
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:05,010
对  不当影响  怎么讲
Yeah! Undue influence, how about that?

1656
01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:06,050
你是刚在网上搜到的吗
Did you just google that?

1657
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:08,460
听着  如果玛塔设法操控了爸爸
Look, if Marta was manipulating Dad somehow

1658
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,390
-如果我们发现  -如果她想办法
- and if we found out... - If somehow, she had gotten...

1659
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:11,590
-她想办法...  -她控制了他...
- that somehow she was... - her hooks into him...

1660
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:14,250
你们需要有确切的证据
You need a strong case for that.

1661
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,820
"法官大人  她通过努力工作与幽默
"Your Honor, she endeared herself to him

1662
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,050
得到了他的喜爱"
"through hard work and good humor."

1663
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:20,850
那没有任何用处
That won't cut the salami.

1664
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:22,820
那凶手规则呢
What about the slayer rule?

1665
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:24,960
是我刚在网上搜到的
I did just google that.

1666
01:16:25,470 --> 01:16:27,390
凶手规则显然不适用于此案
The slayer rule obviously doesn't apply here.

1667
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:30,040
凶手规则是什么东西
Well, what the hell is the slayer rule?

1668
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:31,510
就是说如果继承人被判决为
Well, it's if someone is convicted

1669
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:32,750
杀害被继承人的凶手
of killing the person,

1670
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:33,980
那就不能继承其遗产
they don't get their inheritance.

1671
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:35,080
无需法院判决
Not even convicted.

1672
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,520
哪怕继承人在民事法庭上被认定为
Even if they're held responsible

1673
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:38,010
对被继承人的死负有责任都不行
for their death in civil court.

1674
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:39,410
像O·J·辛普森那样
Like O.J.?

1675
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:42,280
对  像O·J·辛普森那样
Yes, like O.J.

1676
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:45,410
但哈兰是自杀的
But Harlan committed suicide.

1677
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:55,960
布莱克侦探
Detective Blanc?

1678
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,470
你说调查还在进行
You said the investigation is ongoing.

1679
01:16:58,470 --> 01:16:59,630
你特别声明过
You made a point of that.

1680
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:01,140
你怀疑是他杀吗
Do you suspect foul play?

1681
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:04,670
麻烦叫我布兰克先生
Mr. Blanc, if you please...

1682
01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:08,150
还有很多都不明确
There is much that remains unclear,

1683
01:17:08,150 --> 01:17:09,270
但是的
but yes,

1684
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,710
我怀疑是他杀
I suspect foul play.

1685
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:14,680
玛塔
Marta?

1686
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:18,080
我还没有排除任何一个人的嫌疑
I have eliminated no suspects.

1687
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:21,080
你真是满嘴放炮
You're full of shit.

1688
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,380
我不信任这个穿粗花呢西装的家伙
I don't trust this guy in the tweed suit.

1689
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:26,120
艾伦  上帝保佑你  你真是没用
And, Alan, God bless you, you're useless.

1690
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:27,290
谢谢
Thank you.

1691
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:29,220
这件事只有一个办法
There's only one answer to this.

1692
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,840
她得宣布放弃继承
She has to renounce the inheritance.

1693
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:31,840
她知道应该这么做
She knows it's what she should do.

1694
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,310
-她就应该这么...  -这才是正确的做法
- That's exactly what she... - It's the right thing to do.

1695
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:34,460
-对吧  -没门...
- Right? - No way...

1696
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:36,130
这才符合道德
It's the moral thing.

1697
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:37,200
-妈妈  -她会这么做的
- Mom. - She'll do it.

1698
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:39,480
如果爷爷想把一切给玛塔
If Granddad wanted to give Marta everything,

1699
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,830
那就是他的意愿
then that's what he wanted.

1700
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:41,600
不是
No.

1701
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:44,270
他不是这样的  他爱我们
This wasn't him. He loved us.

1702
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:45,620
他想要我们被照顾好
He wanted us taken care of.

1703
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:47,880
他想让你接受高等教育
He wanted you to have an education.

1704
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,140
梅格
Meg,

1705
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,880
你觉得我能付得起你的学费吗
you think I can pay for your school?

1706
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:03,390
我知道
I know.

1707
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:05,110
我自己说出来都觉得离谱
Just saying it, it sounds insane,

1708
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:06,130
但这都是真的
but it's all true.

1709
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:08,760
我觉得布兰克从一开始就盯上了我
And I think Blanc's been on to me from the start.

1710
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:11,270
我不在乎自己会不会进监狱  但我妈妈
I don't care if I go to jail, but my mom,

1711
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:13,170
我妹妹
my sister?

1712
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:14,230
我们...
We...

1713
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:18,270
你要说点什么吗
You gonna say something?

1714
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:21,520
我一直以为只有我
I always thought I was the only one

1715
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,910
能在围棋上赢过他
that could beat him at Go.

1716
01:18:24,190 --> 01:18:25,710
我总认为那意义非凡
Always thought that meant something.

1717
01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:28,550
是  我知道你是的
Um, yeah, I know you did.

1718
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,620
那晚在派对上
That night at the party,

1719
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:32,020
我和他的最后一次谈话
my last conversation with him...

1720
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:34,590
最后的争执  他就是这么跟我说你的
My last argument, that's what he told me about you.

1721
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:38,360
他说你在围棋上比我赢过他更多次  我就想
That you beat him at Go more than I do, and I thought...

1722
01:18:41,010 --> 01:18:42,660
告诉我这种事也太奇怪了
What a strange thing to tell me.

1723
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:46,370
我现在明白了
Think I get it now.

1724
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,400
或许这一点确实意义非凡
Maybe it did mean something.

1725
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,150
我不会告诉我的家人
I'm not gonna tell my family shit.

1726
01:18:58,530 --> 01:18:59,690
你不会进监狱
You're not gonna go to jail.

1727
01:18:59,690 --> 01:19:01,380
那个侦探不会抓住你
That detective is not gonna catch you.

1728
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:03,980
你也不会放弃遗产
And you're not gonna give up the money.

1729
01:19:05,130 --> 01:19:06,530
这是爷爷想给你的
This is what Granddad wanted for you.

1730
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:08,330
想想他为此都做了什么
I mean, think about what he did to go through with this.

1731
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:10,690
他这是为了自己  为了家人
He wanted this for himself, he wanted this for the family.

1732
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,090
也是为了你
And he wanted it for you.

1733
01:19:13,570 --> 01:19:14,730
你都走到这一步了
You've come this far.

1734
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,300
让我来帮你继续吧
Let me help you go all the way.

1735
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:19,430
怎么回事  你不是这样的人
What's going on? This isn't you.

1736
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:21,510
你现在就可以告发我
You could just turn me in right now

1737
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,500
而且还能拿到你的那份遗产
and still get your cut of the inheritance.

1738
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:24,140
为什么
Why?

1739
01:19:25,150 --> 01:19:26,540
因为去他妈的家人
Because fuck my family.

1740
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:29,940
我能帮你摆脱这些
I can help you get away with this.

1741
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:31,150
然后
And then,

1742
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:34,250
你要给我我的那份遗产
you're gonna give me my cut of the inheritance.

1743
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:38,990
大团圆结局  大家都是赢家  你  我
Happy ending. Everybody wins. You, me...

1744
01:19:39,370 --> 01:19:40,150
哈兰
Harlan.

1745
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:40,920
是啊
Yeah.

1746
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:43,320
说定了
Deal?

1747
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,540
{\an9}来电
梅格

1748
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:56,900
梅格
Meg.

1749
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:57,870
玛塔
Marta...

1750
01:19:58,990 --> 01:20:00,540
刚刚大家都疯了
That was nuts.

1751
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:01,410
我知道
I know.

1752
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:02,840
你还好吗
Are you okay?

1753
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:06,210
还好  你呢
Yeah. Are you?

1754
01:20:06,690 --> 01:20:08,250
是的  我还好  我...
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, I...

1755
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,750
听我说  没人知道我打给你了  我...
Look, no one knows I'm calling you, I just...

1756
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:12,990
我想...
I wanted to...

1757
01:20:15,970 --> 01:20:18,560
我为大家刚才的行为向你道歉
I wanted to say sorry for how everyone was.

1758
01:20:19,970 --> 01:20:20,990
还有...
And, uh...

1759
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,170
我想问  你打算怎么做
I guess, I wanted to ask, what are you gonna do?

1760
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:29,200
什么意思
What do you mean?

1761
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:30,500
就是...
Well, the...

1762
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:33,110
遗嘱  你打算怎么做
You know, with the will, what are you gonna do?

1763
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:37,710
你觉得我该怎么做
What do you think I should do?

1764
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:43,420
你应该做你觉得正确的事
You should do whatever you think is right.

1765
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:46,950
是这样  我...
Look, I...

1766
01:20:49,370 --> 01:20:51,090
我觉得你应该还给我们
I think you should give it back to us.

1767
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:55,680
爷爷总是照顾我们
Granddad always took care of us.

1768
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:56,710
我们是他的家人
You know, we're his family.

1769
01:20:56,710 --> 01:20:58,980
我知道他对你来说也像是家人
And I know he was like family to you,

1770
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:00,900
但我们才是他真正的家人
but we're his actual family.

1771
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:02,000
是
Yeah.

1772
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:04,070
还有...听着  玛塔
And... Look, Marta,

1773
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:05,840
你知道这不公平
you know this isn't fair.

1774
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:08,220
我们一直都对你很好
We've always been good to you

1775
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:10,460
你就像家人一样  我们也会照顾你
and you're like family, and we'll take care of you,

1776
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:13,310
但你要纠正这一切
but you have to make things right.

1777
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:15,380
你知道怎样才是正确的
You know what's right.

1778
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:17,050
玛塔
Marta...

1779
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:21,420
妈妈没钱了
Mom's broke.

1780
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,120
她说我得退学了
And she says I'm gonna have to drop out of school.

1781
01:21:24,270 --> 01:21:25,930
不  不  不  梅格
No. No, no, Meg.

1782
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:29,260
听着  我不会让你退学的
Listen, I won't let that happen.

1783
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:31,880
无论你需要多少钱  我都会给你
Whatever money you need, I'll give it to you.

1784
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:32,970
我会支持你
I'm here for you.

1785
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:34,750
我想让你知道我会照顾你的
And I want you to know I'm gonna take care of you,

1786
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:35,870
我保证
I promise that.

1787
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:36,970
好吗
Okay?

1788
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:38,210
谢谢
Thanks.

1789
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:39,870
一旦我...
And once I...

1790
01:21:59,570 --> 01:22:00,330
行吧
Okay then.

1791
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,330
布兰克在房子里发现疑点了吗
Did Blanc find anything suspicious at the house?

1792
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:09,100
有  他发现楼上有泥巴
Yes, he found mud upstairs.

1793
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:10,900
是我从窗户爬进去的地方
Where I broke in through the window.

1794
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:11,640
糟糕
Shit.

1795
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:13,010
有清晰的脚印吗
Identifiable prints?

1796
01:22:13,790 --> 01:22:14,340
没有
No.

1797
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:16,040
很好  好的
Good. Okay.

1798
01:22:16,990 --> 01:22:18,350
很好
Good.

1799
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:20,230
你这几天低调点
You lay low for a couple days,

1800
01:22:20,230 --> 01:22:22,920
等待调查结束  调查一定会结束的
wait for this investigation to blow over, and it will.

1801
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,260
因为不论布兰克这家伙自诩有多牛
'Cause no matter how good this Blanc guy thinks he is,

1802
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:26,350
他终归没找到什么证据
he's got nothin'.

1803
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,420
别紧张
Hey, relax.

1804
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:32,570
玛塔  快起来
Marta, get your ass up!

1805
01:22:32,570 --> 01:22:33,570
到底发生什么事了
What the hell is happening?

1806
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:35,160
来了个人  外面还有一大堆
There's a guy here, and a bunch of stuff.

1807
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:36,930
一切都要疯了  我们变有钱了吗
Everything's going crazy. Are we rich?

1808
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,400
可能吧  爱丽丝  我不知道
Maybe, Alice. I don't know.

1809
01:22:40,610 --> 01:22:41,550
我都不知道那是什么意思
I don't even know what that means,

1810
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,780
{\an8}28个未接电话

1811
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:42,780
但你最好快起来  好吗
but you better get your ass up, okay?

1812
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:46,490
我们不太了解玛塔·卡布瑞拉
We don't know much about Marta Cabrera,

1813
01:22:44,690 --> 01:22:52,330
{\an8}畅销推理小说作家撇开家人
将遗产留给私人看护

1814
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:48,120
-以及她和哈兰·斯隆贝...  -天啊
- or her exact relationship... - Oh, my God...

1815
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:48,760
到底是什么关系
with Harlan Thrombey...

1816
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:49,390
玛塔  这到底怎么回事
Marta, what is all this?

1817
01:22:49,390 --> 01:22:51,110
-只知她是他的家庭护士  -你做了什么
- beyond being his home nurse. - What did you do?

1818
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:53,150
拍的就是这里吗
Is that here?

1819
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:54,210
是的
Oh, yeah, it is.

1820
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,720
等等  所以是真的吗
Wait, so is that true?

1821
01:22:57,350 --> 01:22:58,390
我们变有钱了
Are we rich?

1822
01:23:00,370 --> 01:23:01,570
这故事精彩得...
This is a story so compelling...

1823
01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:04,360
-我的天  -让人以为是他自己编出来的
- Oh, my God. - you would think he had written the story himself.

1824
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:13,030
{\an8}麦金塔  激光唱机

1825
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,840
早上好  斯隆贝夫人
Good morning, Mrs. Thrombey.

1826
01:23:24,530 --> 01:23:27,050
为何天意总让年轻人承载悲痛
Why is grief the providence of youth?

1827
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:29,720
我不知道
I don't know.

1828
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:36,720
但我想年龄会加深所有的情感
But I'd imagine that age deepens all feelings.

1829
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:39,690
包括悲痛
Including grief.

1830
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:47,130
抱歉我过了这么久才过来
This was a long walk to offering condolences

1831
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:49,570
对你痛失爱子表示哀悼
for the loss of your son.

1832
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:53,450
我还想请问你  恕我冒昧
And asking you, if it isn't presumptuous of me,

1833
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:56,610
不是故意要把你的家人想得太坏
not to think too harshly of your family,

1834
01:23:57,930 --> 01:24:02,620
我猜我是第一个安慰你的人吧
if I am, as I suspect, the first to console you.

1835
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:06,420
他们还年轻  不是吗
They're young, aren't they?

1836
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:14,960
我以为年岁的增长
One thing I assume of age

1837
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:17,100
会导致厌倦
is weariness.

1838
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:20,530
真希望我不会每天感到更加厌倦
Damned if I don't get more tired every day.

1839
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:22,940
厌倦于我的工作
Tired of what I do.

1840
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:26,240
沿着蛛丝马迹
Following arcs like lobbed rocks,

1841
01:24:26,490 --> 01:24:28,540
直至那不可避免的真相
the inevitability of truth.

1842
01:24:31,730 --> 01:24:33,550
但是问题的复杂性和灰色地带
But the complexity and the gray

1843
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,680
不在于真相本身
lie not in the truth

1844
01:24:38,130 --> 01:24:41,320
而在于你找出真相后要怎么办
but what you do with the truth once you have it.

1845
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:51,400
我想你有什么事想要跟我说吧
I think you have something you wanna tell me.

1846
01:24:53,610 --> 01:24:56,370
我觉得你观察入微
I think you're very perceptive

1847
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:59,570
一定可以告诉我  你儿子派对那天晚上
and very capable of telling me what you saw

1848
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,610
你看到了什么
the night of your son's party.

1849
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:11,750
我很乐意等
But I'll happily wait.

1850
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:13,950
我不着急
I'm in no rush.

1851
01:25:15,470 --> 01:25:16,290
事实上
In fact,

1852
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:18,260
我发现跟你一块儿坐在这里
I find it quiet pleasant

1853
01:25:18,770 --> 01:25:20,130
非常愉悦
sitting here with you.

1854
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:29,700
律师们来过了
Lawyers were here.

1855
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:31,280
看起来像是非常出名的律师
Very big lawyers, it looked like.

1856
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:33,690
他们留下来这堆东西  还有名片
They left all this stuff and business cards.

1857
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:34,890
还有一大堆别的东西
And there was a pile of other stuff

1858
01:25:34,890 --> 01:25:35,910
我到家的时候发现的
when I got home.

1859
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,490
我不喜欢这样  玛塔
I don't like any of this, Marta.

1860
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:40,380
我也不喜欢
I don't like it either.

1861
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:42,380
我从后门溜出去
I'm slipping out the back.

1862
01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:45,590
我晚点就回来  别跟任何人说话
I'll be back later. Please don't talk to anyone.

1863
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:53,090
沃尔特
Walt?

1864
01:25:54,170 --> 01:25:56,710
是  我来
Yeah, I came, uh...

1865
01:25:56,710 --> 01:25:57,860
你怎么样了
Hey, how you doin'?

1866
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:01,850
沃尔特  我想让你知道
Walt, I want you to know

1867
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:03,580
我事先对此毫不知情
that I didn't know about any of this.

1868
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:04,840
-我们知道你不知情  -这事...
- We know you didn't. - This is...

1869
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:05,910
我们知道你不知情
We know you didn't.

1870
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:09,720
是  我们昨天都有点失控了
Yeah, we all kind of went a little crazy yesterday.

1871
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:11,240
-可以理解  -是的
- Understandable. - Yeah.

1872
01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:14,820
我都还没看过这些
I haven't even looked at all this, yet.

1873
01:26:13,690 --> 01:26:16,560
{\an8}玛塔·卡布瑞拉收

1874
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:17,530
肯定是本地律师和会计
It must just be local lawyers and accountants

1875
01:26:17,530 --> 01:26:19,850
他们看到新闻了  想要抢这单生意
who saw the news and wanna get a jump on it.

1876
01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:22,290
是啊  你应该小心点
Yeah. I'd be careful of all of it.

1877
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:28,560
玛塔  你打算放弃遗产吗
Marta, is it your intention to renounce the inheritance?

1878
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:34,070
这是哈兰的意愿
This is what Harlan wanted.

1879
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:37,100
没错  但是
Yeah, but...

1880
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:40,870
哈兰让你很为难  我是说
Harlan put you in a very hard position here. I mean,

1881
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:42,940
他这样很不公平
it was unfair of him.

1882
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:45,010
你知道
I mean, you see

1883
01:26:45,490 --> 01:26:48,220
这样做所导致的压力和对你隐私的窥探
the kind of press and scrutiny that this kicks up

1884
01:26:48,330 --> 01:26:50,980
我们知道  你母亲的事...
and we know, with your mother...

1885
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:53,550
我母亲
My mother?

1886
01:26:53,670 --> 01:26:54,220
是的
Yeah.

1887
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:01,600
梅格跟你说什么了
What did Meg tell you?

1888
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:03,830
这跟那个没...
Oh, this isn't about...

1889
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:07,300
你误会了
You're missing the point.

1890
01:27:07,550 --> 01:27:09,320
我们不会拿这件事来害你
We don't wanna attack you with this,

1891
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:10,850
但是  玛塔  如果你母亲
but, Marta, if your mother

1892
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:14,510
是非法进入美国的  那就是犯罪
came into the country illegally, criminally.

1893
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:16,760
你若是继承了遗产
And you've come into this inheritance,

1894
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,620
随之而来的所有调查
with all the scrutiny that entails,

1895
01:27:18,630 --> 01:27:20,650
我担心这件事会被曝光
I'd be afraid that could come to light.

1896
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:23,130
我们不希望发生这种事
And that's what we wanna avoid here.

1897
01:27:23,130 --> 01:27:24,520
我们可以把这件事压下来
We can protect you

1898
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:26,490
即使曝光了
from that happening,

1899
01:27:26,530 --> 01:27:27,990
我们也能保护你
or if it happens.

1900
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:32,130
你是说即使这件事曝光了
So you're saying that even if it came to light,

1901
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:35,710
以你们家的资源  你们也可以帮我解决
with your family's resources, you could help me fix it?

1902
01:27:35,710 --> 01:27:36,360
是的
Yeah.

1903
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:39,150
是的  找到合适的律师就行
Yeah, with the right lawyers, you know?

1904
01:27:39,150 --> 01:27:40,510
这帮本地菜鸟不行
Not these local guys,

1905
01:27:40,510 --> 01:27:43,040
要找纽约的律师  华盛顿的律师
but New York lawyers, DC lawyers,

1906
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:45,480
加上足够的资源  就可以解决
with enough resources put toward it, yes.

1907
01:27:45,490 --> 01:27:48,520
不是说一定会出现这种情况
Not that that ever even needs to come up,

1908
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,110
但是没错  可以解决
but, yes.

1909
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:53,150
好的  很好
Okay, good.

1910
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:55,780
好的
Okay?

1911
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:00,520
因为哈兰把你们所有的资源都给了我
Because Harlan gave me all your resources.

1912
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:03,040
那就是说以我的资源
So that means with my resources,

1913
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,200
我就可以解决这件事
I'll be able to fix it.

1914
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,090
所以我想我能找到合适的律师
So I guess I will find the right lawyers.

1915
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:07,930
玛塔  这...
Marta, that's...

1916
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,000
你最好确定
You better be sure that's

1917
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:14,730
这是你想要的
what you want.

1918
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:31,300
{\an8}我知道你做了什么

1919
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:42,080
{\an9}来电
疑似贝努瓦·布兰克

1920
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:46,610
{\an8}我知道你做了什么

1921
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:55,860
{\an8}姓名  玛塔·卡布瑞拉

1922
01:28:53,050 --> 01:28:54,650
我不知道  这是什么
I don't know... What's this?

1923
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:56,040
是我医疗包上的标签
It's my medical bag tag.

1924
01:28:56,290 --> 01:28:58,110
这人不知怎么拿到了我的医疗包
They have my medical bag for some reason.

1925
01:28:59,030 --> 01:29:01,230
好吧  不过这是哈兰的血液毒理学报告
Okay, but this is a photocopy of just the header

1926
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:03,100
{\an8}首席法医办公室
马萨诸塞州诺福克郡

1927
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:03,720
开头部分的复印件
of a blood toxicology report on Harlan.

1928
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:04,400
{\an8}病人姓名  哈兰·斯隆贝

1929
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:06,290
玛塔  这样大家就知道吗啡过量的事了
Marta, this is gonna show the morphine overdose.

1930
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:11,060
那我完蛋了
So I'm screwed?

1931
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,430
你怎么懂这些
How do you know all this stuff?

1932
01:29:14,570 --> 01:29:16,800
有一个暑假我给哈兰当过研究助理
I was Harlan's research assistant for a summer.

1933
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:20,210
{\an8}我知道你做了什么

1934
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,270
但这算哪门子敲诈
But what kind of blackmail scheme is this?

1935
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:21,310
我的意思是  真正的证据
I mean, the actual evidence

1936
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:23,440
远在犯罪实验室里
is sitting up the street, at the crime lab.

1937
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:25,610
这上面没提要求  没说见面地点
There's no demands, there's no meeting place.

1938
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:29,780
给你写这封信有什么目的
What's the point in sending you this?

1939
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:33,790
{\an8}首席法医
诺福克郡

1940
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:36,700
{\an8}诺福克郡法医办公室

1941
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:41,500
可能需要半个小时
It could be a half hour.

1942
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:42,900
或一个小时  得看情况
It could be an hour. It depends.

1943
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:43,960
我们要确保...
We wanna make sure...

1944
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:52,910
所以需要点时间
So, it could take a while.

1945
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:54,300
-发生什么了  -我会通知你的
- What's the cheese? - But I'll let you know.

1946
01:29:54,310 --> 01:29:56,600
-谢谢你  队长  -好的  没问题
- Thank you, Chief. - Yeah. No problem.

1947
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,350
凌晨五点
5:00 a.m.

1948
01:29:58,350 --> 01:30:00,410
所有安全系统都被触发了
Security systems here are all triggered.

1949
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,030
火势发展迅速
Now, this thing went up really quick,

1950
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:04,150
这意味着血样和记录
so that means blood stores, records,

1951
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:06,440
之类的东西  都毁掉了
anything of that nature, it's all gone.

1952
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:07,440
当时没有员工在场
There were no employees here,

1953
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,520
谢天谢地
so, thank God for that.

1954
01:30:10,270 --> 01:30:12,590
监控摄像头呢
What about security cameras?

1955
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:13,530
在那里
Oh, yeah.

1956
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:17,730
说到监控
Speaking of security,

1957
01:30:17,730 --> 01:30:19,320
斯隆贝庄园的监控录像
the surveillance tape at the Thrombey estate

1958
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:21,910
不知为何被干扰损坏了
was all scrambled for some reason.

1959
01:30:21,910 --> 01:30:22,980
好吧
Yeah.

1960
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:26,360
尸检还有什么结果没出吗
What's still pending from the autopsy?

1961
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:28,280
就剩血检报告了
Just a report on the blood work.

1962
01:30:29,770 --> 01:30:30,980
血检
Blood work?

1963
01:30:35,870 --> 01:30:37,570
天啊
Holy shit.

1964
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:42,560
这太离谱了
This is insane.

1965
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:47,830
谁会为了敲诈我而烧了一整栋楼
I mean, who would blow up a whole real building just to blackmail me?

1966
01:30:47,830 --> 01:30:50,100
玛塔  这说明敲诈者手上有
Marta, this means the blackmailer has the only paper copy

1967
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:51,790
唯一一份能证明你有罪的纸质报告
of the thing that can prove your guilt.

1968
01:30:51,790 --> 01:30:53,110
你没有收到别的指示吗
You didn't get any other instructions?

1969
01:30:53,110 --> 01:30:54,950
没有接到电话  收到电邮之类的吗
No phone call? No email? Nothing?

1970
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:55,880
没有
No.

1971
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:59,050
我还没看过我的电子邮箱
Well, I haven't checked my email.

1972
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:05,650
有一封电邮
There is one.

1973
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:09,630
{\an8}哥伦比亚路1209号  上午十点

1974
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:07,130
对  这就是了
Yeah, that's it.

1975
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:09,670
"哥伦比亚路1209号  上午十点"
"1209, Columbus Road. 10 a.m."

1976
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:16,630
你知道这意味着什么吧
You know what this means, right?

1977
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:18,440
只要你毁了那份文件
If you destroy that copy,

1978
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:20,270
就完全清白了
you're totally in the clear.

1979
01:31:20,730 --> 01:31:21,820
不
Oh, no.

1980
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:25,410
玛塔  你听到了吗
Marta, did you hear me?

1981
01:31:27,170 --> 01:31:28,150
听到了
Yeah.

1982
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:37,630
艾略特
Elliott!

1983
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:39,240
快走  快走
We gotta go! We gotta go!

1984
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:44,130
-好了  小车神  -天啊
- Okay, baby driver. - Oh, God.

1985
01:31:44,230 --> 01:31:45,470
你后悔帮我了吗
You regret helping me yet?

1986
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,420
我后悔没开宝马
I regret not taking the Beemer.

1987
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:51,090
该死
Oh, shit.

1988
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:54,700
{\an9}来电
疑似贝努瓦·布兰克

1989
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:06,210
-正在华盛顿大街上追击车辆  -别用武力
- Vehicles in pursuit on Washington Street. - No force.

1990
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:07,880
-一定要说"别用武力"  -别用武力
- Make sure you say "No force." - No force.

1991
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:09,070
车上有一位疑似谋杀嫌疑犯
We got a possible murder suspect.

1992
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:10,580
我说了  我说了
I said that. I said that.

1993
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:14,370
快  快  快  油门踩到底了吗
Go. Go! Go! Are you flooring it?

1994
01:32:14,370 --> 01:32:16,340
踩到底了
I am literally flooring it!

1995
01:32:22,930 --> 01:32:24,030
{\an9}来电
疑似布兰克·贝努瓦

1996
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:28,890
-真是顺利  -我要停车  我...
- This is going well. - I'm pulling over. I'm...

1997
01:32:28,890 --> 01:32:31,070
你要是错过这个拿到毒理学报告的机会
If you miss your chance to get this tox report,

1998
01:32:31,070 --> 01:32:32,120
就完蛋了
it's all over.

1999
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:33,520
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

2000
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,590
为什么  为什么要停下
Why... Why are we stopping?

2001
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:41,560
为什么要停在路中间
Why are you stopping in the middle of the road?

2002
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:56,180
抓紧了
Hold on.

2003
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:22,390
天啊  我现在肾上腺素飙升
Oh, my God, I'm just pure adrenaline right now.

2004
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:24,390
感觉像是吞了蜜蜂
I feel like I swallowed bees.

2005
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:25,500
好了
Okay...

2006
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:26,950
所以是哪里  地址是什么
So where is it? What's the address?

2007
01:33:26,950 --> 01:33:28,490
哥伦比亚路1209号
1209, Columbus Road.

2008
01:33:28,490 --> 01:33:30,310
好  不管他们要什么
Okay. I mean, whatever they want,

2009
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:31,630
-我都会答应  -任何条件
- I'll say yes... - Anything.

2010
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:33,050
拿回报告就好
You know, just to get that report back.

2011
01:33:33,050 --> 01:33:35,220
-拿回来销毁  -销毁它
- Get it back and destroy it. - Destroy it.

2012
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:37,210
天啊  兰森
Holy shit, Ransom.

2013
01:33:38,430 --> 01:33:39,500
谢谢你
Hey, thank you.

2014
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:41,840
要是没有你  我肯定做不到
I couldn't do this without you.

2015
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:47,070
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

2016
01:33:48,350 --> 01:33:49,280
下车
Get out.

2017
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:54,380
这真是有史以来最愚蠢的汽车追逐
That was the dumbest car chase of all time.

2018
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:55,680
把手放下
Put your hands down.

2019
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:58,350
我和曾祖母温娜塔·斯隆贝聊过了
I spoke to Wanetta Thrombey, Greatnana.

2020
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:00,040
派对当晚  她看到有人
Night of the party, she saw someone

2021
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:02,340
顺着棚架爬上了三楼
climbing the trellis to the third floor.

2022
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:05,080
-德莱斯戴尔先生  来  -走吧
- Mr. Drysdale, come on. - Let's go.

2023
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:07,100
对他进行搜身检查
Pat him down, check him out.

2024
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:08,440
怎么回事
What's going on?

2025
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:10,720
她说"兰森回来了"
"Ransom came back," She said.

2026
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:11,860
把手放到车上
Hands on the vehicle.

2027
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:13,250
我不知道他回去干什么
I don't know what he came back to do,

2028
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:14,630
但我们会查出来的
but we'll find out.

2029
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:15,980
你携带着任何利器吗
You got anything sharp?

2030
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:18,870
小心头  谢谢
Watch your head. Thank you.

2031
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:19,950
你不必谢他
Hey, you don't need to thank him.

2032
01:34:19,950 --> 01:34:23,230
是他看到我走过去时  让你开车的吗
Did he ask you to drive when he saw me coming?

2033
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:25,650
是的
Yes.

2034
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:34,880
布兰克  跟我们一起走吗
Blanc, coming with us?

2035
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,530
我和玛塔一起走
I'll drive with Marta.

2036
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:39,000
去警局吧
Let's go to the police station.

2037
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,260
我要详细记录他对你所说的一切
I want a full rundown on everything he said to you.

2038
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:44,410
我会将进展告诉你
I'll catch you up on where we're at.

2039
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:54,220
这案子从一开始就很怪异
Strange case from the start.

2040
01:34:54,990 --> 01:34:58,400
案子的中间有个洞
A case with a hole in the middle.

2041
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:01,300
就像甜甜圈
A donut.

2042
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:04,810
我只是在说我的推理过程
I'm just talking through my process here,

2043
01:35:04,810 --> 01:35:06,660
你要是觉得无聊就告诉我
let me know if this is boring.

2044
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:09,480
我能感到气氛越来越紧张
I feel the noose tightening.

2045
01:35:09,490 --> 01:35:12,280
斯隆贝一家真的很绝望
The family is truly desperate.

2046
01:35:12,610 --> 01:35:14,570
绝望的动机
Desperate motives,

2047
01:35:14,970 --> 01:35:17,060
雇用我的神秘人
the mystery of who hired me,

2048
01:35:17,150 --> 01:35:19,680
犯罪之不可能性
the impossibility of the crime,

2049
01:35:19,990 --> 01:35:21,370
而这...
and yet...

2050
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:24,040
就像一个甜甜圈
A donut.

2051
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:26,810
缺失的中心
One central piece

2052
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:30,510
如果它浮出水面  迷雾就会消散
and if it reveals itself, the fog would lift,

2053
01:35:30,610 --> 01:35:34,020
就能查明案情  厘清是非
the arc would resolve, the Slinky become unkinked.

2054
01:35:31,970 --> 01:35:34,390
{\an8}哥伦比亚路
单行道

2055
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:36,270
我能停一下吗
Do you mind if I stop for a second?

2056
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:37,820
我要去取个东西
I need to pick something up.

2057
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:39,680
很快的
It'll be very quick.

2058
01:35:40,630 --> 01:35:41,560
好的
Sure.

2059
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:54,980
{\an8}约翰洗衣店

2060
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:56,470
只要几分钟就好
It'll be just a few minutes.

2061
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:59,760
小心...开门
Watch the, uh, door.

2062
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:14,070
{\an8}约翰洗衣店
后门入口  1209号

2063
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:23,100
有人吗
Hello?

2064
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:48,880
听着  我不知道你想要什么
Listen, I don't know what you want...

2065
01:36:51,710 --> 01:36:53,670
不管你想怎样  我们都能解决
Whatever it is, we can work it out.

2066
01:36:53,670 --> 01:36:56,320
但必须现在就在这里解决
But we have to figure it out right here, right now.

2067
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,140
而且你要把报告交给我
And I'm leaving with that report.

2068
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:03,620
听到了吗
Hello?

2069
01:37:29,230 --> 01:37:30,170
弗兰
Fran?

2070
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:42,190
不  不  不  不  弗兰
No, no, no, no! Fran?

2071
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,190
天啊  弗兰
Oh, my God, Fran.

2072
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:46,430
你能听见吗
Can you hear me?

2073
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:48,860
弗兰  你要是能听见就示意我
Fran, give me a sign if you can hear me.

2074
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:51,440
-你...  -没错  是我  我是玛塔
- You... - Yes, it's me. It's Marta.

2075
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:53,050
你叫我来这里  给我发了电邮
You called me here, you sent me an email,

2076
01:37:53,050 --> 01:37:55,140
所以我来了  你摄入了什么东西吗
that's why I'm here. Did you take something?

2077
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:57,720
我现在叫救护车  你会没事的
I'm gonna call an ambulance now, you're gonna be okay.

2078
01:37:57,210 --> 01:37:58,740
{\an8}吗啡

2079
01:37:57,730 --> 01:37:58,800
你会没事的  好吗
You're gonna be fine, okay?

2080
01:37:58,810 --> 01:38:00,120
-坚持住  -报告...
- Stay with me. - Copy...

2081
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:02,030
-什么  -报告...
- What? - Copy...

2082
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:03,970
藏起来...
Stashed...

2083
01:38:03,970 --> 01:38:05,620
什么  你在说什么
What? What are you saying?

2084
01:38:06,710 --> 01:38:08,780
是你干的
You did this.

2085
01:38:08,950 --> 01:38:11,030
你逃不掉的
Won't get away with this.

2086
01:38:11,030 --> 01:38:12,340
天啊  别说了
Jesus, stop it!

2087
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:27,270
{\an8}姓名  玛塔·卡布瑞拉

2088
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:31,480
{\an9}正在呼叫
紧急中心

2089
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:36,850
紧急中心  你有什么紧急情况
911, what's your emergency?

2090
01:38:37,990 --> 01:38:43,190

老天啊
Oh, Lord.

2096
01:39:00,010 --> 01:39:02,540
好的  朋友  谢谢你及时通知
All right, my friend, thank you for the update.

2097
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:04,950
不用了
No need for that.

2098
01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:06,320
一等管家情况稳定
I'll bring her in once we get word

2099
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,270
我就带她过去
that the housekeeper is stable.

2100
01:39:08,270 --> 01:39:09,980
目前她还没有脱离生命危险
It's still touch and go.

2101
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:11,150
好的
All right.

2102
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:13,810
结束吧
Listen, this is over.

2103
01:39:13,810 --> 01:39:15,480
已经有人受到了伤害
People are getting hurt.

2104
01:39:18,090 --> 01:39:19,210
所以我会把真相告诉你
So I'm gonna tell you the truth.

2105
01:39:19,220 --> 01:39:23,360
兰森刚才对艾略特警官和盘托出了
Young Ransom just told Lieutenant Elliott everything.

2106
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:24,540
挺好
Good.

2107
01:39:24,670 --> 01:39:26,780
等等  我希望他没有替我打掩护
Wait, I hope he didn't cover for me.

2108
01:39:26,780 --> 01:39:28,350
他有没有向你们坦白全部事实
Did he tell you the real truth

2109
01:39:28,350 --> 01:39:30,260
-我搞错药的事...  -说了
- about me switching the... - Yeah.

2110
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:32,150
-变装呢  -说了
- And the disguise bit? - Yes.

2111
01:39:32,150 --> 01:39:34,040
还有被勒索和...
And the whole blackmail and...

2112
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,210
可是弗兰为什么要拿走我的吗啡
But why did Fran take my morphine?

2113
01:39:37,210 --> 01:39:39,490
显然她之前把医疗包从房里偷走了
I mean, obviously she had swiped the bag from the house,

2114
01:39:39,490 --> 01:39:41,390
可她看着不像是吗啡上瘾的人
but she didn't seem like a user to me,

2115
01:39:41,390 --> 01:39:43,710
除非她就是因此才需要勒索钱财
unless that's why she needed the blackmail money.

2116
01:39:43,930 --> 01:39:45,980
不知道  反正这也不重要了
I don't know, it doesn't matter anyway.

2117
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:47,640
我得亲自向斯隆贝一家坦白
I have to tell the Thrombeys myself,

2118
01:39:47,650 --> 01:39:48,690
我觉得这是我欠他们的
I feel like I owe that to them.

2119
01:39:48,690 --> 01:39:50,110
我可不赞同
I don't think that's a good idea.

2120
01:39:50,110 --> 01:39:52,860
不  我得坦白  我需要坦白
No, I have to do it. I need to do it.

2121
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:55,990
我把电话留给医生了
I gave the doctors my number,

2122
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:57,870
如果弗兰这里情况有变  他们会打给我
so they'll call if anything changes with Fran.

2123
01:39:57,870 --> 01:39:58,790
好吧
All right.

2124
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,820
我会在斯隆贝家召集他们一家人
I'll round up the Thrombeys at the house,

2125
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:02,670
再叫上警察
along with a police escort.

2126
01:40:02,860 --> 01:40:04,600
为了之后逮捕我
For the arrest after.

2127
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:08,050
你可以在开车去的路上把整个故事告诉我
You can tell me your whole story on the drive over.

2128
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:11,050
我可不想再有什么"惊喜"了
I don't want any more surprises.

2129
01:40:26,580 --> 01:40:28,950
弗兰说她把报告藏起来了
Fran said it was stashed, the copy,

2130
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:30,340
她还说
and then she said,

2131
01:40:30,630 --> 01:40:32,820
"是你干的  你逃不掉的"
"You did this. You won't get away with it,"

2132
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:36,080
然后我就叫救护车了
and I called the ambulance.

2133
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:37,250
就这样
That's it.

2134
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:39,590
好的
All right.

2135
01:40:41,910 --> 01:40:42,830
准备好了吗
You ready?

2136
01:40:50,270 --> 01:40:51,360
来了
Okay.

2137
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,750
她想明白了吗
Well, has she come to her senses?

2138
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:55,360
她就站在那  理查德
Well, she's standing right there, Richard,

2139
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,680
-她可以自己回答  -家庭成员都来齐了吗
- she can speak for herself. - Is the rest of the family here?

2140
01:40:57,680 --> 01:40:59,110
-在客厅  -我觉得我们再聚齐一次
- In the living room. - I think that it would be better

2141
01:40:59,110 --> 01:41:02,020
把整件事做个了结比较好
if we were to gather again and get this over with.

2142
01:41:11,370 --> 01:41:13,190
真抱歉我和他们说了你妈妈的事
I'm so sorry I told them about your mom.

2143
01:41:13,190 --> 01:41:15,140
没关系的  梅格
Meg, it's okay.

2144
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:17,390
对不起  我好怕  我...
I'm sorry. No... I was scared. I just...

2145
01:41:17,390 --> 01:41:18,350
我不想说的
I didn't wanna tell them.

2146
01:41:18,350 --> 01:41:19,810
我明白
I get it.

2147
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:21,440
相信我
Trust me,

2148
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:24,570
我懂  没事的
I understand. It's all right.

2149
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:26,430
对不起
I'm sorry.

2150
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:32,310
老天  事后我一定要把弗兰的藏货洗劫一空
God, I am so raiding Fran's stash after this.

2151
01:41:32,310 --> 01:41:35,160
我仍认为这不是个好主意
I still think this is a bad idea,

2152
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:37,990
不过家庭成员都聚齐了
but the family is assembled.

2153
01:41:41,150 --> 01:41:43,330
我知道毒理学报告在哪了
I know where the tox report is.

2154
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:52,590
她等于是直接告诉我了
She basically told me where it was.

2155
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:52,330
{\an8}毒理学报告

2156
01:41:54,710 --> 01:41:56,770
无论如何  这份报告能把真相串连起来
Anyways, this will tie everything up.

2157
01:41:58,830 --> 01:42:00,730
而报告我已经交到你手上了
And I just handed it to you.

2158
01:42:01,970 --> 01:42:04,670
天啊  你这侦探可真不算高明  不是吗
God, you're not much of a detective, are you?

2159
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:06,890
说句公道话
Well, to be fair,

2160
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:10,970
你这凶手当得也不怎么样
you make a pretty lousy murderer.

2161
01:42:12,850 --> 01:42:14,830
也许我俩是绝配
Perhaps we deserve each other.

2162
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:28,640
各位一直对我很好
You've always been good to me.

2163
01:42:30,490 --> 01:42:32,490
我接下来要说的事非同小可
And what I'm about to say isn't gonna be easy

2164
01:42:32,490 --> 01:42:34,310
你们听了会动怒
and you're gonna be upset.

2165
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,790
可是我想  过去这些天
But I thought after what you've gone through

2166
01:42:36,790 --> 01:42:38,260
你们经历了那么多纷争
the last few days,

2167
01:42:39,170 --> 01:42:41,950
你们理应听我说出真相
that you deserved to hear it from me.

2168
01:42:44,510 --> 01:42:46,200
-我...  -打断一下
- I... - Excuse me!

2169
01:42:50,260 --> 01:42:53,120
你们哪里对她好了
You have not been good to her.

2170
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:55,600
为了窃回你们已然失去
You have all treated her like shit,

2171
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:58,140
且理应归她的财产
to steal back a fortune that you lost,

2172
01:42:58,140 --> 01:42:59,730
你们视她如敝屣
and she deserves.

2173
01:42:59,730 --> 01:43:02,750
你们就像一群扑食的饿虎
You're a pack of vultures at the feast!

2174
01:43:02,750 --> 01:43:04,940
利刃出鞘  磨牙吮血
Knives out, beaks bloody!

2175
01:43:04,940 --> 01:43:05,840
不过
Well,

2176
01:43:06,670 --> 01:43:09,650
这一回你们绝不可能全身而退
you're not getting bailed out, not this time.

2177
01:43:10,130 --> 01:43:13,020
卡布瑞拉小姐最终决定
Ms. Cabrera has decided, definitively,

2178
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:14,870
不会放弃遗产继承
not to renounce the inheritance.

2179
01:43:14,870 --> 01:43:16,640
-什么  -什么
- What? - What?

2180
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:19,530
并且  我会向本地警方提供专业意见
Furthermore, it will be my professional recommendation

2181
01:43:19,530 --> 01:43:22,160
表明本案中哈兰·斯隆贝之死
to the local authorities that the manner of death

2182
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:26,340
当以自杀判定
in the case of Harlan Thrombey is ruled as suicide!

2183
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:27,890
-结案  -布兰克
- And the case is closed. - Blanc?

2184
01:43:27,890 --> 01:43:28,460
什么
What?

2185
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:30,300
感谢各位前来  再见
Thank you all for coming. Goodbye.

2186
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:32,700
什么情况  你告诉我...
What's going on? Just tell me...

2187
01:43:34,110 --> 01:43:37,200
这显然不是我所期待的结局
That's certainly not what I was expecting.

2188
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:37,760
不
No.

2189
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:38,950
还有人和我一样糊涂吗
Is anybody else confused?

2190
01:43:38,950 --> 01:43:41,330
我可一点都不想听到这个结局
Not what I was expecting to hear at all.

2191
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:45,550
你是不是该告诉我到底什么情况
Are you gonna tell me what the hell is going on?

2192
01:43:45,550 --> 01:43:46,470
是  是
Yes. Yes.

2193
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:48,660
我只想澄清真相  好吗
I just wanna come clean, okay?

2194
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:49,930
-都结束了  -快结束了
- It's over. - Almost.

2195
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:51,250
布兰克  你在干什么
Blanc, what are we doing?

2196
01:43:51,250 --> 01:43:53,570
-这是怎么了  -抱歉  瓦格纳警员
- What's going on? - I'm sorry. Officer Wagner.

2197
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:55,370
别让这家人进这个房间
Keep the family out of this room,

2198
01:43:55,370 --> 01:43:56,900
如果可以的话  直接赶出这座房子
and get 'em out of the house if you can.

2199
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:59,120
但是你和你的随行警员要随时待命
But stand by with your additional officer.

2200
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:00,140
把这家人赶走
Get the family out?

2201
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:01,990
对  不过别全都赶走  拜托你...
Yes, but not all of them. Would you...

2202
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:03,000
谢谢
Thank you.

2203
01:44:03,010 --> 01:44:04,010
-布兰克  -是  先生
- Blanc... - Yes, sir.

2204
01:44:04,010 --> 01:44:05,680
差不多行了  你葫芦里卖的什么药
Come on, come on, what's all this drama?

2205
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:07,660
-容我把话说完  -布兰克
- Indulge me. - Blanc,

2206
01:44:07,660 --> 01:44:09,610
我都告诉兰森了  兰森也告诉你们了
I told Ransom, Ransom told you,

2207
01:44:09,610 --> 01:44:11,300
我现在跟你们说清楚
and I'm telling you now,

2208
01:44:11,350 --> 01:44:14,070
是我杀了哈兰  无可辩驳
it is an immovable fact that I killed Harlan.

2209
01:44:14,070 --> 01:44:16,690
你是说了  他也说了  你说得很清楚
Yes, you did, yes, he did, yes, you are.

2210
01:44:16,690 --> 01:44:19,990
但是  我在车里提到过
But... But, I spoke in the car about the hole

2211
01:44:19,990 --> 01:44:22,040
甜甜圈中心的那个洞
at the center of this donut.

2212
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:24,860
你和哈兰在案发当晚的所作所为
And what you and Harlan did that fateful night

2213
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:28,110
乍看之下似乎完美地填补了那个洞
seems at first glance to fill that hole perfectly.

2214
01:44:28,110 --> 01:44:30,970
甜甜圈洞里甜甜圈球
A donut hole in a donut's hole.

2215
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:33,890
但我们得凑近了观察
But we must look a little closer.

2216
01:44:34,210 --> 01:44:36,980
那时我们就会发现甜甜圈球的中心
And when we do, we see the donut hole

2217
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:39,350
还有一个洞
has a hole in its center.

2218
01:44:39,470 --> 01:44:41,690
那并不是甜甜圈球
It is not a donut hole,

2219
01:44:41,690 --> 01:44:44,620
而是一个小号的甜甜圈  以及中心的洞
but a smaller donut with its own hole

2220
01:44:44,620 --> 01:44:47,580
这样原本的大甜甜圈根本就不完整
and our donut is not whole at all!

2221
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:49,770
布兰克  我知道你觉得这么兜圈子有意思
Blanc, look, I understand that this is amusing for you...

2222
01:44:49,770 --> 01:44:52,510
为什么要雇用我
Why was I hired?

2223
01:44:52,910 --> 01:44:54,400
为什么有人要雇用我
Why would someone hire me?

2224
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:55,760
有人想要证明发生了犯罪行为
Someone fishing for a crime

2225
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,170
从而撤销遗嘱  布兰克  行了
to reverse the will, Blanc. Come on.

2226
01:44:57,170 --> 01:44:59,490
但我在遗嘱拆封前就被雇用了
But I was hired before the sealed will was read.

2227
01:44:59,490 --> 01:45:01,010
所以  没错
So, yes,

2228
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:04,120
这个人一定早就知道遗嘱的内容
the person must have known the contents of the will.

2229
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:05,610
可是再往下想
But one step further,

2230
01:45:05,610 --> 01:45:08,770
这个人一定还早就知道有人犯了罪
that same person must have known a crime was committed,

2231
01:45:08,770 --> 01:45:10,140
再往下想...
and further...

2232
01:45:10,730 --> 01:45:15,070
如果对方的意图是撤销玛塔的继承权
If the intent was to reverse Marta's inheritance,

2233
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,460
对方一定早就知道玛塔就是罪魁祸首
they must have known that Marta was responsible.

2234
01:45:18,810 --> 01:45:21,140
引人入胜而又环环相扣的线索
An intriguing combination of factors.

2235
01:45:21,140 --> 01:45:22,960
有人知道玛塔做了什么
Someone who knew what Marta did

2236
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:24,420
想揭发她
wanted to expose it

2237
01:45:24,430 --> 01:45:26,550
但却不能暴露自己是如何得知的
but could not reveal how they knew.

2238
01:45:26,550 --> 01:45:27,600
是弗兰
Fran!

2239
01:45:28,090 --> 01:45:30,510
她勒索了我  她知道我做了什么
She was blackmailing me. She knew what I did.

2240
01:45:30,510 --> 01:45:32,100
没错  可是弗兰想要的是钱
Yeah, but Fran wanted money,

2241
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:34,610
所以她并不希望罪行曝光
ergo she did not want the crime exposed.

2242
01:45:34,610 --> 01:45:36,310
如果这家人里有谁看到了
What if someone in the family had observed

2243
01:45:36,310 --> 01:45:37,510
玛塔有可疑举动呢
Marta doing something suspicious?

2244
01:45:37,510 --> 01:45:40,920
但他们没有理由缄口不言
But they would have had no reason not to speak up.

2245
01:45:42,650 --> 01:45:46,090
答案没有这么简单
The answer is not so simple.

2246
01:45:46,510 --> 01:45:50,850
现在我已然看穿了全部真相
Now with the entire solution in my field of view,

2247
01:45:50,850 --> 01:45:54,190
这背后的故事是一系列错误导致的悲剧
the arc of this case is a tragedy of errors.

2248
01:45:56,310 --> 01:45:58,830
玛塔  这话可能会让你难以接受
Marta, it will not be easy for you to hear.

2249
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:02,230
但这背后
But there is at least

2250
01:46:02,230 --> 01:46:05,160
至少有一个幕后黑手
one truly guilty party behind it all,

2251
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:07,630
一个怀着真正恶意
guilty in the true sense of acting with malice

2252
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:12,030
为了一己私利犯下滔天罪行的幕后黑手
and committing a heinous crime with selfish intent.

2253
01:46:14,430 --> 01:46:15,740
瓦格纳警员
Trooper Wagner.

2254
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:17,560
凶手是瓦格纳警员
Trooper Wagner?

2255
01:46:18,950 --> 01:46:19,940
不是
No.

2256
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:24,130
玛塔  对不起  我把一切都告诉他们了
Marta, I'm so sorry. I told them everything.

2257
01:46:24,130 --> 01:46:25,690
我以为一切都结束了  对不起
I figured it was up. I'm sorry.

2258
01:46:25,690 --> 01:46:27,960
没事的  兰森  我很高兴你说出来了
Hey. It's all right, Ransom, I'm glad you did.

2259
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:30,450
可他并没说出全部
Not exactly everything though.

2260
01:46:30,630 --> 01:46:32,920
你在怀疑曾祖母和你说的话吗
Is this about what Greatnana told you?

2261
01:46:32,930 --> 01:46:35,960
那晚她看到的是我  她把我认成兰森了
She saw me that night. She mistook me for Ransom.

2262
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:36,970
这个我们后面再说
We'll get to that.

2263
01:46:36,970 --> 01:46:38,700
与此同时
In the meanwhile,

2264
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:41,710
休·兰森·德莱斯戴尔先生
Mr. Hugh Ransom Drysdale,

2265
01:46:41,790 --> 01:46:45,780
你不妨告诉大家  你为什么要雇用我
you might tell us all why you hired me.

2266
01:46:48,950 --> 01:46:50,460
我为什么要雇用你
Why I hired you?

2267
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:53,110
你说得对  我们来复盘一下
You're right, let's back it up...

2268
01:46:53,110 --> 01:46:54,810
回到派对那一晚
To the night of the party.

2269
01:46:54,810 --> 01:46:57,350
你和哈兰发生的争执
Your argument with Harlan.

2270
01:46:57,460 --> 01:46:58,660
在洗手间自慰的纳粹小子
What were the overheard words

2271
01:46:58,660 --> 01:47:02,030
听到了什么来着
by the Nazi child masturbating in the bathroom?

2272
01:47:02,030 --> 01:47:05,600
"我的遗嘱"  还有"我警告你"
"My will," and "I'm warning you."

2273
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:08,070
你和哈兰都喜欢看好戏
You and Harlan were drama mamas,

2274
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:11,280
你俩都十分享受慢慢折磨对方
you shared a love of twisting the knife into one another.

2275
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:12,620
所以  我不相信
You see, I don't believe

2276
01:47:12,620 --> 01:47:14,440
他会说到一半突然转移话题
he would have slipped it in halfway,

2277
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:15,750
不  不  肯定不会
no, no, no.

2278
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:17,550
我认为
I submit

2279
01:47:17,860 --> 01:47:20,430
哈兰告诉了你一切
Harlan told you everything.

2280
01:47:20,430 --> 01:47:21,780
你开什么玩笑
You can't be serious!

2281
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:25,310
他们谁都别想拿到
Not a red dime or word of my work

2282
01:47:25,310 --> 01:47:28,240
我的一本书  一毛钱  包括你
to a single one of them, you included.

2283
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:29,160
玛塔
Marta,

2284
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:31,020
提醒我一下  兰森说
remind me what Ransom said

2285
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:33,810
他和哈兰的对话是如何结束的
his conversation with Harlan ended with?

2286
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:36,790
哈兰对他说我下围棋能打败他
Harlan told him that I could beat him at Go.

2287
01:47:36,790 --> 01:47:38,630
我问自己
And I asked myself,

2288
01:47:38,630 --> 01:47:40,100
"玛塔
"Marta?

2289
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:41,870
为什么关于遗嘱的话题
Why would the topic of the will

2290
01:47:41,870 --> 01:47:44,860
会绕到玛塔那去"
Have steered around to Marta?"

2291
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:48,890
只有一个显而易见的解释
There is one obvious explanation...

2292
01:47:48,890 --> 01:47:49,990
你不至于那么疯狂
You can't be that crazy.

2293
01:47:49,990 --> 01:47:51,880
你不会就那么把全副身家都抛弃了
You're not just gonna throw away your fortune.

2294
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:54,160
当然不会  我会把一切都留给玛塔
No. I'm giving it to Marta.

2295
01:47:54,160 --> 01:47:55,330
所有财产
All of it.

2296
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:57,770
你的巴西护士
Your Brazilian nurse?

2297
01:47:57,770 --> 01:47:59,050
你他妈的是疯了吗
Are you goddamn insane?

2298
01:47:59,050 --> 01:48:02,330
我一生中第一次这么理智
I'm sane for the first time in my life,

2299
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:03,260
而且我已经改好了
and I've done it.

2300
01:48:02,170 --> 01:48:03,700
{\an8}哈兰  如果你认为我会让这发生
Harlan, if you think I'm gonna let this happen,

2301
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:05,330
{\an8}我会坐以待毙...
if you think I'm gonna stand here and...

2302
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:06,900
我已经改好了遗嘱  木已成舟
I've made the change to my will. It's done.

2303
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:08,570
我警告你
I'm warning you!

2304
01:48:09,580 --> 01:48:11,540
你这可是很严重的指控
That's some heavy-duty conjecture.

2305
01:48:11,910 --> 01:48:12,810
可以这么说
Granted.

2306
01:48:13,350 --> 01:48:16,810
但只有这么解释  接下来发生的事才说得通
But it is the only way what comes next makes sense.

2307
01:48:17,350 --> 01:48:20,630
你气冲冲地离开  深夜驾车离去
So you storm out, you drive off into the night.

2308
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:23,080
你后来对玛塔说
You tell Marta later...

2309
01:48:23,260 --> 01:48:26,090
什么来着  感到了前所未有的...
What was it? Feeling an overwhelming sense of...

2310
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:27,120
清明
Clarity.

2311
01:48:27,830 --> 01:48:30,920
说从那以后他要为自己盘算
That he had to make do for himself from here on out.

2312
01:48:30,970 --> 01:48:32,360
没错
Exactly.

2313
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:37,870
玛塔  遗嘱  哈兰
Marta. The will. Harlan.

2314
01:48:37,870 --> 01:48:39,570
"为自己盘算"
"Do for yourself."

2315
01:48:39,570 --> 01:48:41,730
"你逃不掉的"
"You won't get away with this."

2316
01:48:42,340 --> 01:48:44,470
你心里有了计划
And a plan forms.

2317
01:48:52,790 --> 01:48:53,850
你回到庄园
You return,

2318
01:48:53,970 --> 01:48:57,220
小心地避开了门口的监控摄像头
careful to avoid the gate's security camera range.

2319
01:48:57,230 --> 01:48:59,620
然后步行走向房子
Then on foot up towards the house,

2320
01:48:59,660 --> 01:49:01,730
你沿着棚架偷偷爬进屋
you sneak in up the trellis,

2321
01:49:01,730 --> 01:49:04,060
这样就不会被仍然在楼下开派对的
so as not to be seen by the rest of the family

2322
01:49:04,060 --> 01:49:07,300
其余家人发现
who are still having their party downstairs.

2323
01:49:08,570 --> 01:49:12,300
你想要做的只需片刻即可
What you need to do will take moments.

2324
01:49:12,570 --> 01:49:16,910
但你必须只身一人不被发现  这至关重要
But it is essential that you are alone and undetected.

2325
01:49:17,110 --> 01:49:19,480
你知道哈兰所使用的药物
You knew what medications Harlan took.

2326
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:22,980
你知道那晚玛塔会给他注射什么
You knew what Marta would be injecting him with that night.

2327
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:24,250
{\an8}吗啡  痛立消

2328
01:49:23,680 --> 01:49:24,840
而且你知道
And you knew

2329
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:28,980
如果他因为玛塔而死
if Marta was responsible for his death,

2330
01:49:28,990 --> 01:49:30,850
即便是无心之失
even unintentionally,

2331
01:49:31,930 --> 01:49:34,930
凶手规则将会使更改后的遗嘱失效
the slayer rule would nullify the changed will

2332
01:49:34,930 --> 01:49:37,620
而你将会拿回你的那份财产
and you would get your share back.

2333
01:49:38,330 --> 01:49:40,000
你使用药箱里的注射器
You used the syringes in the kit

2334
01:49:39,070 --> 01:49:40,180
{\an8}吗啡

2335
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,720
将两个药瓶里的液体调换了
to switch the liquids in the two medication vials.

2336
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:45,830
而且  为了保险起见
And as a final precaution...

2337
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:44,210
{\an8}痛立消

2338
01:49:47,570 --> 01:49:49,440
你拿走了纳洛酮
you took the Naloxone,

2339
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:52,740
能够救命的解毒剂
the lifesaving antidote.

2340
01:49:53,410 --> 01:49:55,580
不  不不不  这不可能
No. No, no, no, that's impossible.

2341
01:49:55,580 --> 01:49:57,090
这就是真相
That is the truth.

2342
01:49:57,180 --> 01:49:59,820
把那瓶吗啡递给我  我证明给你看
Hand me that vial of morphine, I'll show you.

2343
01:49:59,820 --> 01:50:02,820
如果他那么做了  如果药被调换了
If he did that, if the meds were switched,

2344
01:50:02,990 --> 01:50:05,690
那么当我把它们搞混的时候  我...
then when I got them mixed up, I...

2345
01:50:06,930 --> 01:50:08,690
我就意外地又将它们调换回来了
I accidentally switched them back,

2346
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:11,660
那么我给哈兰注射的是...
so I gave Harlan...

2347
01:50:11,660 --> 01:50:13,360
正确的剂量
The correct doses.

2348
01:50:13,700 --> 01:50:14,590
是的
Yes.

2349
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:18,990
但那并不是意外
But not accidentally.

2350
01:50:20,370 --> 01:50:23,870
我将这两瓶药的标签遮盖掉了
I taped over the label of these two vials.

2351
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:27,570
这两个瓶子是完全一样的
The vials themselves are identical.

2352
01:50:27,390 --> 01:50:28,720
{\an8}吗啡

2353
01:50:30,250 --> 01:50:32,310
你怎么知道这瓶是吗啡
How'd you know this was the morphine?

2354
01:50:32,790 --> 01:50:33,910
我就是知道
I just knew.

2355
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:36,020
你能分辨  是因为
You knew because there is the slightest,

2356
01:50:36,020 --> 01:50:37,390
这两种液体的色泽和黏度
almost imperceptible differences

2357
01:50:37,390 --> 01:50:40,500
有着几乎无法被察觉的区别
of tincture and viscosity between the two liquids.

2358
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,630
你能分辨  是因为你已操作过上百次
You knew because you've done it a hundred times.

2359
01:50:46,530 --> 01:50:48,770
你给他注射了正确的药物
You gave him the correct medication

2360
01:50:48,770 --> 01:50:51,770
因为你是一个好护士
because you are a good nurse.

2361
01:50:53,070 --> 01:50:54,110
那么哈兰...
Then Harlan was...

2362
01:50:54,110 --> 01:50:56,370
我很抱歉  玛塔  但是的
I'm sorry, Marta. But yes.

2363
01:50:57,680 --> 01:50:59,670
-哈兰当时根本没事  -我的天啊
- Harlan was perfectly fine. - Oh, my God.

2364
01:51:00,850 --> 01:51:02,240
他的血检结果是正常的
His blood was normal.

2365
01:51:03,150 --> 01:51:07,050
他的死因就是单纯的自杀
The cause of death was truly, solely suicide,

2366
01:51:07,050 --> 01:51:09,120
而你完全无罪
and you are guilty of nothing

2367
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:10,390
除了给棚架造成了些破坏
but some damage to the trellis

2368
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:12,420
以及几场业余拙劣的表演
and a few amateur theatrics.

2369
01:51:13,010 --> 01:51:15,460
事实上  如果哈兰听了你的话
In fact, if Harlan had listened to you

2370
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:17,390
打电话叫了救护车
and called the ambulance,

2371
01:51:19,170 --> 01:51:20,890
他就不会死
he would be alive today.

2372
01:51:24,540 --> 01:51:25,380
我靠
Damn!

2373
01:51:25,510 --> 01:51:27,070
这是一张错综交织的网
A twisted web

2374
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:30,710
而我们还未将其解开
and we are not finished untangling it.

2375
01:51:30,710 --> 01:51:31,800
还未完全解开
Not yet.

2376
01:51:32,450 --> 01:51:34,450
玛塔  当曾祖母发现你
Marta, when Greatnana spotted you

2377
01:51:34,450 --> 01:51:36,840
从棚架上往下爬的时候  她说..
climbing down the trellis, she said...

2378
01:51:38,050 --> 01:51:41,690
兰森  你又回来了吗
Ransom? Are you back again already?

2379
01:51:41,690 --> 01:51:44,520
她说"你又回来了吗"
"Are you back again already?"

2380
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:46,300
因为那晚早些时候
'Cause earlier that night...

2381
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:51,930
兰森  你回来了
Ransom, you're back?

2382
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:55,170
拜托  玛塔
Come on, Marta.

2383
01:51:55,170 --> 01:51:57,600
这说法真是愚蠢到家了
This is stoopid with two o's.

2384
01:51:57,600 --> 01:51:58,940
你一丁点证据都没有
You don't have a shred of evidence,

2385
01:51:58,940 --> 01:52:00,110
都是你天方夜谭的想象罢了
you're just spinning a fairy tale.

2386
01:52:00,110 --> 01:52:01,940
一丁点都没有  确实
Not a shred, no.

2387
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:05,280
就好比没有确凿的证据证明玛塔弄混了两瓶药
Just as we have no real proof of Marta mixing up the vials,

2388
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:06,580
所以各执...
so it's your word...

2389
01:52:06,580 --> 01:52:08,180
她都认罪了
You have her confession!

2390
01:52:10,650 --> 01:52:12,010
也对  确实
All right, yeah.

2391
01:52:12,850 --> 01:52:14,220
我们确实有她的供词
Yeah, we do have that.

2392
01:52:14,220 --> 01:52:14,920
如果可以
With your permission,

2393
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:17,020
我想再多想象一些
I'd like to spin a little further.

2394
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:18,690
那晚更晚的时候
Much later that night,

2395
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:20,030
你不得不回到房子里
you'd have to come back to the house...

2396
01:52:20,030 --> 01:52:22,860
取走作为罪证的动过手脚的药瓶
to retrieve the incriminating tampered vials.

2397
01:52:22,860 --> 01:52:26,030
然而  这回狗出来了
However, this time the dogs were outside.

2398
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:30,940
他们狂吠  吵醒了梅格
They barked, waking Meg.

2399
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:31,870
没关系
No matter.

2400
01:52:32,170 --> 01:52:33,870
你可以明天再拿药瓶
You'll get the vials tomorrow.

2401
01:52:34,110 --> 01:52:35,680
但是  第二天见报的新闻
But tomorrow brings news...

2402
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:38,500
不是医疗事故和有罪的护士
Not of a medical error and a guilty nurse,

2403
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:41,470
而是割喉自杀
but of a slit throat and a suicide.

2404
01:52:41,060 --> 01:52:42,980
{\an8}著名作家斯隆贝享年85岁

2405
01:52:45,450 --> 01:52:48,350
现在是匿名雇用我的
Now the circumstances are perfect

2406
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:50,480
最佳时机
for the anonymous hirin' of me.

2407
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:53,260
你知道卡布瑞拉小姐犯了罪
You know a crime has been committed by Miss Cabrera,

2408
01:52:52,850 --> 01:52:54,460
{\an8}绅士侦探

2409
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:54,830
你需要她被捉拿归案
you need her to be caught for it.

2410
01:52:54,830 --> 01:52:57,890
你不能泄露你是如何知道的
You cannot reveal how you know.

2411
01:52:59,530 --> 01:53:00,490
下面登场的是
Enter...

2412
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,260
贝努瓦·布兰克
Benoit Blanc.

2413
01:53:02,370 --> 01:53:03,040
贝尼
Benny, look...

2414
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:05,770
我听懂你的推断了  但是...
I hear what you're saying, but this...

2415
01:53:06,210 --> 01:53:08,210
尸体在第二天大清早就被发现了
The body is discovered early the next morning.

2416
01:53:08,210 --> 01:53:10,900
警察  法医  家人
The police, the medical examiner, the family,

2417
01:53:10,910 --> 01:53:13,050
所有人蜂拥而至
everyone swarms in

2418
01:53:12,210 --> 01:53:13,630
{\an8}犯罪现场  请止步

2419
01:53:13,050 --> 01:53:14,810
你根本没可能
and there is no possible way

2420
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:16,620
从玛塔的医疗包里
you can get to Marta's medical bag

2421
01:53:16,620 --> 01:53:18,050
取回药瓶
to retrieve the vials.

2422
01:53:18,050 --> 01:53:19,490
你必须等待时机
You must wait for your moment,

2423
01:53:19,490 --> 01:53:21,420
等调查结束
when the investigation is over

2424
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:24,550
等你确定房子里空无一人的时候
and you know the house will be empty.

2425
01:53:24,730 --> 01:53:26,090
所以你才
And that is why

2426
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:28,820
没有参加葬礼
you missed the funeral.

2427
01:53:29,700 --> 01:53:30,900
家里一个人也没有
There is no one home

2428
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:33,830
你就能神不知鬼不觉地去哈兰的书房
to wonder why you're going into Harlan's study.

2429
01:53:34,830 --> 01:53:36,430
但人算不如天算
Or so you think.

2430
01:53:39,510 --> 01:53:40,970
可怜的弗兰
Poor Fran.

2431
01:53:40,970 --> 01:53:42,380
她亲眼看到你在对
She witnessed you tampering

2432
01:53:42,380 --> 01:53:44,940
医疗包里哈兰的药物动手脚
with Harlan's medication in the medical bag.

2433
01:53:44,950 --> 01:53:48,440
她当时不知道你在做什么
She did not know what you were doing.

2434
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:51,220
但她知道你一定没安好心
But she knew you were up to no good.

2435
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:53,390
所以她开始对你产生怀疑
So her mind begins to turn.

2436
01:53:53,390 --> 01:53:54,410
天啊
Oh, God.

2437
01:53:55,120 --> 01:53:56,820
她跟我提到的那部贺曼公司的电影
That Hallmark movie she told me about,

2438
01:53:56,820 --> 01:53:58,410
丹妮卡·麦凯拉主演的...
with Danica McKellar...

2439
01:53:58,410 --> 01:53:59,620
《意外致死》
Deadly by Surprise.

2440
01:53:59,630 --> 01:54:01,190
原来她是指这件事
That's what she was talking about.

2441
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:02,590
她爱哈兰
She loved Harlan.

2442
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:04,760
但是恨兰森
She hates Ransom.

2443
01:54:04,900 --> 01:54:07,230
所以这个可怜的姑娘决定去证实她的猜想
So the poor girl decides to test her theory,

2444
01:54:07,230 --> 01:54:08,970
让这个混蛋付出代价
and make this asshole pay.

2445
01:54:08,970 --> 01:54:12,170
她设法拿到了一份毒理学检测报告
She gets a copy of the toxicology report.

2446
01:54:12,170 --> 01:54:15,510
说实话  我不知道她怎么做到的
Now, I will be honest, I have no idea how.

2447
01:54:15,510 --> 01:54:16,940
她有个表妹
'Cause she has a cousin.

2448
01:54:17,610 --> 01:54:18,840
她跟我说过  她有个表妹
She told me, she has a cousin

2449
01:54:18,850 --> 01:54:21,210
在法医办公室当接待员
who works as a receptionist at the examiner's office.

2450
01:54:21,220 --> 01:54:22,540
那就说得通了
Well, voila!

2451
01:54:22,620 --> 01:54:25,380
她其实对表上的数字一窍不通
The numbers, they mean nothing to her,

2452
01:54:25,650 --> 01:54:26,950
但如果兰森有罪
but if Ransom is guilty,

2453
01:54:26,950 --> 01:54:29,190
这份报告就能对他构成威胁
its existence is a threat

2454
01:54:29,190 --> 01:54:32,750
所以她复印了报告的开头  写下了勒索信
so she photocopies the header and makes her blackmail note.

2455
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:34,860
那她为什么寄给我
So why did she send it to me?

2456
01:54:34,860 --> 01:54:35,890
她没有
She didn't.

2457
01:54:36,700 --> 01:54:38,460
她寄给的是兰森
She sent it to Ransom.

2458
01:54:43,470 --> 01:54:45,630
你猜德莱斯戴尔先生收到信时
And when Mr. Drysdale gets it,

2459
01:54:45,810 --> 01:54:47,770
他是什么反应
what is his reaction?

2460
01:54:47,980 --> 01:54:49,210
得意洋洋
Elation.

2461
01:54:49,210 --> 01:54:52,910
他还误以为玛塔给哈兰注射了调包后的药物
He still thinks Marta has given Harlan the tampered drugs.

2462
01:54:52,910 --> 01:54:55,750
这份血检报告能证明她有罪
A blood tox report will prove her guilt.

2463
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:57,920
所以他满心欢喜地去听了遗嘱宣读
He goes to the will reading in high spirits,

2464
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,800
准备欣赏一家人分崩离析的好戏
ready to see the family tear itself apart,

2465
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:03,620
因为他确信一旦血检报告公开
secure in the knowledge it will be all undone

2466
01:55:03,620 --> 01:55:06,550
这一切都会全部作废
when the tox report comes to light.

2467
01:55:07,230 --> 01:55:08,320
但紧接着...
And then...

2468
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:11,590
玛塔坦白
Marta's confession.

2469
01:55:12,100 --> 01:55:14,670
事态扭转
And everything turns on its head.

2470
01:55:14,670 --> 01:55:19,040
他此时意识到玛塔并没有犯罪
He now realizes that Marta has committed no crime

2471
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:23,040
而血检报告恰好能证明她的清白
and the tox report will prove her innocence.

2472
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:25,310
修改后的遗嘱依旧有效
The changed will is gonna stand.

2473
01:55:25,510 --> 01:55:27,440
他一时慌了神
He has lost.

2474
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:30,310
除非...
Unless...

2475
01:55:31,350 --> 01:55:33,010
除非你决定...
Unless you decide...

2476
01:55:33,090 --> 01:55:34,350
你不会放弃遗产
You're not gonna give up the money.

2477
01:55:34,350 --> 01:55:36,360
你不会放弃遗产
You're not gonna give up the money.

2478
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:37,420
你都走到这一步了
You've come this far.

2479
01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:39,420
你都走到这一步了
You've come this far.

2480
01:55:39,890 --> 01:55:42,260
只要再往前走一步
Just one step further,

2481
01:55:42,430 --> 01:55:45,090
最后再行动一次
just one last act.

2482
01:55:45,270 --> 01:55:47,960
一不做  二不休
In for a penny, in for a pound.

2483
01:55:50,070 --> 01:55:51,930
你索性做到底
You decide you are in.

2484
01:55:57,040 --> 01:55:58,140
第一步
Step one...

2485
01:55:59,150 --> 01:56:02,480
销毁所有能证明玛塔清白的证据
Destroy all evidence of Marta's innocence.

2486
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:10,080
第二步
Step two,

2487
01:56:10,160 --> 01:56:12,520
向她发送匿名邮件
send her the anonymous email

2488
01:56:11,190 --> 01:56:14,210
{\an8}哥伦比亚路1209号  上午十点

2489
01:56:12,660 --> 01:56:15,020
约她上午见面
with a late morning rendezvous time...

2490
01:56:14,210 --> 01:56:15,900
{\an8}哥伦比亚路1209号  早上八点

2491
01:56:18,580 --> 01:56:21,760
然后亲自把勒索信送到她家里
And deliver her the blackmail note.

2492
01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:25,260
第三步
Step three,

2493
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:28,540
早上赴弗兰之约
keep your appointment with Fran.

2494
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:32,150
我就知道
I knew it.

2495
01:56:32,150 --> 01:56:34,810
我就知道你是个图谋不轨的王八蛋
I knew you were a no-good son of a bitch.

2496
01:56:34,950 --> 01:56:37,180
我就知道哈兰不会平白无故地自杀
I knew Harlan wouldn't just kill himself.

2497
01:56:37,350 --> 01:56:38,910
没错  弗兰  你说得对
Yes, Fran, you were right.

2498
01:56:39,050 --> 01:56:41,250
我就知道你就是凶手
I knew you were guilty as shit.

2499
01:56:41,260 --> 01:56:43,750
而现在你要为此付出代价
And now you're gonna pay for it!

2500
01:56:43,890 --> 01:56:45,220
你胆敢过来
Don't you come near me.

2501
01:56:45,530 --> 01:56:47,590
别过来  我警告你
Don't come near me! I'm warning you!

2502
01:56:57,540 --> 01:56:59,870
现在局已设好
See, now, now the board is set.

2503
01:57:00,140 --> 01:57:01,190
{\an8}毒理学检测报告

2504
01:57:00,140 --> 01:57:01,710
玛塔会收到勒索信
Marta will get the blackmail note.

2505
01:57:01,710 --> 01:57:03,880
你负责帮她拼凑线索
You'll put the pieces together for her.

2506
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:05,970
你会引导她到会面点
You'll guide her to the rendezvous.

2507
01:57:06,010 --> 01:57:07,910
再匿名报警
You'll make the anonymous call to the police,

2508
01:57:07,910 --> 01:57:09,080
警方会在现场抓她个正着
they will catch her there

2509
01:57:09,080 --> 01:57:10,950
连带着尸体和烧毁的证据一起
with the body and the burned evidence.

2510
01:57:10,950 --> 01:57:15,080
玛塔会因谋杀弗兰和哈兰而被逮捕
Marta will get arrested for killing Fran and Harlan.

2511
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:17,290
她说
She said...

2512
01:57:17,290 --> 01:57:19,080
是你干的
You did this.

2513
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:21,420
她说的不是
She didn't say...

2514
01:57:21,930 --> 01:57:23,160
"是你干的"
"You did this."

2515
01:57:24,130 --> 01:57:26,160
她不是指我  她说的是
She wasn't talking about me, she said...

2516
01:57:26,170 --> 01:57:28,370
是休干的
Hugh did this.

2517
01:57:28,370 --> 01:57:29,800
"是休干的"
"Hugh did this."

2518
01:57:30,370 --> 01:57:32,670
因为你让佣人都叫你休
'Cause you made the help call you Hugh.

2519
01:57:34,110 --> 01:57:35,520
因为你就是个混蛋
'Cause you're an asshole.

2520
01:57:36,810 --> 01:57:38,140
这计划本该奏效
And it would have worked

2521
01:57:39,080 --> 01:57:40,950
但我们阴差阳错地把你抓进警局审问
if we hadn't have brought you in for questioning

2522
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:43,780
导致你没法打匿名电话报警
so you could not make your anonymous call.

2523
01:57:43,780 --> 01:57:45,380
加之弗兰还藏了一份
And if Fran had not stashed

2524
01:57:45,390 --> 01:57:47,980
血检报告以防万一
a safety copy of the tox report.

2525
01:57:48,290 --> 01:57:52,420
玛塔也再次坏了你的好事
And if Marta had not outplayed you once again.

2526
01:57:53,230 --> 01:57:54,920
因为她心地善良
By having a kind heart.

2527
01:57:57,200 --> 01:57:59,330
救了弗兰一命
By saving Fran's life

2528
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:02,070
即便这会让她失去遗产
though it meant her losing the inheritance

2529
01:58:02,070 --> 01:58:02,940
锒铛入狱
and going to jail.

2530
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:05,160
她没有陷入你的圈套
She didn't play your game.

2531
01:58:06,070 --> 01:58:08,070
她救了弗兰的命
She saved Fran's life.

2532
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:12,370
弗兰还活着
Fran's alive?

2533
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:14,340
是的
Yes.

2534
01:58:14,550 --> 01:58:15,410
弗兰
Fran...

2535
01:58:16,050 --> 01:58:19,380
她能证实这一推测
who will confirm this very story

2536
01:58:18,350 --> 01:58:20,050
{\an9}来电
克利夫顿医院

2537
01:58:19,890 --> 01:58:21,650
至少八九不离十
or something close to it.

2538
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:25,820
然后让你  休
And send you, Hugh,

2539
01:58:26,230 --> 01:58:27,350
进监狱
to jail.

2540
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:32,930
你好
Yes?

2541
01:58:36,640 --> 01:58:38,260
医生  这真是太好了
Doctor, that's great news.

2542
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:41,030
我们马上过去  谢谢
We'll be there soon. Thank you.

2543
01:58:45,980 --> 01:58:46,840
她没事
She's okay.

2544
01:58:47,510 --> 01:58:48,840
她准备好录口供了
She's ready to talk.

2545
01:58:49,450 --> 01:58:51,180
瓦格纳警员  麻烦你
Trooper Wagner, if you could,

2546
01:58:51,380 --> 01:58:52,890
把德莱斯戴尔先生铐起来
keep Mr. Drysdale in custody

2547
01:58:52,890 --> 01:58:55,280
而艾略特警督  卡布瑞拉女士和我
while Lieutenant Elliott, Ms. Cabrera and myself,

2548
01:58:55,660 --> 01:58:57,490
会去医院给弗兰录口供
we go to the hospital and take Fran's statement.

2549
01:58:57,490 --> 01:58:59,120
好了  快站起来
All right. Up, come on.

2550
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:06,830
这话我只会当面对你说
I'm gonna say this just to you.

2551
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:08,570
这里没有监控  也不是法院
No cameras, no courtroom,

2552
01:59:08,570 --> 01:59:10,460
只有你  因为知道我说的是实话
just you, 'cause you know it's true.

2553
01:59:11,370 --> 01:59:13,270
我们让你进了我们家门
We allowed you into our home.

2554
01:59:13,270 --> 01:59:14,740
让你照看我们的爷爷
We let you watch our granddad,

2555
01:59:14,740 --> 01:59:16,440
欢迎你融入我们的大家庭
we welcomed you into our family.

2556
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:18,880
你现在还真以为能从我们手里夺走遗产
And now you think you can steal it from us?

2557
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:21,940
你以为我不会奋起反抗保护我的家
You think I'm not gonna fight to protect my home,

2558
01:59:21,950 --> 01:59:23,380
我们的继承权
our birthright,

2559
01:59:23,780 --> 01:59:26,210
还有我们代代相传的祖屋吗
our ancestral family home?

2560
01:59:28,620 --> 01:59:30,220
别胡说八道了
That is hooey.

2561
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:32,460
这栋房子是哈兰上世纪八十年代
Harlan, he bought this place in the '80s

2562
01:59:32,460 --> 01:59:34,130
从一个巴基斯坦房地产富豪那里买下的
from a Pakistani real estate billionaire.

2563
01:59:34,130 --> 01:59:35,990
闭嘴  布兰克  给我闭嘴
Shut up, Blanc! Shut up!

2564
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:40,930
收起你那油嘴滑舌拖着调子的南方乡巴佬腔
Shut up with that Kentucky Fried Foghorn Leghorn drawl!

2565
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:43,270
没错  我试图杀了弗兰  但好像没成功
Yeah, I killed Fran. But I guess I didn't.

2566
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:44,900
你们是有我什么证据吗
So what do you have on me?

2567
01:59:44,910 --> 01:59:46,910
什么都没有  所以最多判个谋杀未遂
Nothing. What, attempted murder?

2568
01:59:46,910 --> 01:59:49,340
烧房子判个纵火罪  再加上其他几项罪名
I get arson for the building, and a few other charges.

2569
01:59:49,340 --> 01:59:51,640
只要找个好律师  恰好我有
With a good lawyer, which I have,

2570
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:53,110
我用不了多久就能出狱
I'll be out in no time.

2571
01:59:53,110 --> 01:59:54,220
到时候你就等着看
And then you'll see

2572
01:59:54,220 --> 01:59:57,080
我会让你有多么生不如死
just how much hell I can wreak on your life,

2573
01:59:57,080 --> 01:59:59,550
你这个恶毒的贱婊子
you vicious little bitch.

2574
02:00:06,790 --> 02:00:08,320
搞毛啊
What the shit!

2575
02:00:09,310 --> 02:00:10,860
这说明她说谎了
That means she's lying!

2576
02:00:11,130 --> 02:00:12,330
不用你多嘴  我们知道
Yeah, man, we know.

2577
02:00:12,330 --> 02:00:13,290
没错
That's right.

2578
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:15,700
弗兰死了
Fran's dead.

2579
02:00:19,770 --> 02:00:21,770
而你刚刚承认杀了她
And you just confessed to her murder.

2580
02:00:34,660 --> 02:00:35,360
好吧
Well...

2581
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:38,020
那就不做不休
In for a penny...

2582
02:01:22,670 --> 02:01:23,460
靠
Shit.

2583
02:02:52,090 --> 02:02:55,490
{\an7}我的宝贝
是时候离开他了  他在背着你偷腥
我手里有证据  但我知道你不用看
尽早抽身  是时候了
爸爸

2584
02:02:56,860 --> 02:02:57,860
琳达
Linda!

2585
02:02:58,370 --> 02:02:59,360
琳达
Linda!

2586
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:02,200
我们得马上给律师打电话
We've gotta get the attorneys on the phone right now!

2587
02:03:02,740 --> 02:03:03,500
我们...
We...

2588
02:03:09,910 --> 02:03:11,200
我能不能问问
Can I ask

2589
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:14,170
你是什么时候知道我跟哈兰的死有关的
when did you know I had something to do with Harlan's death?

2590
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:18,710
你第一次走到我面前的时候就知道了
From the first moment you set foot in front of me.

2591
02:03:23,860 --> 02:03:24,660
该死
Shit.

2592
02:03:24,660 --> 02:03:26,290
我想让你记住一件事
I want you to remember something

2593
02:03:26,290 --> 02:03:28,090
非常重要
that's very important.

2594
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:30,190
你之所以能赢
You won,

2595
02:03:30,430 --> 02:03:32,960
不是靠哈兰给你指的路
not by playing the game Harlan's way,

2596
02:03:33,900 --> 02:03:35,090
而是靠你自己
but yours.

2597
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:38,730
你是个好人
You're a good person.

2598
02:03:40,870 --> 02:03:42,400
他们一家
This family.

2599
02:03:48,620 --> 02:03:50,710
我应该帮助他们  对吗
I should help them. Right?

2600
02:03:51,650 --> 02:03:53,950
我可没这么想
Well, I have my opinion,

2601
02:03:55,790 --> 02:03:58,250
不过我有预感你会遵从自己的内心
but I have a feeling you'll follow your heart.

2602
02:05:08,160 --> 02:05:09,790
{\an8}我的房子
我的规则
我的咖啡

2603
02:05:12,580 --> 02:05:18,840
{\an8}{\pos(193.2,37.6)}利刃出鞘
