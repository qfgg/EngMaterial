Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

21
00:02:37,755 --> 00:02:39,791
唷 我的女伴多美啊
Yo, how hot is my date?

22
00:02:39,857 --> 00:02:41,626
美呆了 哇哦
So hot. Wow.

23
00:02:41,693 --> 00:02:43,061
那你说我的女伴有多美
How 'bout how hot mine is?

24
00:02:43,127 --> 00:02:45,029
你有个女伴
You got a date?

25
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:48,199
对 她也是隐形的 所以你们看不见她
Yeah. She's invisible. That's why you can't see her.

26
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:49,866
哦 是啊 来自加拿大的那位吗
Oh, right. This is the one from "Canada"?

27
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:52,036
婚礼开始了
Wedding's starting.

28
00:03:51,429 --> 00:03:52,429
太棒了
Great.

29
00:04:00,204 --> 00:04:02,507
对 说得太对了 马蒂
True. So true, Marty.

30
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:19,190
好贴心啊
Aw. How sweet.

31
00:04:22,193 --> 00:04:23,795
哦 天啊 瞧瞧你
Oh, my. Look at you.

32
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:26,476
哦 天啊
Oh, my gosh.

33
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:44,081
这是你想要的吗 我的小蜜糖
Is it everything you wanted, my little poisonberry?

34
00:04:44,148 --> 00:04:45,616
是的 爸爸
Oh, it is, Daddy.

35
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:48,653
只不过 弗拉德爷爷怎么没来
Except where's Grandpa Vlad?

36
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:51,189
宝贝 你爷爷不会同意这事的
Honey, your gramps would not have been cool with this.

37
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:52,990
他相当老派
He's old-school.

38
00:04:53,057 --> 00:04:55,393
我们怎么知道 如果他能见见强尼
How do we know? If he could just meet Johnny...

39
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,161
他会吃了他的
He would have eaten him.

40
00:04:57,228 --> 00:05:00,097
他可不想你酷爸爸我这么开明
He's not as enlightened as your hip Daddy.

41
00:05:00,164 --> 00:05:03,568
所以 你真的可以接受他不是个怪物吗
So, you're really okay with him not being a monster?

42
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:07,605
人也好 怪物也罢 独角兽都行 只要你幸福就好
Human, monster, unicorn, as long as you're happy.

43
00:05:08,773 --> 00:05:09,841
谢谢 爸爸
Thanks, Dad.

44
00:05:12,577 --> 00:05:16,314
#你一直都是我的月光#
# And you'll always be my moonlight #

45
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,851
#但如今你乘着爱的翅膀飞翔#
# But now on wings of love you soar #

46
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:22,353
#如今你是强尼的新娘#
# Now that you're Johnny's girl #

47
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,155
#强尼的新娘#
# Johnny's girl #

48
00:05:24,222 --> 00:05:26,624
#但你也是爹地的宝贝#
# And kind of Daddy's, too #

49
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:28,526
#你妈妈会很高兴#
# Your mom would be so happy #

50
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:30,928
#因为她一直知道#
# 'Cause she always knew #

51
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:36,100
#是爱让你如此美好#
# Love is making room for all the best in you #

52
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:56,587
嘿 爸爸
Hey, Dad.

53
00:05:56,654 --> 00:05:57,755
哦 嘿 你们好
Oh, hey, guys!

54
00:05:57,822 --> 00:05:59,290
陶德 休息一下
Todd, take a break.

55
00:06:03,161 --> 00:06:04,662
有什么事情
So, what's up?

56
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:08,132
梅维斯在想你要不要出去飞一下
Mavis was wondering if maybe you wanted to go for a fly.

57
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,370
我们从不干那事 有什么特别的原因吗
Oh. We haven't done that in forever. Any special reason?

58
00:06:12,436 --> 00:06:13,938
完全没有特别原因
No special reason at all.

59
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:16,240
对吧 梅维
Right, Mavey?

60
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,142
他这是什么毛病
What's his deal?

61
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:19,510
他傻了
He's silly.

62
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:21,546
只是夜色很美 还有
It's just a beautiful night, and...

63
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:23,281
但是 如果你不想去的话
Well, if you don't want to...

64
00:06:23,347 --> 00:06:24,815
不 不 开什么玩笑
No, no! Are you kidding?

65
00:06:24,882 --> 00:06:27,385
只要能跟你出去飞 要我吃一桶大蒜都行
I would eat a bucket of garlic to fly with you.

66
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,323
宝贝 看看那些软蓬蓬的云朵
Oh, honey, look at those fluffy clouds.

67
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:09,460
还记得你小的时候我们都玩什么吗
Remember what we played when you were little?

68
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:12,330
还记得捉迷藏吗
Hide and Go Seek Sharp Objects?

69
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:16,000
好啊 跟往常一样的捉迷藏
Okay. Regular Hide and Go Seek.

70
00:07:18,502 --> 00:07:20,004
你在哪里
Where are you?

71
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,342
我的蝙蝠小宝贝
Honeybat!

72
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:27,545
梅维
Mavey!

73
00:07:29,347 --> 00:07:30,748
我的蝙蝠小宝贝
Honeybat!

74
00:07:32,116 --> 00:07:34,485
我要抓到你了
I'm gonna get you.

75
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:42,560
宝贝 你没事吧
Honey? Are you okay?

76
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:44,528
没事 只是怀了孕之后
Yes. It's just a little harder

77
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:46,764
我有点喘不过气
to catch my breath since I'm pregnant.

78
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:49,166
对啊 我想那会更加
Yes, well, I guess that would make it more...

79
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:50,301
什么
What?

80
00:07:57,575 --> 00:07:59,877
我要当外公了
I'm gonna be a grandpa!

81
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:04,649
而我要做爸爸了
And I'm gonna be a dad!

82
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:09,220
你是爸爸的小公主 或儿子
# 'Cause you're Daddy's girl, or boy #

83
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:12,156
爸爸的小公主 或儿子
# Daddy's girl, or boy #

84
00:08:12,223 --> 00:08:13,958
我又饿了 亲爱的
I'm hungry again, honey.

85
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:15,785
你能帮我拿点鱼冰淇淋吗
Can you get me some ice cream with anchovies?

86
00:08:17,995 --> 00:08:20,364
不行 不行 不行 你不能像你的欲望低头
No, no, no. You mustn't give in to your cravings.

87
00:08:20,431 --> 00:08:22,600
那对孩子不好
It's not good for the baby.

88
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,702
你得多吃点蜘蛛
You need to increase your spider intake,

89
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:26,203
那样他才能爬上天花顶
so he'll be able to climb ceilings properly.

90
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,938
还要吃大量的羊胆汁
And eat lots of sheep bile.

91
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:31,809
我爱你 爸爸 但我们都还不知道
I love you, Dad, but we don't even know

92
00:08:31,876 --> 00:08:33,911
这孩子会不会是个吸血鬼
if the kid's gonna be a vampire.

93
00:08:33,978 --> 00:08:36,914
如果这孩子是个人类 像强尼一样 我也会很激动
I'd be thrilled if the baby's human-y, just like Johnny.

94
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,117
人类 考虑到德古拉家族数千年来的基因遗传
Human-y. With thousands of years of Dracula genes.

95
00:08:40,184 --> 00:08:41,451
那是不可能的
Not gonna happen.

96
00:08:41,518 --> 00:08:43,454
只要宝宝健康就好
As long as the baby's healthy.

97
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:45,890
当然了 一个健康的小吸血鬼
Of course. A healthy little vampire.

98
00:08:45,956 --> 00:08:47,024
或者人类
Or human.

99
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:50,094
是 一个能像蝙蝠那样飞的人类
Yes, a human who can fly as a bat.

100
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:52,763
来 喝点怪物肉丸汤
Here. Just have some monster ball soup.

101
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,699
这可是按你妈咪的食谱做的哦
It's your mommy's recipe.

102
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:01,338
谢谢你 爸爸
Thank you, Dad.

103
00:09:01,405 --> 00:09:04,542
就跟我小的时候你做的一样 我的最爱
Just like you made it when I was a kid. My favorite.

104
00:09:16,387 --> 00:09:17,388
抱歉
Sorry.

105
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:35,373
先生 只有孩子的父亲能进产房
Sir, only the father is allowed in the delivery room.

106
00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:37,708
真的吗 好吧
Really? I mean, okay.

107
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:39,877
他是家人吧 我猜
He's the family, I guess.

108
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:48,819
快看 是个男孩 是个男孩
Oh, look! It's a boy! It's a boy!

109
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:52,690
德古拉血脉的延续
The Dracula bloodline carries on!

110
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:56,093
只要我在 没人能伤害你
No one will ever harm you as long as I'm here,

111
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,329
我的小魔童
my little devil dog.

112
00:09:58,396 --> 00:09:59,930
爸爸 我能抱一下我的孩子吗
Dad, can I hold my baby?

113
00:09:59,997 --> 00:10:02,266
如果我是你爸爸 我会说好
If I were Dad, I'd say yes.

114
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,702
但人家是弗朗辛护士哦
But I'm the nurse, Francine.

115
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:06,804
总之呢 给你抱啦
Here you go anyway.

116
00:10:12,276 --> 00:10:15,146
对不起
My bad.

117
00:10:19,717 --> 00:10:21,886
小丹尼斯一岁了
Little Dennis is a year old now. Wow!

118
00:10:25,723 --> 00:10:27,925
很好 很好 很可爱的孩子
Nice. Yeah. Cute kid.

119
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:34,465
好了 该拆礼物了 小朋友们
Okay, time for presents, guys.

120
00:10:34,532 --> 00:10:38,135
好的 咱们一起让这孩子嗨起来吧
All right! Let's do this boy up!

121
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:40,271
瞧瞧我给他带了什么东西
Check out what I got him. Bling!

122
00:10:40,337 --> 00:10:42,239
哇哦 这受了诅咒的吗
Wow. Is it cursed?

123
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:44,275
超强诅咒 但只有好的咒
Super cursed. Only the best.

124
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:46,544
直接从墓穴里拿出来的
Straight from the crypt.

125
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,214
他刚刚开始走路 所以这项链对他来说可能有点重
He's just starting to walk, so maybe it's heavier than...

126
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,752
没事的 丹尼索维奇
Oh. You're okay, Denisovich.

127
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:57,388
他的名字是丹尼斯 以我父亲的名字命名的
His name is Dennis. Named after my father.

128
00:10:57,455 --> 00:10:59,590
但那不是他的吸血鬼名字
It's not his vampire name.

129
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:02,059
我的小小丹尼索维奇 维索维奇
My little Denisovichy-Weesovichy.

130
00:11:02,126 --> 00:11:04,829
哈哈 我们确定他是吸血鬼吗
Huh! Are we sure he's a vampire?

131
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:06,831
我的意思是 那也不是什么坏事
I mean, not that it's a bad thing,

132
00:11:06,897 --> 00:11:11,135
但他不是得长出你们那样的尖牙还有苍白肤色吗？
but shouldn't he have fangs and that pasty skin you guys have?

133
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:12,312
实际上 得等到
Technically, you have

134
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:14,639
五岁时 尖牙才会长出来
until you're five to get your vampire fangs.

135
00:11:14,705 --> 00:11:16,574
他会长尖牙的 他是德古拉家的孩子
Oh, he'll get his fangs. He's a Dracula.

136
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:18,909
他也有一半洛克伦家的血统
He's also half Loughran.

137
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:20,777
或许他离开这里到我们家乡去会更好
Maybe he'd be better off where we live.

138
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:21,979
那儿有更多的人类
There's more humans there.

139
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:25,416
什么 看看他和他的狼人小伙伴玩得多好
What? Look how well he's playing with the wolf pups.

140
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:32,356
我们准备了一份礼物 希望你们会喜欢
We have a present. I hope it's acceptable.

141
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,159
我的第一部斩首机
My First Guillotine.

142
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:38,329
非常具有教育意义 送得好 弗兰克
Very educational. Well played, Frank.

143
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:41,666
太棒了 谢谢你们 只是我们得把这东西做一下婴儿保护
It's great. Thank you. We just have to baby-proof that.

144
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:46,070
强尼 你知道你把橡胶防护套放哪里了吗
Johnny, do you know where you put the rubber guards?

145
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:49,106
给斩首机加婴儿保护套
Baby-proofing a guillotine?

146
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:52,710
那样才能把手指头切下来 那可是乐趣之一啊
So you cut your finger off. It's part of the fun.

147
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:55,112
她让我把整个旅馆都加了婴儿保护
She made me baby-proof the whole hotel.

148
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:57,581
有人过度保护了啊
Someone's overprotective.

149
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,575
强尼 快点过来
Johnny! Come quick!

150
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:29,146
怎么了 他没事吧
What's up? He's okay?

151
00:12:29,213 --> 00:12:30,733
丹尼斯刚刚开口说话了
Dennis said his first word!

152
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:32,450
他说了吗
He did?

153
00:12:32,516 --> 00:12:34,485
来 宝宝 再说一次
Come on, honey. Say it again.

154
00:12:34,552 --> 00:12:35,553
给我血 血 血
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

155
00:12:36,954 --> 00:12:39,457
我没说 给我血 血 血
I don't say, "Bleh, bleh-bleh."

156
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:42,226
我们没说你说了啊
We didn't say you did.

157
00:12:42,293 --> 00:12:43,333
那他从哪儿听到这话的
Then where did he get that?

158
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:44,662
给我血 血 血
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

159
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:46,997
这个嘛 可能你有时候有说吧
Well, maybe sometimes you say it.

160
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:49,066
我只有在反驳我没有说的时候才会说这话
I only say it when I say I don't say it!

161
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,068
给我血 血 血
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

162
00:12:51,135 --> 00:12:53,571
好吧 小子 我们收到了 你可以说话了
Okay, kid. We get it. You can talk.

163
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:56,807
丹尼索维奇
Denisovich.

164
00:12:58,109 --> 00:12:59,510
爸爸
Dad.

165
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:00,657
检查一下有没有蛀牙而已
Just checking for cavities.

166
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:05,449
给我血 血 血
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

167
00:13:05,516 --> 00:13:06,717
给我血 血 血
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

168
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:08,819
原来是你
It was you!

169
00:13:19,797 --> 00:13:20,965
哦 天啊 莱纳德
Oh, my goodness, Leonard.

170
00:13:21,031 --> 00:13:22,900
如果你真的长得这么丑
If you really looked that hideous,

171
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,735
我觉得我没法跟你出去
I don't think I could hang out with you.

172
00:13:24,802 --> 00:13:26,337
伙计们 现在是什么情况
Guys, what's the deal?

173
00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:29,306
这是在开派对吗 快接电话
Is this a party? Pick up a phone.

174
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:32,793
我不管强尼是不是说这是一个很酷的应用软件
I don't care if Johnny said it's a "Cool app."

175
00:13:32,794 --> 00:13:34,578
强尼才来这儿没多久
Johnny's still new here.

176
00:13:34,645 --> 00:13:37,948
现在 浆糊脑子 你有没有打电话给冰鬼订灵车
Now, Porridge Head, did you call a hearse for the Gremlinbergs?

177
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:41,452
没有 你在看你的脸书页面 又在看
No, you're checking your Facebook page. Again.

178
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,254
德古拉 我跟大家说了 社交媒体
Drac, I told the guys social media

179
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,789
是推广旅馆的最好方式
is the best way to promote the hotel.

180
00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:46,056
对吧 克利夫顿
Right, Clifton?

181
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:50,227
所以 德古拉 我想说一下我作为你
So, Drac, I wanted to go through some thoughts I had,

182
00:13:50,294 --> 00:13:53,297
新任的人类关系协调助理的一些想法
as your new human relations coordinating co-assistant.

183
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:54,698
请说 毕竟这是份真正的工作
Sure. It's a real job.

184
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:57,768
而不是为了让梅维开心 你赖着不走的低廉借口
Not a cheap excuse to keep Mavis happy, so you never leave here.

185
00:13:57,835 --> 00:14:00,404
没错 所以 我在想
Right. So, I was thinking,

186
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:04,441
既然我们都有这么多人类来这儿了 那或许可以更新一些配备
since we have so many humans now, maybe update some of the acts?

187
00:14:04,508 --> 00:14:05,910
比如 或许换一下魔术师
Like, maybe the magician?

188
00:14:05,976 --> 00:14:07,978
三只眼哈利有什么不好
What's wrong with Harry Three-Eye?

189
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:11,182
对于人类来说 他可能有点老派
Well, he might be a little old-school for the humans.

190
00:14:11,248 --> 00:14:13,250
告诉我 先生 你的牌是什么
Tell me, sir, what was your card?

191
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:14,785
黑桃三
The three of spades?

192
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:18,956
这是你的牌吗 我的朋友
Is this your card, my friend?

193
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:20,891
哇哦
Whoa!

194
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,662
不行 哈利很棒
No, Harry's great.

195
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:26,864
不能把观众不嗨怪在哈利头上
Can't blame Harry for the crowd not being hip.

196
00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:29,033
好吧 那韦恩呢
Okay, what about Wayne?

197
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:30,701
韦恩 你是疯了吗 他是我的兄弟
Wayne? Are you nuts? He's my boy.

198
00:14:30,768 --> 00:14:32,670
那能换个活儿给他吗 不要网球可以吗
Then maybe something other than tennis?

199
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:34,872
好了 你要做的就是
Okay, so, what you wanna do

200
00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:36,807
球来的时候举起拍子
is lift the racket right on impact,

201
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:38,409
然后就能打出一手好球了
so you get that nice top spin.

202
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:39,944
试试打一个吧
Try and hit one.

203
00:14:48,786 --> 00:14:51,722
什么东西 什么声音 是从我身上发出来的
What is that? What's the noise? It's on me!

204
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:53,691
是我给你买的手机响了而已
It's just the cell phone I got you.

205
00:14:53,757 --> 00:14:54,803
克利夫顿在给你发短信
Clifton's sending you a

206
00:14:54,804 --> 00:14:56,760
好让你能练习下怎么回短信
text so you can practice how to write back.

207
00:15:00,798 --> 00:15:01,999
什么东 这破手机不听使唤
What the... It's not doing it.

208
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:03,100
我来
I got it.

209
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:09,707
现在你可以给克利夫顿发短信了
Now you can text Clifton.

210
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,009
好吧好吧
All right, fine.

211
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,778
你是怎么做到的
How do you do this?

212
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:15,965
或许是你的指甲的问题
Maybe it's your fingernails.

213
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:18,415
很简单的 看 我给梅维丝发条短信
It's easy. Look. I'll text Mavis.

214
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:21,352
今晚要约会了 好激动啊
Psyched for date night.

215
00:15:21,418 --> 00:15:23,687
看见么 看 她立马就回我了
See? And now look, she texted right back.

216
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:25,890
“取消吧 我离不开丹尼斯”
Gotta cancel. Can't leave Dennis.

217
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,825
好吧
Okay.

218
00:15:27,892 --> 00:15:32,563
我们再也不能独处了吗
Are we never allowed to be alone again?

219
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,433
我也需要被爱啊
I need to feel loved, too.

220
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,236
然后发送
And send.

221
00:15:39,303 --> 00:15:42,573
够了 我只学会一件事 你真窝囊
Okay. All that taught me is that you're pathetic.

222
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,875
嗯 知道了 或许你就用蓝牙
Yeah, got it. Maybe you should just get Bluetooth.

223
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:47,244
没问题 蓝牙 过来
Okay. Blue Tooth, come over here.

224
00:15:50,314 --> 00:15:51,615
然后呢
So, now what?

225
00:15:56,086 --> 00:15:58,389
该起床啦 我的丹尼索维奇
Rise and shine, my Denisovich.

226
00:15:58,455 --> 00:16:00,157
嗨 外公
Hi, Papa.

227
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:03,561
你好啊 我的小恶魔 你做了个香甜的噩梦吗
Hello, my little devil. Did you have sweet nightmares?

228
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:07,431
嗯哼 我梦见了一条剑龙
Uh-huh. I dreamed that I saw a stegosaurus.

229
00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:09,667
噢 然后你在喝他的血吗
Oh... And were you drinking his blood?

230
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:11,635
没有
No.

231
00:16:11,702 --> 00:16:12,970
那不管他了
Just throwing it out there.

232
00:16:13,037 --> 00:16:14,505
嘿 想不想做些很酷的事
Hey! You want to do something cool?

233
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:17,141
想
Yeah!

234
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:21,745
我来教你怎样变成蝙蝠 像我一样
I'm going to teach you how to turn into a bat. Like me.

235

236
00:16:23,714 --> 00:16:25,349
没错 很酷 我就说了

237
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:27,318

00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:31,755

243
00:16:38,762 --> 00:16:43,267
丹尼索维奇 深呼吸 你真的可以变成蝙蝠的
Denisovich. Take a breath. You can really turn into a bat.

244
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:45,369
试试 找到蝙蝠的感觉
Try. Feel the bat.

245
00:16:47,738 --> 00:16:49,239
不是只小鸡
Not a chicken.

246
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:53,744
那是什么 机械舞吗
What's that? The electric boogaloo?

247
00:16:53,811 --> 00:16:56,680
我要是跳段舞给你看 你能试着飞一下吗
If I show you I can bust a move, will you try to fly, then?

248
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:57,747
嗯哼
Uh-huh.

249
00:17:12,627 --> 00:17:14,431
爸爸 你们怎么在跳舞
Dad? Why are you guys dancing?

250

呃 他在梦舞
Uh, he was sleep-dancing.

251
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:19,236
过来 小甜心 回床上睡觉吧
Come on, sweetie. Back to bed.

252
00:17:19,303 --> 00:17:22,239
“回床上睡觉吧” 已经过了晚上八点了
Back to bed? It's already after 8:00 p.M.

253
00:17:22,306 --> 00:17:24,241
你不记得新的作息表了吗
Don't you remember the new sleep schedule?

254
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:25,209
他要去上半天的人类课堂
He's going to human classes half the day.

255
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:28,675
今晚他要是能睡到凌晨两点的话
If he could just sleep till 2:00 A.M.

256
00:17:28,676 --> 00:17:30,114
对他来说就太好了
Tonight, it'd be so great for him.

257
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,116
但是 宝贝小死神 韦恩的六条小狼犬
But, honeydeath, six of Wayne's wolf pups

你不会忍心让他错过吧
You wouldn't want him to miss that.

260
00:17:36,353 --> 00:17:37,794
爸爸 我爱那些小狼犬
Dad, I love the wolf pups,

261
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:40,124
但是他们对于丹尼斯来说 有些太粗暴了
but they're a little too rough for Dennis.

262
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,426
“太粗暴”
Too rough?

263
00:17:42,493 --> 00:17:44,495
你没注意到吗 丹尼斯不一样
Haven't you noticed? Dennis is different.

264
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:47,364
你在说什么 丹尼索维奇不该与怪兽为伍吗
What are you saying? Denisovich shouldn't be around monsters?

265
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:50,668
-我爱怪兽 动画片 动画片 -哈
I love monsters! Video! Video! Ha!

没错
Yeah!

268
00:17:56,774 --> 00:17:58,909
谁是最酷的怪兽
Who's the coolest monster?

269
00:17:58,976 --> 00:18:00,744
蛋糕糕
Kakie!

00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:03,781
蛋糕糕是一只快乐的怪兽
Wee! Kakie one happy monster!

271

蛋糕糕爱吃蛋糕 好吃

00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:14,391
吃点蛋糕吧 唔兹拉帕巴姆
Have some cake, Wuzzlelumplebum.

275
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:18,362
记住了 孩子们 真正的怪兽喜欢分享
Remember, kids, a real monster always shares.

276
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:23,233
“分享”没错 我一想到怪兽的时候就会想到“分享”
Shares? Yes! When I think monsters, I think "Shares."

277
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,804
现在 让我来告诉你什么才是真正的怪兽 丹尼索维奇
Now, let me tell you what a real monster is, Denisovich.

278
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:30,474
爸爸 别这样 他才五岁啊 别逼他
Dad, please. He's practically five already. Don't force it.

279
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:36,580
慢慢来 唔兹拉帕巴姆
Slow down, Wuzzlelumplebum.

280
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:45,622
一闪一闪小星星 究竟何物
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star How I wonder #

281
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:48,158
妈咪 我已经过了听摇篮曲的年龄了
Mommy, I'm too old for lullabies.

282
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:50,394
什么 摇篮曲不是那样唱的
What? That's not how that one goes.

283
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:52,029
大多数人都这样唱
This is the way most people sing it.

284
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:54,298
“大多数人” 我的版本又怎么了
Most people? What's wrong with...

285
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:57,801
受苦 受难 痛苦中尖叫
# Suffer, suffer, scream in pain #

286
00:18:57,868 --> 00:19:01,238
鲜血从你脑中溢
# Blood is spilling from your brain #

287
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:04,007
-爸爸 -得了吧 你知道我就是这样唱给你听的
Daddy. Come on. You know how I sang it to you.

288
00:19:04,074 --> 00:19:07,211
僵尸咬你像葡干
# Zombies gnaw you like a plum #

289
00:19:07,277 --> 00:19:10,414
撕成碎片你完蛋
# Piercing cries and you succumb #

290
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:15,953
受苦 受难 痛苦中尖叫
# Suffer, suffer, scream in pain #

291
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:21,058
然后你就死翘翘
# You will never breathe again #

292
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,528
还是有用的嘛
Still works.

293
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:49,853
生日快乐 沃利 维尔森
Happy birthday, Wally, Wilson,

294
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,855
伍皮 伟伦 维皮还有韦恩
Whoopi, Waylon, Weepy and Wanye.

295
00:19:53,557 --> 00:19:56,160
丹尼索维奇 好孩子 你来了
Denisovich! My big boy! You made it!

296
00:19:57,161 --> 00:19:59,396
我仔细想了下你所说的 爸爸
I thought about what you said, Dad.

297
00:19:59,463 --> 00:20:01,198
或许我有点保护过度了
Maybe I was being a little overprotective.

298
00:20:01,265 --> 00:20:03,167
谢谢你 棺材蛋糕小甜心
Thank you, coffin cake.

299
00:20:04,168 --> 00:20:05,803
丹尼斯 我爱你 噌
Dennis! I love you! Zing!

300
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:07,404
嗨 温妮
Hi, Winnie.

301
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:10,607
我真的好爱你的美味草莓锁 噌 噌
I just love your yummy strawberry locks! Zing, zing!

302
00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:17,648
温妮 别老缠着丹尼斯 亲爱的 抱歉 梅维丝
Winnie. Give him his space, hon. I'm sorry, Mavis.

303
00:20:17,714 --> 00:20:20,384
没事的 旺达阿姨 他们只是在闹着玩
It's okay, Aunt Wanda. They're just playing.

304
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,154
噢 天呐 地狱边境吗 我之前爱死那游戏了
Holy rabies! Limbo? I used to love that game!

305
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:26,056
去玩啊 梅维
Get in there, Mavey.

306
00:20:26,123 --> 00:20:27,724
真的吗 但是我现在为人母了啊
Really? But I'm a parent now.

307
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,159
给他们看看是怎么玩
Show 'em how it's done.

308
00:20:29,226 --> 00:20:30,460
好的 好的 好的
Okay. Okay, okay.

309
00:20:39,469 --> 00:20:41,071
不是吧 一个皮纳塔
No way! A pinata?

310
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:46,677
噢 梅维丝 亲爱的 那个稍后再玩
Oh, Mavis, honey. That's for later.

311
00:20:48,712 --> 00:20:50,352
我们不想小狼犬们吃太多的
We don't want the pups to have too much...

312
00:20:50,814 --> 00:20:52,249
糖果
Candy!

313
00:20:55,852 --> 00:20:56,852
糖
Sugar.

314
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:06,597
对不起 是我引起的吗
I'm sorry. Did I start all that?

315
00:21:06,663 --> 00:21:08,703
别担心 幼崽们就是这样闹腾
Don't worry. There's a reason they call it a litter.

316
00:21:20,844 --> 00:21:22,813
丹尼斯 你还好吗
Dennis! Are you okay?

317
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:24,781
我抢到一颗糖
I got a candy.

318
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:26,750
看 你掉了颗牙
Look! Your tooth came out.

319
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:29,253
不是吧 他的牙磕掉了吗
Are you kidding me? He got his tooth knocked out?

320
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:32,356
噢 是的 没错 要长出尖牙啦
Oh, yes, indeed. Here comes the fang.

321
00:21:32,422 --> 00:21:35,525
爸爸 他的乳齿都不是尖牙 这颗怎么会是呢
Dad. His baby tooth wasn't a fang. Why would this one be?

322
00:21:35,592 --> 00:21:37,160
他不是个怪物
He's not a monster.

323
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:45,135
太阳就要出来了 我们得送他去上课了
The sun's gonna come out soon, and we gotta get to his classes.

324
00:21:45,202 --> 00:21:48,939
我们这的课程有什么不好吗 比如说儿童瑜伽
What's wrong with the classes we have here? Like the kids' yoga?

325
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:53,043
瑜伽
Yoga!

326
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,178
这儿是丹尼索维奇的家
This is Denisovich's home.

327
00:21:55,245 --> 00:21:56,780
我不知道 爸爸
I don't know, Dad.

328
00:21:56,847 --> 00:21:58,215
你不知道什么
What don't you know?

329
00:21:58,282 --> 00:22:01,752
嗯 我们在想要不要搬家
Well, we've been talking about moving.

330
00:22:01,818 --> 00:22:04,254
搬到对于丹尼斯来说更安全的地方去
Somewhere safer for Dennis.

331
00:22:04,321 --> 00:22:07,224
或许搬到加利福尼亚 强尼长大的地方去
Maybe where Johnny grew up in California.

332
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,719
对不起 但是你不能
I'm sorry, but you can't

333
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,161
强迫别人变成自身以外的东西
just make somebody something they're not.

334
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:14,765
过来 亲爱的 我们得走了
Come on, honey. We have to go.

335
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:16,033
噌 噌
Zing, zing?

336
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:19,970
梅维 等等 你不是认真的吧
Mavey, wait. You can't mean that.

337
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,242
这事儿你有份吗 要搬家
You're in on this? The leaving?

338
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:28,145
呃 都还不确定
Uh... It's not definite at all.

339
00:22:28,211 --> 00:22:29,413
她只是在说说而已
It's just something she's definitely talking about,

340
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:31,715
但在我们搬走之前 都还不确定
but until we do it, it's not definitized.

341
00:22:35,185 --> 00:22:37,120
他是用鸟饵把我埋起来了吗
Did he just cover me with birdseed?

342
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:39,423
没错 他把我埋起来了
Yeah, he covered me.

343
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:52,469
爸爸 这不是尖牙
Dad, it's not a fang.

344
00:22:52,536 --> 00:22:55,672
爸爸 我不知道这里是否是丹尼斯的好居所
Dad, I don't know if it's the right place for Dennis.

345
00:22:55,739 --> 00:22:57,374
对吧 强尼
Right, Johnny?

346
00:22:57,441 --> 00:23:00,677
噢 嘿 老家伙 不是我 是梅维
Oh, hey, dudeman. It's not me. It's Mavey.

347
00:23:00,744 --> 00:23:04,114
嘿 老家伙 我胆小怕事
Hey, dudeman. I'm afraid to say anything.

348
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:06,450
嘿 老家伙 我是个老家伙
Hey, dudeman. I'm a dudeman!

349
00:23:06,516 --> 00:23:08,986
呃 德古拉 你在和谁说话
Uh, Drac? Who you talkin' to?

350
00:23:09,052 --> 00:23:11,221
别来打扰 伯爵现在很不满
Do not disturb. The count's wiggin' out in here.

351
00:23:12,656 --> 00:23:14,524
德古拉 你在不满些什么
What are you wiggin' out about, Drac?

352
00:23:14,591 --> 00:23:17,928
孩子们 梅维说她想要搬家
The kids. Mavey Wavey's saying she wants to leave.

353
00:23:17,995 --> 00:23:20,630
她想要搬家 强尼怎么说 他不想走啊
She wants to leave? What about Johnny? He doesn't wanna go.

354
00:23:20,697 --> 00:23:23,033
他为了丹尼斯把旅馆变得更有人味啊
He's making the hotel more human-y for Dennis.

355
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,868
你懂的 因为他不是个怪物
You know, seeing that he isn't a monster.

356
00:23:24,935 --> 00:23:26,303
他是个怪物
He is a monster!

357
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,437
他只不过是晚长牙而已
He's just a late fanger.

358
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:28,538
嗯哼
Mmm-hmm.

359
00:23:28,605 --> 00:23:30,140
那我可以成为个手模
And I could be a hand model.

360
00:23:30,207 --> 00:23:32,442
闭嘴 都是那些人类的破事
Shut up! It's all that human-y stuff

361
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:36,046
困扰了可怜的丹尼索维奇
that's confusing poor Denisovich.

362
00:23:36,113 --> 00:23:39,249
所以或许你可以让丹尼索维奇身处在更多的怪兽事儿里
So maybe you gotta get the kid around more monster-y things. Ooh!

363
00:23:39,316 --> 00:23:41,451
噢 我需要件斗篷
Oh, I need a cape.

364
00:23:41,518 --> 00:23:44,621
不行啊 梅维丝总是在周围监督着我
I can't. She's always around, checking up on me.

365
00:23:44,688 --> 00:23:47,924
老兄 要是你有些独处的时间就好了
Man, if you could just get some alone time.

366
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:50,360
等会 那也是强尼想要的
Wait a minute. That's what Johnny wants, too.

367
00:23:51,361 --> 00:23:53,530
和梅维丝独处
Alone time with Mavis.

368
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:57,501
在他们结婚前
Have they even had a vacation

369
00:23:57,567 --> 00:23:59,069
他们度过假吗
since before they were married?

370
00:24:03,073 --> 00:24:06,309
他们现在要去了 还有我们 弗兰克 你真是个天才
They're going to now. And so are we. Frank, you're a genius.

371
00:24:18,088 --> 00:24:19,088
嗯哼
Mmm-hmm.

372
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,762
我们要带着丹尼索维奇去所有我们常去的地方
We'll take Denisovich to all our old haunts.

373
00:24:27,664 --> 00:24:29,064
每个人都展示给他看我们的技能
Each of us will show him our skills.

374
00:24:31,201 --> 00:24:33,303
教会他如何做一个怪物
Teach him how to be a monster.

375
00:24:35,772 --> 00:24:38,308
然后他很快就会长出尖牙的
And he'll be fanging it up in no time.

376
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,510
小家伙下周就五岁了
Boy turns five next week.

377
00:24:40,577 --> 00:24:43,113
到他生日那天要是还不能成为吸血鬼的话 就再也不可能了
If he's not a vampire by his birthday, it ain't happenin'.

378
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,415
噢 不会那样的 宝贝
Oh, it ain't ain't happening, baby.

379
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:47,818
他所需要的就是与他的吸血公独处
All he needs is time with his vampa.

380
00:24:47,884 --> 00:24:49,219
“吸血公”
Vampa?

381
00:24:49,286 --> 00:24:50,620
吸血鬼外公
Vampire grandpa.

382
00:24:50,687 --> 00:24:52,622
不是吧 老兄 很明显的好吧
Come on, man. That's obvious.

383
00:24:55,025 --> 00:24:57,227
强尼 出来一下
Johnny. Come outside.

384
00:24:57,294 --> 00:24:59,629
什么 谁在外面
What? Who is it?

385
00:24:59,696 --> 00:25:02,199
是你岳父 我们谈谈
It's your father-in-law. I need to talk to you.

386
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:04,868
怎么了
What's up?

387
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,005
先让我赶开他们 抱歉
Let me get rid of them. Sorry.

388
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:12,175
没关系 我有在试着集中注意力
No problem-o. I was kinda diggin' the attention.

389
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:17,214
他俩能待着吗 我觉得他俩还没准备好离开
Can they stay? I don't think they're ready to leave yet.

390
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,416
去去去 找你的妈妈去
Come on. Go to your mother.

391
00:25:19,483 --> 00:25:20,684
听着 你想留在这儿 是吗
Look, you want to stay here, right?

392
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,519
当然
Of course.

393
00:25:22,586 --> 00:25:25,255
这是第一个我能真正做我自己的地方
This is the first place where I can really be myself.

394
00:25:25,322 --> 00:25:26,643
自从他们发明了芝心匹萨后
I haven't felt this alive

395
00:25:26,644 --> 00:25:28,758
我从未感到如此有活力
since they invented stuffed-crust pizza.

396
00:25:28,825 --> 00:25:33,129
嗯 那 我们得做些事情 我的计划是这样的
Well, then, we've got some work to do. Okay, so here's the plan.

397
00:25:33,196 --> 00:25:35,465
或许带她回你的家乡是个好主意
Maybe it's a good idea to take her to your hometown.

398
00:25:35,532 --> 00:25:37,767
但是记住
But remember...

399
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:40,670
嗯 要给他吃牛油果切片 杏仁燕麦片
So, it's sliced avocado, rolled oats with apricot,

400
00:25:40,737 --> 00:25:43,039
每次洗完澡都要记得擦上艾维诺润肤霜
the Aveeno moisturizer after every bath.

401
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:46,409
然后在他皮肤粘膜色素沉着之前在他屁股上擦上牛油树脂
And then the shea butter on his tush before his PJs

402
00:25:46,476 --> 00:25:49,179
然后在我给他念自然拼读教材的时候
and then 20 minutes with the nebulizer

403
00:25:49,246 --> 00:25:52,449
用二十分钟的喷雾器
while I read his Learning Factory Phonics book to him.

404
00:25:52,516 --> 00:25:55,886
带小孩很麻烦的 爸爸 我们可以带上丹尼斯的
It's asking a lot, Dad. We could just take Dennis with us.

405
00:25:55,952 --> 00:25:58,822
什么 逗我呢 然后打破他的日常生活习惯吗
What? Are you kidding me? And get him off his routine?

406
00:25:58,889 --> 00:26:00,190
不不不
No, no, no.

407
00:26:00,257 --> 00:26:02,292
你们去加利福尼亚吧
You kids go to California,

408
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:04,728
去看看那里是否是养育丹尼索维奇的好地方
and see if it's the right place to raise Denisovich.

409
00:26:04,794 --> 00:26:06,563
你记得怎么视频通话吧
And you remember how to video chat?

410
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,933
记得记得 用手机然后按键然后就是折磨

Of course, Mavey. Stake my heart and hope to die.

414
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:19,442
我只是会很想他
I'm just gonna miss him so much.

415
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,212
我爱你 丹尼斯

我爱你 妈咪

你最棒了 我爱你 爸爸
You're the best. I love you, Dad.

422
00:26:40,797 --> 00:26:44,501
记得我们的计划 让她分心然后高兴就好
Now, remember the plan. Just keep her distracted and happy.

423
00:26:44,568 --> 00:26:47,003
-但是不要太高兴了 明白吗 -明白
But not too happy, capisce? Got it.

424
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,606
执行行动“让她分心然后高兴就好”
Operation "Just Keep Her Distracted and Happy,

425
00:26:49,673 --> 00:26:52,976
“但是不要太高兴了 明白吗” 立即开始 没错吧
But Not Too Happy, Capisce, Starts now. Cool?

426
00:26:53,043 --> 00:26:54,511
表面要笑嘻嘻的
Smiling on the outside.

427
00:26:54,578 --> 00:26:55,679
你会拥抱我的背包吗
Will you hug my backpack?

428
00:26:55,745 --> 00:26:56,745
不
No.

429
00:27:03,286 --> 00:27:05,155
回床上睡觉吧
Back to bed.

430
00:27:05,222 --> 00:27:08,358
啊 是 我们要上床睡觉了 我们都爱床
Ah, yes, we'll get to the bed. We all love the bed.

431
00:27:08,425 --> 00:27:10,694
但是我们要先做一件事
But we're just gonna do one thing first.

432
00:27:14,598 --> 00:27:16,399
我们要去的地方天气热吗
Is it shorts weather where we're going?

433
00:27:16,466 --> 00:27:19,135
天 希望不是 我的身材还没恢复到可以穿泳衣
Jeez. I hope not. My body isn't swimsuit-ready yet.

434
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:21,471
随便 格里芬在哪
Whatever. Where's Griffin?

435
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:23,807
嘿 能等会吗 我想和艾米丽告别
Hey, can I have a second? I'm just saying goodbye to Emily.

436
00:27:23,873 --> 00:27:25,508
噢 兄弟
Oh, brother.

437
00:27:25,575 --> 00:27:28,144
我会非常想你的
I'm gonna miss you so much.

438
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:29,980
坚强点 亲爱的
You know, you have to be strong, honey.

439
00:27:30,046 --> 00:27:31,446
因为我们间的感情坚如磐石
Because what we have is unbreakable.

440
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,553
宝贝 别哭了 大家都在看呢
Babe, don't cry. Everyone's looking.

441
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,221
好吧 我跟他好好学学这个
Okay, I gotta call him on this.

442
00:27:38,288 --> 00:27:41,258
就让他演完吧 早完早散场
Just let him play it out, get it over with.

443
00:27:41,324 --> 00:27:42,974
好了 你们这对鸳鸯
Okay, you two lovebirds.

444
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:45,795
喝你的香槟然后走吧
Drink your champagne and let's get going.

445
00:27:45,862 --> 00:27:48,064
噢 是 当然 好的
Oh, yeah. No, sure. Okay.

446
00:27:48,131 --> 00:27:49,131
干杯 宝贝
Cheers, babe.

447
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:53,536
噢 你这个笨蛋
Oh. You klutz.

448
00:27:53,603 --> 00:27:55,672
我们就不能说说吗
We can't say nothin' about this?

449
00:27:55,739 --> 00:27:57,099
不行 我们没时间磨蹭了
No. We don't have time for zingers.

450
00:28:05,582 --> 00:28:09,019
这该死的安全带是怎么系上的
How do you click in the stupid car seat?

451
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:10,754
老兄 剪剪指甲吧
You gotta cut those nails, man.

452
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,522
我们都只是用胶带绑着我们的孩子
We just strap our kids down with duct tape.

453
00:28:17,394 --> 00:28:18,995
他在这干嘛
What's he doing here?

454
00:28:19,062 --> 00:28:21,865
我跟他说他可以来 他从没出过旅馆
I told him he could come. He's never been outside the hotel.

455
00:28:21,931 --> 00:28:24,634
布拉比 没位置了 不好意思 老兄
Blobby, there's no room. Sorry, man.

456
00:28:27,303 --> 00:28:29,005
嗯 不是吧
Yeah, that ain't happenin'.

457
00:28:29,072 --> 00:28:31,708
好吧 把他安置在调皮鬼摩托车上 走吧
Fine, put him on the Rascal. Let's just get going.

458
00:28:46,623 --> 00:28:49,025
我们去哪儿啊 德古拉外公
Where are we going, Papa Drac?

459
00:28:49,092 --> 00:28:51,494
噢 丹尼索维奇 我们去冒险
Oh, Denisovich, we're going to have an adventure.

460
00:28:51,561 --> 00:28:53,730
一场怪物冒险之旅
A monster-y adventure.

461
00:28:53,797 --> 00:28:56,666
耶 怪物 我们去吃蛋糕
Yay! Monsters! We're gonna eat cake.

462
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:58,768
他刚说什么
What did he say?

463
00:28:58,835 --> 00:29:01,237
不 这次怪物之旅没有蛋糕
No. No cake on this monster trip.

464
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:04,841
没有蛋糕 因为蛋糕糕说“吃太多蛋糕会肚子痛”
No cake, cebause Kakie says, "Too much cake makes tummy ache."

465
00:29:05,175 --> 00:29:06,476
耶
Yay!

466
00:29:06,543 --> 00:29:07,977
“怪物喜欢分享”
A monster always shares.

467
00:29:09,646 --> 00:29:11,047
哇哦
Wow!

468
00:29:11,114 --> 00:29:13,450
看来要不止一周了
We may need more than a week.

469
00:29:13,516 --> 00:29:16,686
嘿 你知道谁能快速治好小孩吗 弗拉德
Hey, you know who could fix the kid in a snap? Vlad.

470
00:29:16,753 --> 00:29:20,223
什么 我们不需要叫弗拉德 我们自有办法
What? We don't need to call Vlad. We got this.

471
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:24,828
看见没 丹尼索维奇 怪物们都很和善 和你一样
You see, Denisovich, monsters are nice, just like you.

472
00:29:24,894 --> 00:29:29,099
但是月亮一出来 真正的怪物活动就开始了
But when the moon comes out, the real monster fun begins.

473
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:32,469
很可怕 对吧 伙计们
Being scary. Right, guys?

474
00:29:36,406 --> 00:29:37,766
伙计们 伙计们 你们有什么毛病
Guys? Guys! What is wrong with you?

475
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:41,845
别这样 人人都爱那首歌
Come on. Everybody likes that song.

476
00:29:41,911 --> 00:29:45,682
我们不是普通人 我们是可怕的怪物 记得吗
We're not everybody. We're scary monsters. Remember?

477
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:46,983
嘿 你在放什么
Hey, what are you putting in?

478
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,518
是本电子书
It's an audio book.

479
00:29:48,585 --> 00:29:51,688
大脚怪的人生故事 自动播放的
Bigfoot's life story. He reads it himself.

480
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:53,389
第一章
Chapter One.

481
00:30:26,923 --> 00:30:29,058
这次旅行肯定棒呆了
This is gonna be so amazing.

482
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:32,162
噢 没错 你会很高兴的 但不会太高兴
Oh, yeah. You're gonna be so happy, but not too happy.

483
00:30:32,228 --> 00:30:33,663
-哈 -什么
Huh? What?

484
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,999
我想看你成长过程中做的每件事
I wanna see everything you did growing up.

485
00:30:36,065 --> 00:30:38,201
只要你分心了 明白吗
As long as you're distracted, capisce?

486
00:30:40,136 --> 00:30:41,704
我们在拜访我父母的路上可以参观一些景点
We can hit a few spots on the way to my parents.

487
00:30:41,771 --> 00:30:43,273
让我给家里打个电话
Lemme just quickly call home.

488
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:45,008
啊 别打
Ah! Don't do that.

489
00:30:45,074 --> 00:30:47,877
那里才凌晨一点 丹尼斯还没起床呢
It's only 1:00 A.M. There. Dennis isn't even up yet.

490
00:30:47,944 --> 00:30:51,214
没错 我只是还不习惯离开他
Right. I'm just not used to being away from him.

491
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:53,716
没事的 你爸爸都能搞定
Everything's gonna be cool. Your dad was so all over it.

492
00:30:53,783 --> 00:30:55,819
我知道 他最棒了
I know. He's the best.

493
00:31:16,506 --> 00:31:17,807
右拐 这里
Right turn, here.

494
00:31:18,808 --> 00:31:20,643
丹尼索维奇 该起床啦
Denisovich, rise and shine.

495
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:24,881
伙计们，这让你们想起了什么
Boys, this bringing back any memories?

496
00:31:24,948 --> 00:31:28,218
我们一百岁的时候还曾经在这里徘徊
We used to prowl around here when we were in our 100s.

497
00:31:28,284 --> 00:31:31,588
斯洛博齐亚的黑暗森林
The Dark Forest of Slobozia.

498
00:31:40,997 --> 00:31:42,632
他们建成这样挺漂亮的
Nice how they built it up.

499
00:31:42,699 --> 00:31:44,868
好吧 下车
Okay, out of the car.

500
00:31:44,934 --> 00:31:47,470
丹尼索维奇 你将会看到
Denisovich, you're going to see

501
00:31:47,537 --> 00:31:50,039
每一个怪物各显身手
every monster do his specialty.

502
00:31:50,106 --> 00:31:53,743
首先 弗兰克会让我们知道 他是怎么吓人的
First, Frank's gonna show us how he scares people.

503
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:56,579
耶 他会说 吓死你
Yay! He's gonna say, "Boo."

504
00:31:56,646 --> 00:31:59,115
是的 但是我不认为这样吓人每次都有用
Yeah, I don't think "Boos" Ever work.

505
00:31:59,182 --> 00:32:02,218
但是这就是为什么我们现在来到这里 来向大师学习
But that's why we're here. To learn from the master.

506
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:05,088
好 我先露一手
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

507
00:32:21,137 --> 00:32:23,306
是的 我猜测这取决于工作
Yeah, guess it just depends on work.

508
00:32:24,941 --> 00:32:26,476
科学怪人
Frankenstein!

509
00:32:26,543 --> 00:32:28,611
嘿 你们好吗
Hey, how ya doin'?

510
00:32:28,678 --> 00:32:31,781

You're awesome! Can we take a picture? Is that okay?

511
00:32:31,848 --> 00:32:33,850
当然没问题 不就是个小自拍嘛
Sure, okay. Little selfie action.

512
00:32:35,118 --> 00:32:36,118
不是吧
For real?

513
00:32:36,786 --> 00:32:38,321
太酷了 谢谢你
Awesome! Thank you so much.

514
00:32:38,388 --> 00:32:39,656
嘿 祝你们过得愉快
Hey, have a great day.

515
00:32:40,323 --> 00:32:41,858
吓死你
Boo!

516
00:32:41,925 --> 00:32:44,060
哦 他好可爱啊 好可爱啊
Oh. He's adorable. He's adorable.

517
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:46,062
是挺可爱的 没错
Adorable, yes.

518
00:32:46,129 --> 00:32:48,998
虽然不吓人 但好歹是个开始
Not scary, but "Boo" Is a start.

519
00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:02,679
我生日蛋糕上将会有最酷的人
My birthday cake's gonna have the coolest guy on it.

520
00:33:02,745 --> 00:33:05,081
让我猜猜 蛋糕糕
Let me guess. Kakie.

521
00:33:05,148 --> 00:33:08,952
不是他 他真的很酷 穿着斗篷 在墙壁间穿梭
No. He's so cool. He climbs walls and wears a cape.

522
00:33:09,018 --> 00:33:11,988
哦是吗 那这个很酷的人是谁呢
Oh, really. And who is this very cool guy?

523
00:33:12,055 --> 00:33:13,723
蝙蝠侠
Batman!

524
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,525
蝙蝠侠 很好
Batman. Great.

525
00:33:15,592 --> 00:33:18,795
你不知道另外一个带斗篷的人也很酷吗
You don't know anyone else with a cape that's cool?

526
00:33:18,861 --> 00:33:19,963
这里不错 停车
This is good. Stop here.

527
00:33:26,135 --> 00:33:29,405
好了 韦恩 到你了 快去杀些什么
Okay, Wayne. It's your turn. Go kill something.

528
00:33:29,472 --> 00:33:30,606
丹尼索维奇 看好了哦
Denisovich, watch this.

529
00:33:30,673 --> 00:33:31,908
什么
What?

530
00:33:31,975 --> 00:33:33,276
我告诉过你了 快去
I told you, come on.

531
00:33:33,343 --> 00:33:35,211
如果我们不激励他
If we don't inspire Denisovich,

532
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:37,246
他怎么能找到他内心的怪物本质呢
how's he going to find his inner monster?

533
00:33:37,313 --> 00:33:38,648
谁有怪物本质
Who's in a monster?

534
00:33:38,715 --> 00:33:40,216
没有 只是
Nobody, just...

535
00:33:40,283 --> 00:33:41,283
给 吃个牛油果吧
Here, have an avocado.

536
00:33:41,317 --> 00:33:42,552
耶
Yay!

537
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:44,620
你妈妈说这个的脂肪很好
Your mommy says it's a good fat.

538
00:33:44,687 --> 00:33:46,756
谁知道那是什么意思
Whatever the heaven that means.

539
00:33:46,823 --> 00:33:48,791
听着 我不会再变成怪物
Listen, I'm not gonna set monsters back again

540
00:33:48,858 --> 00:33:51,361
就为了让你的孙子变成吸血鬼那样
just to make your grandkid like vampires.

541
00:33:51,427 --> 00:33:53,547
无论如何 这里不会有人被杀 一切都
Anyway, there's nothing to kill here. It's all been...

542
00:33:58,234 --> 00:33:59,402
多么可爱啊
What a cutie.

543
00:34:00,236 --> 00:34:01,604
但是杀了他
But kill him.

544
00:34:01,671 --> 00:34:05,274
很好 你知道我好多年没干这种事了
Oh, great. You know I haven't done this in years.

545
00:34:05,341 --> 00:34:08,244
我们不需要再杀人了 我们有馅饼吃
We don't need to kill anymore. We have Pop-Tarts.

546
00:34:08,311 --> 00:34:10,713
你会喜欢的 丹尼索维奇
Denisovich, you're going to love this.

547
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,683
韦恩要吃下那整只鹿 然后下一只就是你的
Wayne's going to eat that whole deer, and the next one's yours.

548
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:14,851
韦恩 上
Wayne, go.

549
00:34:19,522 --> 00:34:21,824
哦 拜托 我已经老到猎不动鹿了
Oh, man. I'm too old for this.

550
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:24,193
好吧 该怎么做来着
Okay, how's it go again?

551
00:34:25,561 --> 00:34:27,063
不 不 等等 这是月圆的时候该干的
No, no, wait. That's for the moon.

552
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,297
哦 我咆哮 对 开始了
Oh, I growl. Right, here goes.

553
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:32,768
咆哮
Growl!

554
00:34:32,835 --> 00:34:33,835
接住这个飞盘 伙计
Get it, boy.

555
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:40,976
接住它 韦恩叔叔
Get it, Uncle Wayne.

556
00:34:43,413 --> 00:34:47,315
某狼人 你真的咆哮了吗
Some werewolf. Did you actually say the word "Growl?"

557
00:34:47,382 --> 00:34:48,784
你这个没用鬼
You're a werewussy.

558
00:34:48,851 --> 00:34:50,186
我就说我已经生锈了
I said I was rusty.

559
00:34:51,888 --> 00:34:53,523
把飞盘给我
Gimme me that Frisbee.

560
00:34:53,589 --> 00:34:55,024
不要 这是我的飞盘 我抢来的
No! It's my Frisbee! I fetched it!

561
00:34:55,091 --> 00:34:56,692
给我 给我
Give it to me! Give it back!

562
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:59,228
拿来 给我 快给我
Give it over here! Give me that! Give it back!

563
00:35:04,901 --> 00:35:06,502
他没事的 他是软波比呢
He's fine. He's Blobby.

564
00:35:09,272 --> 00:35:12,175
这个地方是如此的美丽动人
This place is so amazing and scenic.

565
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:13,409
你想先给我看什么
What do you wanna show me first?

566
00:35:13,476 --> 00:35:14,777
嗯 我不知道
Mmm. I don't know.

567
00:35:14,844 --> 00:35:16,279
这很漂亮 但天黑之后
It's pretty, but there's really

568
00:35:16,345 --> 00:35:17,747
真的没什么可做的
nothing to do once it gets dark.

569
00:35:17,814 --> 00:35:19,215
等等 那是什么地方
Wait. What's that place?

570
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:25,922
你是说 我可以在这些
So, you're telling me that I can pick

571
00:35:25,988 --> 00:35:27,668
各种口味的薯片里面随便挑吗
between all these different kinds of chips?

572
00:35:28,391 --> 00:35:29,559
是的
Yes.

573
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:31,394
大家要怎么选啊
How do people decide?

574
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:36,232
那个美丽的红宝石喷泉是什么
Now what's that beautiful fountain of rubies?

575
00:35:37,433 --> 00:35:39,402
强尼 你喝过这种思冰乐吗
Johnny, have you tried this Slurpee?

576
00:35:39,469 --> 00:35:41,471
别喝那么急 亲爱的
Not that quickly, hon.

577
00:35:41,537 --> 00:35:44,874
它有四十八种口味 我们全都得尝尝
It comes in 48 flavors. We have to try them all.

578
00:35:48,144 --> 00:35:49,879
呃 我不知道我们有没有时间
Uh, I don't know if we have time.

579
00:35:49,946 --> 00:35:52,648
为什么 这个地方不是一整夜都开着的 对吧 先生
Why? This place is open all night. Right, sir?

580
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:53,715
是的
Yes.

581
00:35:58,321 --> 00:35:59,655
强尼 看
Johnny, look.

582
00:35:59,722 --> 00:36:02,859
他们正在拍这个地方的电视节目 我们就是明星
They're making a TV show about this place and we're the stars.

583
00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:04,227
全世界好啊
Hello, world.

584
00:36:04,293 --> 00:36:05,695

It's totally awesome. You're so lucky, Kal.

586
00:36:10,433 --> 00:36:11,968
全世界好啊
Hello, world.

587
00:36:15,505 --> 00:36:17,373
好吧 墨瑞 该你了
Okay, Murray. Your turn.

588
00:36:18,808 --> 00:36:22,278
不好意思 你知道这附近哪里有卖吃的吗[直译是 能被咬一口]
Excuse us. Do you know where someone can get a bite around here?

589
00:36:22,345 --> 00:36:25,548
你真的在问一只吸血鬼什么地方能让人被咬一口吗
Did you seriously just ask a vampire where to get a bite?

590
00:36:25,615 --> 00:36:28,084
哦 天哪 我不是这个意思 我们不是这附近的人
Oh, gosh. I didn't mean... We're not from around here.

591
00:36:28,151 --> 00:36:30,553
真的太尴尬了 开车啦
This is so embarrassing. Just keep going.

592
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,555
不好意思打扰你 超爱你的巧克力麦片哦
Sorry to bother you. Love your chocolate cereal.

593
00:36:36,092 --> 00:36:37,994
你想让我做什么
So, what do you want me to do now?

594
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,762
丹尼索沃奇 你不会相信的
Denisovich, you won't believe it.

595
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:42,098
木乃伊能穿墙而过
The mummy can crash through walls

596
00:36:42,165 --> 00:36:44,100
也可以变成一群甲壳虫
and turn into a swarm of beetles

597
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:46,435
还能对所有人施咒
and put a curse on anyone.

598
00:36:46,502 --> 00:36:47,937
听起来好恶劣啊
That sounds mean.

599
00:36:48,004 --> 00:36:49,539
但恶劣得很有趣 好的
It's fun mean. Okay.

600
00:36:49,605 --> 00:36:51,207
快看看
So, check it out.

601
00:36:51,274 --> 00:36:52,966
墨瑞要召唤
Murray's going to conjure

602
00:36:52,967 --> 00:36:55,811
一场你从未见过的超级大沙尘暴
up the biggest sandstorm you've ever seen.

603
00:36:55,878 --> 00:36:57,547
开始
Hit it!

604
00:36:57,613 --> 00:36:59,282
沙尘暴 好久没召唤过了
Sandstorm? It's been awhile.

605
00:36:59,348 --> 00:37:01,317
那我不管 快点 念你的小咒语
Not my problem. Do it. Say your little spell.

606
00:37:01,384 --> 00:37:04,086
好吧
Okay.

607
00:37:04,153 --> 00:37:07,890

I got this. Frank, Wayne, Griffin, just try not to faint.

608
00:37:29,979 --> 00:37:31,214
我的背
My back.

609
00:37:40,323 --> 00:37:41,591
噢 等等
Oh. Wait.

610
00:37:47,997 --> 00:37:49,599
多可爱啊
How cute!

611
00:37:56,572 --> 00:37:59,942
等一等 在游乐场那里停 看看那些可爱的孩子
Wait. Stop at that playground. Look at these cute kids.

612
00:38:06,649 --> 00:38:09,552
天呐 这看起来太酷爆了
Holy rabies! This looks like a blast.

613
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:10,987
我不知道 梅维
I don't know, Mavey.

614
00:38:11,053 --> 00:38:13,889
如果你不知道自己在干什么的话 这可能会很危险
This can be pretty dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.

615
00:38:13,956 --> 00:38:15,625
当然 我当然会骑了
Of course, I rock these bikes.

616
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:17,059
我能试试吗 小家伙
May I, little dude?

617
00:38:17,893 --> 00:38:20,496
小心 噢耶
Check it out. Oh, yeah.

618
00:38:20,563 --> 00:38:22,565
我每个夏天都这么骑着玩的
This is how I rolled every summer.

619
00:38:37,046 --> 00:38:38,447
我想我把车子弄坏了
I think I scratched it.

620
00:38:39,582 --> 00:38:41,183
轮到我
My turn.

621
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:44,186
梅维斯 我告诉你 我花了好几年才练成这样
Mavey, I told you, it took me years to get this good.

622
00:38:44,253 --> 00:38:46,222
既然如此 我试试吧
Well, I'll give it a try.

623
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:28,064
瞧见没有 这是我的女朋友 手下败将们
You feel me now? That's my girlfriend, suckers.

624

你的老婆 强尼
Your wife, Johnny.

625
00:39:29,532 --> 00:39:31,233
我老婆 更厉害了
My wife. Even better.

626
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,937
这太棒了 你这技术是在哪里学的
That was sick, lady. Where did you learn how to do that stuff?

627
00:39:35,004 --> 00:39:36,372
特兰西瓦尼亚
Transylvania.

628
00:39:36,439 --> 00:39:39,709
太酷了 我有一个来自宾夕法尼亚的表姐
That's cool. I have a cousin from Pennsylvania.

629
00:39:39,775 --> 00:39:43,479
噢 这些小家伙们太可爱了 丹尼斯会喜欢他们的
Oh. These little guys are so sweet. Dennis would love them.

630
00:39:43,546 --> 00:39:45,247
这真是个抚养孩子的好地方
What an awesome place to raise a kid.

631
00:39:45,314 --> 00:39:47,183
噢 抚养一个孩子
Oh. To raise a kid?

632
00:39:47,249 --> 00:39:49,118
我不知道好在哪里了
I don't know about awesome.

633
00:39:49,185 --> 00:39:52,254
可能是好极了 明白吗
Maybe tubular. Capisce?

634
00:39:52,321 --> 00:39:53,956
总之 我们该去我父母家了
Anyways, we should hit my folks' place.

635
00:39:54,023 --> 00:39:54,890
我说这时候我们应该到那里了
I said we'd be there by now.

636
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:56,325
当然
Sure.

637
00:39:56,392 --> 00:39:58,527
噢 嗨 现在特兰西瓦尼亚已经过了三点了
Oh, hey, it's after 3:00 o'clock in Transylvania.

638
00:39:58,594 --> 00:40:00,496
我要检查一下丹尼斯的情况，好吗
I'm gonna check on Dennis, okay?

639
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:08,304
巧克力麦片 你在开玩笑吗
Chocolate cereal. Are you kidding me?

640
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:10,506
别紧张 德古拉 那是因为他们喜欢我们
It's okay, Drac. It's 'cause they love us.

641
00:40:10,573 --> 00:40:13,008
好吧 怪物就是这样的
Yeah. Monsters are what's goin' on.

642
00:40:13,075 --> 00:40:15,177
好吧 你应该就像我一样敞开胸怀接受
Oh, yeah. You should embrace it like I did.

643
00:40:15,244 --> 00:40:17,213
我都发行一张畅销的锻炼视频了
I've got a best-selling workout video.

644
00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:19,915

657
00:40:55,317 --> 00:40:56,585
爸爸 怎么这么久才接电话
Dad, what took so long?

658
00:40:56,652 --> 00:40:57,953

Nothing, Mavey. We're all great here at the hotel.

就在忙旅馆的事情
Just doing hotel things.

661
00:41:03,459 --> 00:41:04,760
抱歉，你不能控制一下你的呼吸吗
Sorry, can't handle your breath.

Hey, little dude.

674
00:41:27,249 --> 00:41:28,818
他为什么戴着墨镜
Why is he wearing sunglasses?

675
00:41:28,884 --> 00:41:30,953
我们正在玩游戏
Oh, we were playing.

676
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,789
超级英雄的游戏
It's a superhero thing.

677
00:41:33,856 --> 00:41:37,293
因为 我是墨镜侠 我要拯救世界
Cebause, I'm Sunglasses Man, to the rescue!

678
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:38,961
好吧 把他放下来吧 我正飞呢
Okay, take it down a notch. I'm flying.

679
00:41:39,028 --> 00:41:41,564
你声音有些奇怪
You sound funny.

680
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:44,700
噢不不 那就是他墨镜侠版的声音
Oh, no, no, that's his Sunglasses Man voice.

681
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:47,503
有静电干扰 信号很差 梅维斯 你听得到吗
Static. The signal is bad. Mavis, are you there?

682
00:41:49,004 --> 00:41:50,004
对 我还
Yeah, I'm still...

683
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,876
好吧 我想他玩的很开心
All right. I guess he's having fun.

684
00:41:53,943 --> 00:41:55,644
他当然开心了
Of course he is.

685
00:41:57,646 --> 00:42:00,015
哇 我用墨镜侠解决了问题
Wow, I nailed it with the Sunglasses Man.

686
00:42:00,082 --> 00:42:01,684
就在我的头顶
Right off the top of my head.

687
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,719
我仍出了[因喂]这个词 大家都瞧见了吗
I threw in a "Cebause." Did everyone see that?

688
00:42:03,786 --> 00:42:06,555
她说她很开心 强尼把任务搞砸了
She said she was having fun. Johnny's blowing it.

689
00:42:06,622 --> 00:42:09,859
她骑了自行车和逛了小商场 她要搬走了
She's biking and mini-marting. She's gonna wanna move!

690
00:42:09,925 --> 00:42:12,761
我要好好矫正这个孩子 我们要到了没有
I gotta fix this kid now. Are we almost there or what?

691
00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:14,730
好吧 我可能
Okay, I may

692
00:42:14,797 --> 00:42:16,398
在几英里之前 拐错了弯
have taken a wrong turn a few miles back.

693
00:42:16,465 --> 00:42:18,267
别生气 什么
Don't get mad. What?

694
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:22,538
来人把这个导航器开一下
Someone turn on the navigator on this thing.

695
00:42:22,605 --> 00:42:24,573
看看我触碰得多轻
Look how light I touch it.

696
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,576
请输入你的目的地
Please enter your destination.

697
00:42:27,643 --> 00:42:31,280
拜托 我求你了
Please. I am begging you.

698
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:36,418
会没事的 丹尼索维奇
Yeah, this is gonna be good, Denisovich.

699
00:42:36,485 --> 00:42:39,355
那可怕的本质 就在你的血液之中 好吗
Scary stuff, okay? It's in you.

700
00:42:39,421 --> 00:42:42,191
我们只需要集中精力吓人就好了
We just gotta concentrate on the scary.

701
00:42:42,258 --> 00:42:45,027
德古拉外公 你会想念外婆吗
Papa Drac? Do you miss Grandma?

702
00:42:45,094 --> 00:42:47,863
想念外婆 当然 我会啊
Miss Grandma? Oh. Sure, I do.

703
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:52,201
我每天都想念她 她是我的爱
I miss her every day. She was my zing.

704
00:42:53,135 --> 00:42:54,603
你为什么要问这个
Why do you ask?

705
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,071
我不知道
I don't know.

706
00:42:56,138 --> 00:42:58,107

还有谁呢 你想念温妮吗
And who else? You miss that Winnie?

709
00:43:03,178 --> 00:43:06,282
那个扑倒你 一直想要舔你的小家伙
The pup who tackles you and tries to lick you all the time?

710
00:43:06,348 --> 00:43:08,584
想啊 但是我们只是朋友
Yeah, but we're just friends.

711
00:43:08,651 --> 00:43:11,453
哦 不 不 不 你是德古拉家的人
Oh, no, no, no. You're a Dracula.

712
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,324
你不会只和温妮那样可爱 毛茸茸的小家伙做朋友的
You can't just be friends with a cute, hairy number like Winnie.

713
00:43:15,391 --> 00:43:20,996
-立刻右转 -这里转 你个笨蛋

716
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:29,965
等着瞧 伙计们
Wait and see, fellas.

717
00:43:29,966 --> 00:43:33,242

It's the vampire summer camp I went to as a kid.

721
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:43,452
叫什么名字 吸血营吗
What's it, Camp Vamp?

722
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:45,588
不是 谁会把自己的夏令营命名为 吸血营
No. Who names their camp "Camp Vamp?"

723
00:43:45,654 --> 00:43:47,823
这是维尼帕卡卡夏令营
It's Camp Winnepacaca.

724
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:10,112
你看看 丹尼索维奇

00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:14,249
我就在这里学会捕捉老鼠和变身的
This is where I learned to catch mice and shapeshift.

726
00:44:14,316 --> 00:44:17,987
并用学会使用我难以置信的力量和勇气 很酷吧
And use my incredible powers and strength. It's pretty cool. Huh?

727
00:44:18,053 --> 00:44:19,053
羽毛球
Badminton.

728
00:44:23,592 --> 00:44:26,895
是啊 我不记得有这个羽毛球

I'm Dana, the director.

731
00:44:31,867 --> 00:44:34,336
我们非常高兴你们这些传奇人物来访
We're sure excited to have you legends visitin' us.

732
00:44:34,403 --> 00:44:36,372
我能为你做什么
What can I do you for?

733
00:44:36,438 --> 00:44:38,232
我非常感兴趣
Well, I'm very interested

734
00:44:38,233 --> 00:44:41,176
送我的孙子 丹尼索维奇 来这里
in sending my grandboy, Denisovich, here.

735
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:45,714
哦 就是这个一头红发 没有尖牙的小家伙吗
Oh. This little redheaded, non-fangy little guy?

736
00:44:45,781 --> 00:44:47,969
哦 尖牙还没有长出来而已 他晚长牙
Oh, they're in there. He's a late fanger.

737
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:49,251
这也是我们来到这里的原因
That's why we came here.

738
00:44:49,318 --> 00:44:51,453
你能给我们展示一些实操演练吗
Can you show us some of the drills,

739
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,589
比如像他们抓老鼠的地方
like where they catch the mice?

740
00:44:53,656 --> 00:44:56,625
可以 当然现在我们叫它通鼠窜
Can do. A-course now we call it Tee-Mousing.

741
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:10,139
所以他们不必去抓老鼠了吗
So they don't have to catch the mice?

742
00:45:10,205 --> 00:45:13,676
不用 我们发现这个办法可以很好地建立他们的信心
Nope. We find this is a good way to build their confidence.

743
00:45:15,477 --> 00:45:16,545
快来这里
Come here.

Yeah. We're over here, now.

749
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:43,672
保险起见 不得不减低规模
Had to scale it down. Insurance.

750
00:45:47,409 --> 00:45:49,678
救我 救我 救我
Help me. Help me. Help me.

Wow! I can't believe I'm actually here.

757
00:46:11,233 --> 00:46:12,534
你已经在这里了
Well, you are.

758
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:15,904

但是这雨披 如果你想要安全
But otherwise this poncho, if you wanna be safe.

764
00:46:24,646 --> 00:46:26,415
这事我们可以稍后处理 琳达
We can deal with it later, Linda.

765
00:46:26,482 --> 00:46:27,416
好吧

我装饰了你的卧室
I've set up your bedroom.

768
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:39,128
这就像特兰西瓦尼亚一样
It's just like Transylvania.

769
00:46:39,194 --> 00:46:42,664
噢 特兰西瓦尼亚 那是一次有趣的经历
Oh, Transylvania. That was a fun experience.

770
00:46:42,731 --> 00:46:44,800

Mike was afraid he'd get disemboweled and eaten,

771
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:46,802
但是我告诉他 他真傻
but I told him he was just being silly.

772
00:46:46,869 --> 00:46:48,509
那是你 琳达
That was you, Linda.

773

774
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:53,609
这小区有一个人类和怪物组合的家庭
You know, we have a couple of mixed families in the neighborhood,

775
00:46:53,675 --> 00:46:55,577
所以我想着请他们过来
so I thought I'd invite them over.

776
00:46:55,644 --> 00:46:57,679
既然你们想要搬来这里
They might be nice for you guys to talk to

777
00:46:57,746 --> 00:46:59,481
那跟他们聊一聊可能有好处

人们对于我们选择的生活方式完全没有异议
People are totally cool with our lifestyle choice.

782
00:47:13,195 --> 00:47:14,496
我是说 孩子们有时会被欺负
I mean, the kids get picked on a little,

783
00:47:14,563 --> 00:47:16,765
但是这会让他们更加强大
but it toughens them up.

784
00:47:16,832 --> 00:47:18,632
噢 嗨 你们好 这是洛瑞塔

Who's ready to fly?

807
00:48:40,015 --> 00:48:42,217
我 我 像个超级英雄一样地飞
Me! Me! Like a superhero.

808
00:48:42,284 --> 00:48:44,086
要更好的 要像个吸血鬼一样
Better! Like a vampire!

809
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:46,922
这塔摇摇欲坠
This thing is rickety.

810
00:48:46,989 --> 00:48:49,291
你知道吗 也许这孩子不该飞
You know what? Maybe the kid isn't supposed to fly.

811
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:50,800
给我闭嘴 这就是他们学习的过程
Quiet. This is how they learn.

812
00:48:50,801 --> 00:48:52,628
你把他们扔出去然后他们自己就学会了
You throw them and they figure it out.

813
00:48:53,595 --> 00:48:55,163
我就是这么学会的
It's how I was taught.

814
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:56,598
我现在就要飞
I wanna fly now!

815
00:48:56,665 --> 00:49:00,002
小乖蝙蝠 如果你需要外公的话 外公就在这儿保护你
Attabat. You know Papa's right here if you need him.

816
00:49:00,068 --> 00:49:01,503
呃 无法直视
Uh. I can't watch this.

817
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,071
别这样
Please don't.

818
00:49:03,138 --> 00:49:05,607
我们飞啦
Here we go!

819
00:49:11,947 --> 00:49:13,215
他还是没飞
He's still not flying.

820
00:49:13,282 --> 00:49:14,283
他会的
He will.

821
00:49:15,617 --> 00:49:17,085
还没有
Still not.

822
00:49:17,152 --> 00:49:18,152
马上就会了
It'll happen.

823
00:49:19,321 --> 00:49:20,689
这塔真的好高
This is a tall tower.

824
00:49:20,756 --> 00:49:22,224
这样才好
That's why it's good.

825
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:23,558
你应该去接他
You should get him.

826
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:24,693
他会摔得粉身碎骨的
He's gonna fall to his death.

827
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,628
他在慢慢学习中
He's taking his time.

828
00:49:28,096 --> 00:49:29,598
德古拉
Drac!

829
00:49:29,665 --> 00:49:31,566
我第一次也是如此
I did that my first time.

830
00:49:31,633 --> 00:49:33,235
他离地太近了
He's getting too close to the ground!

831
00:49:34,636 --> 00:49:36,038
你知道吗 也许他不会飞了
You know what? He's not gonna fly.

832
00:49:46,682 --> 00:49:49,685
我说过了 外公会一直在这儿保护你
I told you. Papa's always here for you.

833
00:49:49,751 --> 00:49:52,020
再来 再来
Again! Again!

834
00:49:52,087 --> 00:49:54,756
噢亲爱的 哦 恶魔 我们必须报告这事
Oh, dear. Oh, my devil. We're gonna have to report this.

835
00:49:54,823 --> 00:49:56,391
你是说上报纸吗
You mean to the papers?

836
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:59,828
我觉得那会很酷 但是我还不想登报
I guess it was pretty cool, but I'm not about getting press.

837
00:49:59,895 --> 00:50:02,364
不 先生 我是指报给当地政府
No, sir. I mean the authorities.

838
00:50:02,431 --> 00:50:04,866
我必须上报 置儿童于危险罪
I can't not report child endangerment.

839
00:50:04,933 --> 00:50:07,703
喔 听我说 那很有好玩
Whoa! Listen to me. That was fun.

840
00:50:07,769 --> 00:50:10,138
你的歌才是置儿童于危险之中
Your singing is child endangerment.

841
00:50:10,205 --> 00:50:12,207
我们应该下去帮他吗
Should we go down and help him?

842
00:50:12,274 --> 00:50:15,110
绝不 我告诉过他这有多疯狂 他自作自受
Nope. I told him this was nuts. He's on his own.

843
00:50:15,177 --> 00:50:16,678
我们应该给这男孩的妈妈打电话
We have to call the boy's mother.

844
00:50:16,745 --> 00:50:18,280
不 不会打的
No, that ain't happening.

845
00:50:18,347 --> 00:50:20,916
他妈妈已经是个精神错乱的颠颠了
His mother's already nutsy koo koo!

846
00:50:20,983 --> 00:50:23,585
我必须按章办事
I have to follow protocol.

847
00:50:23,652 --> 00:50:27,222
你不会按章办事的
You will not follow protocol.

848
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:29,224
我是一个吸血鬼 我不会被催眠的
I'm a vampire. I can't be hypnotized.

849
00:50:30,025 --> 00:50:31,226
对哦
Right.

850
00:50:31,293 --> 00:50:33,795
现在 请你合作 别逼我报警
Now, please. Don't make me call the police.

851
00:50:33,862 --> 00:50:35,664
没人会报告任何人
No one's calling nobody!

852
00:50:38,633 --> 00:50:40,202
着火了
Fire!

853
00:50:40,268 --> 00:50:43,071
停住 倒地然后翻滚 停住 倒地然后翻滚
Stop, drop and roll. Stop, drop and roll.

854
00:50:43,138 --> 00:50:44,473
尖叫没有用
Screaming's not helping!

855
00:50:44,539 --> 00:50:45,539
呀
Yay!

856
00:50:53,148 --> 00:50:54,950
我们是坏人吗 德古拉外公
Are we bad guys, Papa Drac?

857
00:50:55,584 --> 00:50:56,584
坏人
Bad?

858
00:50:58,387 --> 00:51:01,156
不 你是世上最好的孩子
No. You're the best kid in the world.

859
00:51:01,223 --> 00:51:04,559
不是我们点火的 是塔楼的问题
We didn't start the fire. It was the tower.

860
00:51:04,626 --> 00:51:06,350
那是个非常危险的塔楼
That's a very unsafe tower.

861
00:51:06,351 --> 00:51:09,097
你应该庆幸我们没有报警
You're lucky we don't call the authorities.

862
00:51:09,164 --> 00:51:10,966
走吧 我的英雄
Let's go, my hero.

863
00:51:11,033 --> 00:51:13,769
因为我是蝙蝠侠 快上我的蝙蝠战车
Cebause I'm Batman! To the Batmobile!

864
00:51:13,835 --> 00:51:15,337
是 快上
Yes. To the...

865
00:51:26,815 --> 00:51:29,451
我很抱歉发生了那一切 我猜他们还以为你会喜欢
Sorry about all that stuff. I guess they thought you'd like it.

866
00:51:29,518 --> 00:51:31,620
为什么我在这里如此怪异
Why do I feel so weird here?

867
00:51:31,686 --> 00:51:33,822
不 宝贝 他们才是奇怪的人
No, hon. They're being weird.

868
00:51:33,889 --> 00:51:36,291
我想他们只是想帮我
I think they're just trying to help me.

869
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:39,828
我是说 我从小在那旅馆长大 对外界一无所知
I mean, I grew up knowing nothing living inside that hotel.

870
00:51:39,895 --> 00:51:42,831
而你在圣诞老人这里长大 无所不知
And you learned about everything growing up in Santa Claus.

871
00:51:42,898 --> 00:51:45,367
是圣克鲁兹 但是 呃
Santa Cruz. But, uh...

872
00:51:45,434 --> 00:51:48,203
如果让丹尼斯在精灵旅社外面长大
Maybe if Dennis grows up away from Transylvania,

873
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:52,240
他就不会那么怪异 不会像我一样
he won't be so freaky. Like me.

874
00:51:52,307 --> 00:51:55,777
你疯了吗 梅维斯 你很棒的
Are you nuts? Mavis, you're a blast.

875
00:51:55,844 --> 00:51:58,680
你那么地充满活力 对所有事都感到好奇
You're so full of life and curious about everything.

876
00:51:58,747 --> 00:52:00,982
如果丹尼斯能长成像你一样
If Dennis grows up to be just like you,

877
00:52:01,049 --> 00:52:03,151
我将是世界上最幸运的爸爸
I'll be the luckiest dad in the world.

878
00:52:03,218 --> 00:52:06,288
我爱你 强尼斯顿
I love you, Johnnystein.

879
00:52:06,354 --> 00:52:07,689
你知道吗
You know what?

880
00:52:07,756 --> 00:52:10,659
只要我们相伴永久 在哪儿都会快乐的
As long as we're all together, we'll be happy anywhere.

881
00:52:10,726 --> 00:52:12,194
即使在精灵旅社
Even at the hotel.

882
00:52:13,361 --> 00:52:14,963
是的
Yes!

883
00:52:17,432 --> 00:52:18,767
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

884
00:52:18,834 --> 00:52:21,303
看看我朋友发给我的这个视频
Check out this video my friend sent me.

885
00:52:21,369 --> 00:52:23,371
这孩子是个超赞的不怕死星人
This kid is an awesome daredevil.

886
00:52:25,674 --> 00:52:26,575
哦 老兄
Oh, dude!

887
00:52:26,641 --> 00:52:27,709
你看到了吗
Did you get it?

888
00:52:27,776 --> 00:52:29,010
等等 那是丹尼斯吗
Wait! Is that Dennis?

889
00:52:29,077 --> 00:52:33,782
不 是吗 不 很难看清楚 但是
- No! Is it? No. It's just hard to see. - But...

890
00:52:33,849 --> 00:52:36,351
哦 刚删了它 所以 没有了
Oops. Just deleted it. So, it's gone.

891
00:52:46,928 --> 00:52:48,997
什么 是梅维斯 我不会接的
What? It's Mavis. I'm not answering it.

892
00:52:51,032 --> 00:52:53,001
快接 德古拉 你一定得接
Come on, Drac. You have to.

893
00:52:55,604 --> 00:52:57,272
好吧
All right!

894
00:52:57,339 --> 00:52:58,840
你好 甜心
Yes, honeybunch.

895
00:52:58,907 --> 00:53:00,509
爸 你在哪里
Dad? Where are you?

896
00:53:00,575 --> 00:53:04,546
呃 我们在旅社外面露天烧烤呢
Um... We're outside the hotel having a little cookout.

897
00:53:04,613 --> 00:53:06,248
百分百安全
It's perfectly safe.

898
00:53:06,314 --> 00:53:07,849
那是什么声音 警笛吗
What's that noise? Is that a siren?

899
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:11,086
哦 那只是一些爱啼哭的妖怪来住店了
Oh, those are just some wailing banshees checking in.

900
00:53:11,153 --> 00:53:12,954
安静点 你们这些妖怪
Quiet, you banshees.

901
00:53:13,021 --> 00:53:15,757
我们正举办一个百分百安全的篝火晚会
We're trying to have a perfectly safe cookout over here.

902
00:53:15,824 --> 00:53:19,427
妈妈 我要打招呼 妈妈 妈妈
Mommy! I wanna say hi! Mommy! Mommy!

903
00:53:19,494 --> 00:53:20,929
德古拉爷爷刚刚正教我怎么飞
Papa Drac just tried to teach me how to fly.

904
00:53:20,996 --> 00:53:22,430
等等 那是他妈妈吗
Wait a minute. Is that the mother?

905
00:53:22,497 --> 00:53:23,932
哦 不好 又卡住了
Oh, no. Static again.

906
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,135
我现在就回旅社
I am coming back to the hotel right now.

907
00:53:27,202 --> 00:53:29,345
你最好给我在那里不然我发誓
And you better be there or I swear,

908
00:53:29,346 --> 00:53:31,306
爸爸 你会非常抱歉的
Dad, you're gonna be very sorry.

909
00:53:32,107 --> 00:53:34,075
怎么了
What's goin' on?

910
00:53:34,142 --> 00:53:35,377
我们必须马上回家
We need to get home right away.

911
00:53:37,846 --> 00:53:40,482
好的 我去拿一下我的背包
Okay. I'll go wake up my backpack.

912
00:53:40,549 --> 00:53:42,083
伙计们 我们得走了
Guys, we gotta move.

913
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:44,519
我们没有车 怎么离开这儿
We got no car! How we gonna get out of here?

914
00:53:44,586 --> 00:53:46,087
别担心 我打过电话了
Don't worry. I made a call.

915
00:53:55,597 --> 00:53:58,567
对不起 兄弟 我们本打算早点打给你的
I'm sorry, Blobby. We really meant to call you sooner.

916
00:54:05,106 --> 00:54:06,341
快开
Hit it!

917
00:54:21,656 --> 00:54:22,757
去特兰西瓦尼亚
Transylvania.

918
00:54:22,824 --> 00:54:24,159
你想去哪里
You want to go where?

919
00:54:24,226 --> 00:54:25,594
特兰西瓦尼亚 越快越好
Transylvania. As soon as possible.

920
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,662
没有直达特兰西瓦尼亚的飞机
We don't fly direct to Transylvania.

921
00:54:27,729 --> 00:54:29,097
没有吗
You don't?

922
00:54:29,164 --> 00:54:31,366
你可以先去布加勒斯特 但你必须
You can go to Bucharest, but you'll have to

923
00:54:31,433 --> 00:54:33,268
在芝加哥转机 然后到苏黎世
switch planes in Chicago and then Zurich.

924
00:54:33,335 --> 00:54:35,003
那么 什么时候会到
So, when would we get there?

925
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:38,073
芝加哥的航班因天气问题延误了
Well, the Chicago flight's delayed due to bad weather.

926
00:54:43,645 --> 00:54:45,247
所以 两张经济舱票吗
So, two seats in coach?

927
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,680
不要
No!

928
00:54:47,215 --> 00:54:48,650
-不会吧 -是的
- No! - Yes.

929
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:11,740
你非要现在去吗 在我们终于没有堵车的时候
You have to go now? When we finally have no traffic.

930
00:55:11,806 --> 00:55:13,408
你要杀死我吗 兄弟
You're killing me, Blobby.

931
00:55:23,418 --> 00:55:26,421
我头上还有点云 要自拍一下
I still have some cloud on me. Gotta do a selfie!

932
00:55:26,488 --> 00:55:27,989
强尼 现在不行
Johnny! Not now!

933
00:55:28,056 --> 00:55:29,291
好吧 待会再说
Okay. Maybe later.

934
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:38,099
这踏板车快没油了 我们到不了了
This scooter thing's out of juice. We're never gonna make it.

935
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:39,601
弗兰克 吹气
Frank, blow.

936
00:55:49,044 --> 00:55:50,145
就是现在
Now!

937
00:56:13,034 --> 00:56:16,237
多有意思呀 你笑什么呢 你喜欢吗
How fun is this? Why are you laughing? You like that?

938
00:56:16,304 --> 00:56:17,572
看这个
Watch this.

939
00:56:19,374 --> 00:56:20,814
麻利麻利麻利哄
Coochie-coochie-coochie-coo!

940
00:56:29,451 --> 00:56:31,252
这就是飞翔 丹尼索维奇
Now this is flying, Denisovich.

941
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:33,455
像一个吸血鬼一样
Like a vampire.

942
00:56:34,923 --> 00:56:35,923
哇
Wee!

943
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:39,828
这才是我的乖孩子 看你飞得多好
That's my boy. Look at you go.

944
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:52,240
你是穿披风里面最帅的人 德拉克外公
You're the coolest guy who wears a cape, Papa Drac.

945
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:05,619

So, hey, when are you going to get here already?

947
00:57:23,705 --> 00:57:25,306
我们已经等了
We've been waiting...

948
00:57:27,342 --> 00:57:29,477
把儿子给我
Give me my son.

949
00:57:29,544 --> 00:57:31,913
我们只是去吃了些牛油果
We just went out for some avocados.

950
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,448
妈妈 我飞了
Mommy! I flew!

951
00:57:33,515 --> 00:57:35,150
我看到了

952
00:57:35,216 --> 00:57:37,152
#妈妈是一个精神错乱的颠颠#
# Mother's already nutsy koo koo #

953
00:57:37,218 --> 00:57:39,788
#精神错乱的颠颠#
# Nutsy koo koo #

954
00:57:39,854 --> 00:57:41,614
#颠颠 噢 亲爱的 噢 亲爱的#
- # Koo koo # - COUNSELOR: Oh, dear. Oh, dear

955
00:57:41,656 --> 00:57:43,358
#噢 我的小恶魔 我必须按章办事#
# Oh, my devil I have to follow protocol #

956
00:57:43,425 --> 00:57:45,185
#不会发生的 不会发生的#
# That ain't happening That ain't happening #

957
00:57:45,226 --> 00:57:46,628
#妈妈已经#
# Mother's already #

958
00:57:46,694 --> 00:57:47,694
#颠颠#
# Koo koo #

959
00:57:48,797 --> 00:57:49,797
#颠颠#
# Koo koo #

960
00:57:57,772 --> 00:58:01,142
我本担心丹尼斯待在别的怪物身边不安全
I was worried Dennis wasn't safe around other monsters.

961
00:58:01,209 --> 00:58:04,212
现在我觉得他待在你身边也不安全
Now I don't even feel like he's safe around you.

962
00:58:04,279 --> 00:58:05,447
但我刚只是
But I was just...

963
00:58:05,513 --> 00:58:06,881
你之前说了什么
What was it you said?

964
00:58:06,948 --> 00:58:10,351
人也好 怪物也罢 独角兽都行 都没有关系
Human, monster, unicorn. That it didn't matter?

965
00:58:10,418 --> 00:58:12,554
好吧 我只是知道他的生活会
Well, I just know his life would...

966
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:15,023
星期三我们会在这里举办他的生日派对
We'll have his birthday party here on Wednesday.

967
00:58:15,089 --> 00:58:16,991
然后我们就搬走
Then we're moving.

968
00:58:17,058 --> 00:58:19,894
求你了 梅维 别走
Please, Mavey. Don't leave.

969
00:58:19,961 --> 00:58:23,097
或许你已经让人类进入你的旅馆 爸爸
Maybe you've let humans into your hotel, Dad.

970
00:58:23,164 --> 00:58:25,333
但我认为你从没让他们进入你内心
But I don't think you've let them into your heart.

971
00:59:09,944 --> 00:59:12,480
我可以的 我可以的
I can do it. I can do it.

972
00:59:13,181 --> 00:59:16,484
我是蝙蝠 我是蝙蝠
I'm a bat. I'm a bat.

973
00:59:16,551 --> 00:59:18,486
我是蝙蝠 我是蝙蝠 我是蝙蝠
I'm a bat. I'm a bat. I'm a bat!

974
00:59:18,553 --> 00:59:20,221
丹尼斯 你在干什么呢 小甜心
Dennis? What are you doing, sweetie?

975
00:59:20,288 --> 00:59:22,457
呃 没什么
Uh... Nothing.

976
00:59:22,524 --> 00:59:25,527
小心 让我抱你下来
Careful. Let me help you down from there.

977
00:59:25,593 --> 00:59:27,695
你对你的大派对感到兴奋吗
Are you getting excited about your big party?

978
00:59:27,762 --> 00:59:29,564
可能吧
I guess so.

979
00:59:29,631 --> 00:59:32,567
你猜谁会来 爸爸全家人哦
You know who's coming? Daddy's whole family.

980
00:59:32,634 --> 00:59:34,869
迈克爷爷和琳达奶奶
Grandpa Mike and Grandma Linda.

981
00:59:34,936 --> 00:59:38,673
还有所有爱你的堂兄妹和叔叔阿姨
All your cousins and aunts and uncles who love you so much.

982
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:42,744
我们搬去加州时他们会跟我们一起哦
And then they're gonna be with us when we move to California.

983
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:47,382
妈妈 我们搬走是因为我不是怪物吗
Mommy, are we going away cebause I'm not a monster?

984
00:59:47,448 --> 00:59:50,985
什么 不是的 丹尼斯 当然不是
What? No. Dennis, of course not.

985
00:59:51,052 --> 00:59:53,588
这只是成长必须经历的事情
It's just grown-up stuff.

986
00:59:53,655 --> 00:59:56,224
好吧 但是德古拉外公怎么办
Okay. But what about Papa Drac?

987
00:59:56,291 --> 00:59:58,826
他要一人住在这里了
He's gonna be here all alone.

988
00:59:58,893 --> 01:00:01,796
德古拉外公必须留下来经营旅馆
Papa Drac has to stay here to run the hotel.

989
01:00:01,863 --> 01:00:04,399
但他会来看我们 我们也会来看他
But he'll visit us. And we'll visit him.

990
01:00:04,465 --> 01:00:06,000
我们可以每晚给他打电话吗
Can we call him every night?

991
01:00:06,067 --> 01:00:07,602
当然可以
Sure.

992
01:00:13,274 --> 01:00:14,909
太好了

01:00:32,594 --> 01:00:36,264
#把所有情绪藏起#
# Keep them all inside #

999
01:00:43,371 --> 01:00:46,107
老兄 你干嘛想搬走 这地方简直不可思议
Dude, why do you wanna leave? This place is out of control.

1000
01:00:46,174 --> 01:00:47,475
我可不想走
I don't wanna leave.

1001

这里有这些超酷的僵尸怪兽
All these awesome freakazoids!

1002
01:00:49,644 --> 01:00:51,079
那么 哪个是最酷的怪物
So, who's the coolest monster?

1003
01:00:51,145 --> 01:00:52,880

1004
01:00:52,947 --> 01:00:54,349
蛋糕糕
Kakie.

1005
01:00:54,415 --> 01:00:55,695
蛋糕糕 真窝囊
Kakie. What a wussbag.

1006
01:00:56,684 --> 01:01:00,154
全家聚会是不是很美好
Isn't it nice to have the whole family together?

1007
01:01:00,221 --> 01:01:04,258
梅维斯 你家里有什么堂兄妹亲戚的吗
Mavis, do you have any cousins or thingies in your family?

1008
01:01:04,325 --> 01:01:06,461
没有 只有我和我爸
No. It's just been me and Dad.

1009
01:01:06,527 --> 01:01:09,163
我还不知道你妈妈怎么离开的
I never did ask how you lost your mom.

1010
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:11,232
哦 她被愤怒的人类杀死了
Oh. She was killed by angry humans.

1011
01:01:12,533 --> 01:01:15,370
#尴尬#
# Awkward #

1012
01:01:15,436 --> 01:01:17,705
但是我有个爷爷 弗拉德
But there is my Grandpa Vlad.

1013
01:01:17,772 --> 01:01:19,240
哦 你有个爷爷
Oh, you have a grandpa?

1014
01:01:19,307 --> 01:01:20,987
是的 他会来派对的 我邀请了他

1015
01:01:22,443 --> 01:01:24,479
你邀请了他？
You invited him?

1016
01:01:24,545 --> 01:01:26,111
爸 他从没见过丹尼斯
Dad, he's never seen Dennis.

1017
01:01:26,112 --> 01:01:28,349
我想离开前让他们见一面
I wanted them to meet once before we go.

1018
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:32,687
当然 太好了 太赞了 好老人弗拉德
Sure. Great. Peachy. Good old Vlad.

1019
01:01:32,754 --> 01:01:34,722
谁有湿纸巾吗
Anybody have a wet wipe?

1020
01:01:52,573 --> 01:01:56,878
我的天啊 他终于邀请我了
Holy rabies. He finally invites me to something.

1021
01:01:56,944 --> 01:01:58,379
他有了外孙？
He's got a grandkid?

1022
01:01:58,446 --> 01:02:00,214
而他从未对你提过
And he never told you?

1023
01:02:00,281 --> 01:02:04,619
放松点 贝拉 至少家族里多了一个吸血鬼
Easy, Bela. At least there's another vampire in the family.

1024
01:02:04,686 --> 01:02:07,255
这是在一家旅馆 奢侈奢侈
It's at a hotel? Fancy schmancy.

1025
01:02:07,321 --> 01:02:10,425
旅馆是人类的
Hotels are for humans!

1026
01:02:15,663 --> 01:02:18,299
贝拉 闭上你的血盆大口 看看你都干了什么
Bela, shut your blood hole. Look what you started.

1027
01:02:18,366 --> 01:02:20,301
别担心 大家
Don't worry, gang.

1028
01:02:20,368 --> 01:02:23,638
我教育我的儿子要憎恨 杀戮 还有偷走人类的灵魂
I raised my son to hate and kill and steal the souls of humans

1029
01:02:23,705 --> 01:02:25,773
要做我的好孩子
like a good boy.

1030
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:29,110
是的 弗拉德爷爷看到我和强尼策划的
Yes, Grandpa Vlad will be so happy

1031
01:02:29,177 --> 01:02:33,514
这个盛大的化妆舞会 会非常开心的
when he sees the big masquerade party Johnny and I have planned.

1032
01:02:33,581 --> 01:02:34,716
什么
What?

1033
01:02:38,252 --> 01:02:39,887
好好配合 那是我的爸爸
Play along. It's my dad.

1034
01:02:39,954 --> 01:02:41,723
你有爸爸？真有趣
You have a dad? That's funny.

1035
01:02:41,789 --> 01:02:44,192
听我说 不能让我爸知道你或者是
Listen to me. My dad cannot know you're a human.

1036
01:02:44,258 --> 01:02:46,461
你的家人是人类
Or any of your family.

1037
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:48,963
什么 但是 德古拉 我很自豪我们是
What? But, Drac, I'm proud that we're...

1038
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:51,799
否则他会偷走你家人的灵魂然后吃了你的背包
Or he'll steal your family's souls and eat your backpack.

1039
01:02:54,335 --> 01:02:55,903
对了 大家
That's right, gang.

1040
01:02:55,970 --> 01:02:58,906
我们要把生日宴会搞成化妆舞会
We're gonna make the birthday a monster masquerade party.

1041
01:02:59,841 --> 01:03:02,076
真的？那真有趣
Really? Oh, that's lovely.

1042
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,803
就好像在丹尼斯成为正常人
Sort of like a last hurrah

1043
01:03:03,804 --> 01:03:06,614
之前最后一次的狂欢
before Dennis gets to be with normal people.

1044
01:03:06,681 --> 01:03:08,716
没有更好的说法了
I couldn't have said it better.

1045
01:03:28,402 --> 01:03:29,759
你觉得怎么样 梅维斯
What do you think, Mavis?

1046
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,039
我想我已经喜欢上变得很怪异了
I think I'm starting to like being creepy.

1047
01:03:37,145 --> 01:03:39,680
你该庆幸我们没有报警
You're lucky we don't call the authorities.

1048
01:03:39,747 --> 01:03:41,649
走吧 我的英雄
Let's go, my hero.

1049
01:03:41,716 --> 01:03:43,217
因为我是蝙蝠侠
Cebause I'm Batman!

1050
01:03:44,418 --> 01:03:46,554
好 去我的蝙蝠战车
Yes! To the Batmobile!

1051
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,580
你的屁股被一个女孩踢了 蝙蝠侠
Got your butt kicked by a girl, Batman.

1052
01:03:56,964 --> 01:03:59,534
是 没关系 我不会哭的
Yeah. Whatever. I'm not about to cry.

1053
01:04:03,104 --> 01:04:06,407
精灵旅社
Hotel Transylvania.

1054
01:04:06,474 --> 01:04:09,944
我闻到了人类的味道
I smell humans!

1055
01:04:10,011 --> 01:04:12,980
把它砸了
Tear it down!

1056
01:04:13,047 --> 01:04:17,585
贝拉 我们在外面 你当然会闻到人类气息
Bela, we're in the outside world. You're gonna smell humans.

1057
01:04:17,652 --> 01:04:21,189
你知道吗 你就在外面等我好了 这是家庭聚会
You know what? Just wait outside for me. This is family stuff.

1058
01:04:21,255 --> 01:04:22,857
你会碍手碍脚的
You'll only get in the way.

1059
01:04:22,924 --> 01:04:24,725
我只是想看看小曾孙
I just wanna meet the little fanger.

1060
01:04:24,792 --> 01:04:26,260
他应该认识一下他伟大的吸血鬼曾祖父
He should know his great-vampa.

1061
01:04:26,327 --> 01:04:27,995
他的什么
His what?

1062
01:04:28,062 --> 01:04:31,265
吸血鬼曾祖父 得了吧 多明显的事
Vampire grandpa. Come on. That was obvious.

1063
01:04:33,835 --> 01:04:35,469
超赞的派对
Amazing party!

1064
01:04:35,536 --> 01:04:38,372
那么 你觉得如何
So, what do you think?

1065
01:04:38,439 --> 01:04:40,942
这就是你的吸血鬼打扮 你是什么 疯子吗
This is your vampire costume? What are you, nuts?

1066
01:04:41,008 --> 01:04:42,476
我上网买的
I ordered it online.

1067
01:04:42,543 --> 01:04:44,445
只有那家店可以第二天送到
It was the only place that delivered overnight.

1068
01:04:44,512 --> 01:04:46,914
你头上好像装了个狒狒的屁股
You look like you got a baboon's butt on your head.

1069
01:04:46,981 --> 01:04:48,916
你练习过说话方式吗
Have you at least practiced your voice?

1070
01:04:48,983 --> 01:04:50,985
你可不能像嬉皮士一样说话
You can't just talk like a hippie.

1071
01:04:51,052 --> 01:04:52,687
我不是嬉皮士 我是个懒鬼
I'm not a hippie. I'm a slacker.

1072
01:04:52,753 --> 01:04:55,122
像吸血鬼一样说话
Talk like a vampire.

1073
01:04:55,189 --> 01:05:00,695
吾名为强尼 我是个吸血鬼
My name is Count Jonafang. I am a vampire.

1074
01:05:00,761 --> 01:05:04,398
好吧 吸血鬼不会到处说 “我是个吸血鬼”
Okay, vampires don't go around saying, "I am a vampire."

1075
01:05:04,465 --> 01:05:08,836
对不起 吾是强尼 给我血 血 血
Sorry. I am Count Jonafang. Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1076
01:05:08,903 --> 01:05:10,304
你在逗我吗
Are you kidding me?

1077
01:05:10,371 --> 01:05:11,839
对不起 我太紧张了
I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

1078
01:05:11,906 --> 01:05:14,008
好吧 听着 如果你认为我都不会喜欢
Yeah, listen, if you think I don't like it,

1079
01:05:14,075 --> 01:05:16,010
那你绝对不要
you definitely don't want to say,

1080
01:05:16,077 --> 01:05:17,845
冲着我父亲喊 给我血 血 血
Bleh, bleh-bleh, In front of my father.

很不高兴认识你
Nauseated to meet you.

1086
01:05:28,322 --> 01:05:30,658
宴会什么时候开始 半小时后我有场图书展销会
When does this happen? I got a book fair in half an hour.

1087
01:05:34,529 --> 01:05:36,898
好了 我的吸血鬼儿子呢
All right. Where's my vampson?

噢 得了吧 还是得搞个这么戏剧化的开场嘛
Oh, please. Still has to make a dramatic entrance.

1089

老爸 看看你

1090
01:05:45,506 --> 01:05:47,942
所以你现在是在经营一家旅馆吗

1091
01:05:48,009 --> 01:05:51,779
从黑暗王子堕落到房间服务之王

1094
01:06:01,055 --> 01:06:03,925
让弗拉德远离人类和梅维斯
Keep Vlad away from the humans and Mavis.

1095
01:06:04,892 --> 01:06:05,960
我马上去做

1096
01:06:06,894 --> 01:06:10,364
噢 这可真是件漂亮的戏服
Oh, now that is a neat costume.

1097

These two smell funny.

1098

噢 你是个欧洲人
Oh, you're European.

1099
01:06:14,635 --> 01:06:17,204
这叫做除臭剂
It's called deodorant.

1100
01:06:17,271 --> 01:06:20,308
没人这么取笑整个大陆的 琳达
Nothing like insulting an entire continent, Linda.

1101
01:06:20,374 --> 01:06:22,443
嘿 伯爵 最近怎么样啊 我是弗兰肯斯坦
Hey, Count! How goes it? Frankenstein.

1102
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:24,679
事实上 严格来说我是弗兰肯斯坦的怪物
Actually, I'm technically Frankenstein's monster.

1103
01:06:24,745 --> 01:06:26,145
弗兰肯斯坦 他是那个博士

So, let me introduce you to some of your son's other buddies.

1106
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,622

This is Murray.

1107
01:06:34,689 --> 01:06:36,357
请不要杀了我
Please don't kill me!

1108
01:06:36,424 --> 01:06:39,226
我是说 哟 小弗 你好啊
I mean, yo, V! What's up?

1109
01:06:39,293 --> 01:06:42,096
会讲话的厕纸 呵呵 这可是个新朋友
Talking toilet paper. Well, that's a new one.

1110
01:06:43,464 --> 01:06:45,733
好了 那孩子在哪儿 他才是我想见的
All right! Where's the kid? That's who I wanna meet.

1111
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,034
强尼

1112
01:06:49,937 --> 01:06:52,807
这是德古拉的女婿
This is Dracula's son-in-law.

1113
01:06:52,873 --> 01:06:56,711
我是强纳梵伯爵
I am Count Jonafang.

1114
01:06:56,777 --> 01:06:59,180
呵 嘿 黑羊
Bleh, bleh, black sheep.

1115
01:06:59,246 --> 01:07:02,216
你身上有羊毛吗
Have you any wool?

1116
01:07:02,283 --> 01:07:04,118
你头上是什么玩意儿
What's that thing on your head?

1117
01:07:04,185 --> 01:07:06,554
看起来像是我奶奶的奶子
Looks like my grandmother's boobies.

1118
01:07:09,223 --> 01:07:11,292
爸爸 那个长得奇怪的人是谁呀
Daddy, who's the man with the funny face?

1119
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:12,560
就是这个孩子
Is this the kid?

1120
01:07:12,626 --> 01:07:13,794
就是他
It sure is.

1121
01:07:13,861 --> 01:07:15,496
让我看看他的尖牙
Let me see those fangs.

1122
01:07:15,563 --> 01:07:16,797
你在干什么
What are you doin'?

1123
01:07:16,864 --> 01:07:18,699
噢 我只是太爱他了
Oh, I just love him so much.

1124
01:07:18,766 --> 01:07:21,736
我想抱抱他的小尖牙
I want to hug him right in the fangs that he has.

1125
01:07:24,005 --> 01:07:27,308
我再说一遍 让我看看他的尖牙
I repeat, lemme see those fangs.

1126
01:07:36,984 --> 01:07:40,087
噢 他长牙比较慢 就像你一样
Oh, he's a late fanger, just like you.

1127
01:07:40,154 --> 01:07:42,390
是的 是的 就像我一样
Yes. Yes. Just like me.

1128
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:47,328
这位大人物以前可是个小爱哭鬼呢
The big shot here was a little crybaby, all right.

1129
01:07:47,395 --> 01:07:48,663
是的 是的 我是
Yes, yes, I was.

1130
01:07:48,729 --> 01:07:49,830
以前还会尿床
Used to pee in his bed.

1131
01:07:49,897 --> 01:07:51,365
好了 爸爸
Okay, Dad.

1132
01:07:51,432 --> 01:07:54,235
我们只需要把那孩子的尖牙给吓出来
We just need to scare the fangs out of the kid.

1133
01:07:54,301 --> 01:07:55,936
吓出来？
Hare ha hangs?

1134
01:07:56,003 --> 01:07:58,672
是啊 这就是我对这位大块头做的事情
Yeah, it's what I did for Mr. Tough Guy here.

1135
01:07:58,739 --> 01:08:01,242
首先 你得拿到迟长牙的小家伙
First, you've got to possess something

1136
01:08:01,308 --> 01:08:03,744
觉得又甜蜜又天真的东西
the late fanger finds sweet and innocent.

1137
01:08:03,811 --> 01:08:05,413
然后你给他展示这玩意儿到底是什么 然后
Then you show them what's what and...

1138
01:08:05,479 --> 01:08:07,481
嘣
Pop!

1139
01:08:07,548 --> 01:08:11,652
相信我 这样会把尖牙吓出来的 对吧 德古拉
Trust me. It'll scare the fangs right out. Right, Drac?

1140
01:08:11,719 --> 01:08:13,888
讲真的 伙计们 如果我赶不上图书展销会
Seriously, guys, if I'm late for the book fair,

1141
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:15,089
我会错过街头集市的
I'll miss the street fair.

1142
01:08:15,956 --> 01:08:18,292
那就是你要找的人
That's your guy.

1143
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:21,162
附身吗 但是丹尼斯会很伤心的
Possessed? But Dennis will be so upset.

1144
01:08:21,228 --> 01:08:23,330
你还没明白吗 这是我们的机会
Don't you get it? This is our ticket.

1145
01:08:23,397 --> 01:08:26,200
如果这样对丹尼索维奇有用 嘣 他是个吸血鬼
If it works for Denisovich, boom! He's a vampire.

1146
01:08:26,267 --> 01:08:28,102
然后你们就都可以留下来了
And you all get to stay here.

1147
01:08:28,169 --> 01:08:29,837
好的 好的
All right. All right.

1148
01:08:30,871 --> 01:08:32,807
收到 很好
Capisce. Good call.

1149
01:08:32,872 --> 01:08:35,910
孩子们 所有人 坐下来
Kids, everyone, have a seat.

1150
01:08:35,975 --> 01:08:38,412
丹尼斯给你们准备了一个大惊喜
Dennis has a big surprise for you.

1151
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:42,817
那就是绝无仅有的蛋糕糕 蛋糕怪物
The one and only Kakie, The Cake Monster!

1152
01:08:42,883 --> 01:08:46,821
嘿 孩子们 是我 蛋糕糕
Hey, kids! It's me, Kakie!

1153
01:08:46,886 --> 01:08:50,224
这是多么棒的蛋糕糕日呀
What a wonderful Kakie day it is!

1154
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:54,127
现在 我有个问题 在场谁喜欢蛋糕呀
Now, I have a question. Who here loves cake?

1155
01:08:59,633 --> 01:09:00,633
上升
Rise!

1156
01:09:09,076 --> 01:09:11,779
为什么我飘起来了 能把舞台管理员找来吗
Why am I floating? Can I have the stage manager, please?

1157
01:09:11,845 --> 01:09:13,613
这我可不干啊
This isn't working for me.

1158
01:09:20,254 --> 01:09:23,357
害怕吗 丹尼索维奇 你感觉到什么了吗 什么变化
Scary, Denisovich? You feeling anything? Any change?

1159
01:09:23,424 --> 01:09:24,859
蛋糕糕还好吗
Is Kakie okay?

1160
01:09:27,228 --> 01:09:31,332
我要所有的蛋糕 只有懦夫才会分享
I want all the cake. Sharing is for cowards.

1161
01:09:34,033 --> 01:09:37,438
我可不记得这些电视里有放这片段
I don't remember any of this from the TV show.

1162
01:09:37,505 --> 01:09:40,341
唔 我大概在蓝光碟里看到过 彩蛋
Um... I think I saw it on a Blu-Ray disc, bonus stuff.

1163
01:09:40,407 --> 01:09:42,510
等等 为什么弗拉德爷爷会在那儿
Wait, why is Grandpa Vlad up there?

1164
01:09:48,983 --> 01:09:51,484
我害怕了 外公 蛋糕糕怎么了
I'm scared, Papa. What's happening to Kakie?

1165
01:09:56,223 --> 01:09:59,627
你不吃蛋糕 蛋糕就吃你
You don't eat cake. Cake eat you!

1166
01:09:59,693 --> 01:10:01,128
不
No!

1167
01:10:01,195 --> 01:10:02,296
停下来
Stop it!

1168
01:10:05,699 --> 01:10:08,636
-刚刚发生什么了 伙计 -我不干了
What just happened, man? I'm outta here.

1169
01:10:08,702 --> 01:10:12,039
没有任何家长会在尖叫网上给好评的
None of these parents better review this on Yelp.

1170
01:10:12,106 --> 01:10:13,908
嘿 你刚刚做什么了
Hey, what did you just do?

1171
01:10:13,974 --> 01:10:14,797
只要再多吓他一会
A few more seconds and

1172
01:10:14,798 --> 01:10:16,443
这孩子的尖牙就会冒出来了
the kid's fangs would have popped right out.

1173
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:18,045
我不在乎 这根本不值得
I don't care. It's not worth it.

1174
01:10:18,112 --> 01:10:20,080
什么不值得
What's not worth it?

1175
01:10:20,147 --> 01:10:23,551
这是我想让小家伙变成吸血鬼的最后努力 这样你们就可以留下来了
It was my last attempt to make the boy a vampire, so you'd stay.

1176
01:10:23,617 --> 01:10:26,587
通过毁掉他最爱的东西吗 你怎么能这么做呢
By ruining his favorite thing? How could you do that?

1177
01:10:26,654 --> 01:10:27,721
我们实在没办法了
We were desperate.

1178
01:10:27,788 --> 01:10:29,657
你也搅和进来了
You were in on this?

1179
01:10:29,723 --> 01:10:31,158
丹尼斯在我的家乡不会开心的
Dennis won't be happy in my town.

1180
01:10:31,225 --> 01:10:32,993
丹尼斯根本就没去过那儿
Dennis hasn't been there.

1181
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:35,329
#丈夫和妻子#
# Now husband and wife #

1182
01:10:35,396 --> 01:10:37,431
#感受到紧张和冲突#
# Feel the strain and the strife #

1183
01:10:37,498 --> 01:10:39,200
闭嘴
Shut up!

1184
01:10:39,266 --> 01:10:41,468
强尼 丹尼斯不是个怪物
Johnny, Dennis is not a monster.

1185
01:10:42,903 --> 01:10:45,039
他喜欢鳄梨
He likes avocado.

1186
01:10:45,105 --> 01:10:46,607
那是因为你都不让他吃其他好玩的东西
'Cause you don't let him eat anything fun.

1187
01:10:46,674 --> 01:10:48,842
我觉得丹尼斯只想做个正常的孩子
I think Dennis just wants to be normal.

1188
01:10:48,909 --> 01:10:51,245
我们能不能别用“正常”这个词了
Can we stop using the word "Normal"?

1189
01:10:51,312 --> 01:10:53,581
在我们的世界里 他就是正常的
Where we live now, he's normal.

1190
01:10:53,647 --> 01:10:57,418
他就是他 而且你不能强行改变他 爸爸
He is who he is. And you can't change him, Dad.

1191
01:11:00,387 --> 01:11:01,827
丹尼斯 你要去哪
Dennis, where are you going?

1192
01:11:01,889 --> 01:11:03,224
离开
Away.

1193
01:11:05,025 --> 01:11:07,394
但是你自己一个人出来不安全
But it's not safe out here by yourself.

1194
01:11:07,461 --> 01:11:10,431
我知道有个地方我们可以藏起来 跟我来
I know a place where we can hide. Follow me.

1195
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:18,339
如果你不阻止我
If you didn't stop me,

1196
01:11:18,405 --> 01:11:21,508
我的曾孙就不用一辈子做个懦夫了
my great-grandson wouldn't have to be a wimp his whole life

1197
01:11:21,575 --> 01:11:23,177
就像那儿的邋遢鬼一样
like Schlumpy over here.

1198
01:11:23,244 --> 01:11:25,112
一个懦夫 强尼 冷静
A wimp? Johnny, be cool.

1199
01:11:25,179 --> 01:11:27,248
你想被扔出去吗 老家伙
You wanna throw down, old man?

1200
01:11:27,314 --> 01:11:28,949
1997年官方认证的黄带
Certified yellow belt since 1997.

1201
01:11:29,016 --> 01:11:31,185
不
No!

1202
01:11:31,252 --> 01:11:33,354
这是怎么回事 你不是个吸血鬼
What's this now? You're not a vampire?

1203
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,923
血
Bleh?

1204
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:40,160
他当然是个人类 他是我们的儿子 你以为我们是怪物吗
Of course he's human. He's our son. You think we're monsters?

1205
01:11:43,697 --> 01:11:48,502
你 你让你女儿嫁给了一个人类 还生了个人类小孩
You! You let your daughter marry a human and have a human kid?

1206
01:11:48,569 --> 01:11:51,739
你为什么不干脆拿根木桩戳我的心脏算了
Why don't you just put a stake through my heart.

1207
01:11:51,805 --> 01:11:54,942
我们不再恨人类了 他们也不恨我们
We don't hate humans anymore, and they don't hate us.

1208
01:11:58,712 --> 01:12:00,614
人类
Humans?

1209
01:12:02,049 --> 01:12:03,450
你就是个蠢蛋
You're a fool.

1210
01:12:03,517 --> 01:12:06,186
你的曾孙是我见过的最可爱最善良
Your great-grandson is the sweetest, kindest,

1211
01:12:06,253 --> 01:12:09,023
最特别的小男孩
most special boy I've ever met.

1212
01:12:09,089 --> 01:12:11,158
如果你仅仅因为他是半个人类
And if you can't give him the love

1213
01:12:11,225 --> 01:12:12,926
就不肯给他他应得的爱
he deserves because he's half-human,

1214
01:12:12,993 --> 01:12:14,328
那么你才是个蠢蛋
then you're the fool.

1215
01:12:15,863 --> 01:12:16,863
噢 爸爸
Oh, Daddy.

1216
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,601
丹尼斯去哪儿了 丹尼斯
Hey, where is Dennis? Dennis!

1217
01:12:21,869 --> 01:12:22,869
丹尼斯
Dennis?

1218
01:12:26,206 --> 01:12:29,176
生日快乐 丹尼斯 我为你准备了一顿晚餐
Happy birthday, Dennis. I made you a treat.

1219
01:12:29,243 --> 01:12:31,445
死鸽子 快吃吧
Dead pigeon? Enjoy it.

1220
01:12:31,512 --> 01:12:32,435
因为当我从商学院毕业
'Cause once I graduate

1221
01:12:32,436 --> 01:12:34,281
并且开始自己经营公司之后
business school and start running a company,

1222
01:12:34,348 --> 01:12:37,217
你就再也吃不到这样自家做的饭菜了
you're not gonna get home-cooked meals like this anymore.

1223
01:12:37,284 --> 01:12:40,654
我必须搬走 维尼 去加利福尼亚
I have to move away, Winnie. To California.

1224
01:12:40,721 --> 01:12:43,490
我妈咪认为我在这儿不快乐
My mommy thinks I'm not happy here

1225
01:12:43,557 --> 01:12:46,026
因为我没有像你一样脸上长毛
cebause I don't have hair on my face like you.

1226
01:12:46,093 --> 01:12:48,495
很抱歉我不是个怪物
I'm sorry I'm not a monster.

1227
01:12:48,562 --> 01:12:51,932
不 你很完美 你是我知道的最好的男孩
No, you are perfect. You're the nicest boy I know.

1228
01:12:51,999 --> 01:12:53,967
而我有三百个兄弟
And I have 300 brothers.

1229
01:12:54,034 --> 01:12:56,103
你也很好 温妮
You're nice, too, Winnie.

1230
01:13:00,374 --> 01:13:05,713
哈 哈 哈 小小人类和他的宠物
Well, well, well. The little human and his pet.

1231
01:13:05,779 --> 01:13:07,581
丹尼斯 丹尼索维奇
Dennis! Denisovich!

1232
01:13:07,648 --> 01:13:08,849
他不在房间里
He's not in the room.

1233
01:13:08,916 --> 01:13:10,384
他不在水池边
He's not by the pool.

1234
01:13:10,451 --> 01:13:12,086
他不在这罐汤里
He's not in this pot of soup.

1235
01:13:12,152 --> 01:13:14,121
他能去哪儿呢
Where could he be?

1236
01:13:14,188 --> 01:13:16,357
我不知道我当初为什么要邀请你
I don't know why I ever invited you.

1237
01:13:17,157 --> 01:13:18,692
丹尼斯 丹尼斯
Dennis! Dennis!

1238
01:13:18,759 --> 01:13:19,759
丹尼索维奇
Denisovich!

1239
01:13:19,793 --> 01:13:20,793
丹尼斯
Dennis!

1240
01:13:33,207 --> 01:13:35,008
别挣扎了
Stop squirming.

1241
01:13:35,075 --> 01:13:37,077
你为什么要这么做
Why are you doing this?

1242
01:13:37,144 --> 01:13:39,113
因为这是错的
Because this is wrong.

1243
01:13:39,179 --> 01:13:41,515
为什么每个人都不明白呢
Why doesn't anybody get that?

1244
01:13:41,582 --> 01:13:44,685
人类和怪物不能在一起
Humans don't belong with monsters.

1245
01:13:44,752 --> 01:13:46,053
你才错了
You're wrong!

1246
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:47,521
我没有
I am not!

1247
01:13:47,588 --> 01:13:50,424
我把你们抓了当人质
I am holding you hostage.

1248
01:13:50,491 --> 01:13:52,163
而且我和我的伙伴们
And me and my crew are

1249
01:13:52,164 --> 01:13:55,662
要把那间装满人类的旅馆撕成碎片
gonna tear that human-hugging hotel to shreds.

1250
01:13:55,729 --> 01:13:57,231
你做不到的
You can't.

1251
01:13:57,297 --> 01:13:58,966
真的吗 为什么呢
Really? Why not?

1252
01:13:59,032 --> 01:14:00,234
因为
Cebause...

1253
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,435
因为 为什么
Cebause, why?

1254
01:14:02,369 --> 01:14:05,539
因为这会让德古拉外公很伤心的
Cebause it will make Papa Drac sad.

1255
01:14:05,606 --> 01:14:09,376
喔 伤心 那你要怎么办呢
Ooh... Sad. And what are you gonna do about it?

1256
01:14:09,443 --> 01:14:11,445
我不知道
I don't know.

1257
01:14:11,512 --> 01:14:13,480
你知道你为什么不知道吗
You know why you don't know?

1258
01:14:13,547 --> 01:14:17,684
因为你只是个弱小的小男孩
Cebause you're just a weak little boy.

1259
01:14:48,182 --> 01:14:49,683
那是什么
What was that?

1260
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:51,318
丹尼斯 我们来了
Dennis, we're coming.

1261
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,688
你还好吗 温妮
Are you okay, Winnie?

1262
01:14:54,755 --> 01:14:56,123
是的 我的王子

见到你我太高兴了
I'm so happy to see you.

1269
01:15:44,104 --> 01:15:45,506
他的坏朋友来了
There's his mean friends.

1270
01:15:52,279 --> 01:15:54,281
噢 那可就好玩儿啦
Oh... This'll be fun.

1271
01:16:55,275 --> 01:16:56,643
不是我吃的哦
I didn't do that.

1272
01:17:08,322 --> 01:17:09,823
你太厉害啦 丹尼斯
You rock, Dennis.

1273
01:17:09,890 --> 01:17:10,991
他是说 丹尼索维奇
He means Denisovich.

1274
01:17:11,058 --> 01:17:12,326
蛋糕糕规则
Kakie rules!

1275
01:17:23,070 --> 01:17:24,504
丹尼斯 我来了 呜哇
Dennis, I'm coming. Whoa...

1276
01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:31,812
我就知道那些练习会有作用的
I knew all that practice would pay off.

1277
01:17:55,969 --> 01:17:58,305
这就对了 你们最好有多远飞多远
That's right, you better fly away.

1278
01:17:59,873 --> 01:18:03,410
德古拉外公 我是个吸血鬼还是个超级英雄
Papa Drac, I'm a vampire and a superhero.

1279
01:18:03,477 --> 01:18:05,345
现在我很酷了吧
Am I cool now?

1280
01:18:05,412 --> 01:18:08,915
现在 丹尼斯 你一直都很酷
Now? Dennis, you were always cool.

1281
01:18:08,982 --> 01:18:13,687
人也好 怪物也罢 独角兽都行 不管你是什么 你都很完美
Human, vampire, unicorn, you're perfect no matter what.

1282
01:18:13,754 --> 01:18:17,057
但是 既然我是吸血鬼 那我们能留下来吗
But since I'm a vampire, can we stay here?

1283
01:18:17,924 --> 01:18:19,126
当然
Yes.

1284
01:18:19,192 --> 01:18:20,360

但你得知道
But you have to know,

1287
01:18:25,146 --> 01:18:27,901
我们每个假期都会来看望你的
we're going to visit you here every holiday.

1288
01:18:27,968 --> 01:18:29,970
好啊 好啊

1289
01:18:45,752 --> 01:18:49,690
不许再靠近我或者我的家人一步
Don't ever come near me or my family again.

1290
01:18:53,193 --> 01:18:54,361
不
No!

1291
01:19:03,537 --> 01:19:07,474
老爸 你刚刚救了一个人类
Daddy, you just saved a human.

1292
01:19:07,541 --> 01:19:09,876
所有有关这男孩的
All this pressure about

1293
01:19:09,943 --> 01:19:12,312
尖牙什么时候能长出来的压力
when the boy's fangs were coming out.

1294
01:19:12,379 --> 01:19:15,649
谁在乎啊 我的几年前都出来了 看
Who cares? Mine came out years ago! Look.

1295
01:19:17,751 --> 01:19:20,721
好了 爸爸 趁我们还没吐 赶紧把你的牙放回去
Okay, Dad, put 'em back in before we all barf.

1296
01:19:20,787 --> 01:19:24,391
嘿 今天应该还是某人的生日吧
Hey! Isn't it still somebody's birthday?

1297
01:20:20,547 --> 01:20:22,048
让我听见你们唱起来

1298
01:20:24,184 --> 01:20:25,519
