听说  要想把故事讲好
They say, if you wanna tell a story right,

19
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,580
就得从头说起
you gotta start at the beginning.

20
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,880
太远了  好吧
Too far? Fine.

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,380
这就是我  哈琳·奎泽尔
This is me, Harleen Quinzel.

22
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,650
我小的时候
When I was a kid,

23
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,840
爸爸拿我换了六罐啤酒
my dad traded me for a six-pack of beer.

24
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,470
但不论他抛弃我多少次
But however many times he tried to ditch me...

25
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,930
我都能找回来
I kept coming back.

26
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,480
最后他给我找了个新家
Eventually, he found me a new home.

27
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,850
圣伯纳黛特修道院的好心修女们教会我很多事
The good sisters of St. Bernadette's taught me a lot.

28
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,400
但我从来不是孺子可教的那类孩子
But I was never an establishment kinda gal.

29
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,400
考虑到我经历的一切  我表现得算不错了
All things considered, I did good.

30
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,710
我还去上了大学
I even went to college.

31
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,240
拿了博士学位
Got my PhD.

32
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,570
为爱心碎过一两次
Had my heart broken once or twice.

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,800
找寻真爱  可不太容易
Finding love, it's not easy.

34
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,930
所以我全身心投入工作
So I threw myself into my work,

35
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,660
成为一名精神科医生
became a psychiatrist.

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,810
就在那时我遇见了他
That's when I met him.

37
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,540
J先生  我的小丑大人
Mr. J. My Joker.

38
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,100
我猛地坠入爱河
Oh, I fell hard.

39
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,610
就像从飞机上跳下来  没带降落伞
Like out of a plane without a parachute,

40
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,880
正中你那张蠢兮兮的脸一样惨
right in your dumb fucking face kinda hard.

41
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,990
我完全迷失了自我
I lost all sense of who I was.

42
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,430
只看得到我亲爱的布丁
I only had eyes for Puddin'.

43
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,910
我们都知道那句话怎么说
We all know the saying,

44
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,700
"每个成功男人背后
"Behind every successful man

45
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,350
都有一个坏婆娘"
there's a badass broad."

46
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,230
好吧  说的就是我
Well, that was me.

47
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,870
J先生最伟大的花招中  有一些是我想到的
I was the brains behind some of Mr. J's greatest stunts.

48
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,670
但他只是没告诉别人罢了
Not that he let anyone know it.

49
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,530
布丁
Puddin'?

50
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,360
可能所有的好事总会结束吧
I guess all good things have to come to an end.

51
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:52,870
于是
So...

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,790
我们分手了
we broke up.

53
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,600
我非常成熟地接受了此事
I handled it real mature.

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,630
但J先生受到了极大的冲击
But Mr. J was super broke up about it.

55
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,260
我换了一个很不错的地方  一个人住
I got an amazing new place that was all mine.

56
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,980
让我有空间去反思自己过去犯下的错误
It gave me the space to really reflect on the mistakes of my past.

57
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,690
我需要找到自己的新身份
I had to find a new identity.

58
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,150
新的我
A new me.

59
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,240
很不容易
It wasn't easy.

60
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,590
但过了一段时间  我甚至开始
But after a while, I even opened myself up

61
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,790
拥抱可能的新恋情
to the possibility of new love.

62
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,960
嗨  小可人儿
Hello, nice baby.

63
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,900
新恋情是这样的
Here's the thing about new love...

64
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,840
我接受肉体支付
I take payment-in-kind.

65
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,100
你得喂它才行
...you have to feed it.

66
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,070
不久后我就完全恢复
Soon enough, I was back on my feet.

67
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,900
准备好翻篇  去交新朋友
Ready to move on, to make new friends.

68
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,200
她是货真价实的
She means fucking business!

69
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,220
-来了  -给我借点力
- Oh, here we go! - Whip me!

70
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,000
她借力冲到了最前面
She has taken a whip from the pivot, catapulted to the high side!

71
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,800
来吧
Yeah! Come on!

72
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,510
是时候让哥谭市见识一下新的哈莉·奎茵了
It was time for Gotham to meet the new Harley Quinn,

73
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,010
所以我真的是豁出去了
so I really put myself out there.

74
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,600
像骑你男人一样骑那根杆子吧
Ride that pole like you ride your man!

75
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,900
该死  给我他妈坐下
God damn it. Sit the fuck down.

76
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:51,750
什么
What?

77
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,820
我说了把你的小屁股放下去  你这个蠢婊子
I said sit your skinny ass down, you dumb slut.

78
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,370
好吧
Okay.

79
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,710
你把我的腿坐断了
You broke my fucking legs!

80
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,250
怎么了
What?

81
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,220
无名场面不派对  对吧
It's not a party without a little drama, am I right?

82
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,430
来呀  开灯
Come on! Turn it up!

83
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,430
我请大家喝酒
Shots on the house.

84
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,560
敢说我傻  我有博士学位  混账东西
Call me dumb. I have a PhD, motherfucker.

85
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,930
-奎茵小姐  -罗米
- Miss Quinn. - Romy.

86
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,700
他是我的司机
That was my driver.

87
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,100
哎呀
Oh, whoops.

88
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,290
这肯定是他的错  我炒了他
Well, I'm sure it was his fault. Consider him fired.

89
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,420
我很感激
Consider me grateful.

90
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,990
尤其是我知道你不喜欢我
Especially since I know you don't like me.

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,460
我刺激了他那微妙的心理平衡
I agitate his already delicate sense of mental equilibrium.

92
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,510
和他那必须要成为注意力中心的
That and his obsessive-compulsive need

93
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,130
强迫性的内心需求
to be the center of attention.

94
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,450
你的情人今晚会来吗
Will your paramour be joining us this evening?

95
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,910
今晚不会  罗米  今晚不会
Not tonight, Romy. Not tonight.

96
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,060
好好享受  奎茵小姐
Well, enjoy yourself, Miss Quinn.

97
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,080
请代我向小丑问好
And do give the Joker my best.

98
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,270
好吧  我还没告诉别人我俩分手了
Okay, fine, so I hadn't told people about the breakup.

99
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,650
但你们不会懂的
But you don't understand.

100
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,220
给我找个新司机
Find me a new driver.

101
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,590
做小丑的女友给了我豁免权
Being Joker's girl gave me immunity.

102
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,930
我可以做我想做的事  当我想当的人
I could do whatever I wanted to whoever I wanted,

103
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,230
没有人敢反对
and no one ever dared to object.

104
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,840
别让他给你脸色  好吗
And don't let him give you shit, okay?

105
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,240
你得为你自己撑腰
You have to stick up for yourself.

106
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,570
算了吧  没过几天他们就会复合了
Oh, please. I give it a few days before they're back together.

107
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,370
就算我真的告诉大家了
Even when I did try and tell people,

108
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,160
他们也不相信我
they didn't believe me.

109
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,600
拜托  她跟我说他们这次真的分手了
Come on. She told me they're really broken up this time.

110
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,620
当然了  谢尔
Sure they are, Shell.

111
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,440
所以她还戴着那条俗气的J字项链
That's why she's still wearing that tacky "J" necklace.

112
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,960
只要小丑打个响指  她就会立即
She is going to be running right back into his arms

113
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,880
扑向他的怀抱
the minute he snaps his fingers.

114
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,120
就算不是他  随便哪个活着的大男子主义者都行
If not him, the next closest alpha male with a pulse.

115
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,260
有些人天生就是扶不起的阿斗
Some people just aren't born to stand on their own.

116
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,000
-姑娘们  喝一杯  来吧  -好
- Oh, girl, let's drink. Come on. - All right.

117
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,730
我知道自己需要找个办法告诉全世界
I knew I needed to find some way to show the world

118
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,880
我要永远地跟J先生划清界限
that I'd cut ties with Mr. J for good.

119
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,260
哈莉
Harley!

120
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,760
有些人的回忆是埃菲尔铁塔  或橄榄花园
Some people have the Eiffel Tower, or Olive Garden.

121
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,860
小丑和我呢
The Joker and I?

122
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,350
我们的爱之花盛开在剧毒物质加工厂里
Our love bloomed in a highly toxic industrial processing plant.

123
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,420
很幸运的是
And luckily for me,

124
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,670
我的好主意都是喝醉后想出来的
I have all my best ideas drunk.

125
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,530
我想到一个超棒的主意
I have the best idea!

126
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,170
什么鬼  快回来
The fuck? Hey! Hey! Come back here!

127
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,720
这里是一切开始的地方  布丁
This is where it all began, Puddin'.

128
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,060
你这个混蛋
You motherfucker!

129
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,810
正是我需要的体面的结束
It was the closure I needed.

130
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,210
新的开始
A fresh start.

131
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,260
做自己的机会
A chance to be my own woman.

132
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,650
但我可不是哥谭市唯一需要自我解放的女人
But I wasn't the only dame in Gotham looking for emancipation.

133
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,650
这是我们的故事
This is our story.

134
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,740
因为是我讲  所以老子想从哪里开始就从哪里开始
And I'm telling it, so I'll start where I fucking want.

135
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,550
见见警方吧
Meet the cop.

136
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,180
五十块打赌是地盘争夺战
I got 50 says it was turf war.

137
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,080
不是他
Not him.

138
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,010
一如既往  你赌错了  芒罗
Well, as always, you're wrong, Munroe.

139
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,520
这位  芮妮·蒙托亚
Her. Renee Montoya.

140
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,730
从小看八十年代警匪剧
Raised on '80s cop shows,

141
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,900
她总会说些俗气的名台词  比如
she's always saying cheesy shit like...

142
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,420
只有一个枪手
There was only one shooter.

143
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,970
在屋里
Inside.

144
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,610
这个人开枪把玻璃打碎了
This guy shot out the glass.

145
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,640
塞拉诺
Serrano.

146
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,450
让弹道专家在这些停放的车里检查是否有子弹
Have Ballistics check for a bullet in one of those parked cars.

147
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,450
十年前  她破了一个能平步青云的案子
Ten years ago, she broke a career-making case.

148
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,500
-我结巴了吗  -快去
- Did I stutter? - Go ahead.

149
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,830
但当时她的搭档却把功劳都抢去了
But her partner at the time took all the credit.

150
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,250
所以他荣升了警长
So while he made captain,

151
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,790
她却只能当警探  跟这个蠢货搭档
she got stuck at detective level with this idiot.

152
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,880
好吧  你觉得是一个人打死四个吗
Okay, you think one guy got all four?

153
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,920
等等  等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait.

154
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,720
我只是说我们发现了四具尸体
I'm just saying, we got four dead bodies here, you know.

155
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,120
-一个人...弹孔  -我在努力查案
- One guy... Bullet holes. - I'm trying to work.

156
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,290
抱歉  你工作吧  忙吧
I'm sorry. Go ahead and work. Go ahead.

157
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,920
枪手走到跟前时还没拔枪  六发子弹
The shooter got close before drawing. Six rounds.

158
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,760
这里三个人每人两发
Two for each of these three.

159
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,170
当心你自己吧
Yo, mind your debt.

160
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,640
-我跟你说  -那个叫安吉拉的女孩  她是个公主
- I'm telling you. - That girl, Angelina, she's a princess.

161
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,650
你看看
Look at this.

162
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,260
-是万圣节打扮吗  -你好吗
- Is it Halloween? - Hey. How you doing?

163
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,940
与其他人无关
And it wasn't about them.

164
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,990
枪手是冲这个人来的
It was all about this guy, right here.

165
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,580
你知道我是谁吗
Do you know who I am?

166
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,120
他妈的贱人
You fucking bitch.

167
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,010
穿过他喉咙的这支箭
And this arrow through his throat...

168
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,490
她想让他慢慢死去
She wanted him to die slowly.

169
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,310
-她  -我们找到了头发
- She? - We got a hair.

170
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,330
他找到了新杀手
And he's got a new assassin.

171
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,310
谁
Who does?

172
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,280
罗曼·博伟·赛恩尼斯
Roman Beauvais Sionis.

173
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,030
天啊
Jesus Christ.

174
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,320
我是蒙托亚  刚刚怎么回事
This is Montoya. What the hell was that?

175
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,620
该死
Shit.

176
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,350
-警探  -怎么
- Detective. - Yep?

177
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,580
我们找到这条项链
Found this necklace.

178
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,500
我操
Holy shit.

179
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,250
干得漂亮  警官
Good work, Officer.

180
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,590
怎么了
What is it?

00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,760
哈莉·奎茵和小丑分手了
Harley Quinn and the Joker broke up.

182
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,930
什么

183
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,320
这是他们的秘密地点
This was their spot.

184
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,560
她刚刚公开更新了自己的恋爱状态
She just publicly updated her relationship status.

185
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:42,940
哈莉·奎茵刚刚把自己解禁了
Harley Quinn just called open season on herself.

186
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
她可没想明白
She did not think this one through.

187
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,650
对  我的确没想明白
Yeah, no shit I didn't think it through.

188
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,670
我即将了解到  在这个城市里
I'm about to learn that a lot of people

189
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,570
有很多人想要我的命
in this city want me dead.

190
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:55,030
在名单上的第一位就是这个人
And at the top of that list is this guy.

191
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,200
乔先生和他可爱的妻女
Mr. Keo and his lovely wife and daughter.

192
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,290
是你逼我的
You kinda forced my hand here.

193
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,790
说实话  我有点失望
Gotta say, I'm a little disappointed.

194
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,970
我给了你一份好活计  对吧
I gave you a great pitch. Didn't I?

195
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,890
而我以为...
And I thought...

196
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,720
我以为我们能一起造出点美好的记忆
I thought we could build something beautiful together.

197

我以为我们可以成为家人

198
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,780
我来放你自由
I'm gonna set you free.

199
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,960
她怎么办
What about her?

200
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,310
我想我们可以放她走
I think we can let her go.

201
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,300
这场大戏传递出的信息足够响亮了
I mean, this is a pretty loud fucking shitshow of a message.

202
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,850
宝贝
Baby.

203
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,810

Don't cry.

204
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,980
谢谢  谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

205
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,190
不客气
You're welcome.

206
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,650
那是鼻涕泡吗
Is that a snot bubble?

207
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,530
-恶心  -什么
- Gross. - What?

208
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,990
我改主意了  剥了她
Oh, I've changed my mind. Peel it off.

209
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,040
不  不
No. No!

210
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,730
这位嗜好剥人脸皮的疯子
The wack job with the penchant for peeling faces

211
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,920
叫罗曼·赛恩尼斯
is Roman Sionis,

212
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,040
代号
aka

213
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,630
黑面具
Black Mask.

214
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,930
我尚且不知道他想要我死这件事
The fact that he wants me dead hasn't yet hit my radar.

215
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,810
你瞧  我当时身处半个城市之外
See, I was halfway across town,

216
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,890
宿醉  想着早餐的事儿
hungover, and thinking about breakfast.

217
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,770
鸡蛋  培根  美国芝士
Egg, bacon, American cheese.

218
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,690
松软的  烤过的  抹黄油的面包
Soft, toasted buttered roll.

219
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,590
加上少许辣酱
Just a dash of hot sauce.

220
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,950
别太多  萨尔
Not too much, Sal.

221
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,370
我要尝到芝士味
I wanna taste the cheese.

222
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,370
真是开启新生活的绝妙方式呀
What a way to start my new life.

223
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,670
用一个完美的鸡蛋三明治
With the perfect egg sandwich.

224
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,920
你真是我的救星  萨尔
You're a lifesaver, Sal.

225
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,350
欠你的75美分我会还的  行吗
And I'm good for the 75 cents, okay?

226
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,110
我发誓  我就只剩这么点家底了
I promise. That's all the money I got in the world,

227
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,430
花在这上面简直超值
and it's so worth it.

228
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,750
我不知道是因为他亚美尼亚手臂上稀疏的毛发
I don't know if it's the stray Armenian arm hair,

229
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,330
还是因为他的芝士片总是过期六个月
or the fact that his cheese slices are always six months out of date,

230
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,300
但萨尔做的鸡蛋三明治无人能比
but no one makes an egg sandwich like Sal.

231
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,580
我认真的  萨尔  无人能比
I mean it, Sal. No one.

232
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,940
不许动  哥谭警局
Freeze! Gotham PD.

233
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,090
我才不呢
Yeah, I don't think so.

234
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,640
你他妈是在逗我吗
Are you fucking kidding me?

235
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,690
警察
Police.

236
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,830
距离我用顶尖化工那个小花招
It had been six short hours

237
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,830
向世界宣告我和J先生已经是过去式了
since my little stunt at Ace Chemicals

238
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,610
才过去了短短六小时
announced to the world that Mr. J and I were dunzo.

239
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:22,740
我长久以来享受的豁免就已经失效了
The immunity I'd enjoyed for so long was gone.

240
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,510
以前从来不敢找我麻烦的条子
Cops who never would've dared come after me before

241
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,040
忽然就这样对我了
were suddenly doing this.

242
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,920
站住
Freeze!

243
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
-你知道更糟的是什么吗  -闪开
- And what's worse? - Move!

244
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,150
以前我得罪过的每一个人
Every person I ever wronged

245
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,930
现在都觉得可以来找我报仇了
now felt free to come and take their pound of flesh.

246
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,660
万万没想到我得罪了好多人
Turns out I wronged a lot of people.

247
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,490
来吧  乖乖  咬他
Come on, boy. Get him!

248
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,050
终于
Finally.

249
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,540
然后...
And then...

250
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,870
我们会共渡难关的  好吗
We're gonna get through this, okay?

251
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,360
悲剧降临了
...tragedy struck.

252
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,040
唯有失去了我真正热爱的东西
It took losing something I truly love

253
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,080
我才意识到  我背上的靶子
for me to see that the target on my back

254
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,960
比我想象中要大
was bigger than I thought.

255
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,260
不许动
Freeze.

256
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,270
随着包围圈渐渐向我收紧
With the walls closing in around me,

257
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,270
我采取了一个精心计算过的
I made a carefully calculated,

258
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,930
极具战略性的举动
highly strategic move.

259
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,890
好吧
Fine.

260
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,250
是瞎猫碰着死耗子了  但还是...
It was dumb luck. But still...

261
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,570
那感觉挺棒的
That felt pretty great.

262
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,630
抱歉忽然闯进你家
Sorry for busting in on you like that,

263
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,380
谢谢让我抄近路啦
but thanks for the shortcut.

264
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,280
再见
See ya.

265
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,330
她在这呢
There she is.

266
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,290
哈莉·奎茵
Harley Quinn.

267
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,580
怎么了
Yeah?

268
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,600
我等这一刻等了好久了
I've waited a long time for this.

269
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,710
这样啊
You have?

270
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,050
我还没吃早餐呢
I haven't had breakfast yet.

271
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,420
我怎么你了
What did I do to you?

272
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,090
你在逗我吗
Are you serious?

273
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,140
看看我的脸
Look at my face.

274
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,520
看  看  我  的  脸
Look at my face!

275
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,630
那又不是我干的
That wasn't me.

276
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,590
但是你怂恿他干的
But you dared him to do it.

277
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,780
是啦  但我怂恿了很多人做了很多事呀
Yeah, but I dare a lot of people to do a lot of things, okay?

278
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,460
拜托  我俩现在甚至都不在一起了
Come on. I'm not even with him anymore.

279
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,240
我知道
I know.

280
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,910
那意味着
That means

281
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,950
没有人来阻止我了
there's no one here to stop me.

282
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,330
-好吧  -你死定了  奎茵
- Right. - You're gonna die, Quinn.

283
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,670
一分钱
A penny.

284
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,260
怎么还开始射箭了
They're shooting arrows now?

285
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,890
该死
Ah, crap.

286
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,270
他也来
Him, too?

287
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,950
和谈
Parley?

288
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,660
我操  蒙托亚  你闻着像是死老鼠的屁眼
Fuck, Montoya, you smell like a dead rat's asshole.

289
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,760
今天别惹我  辛普森
Not today, Simpson.

290
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,230
这可是蒙托亚警探  对前辈放尊敬点
It's Detective Montoya. Respect your elders.

291
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,880
我是说  对老人家
I mean, your elderly.

292
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,980
你只比我年轻几岁
You're only a few years younger than me,

293
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,150
却还在做前台工作
and you're still behind that desk.

294
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,220
还要继续说下去吗
You wanna go there?

295
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,360
快点  把口袋里的东西都掏出来  全部
Come on. Empty your pockets. All of it.

296
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,800
卡珊德拉·该隐  这就又进来了
Cassandra Cain, back already?

297
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,760
还以为事到如今你已经学会不被抓的办法了呢
Thought by now you'd figure out how not to get caught.

298
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,020
怎么  居然不回嘴
What? No comeback?

299
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,480
你还好吧
You all right?

300
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,900
你闻着像屎
You smell like shit.

301
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,650
辛普森
Yo, Simpson.

302
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,120
失物招领处有干净衣服吗
Any clean clothes in lost and found?

303
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:40,260
这些可是很严重的指控  蒙托亚小姐
These are serious accusations, Miss Montoya.

304
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,850
赛恩尼斯这个姓氏
The Sionis family name

305
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,890
在哥谭市一半的博物馆和学校前挂着呢
is on half the museums and schools in Gotham.

306
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,390
这就能让他免受法律制裁了吗  警长
And that makes him immune to the law, Captain?

307
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,880
蒙托亚那天的遭遇几乎和我一样悲惨了
Montoya's day is going almost as badly as mine.

308
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,380
还记得那个抢了她的升职的人吗
Remember the guy who stole her promotion?

309
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
就是他
That's him.

310
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,570
光昨晚一晚上他就让人杀了四个人
He had four people killed alone last night.

311
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,700
如果罗曼·赛恩尼斯真这么神机妙算
If Roman Sionis is such a mastermind,

312
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,700
他怎么还被自家公司炒了
how'd he get fired from his own fucking company?

313
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,690
杰纳斯集团是他爸的公司  谢谢
The Janus Corporation is his father's company, thank you.

314
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,020
顺便一提  他被逐出继承人行列了
And by the way, they cut him off.

315
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,540
地检办公室对这件事是什么立场
Where does the DA's office stand on all this?

316
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,290
更糟糕的是  这位助理地检
To make matters worse, the assistant DA?

317
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,380
是她的前女友
That's her ex.

318
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,800
证明赛恩尼斯和这些谋杀案有关的证据...
The evidence that Sionis is linked to these murders...

319
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,120
有一批货要来了
There's a shipment coming in.

320
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,590
毒品吗
Drugs?

321
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,720
-一颗钻石  -一颗钻石
- A diamond. - A diamond.

322
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,600
你可真行  蒙托亚
Wow, Montoya.

323
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,180
我们要不要打电话给联调局求助
Should we call the Feds for backup?

324
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,390
听着  我在那家夜店有个线人
Listen, I had a source at the club.

325
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,180
他的司机
His driver.

326
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,560
他说罗曼一直在叨叨这件事
He said that Roman couldn't stop talking about this thing.

327
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,140
他还说自己听到了关于激光加密之类的东西
And he said that he overheard something about laser-encoding.

328
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,440
我做了些调查
Now, I did some research.

329
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,360
我觉得是贝尔蒂内利钻石
I think it's the Bertinelli diamond.

330
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,820
你还记得贝尔蒂内利灭门案吧
You remember the Bertinelli massacre, right?

331
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,240
历史小课堂
Quick history lesson.

332
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,350
十五年前
Fifteen years ago,

333
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,930
哥谭市最有钱的黑手党家族之一被灭门了
one of the wealthiest mafia families in Gotham was gunned down.

334
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,870
是为了夺权  但真正的目标
It was a power grab, but the real target

335
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:48,000
是贝尔蒂内利家绝密的离岸账户
was the Bertinellis' super-secret offshore bank accounts,

336
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
据说其相关信息被加密在了
the details of which were said to be encoded

337
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,570
一颗三十克拉的钻石的原子结构上
in the atomic structure of a 30-carat diamond.

338
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,420
这颗钻石失踪了
The rock was lost.

339
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,260
找到它
And with it,

340
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,760
就找到了通向贝尔蒂内利财富的唯一钥匙
the only key to the Bertinelli fortune.

341
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,540
正因如此罗曼·赛恩尼斯才想抢到它
Which is exactly why Roman Sionis is trying to get his hands on it.

342
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,310
所以他是个非常危险的人物
That's what makes him so dangerous.

343
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,980
他已经在建造一支军队了
He's already building an army.

344
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,180
如果他得到了那颗钻石
If he gets the diamond,

345
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,060
他就有金钱有门路
he'll have all the money and connections

346
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,750
去贿赂他需要的每一个法官  每一个警察
to bribe every single judge and cop he needs

347
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,190
以垄断这座城市
to get a monopoly on the city.

348
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,510
你刚说你在内部有线人吗
You said you had someone on the inside?

349
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,970
没错  他...
Yes. He's...

350
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,110
他现在已经不在那里了  但...
He's no longer there, but...

351
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,770
所以说起来  你手上什么都没有
So basically, you have nothing.

352
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,870
你试图对付
You are trying to go after

353
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:28,450
哥谭市最不怕打官司也最有钱的家族之一
one of the most litigious and wealthiest families in Gotham,

354
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,230
而你却只能依赖传闻和直觉
and all you've got is rumors and a hunch?

355
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,710
地检办公室也在试图立案起诉他
Well, you know, the DA's office is building a case against him, too.

356
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,050
对吧  易小姐
Isn't that right, Miss Yee?

357
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:39,620
听着  如果地检大人想在这件事上出头
Listen, if the DA is willing to throw himself out in front of this,

358
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,630
-我无所谓  -警长  不是
- it's fine with me. - Captain, no.

359
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,830
听着  芒罗
Listen, Munroe,

360
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,640
给我找些能指控赛恩尼斯的切实证据  好吗
find me some tangible connection to Sionis, all right?

361
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,470
-遵命  长官  -等等  等等  警长
- Yes, sir. - Wait, wait, wait. Captain.

362
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,770
这是我的案子
This is my case, okay?

363
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,480
我已经查了六个月了
I've been working on this for six months.

364
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,920
我们需要一些真正能用得上的东西  警探
We need something that we can actually use, Detective.

365
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,550
还有  蒙托亚小姐  我们是有着装要求的
And, Miss Montoya, we do have a dress code.

366
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,390
-我很抱歉  但我...  -不
- Look, I'm sorry about that, but I... - No.

367
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,930
你这是在拿我的工作乱搞
That is my job you are fucking with.

368
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,630
你什么毛病  芮妮
What is wrong with you, Renee?

369
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,140
我  他把我的案子给别人了
Me? He gave my case away.

370
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,410
可怜的芮妮
Oh, poor Renee.

371
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,460
不如给你自己倒杯酒喝吧  快到中午了
Why don't you pour yourself a drink? It's almost noon.

372
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,890
老天  谁他妈给我打电话
Jesus. Who the fuck is this?

373
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,480
-什么事  -你他妈为什么不接电话
- What? - Why the fuck haven't you been picking up your phone?

374
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,360
出事了
We've got a situation.

375
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,920
出...出什么事了
What... What situation?

376
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,420
这件事不是我告诉你的
You didn't hear this from me,

377
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,710
但你得抢在别人之前找到她
but you gotta find her before someone else does.

378
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,810
钻石在她手上
She's got the diamond,

379
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,100
相信我  罗曼会杀了她的
and trust me, Roman will kill her.

380
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,150
我的钻石  谁  在谁手上
My diamond? Who? Who's got it?

381
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,230
一个孩子
This kid.

382
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,970
是个扒手  叫卡珊德拉·该隐
She's a pickpocket. Her name's Cassandra Cain.

383
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,940
见鬼了
Holy fuck.

384
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,730
有什么需要帮忙吗
Can I help you?

385
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,200
有的  你能帮到我的
Why, yes. Yes, you can.

386
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,090
我是来报告一起可怕的犯罪的
I'm here to report a terrible crime.

387
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,170
是什么可怕的犯罪
And what terrible crime is that?

388
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,720
这个
This one.

389
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,650
好呀  小伙子们
Hi, boys.

390
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,070
散会咯
Meeting's over.

391
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,990
跑啊  小猪快跑
Run, piggy, run.

392
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,700
卡珊德拉·该隐在哪
Where can I find Cassandra Cain?

393
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,360
等等  等等  我讲得不对
Hold up, hold up. I'm telling this all wrong.

394
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,570
倒带一下
Let's rewind.

395
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,410
要让你们理解
For you to understand why me,

396
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,270
为什么我  警察和马桶上那位女士
the cop, and that dame on the toilet...

397
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,430
她叫卡珊德拉·该隐
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

398
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,880
都在找这位叫该隐的
...are all looking for this Cain character...

399
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,930
我得带你回到几天之前
I gotta take you back a few days,

400
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:56,440
带你回到我在黑面具夜店喝到烂醉的那晚
to that night I got shitfaced at the Black Mask Club.

401
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,090
? 这是男人的世界 ?
? This is a man's world ?

402
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:11,610
? 这是男人的世界 ?
? This is a man's world ?

403
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,220
这位是黛娜·兰斯
This is Dinah Lance.

404
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,660
? 但它什么也不是 ?
? But it would be nothing ?

405
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,000
但她更喜欢别人叫她黑金丝雀
But she prefers Black Canary.

406
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,530
? 什么也不是 ?
? Nothing ?

407
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,900
她有迷死人的嗓音
She's got a killer voice.

408
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,290
但那晚出了其他的岔子
But there was some other shit going down that night.

409
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,860
...像这样临时通知
...short notice like this.

410
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,340
我说的不是貌合神离的搭档
I'm not talking superficial partnerships.

411
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,670
我说的是你我互相照应
I'm talking you and me having each other's backs.

412
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:39,290
金狮帮不能大摇大摆地走进哥谭国家银行
The Golden Lions can't just wander into Gotham National Bank.

413
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,490
我能
I can.

414
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,700
贷款  流动资金  洗钱
Loans, liquidity, laundering.

415
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,870
要是你带你的人参与进来
Look, if you bring your boys into the fold,

416
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:50,090
我们一起  要什么有什么
there are no limits to what we could achieve together.

417
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,990
我在构建特别的计划
I'm building something special.

418
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,480
感谢你的邀请  赛恩尼斯先生
I appreciate your offer, Mr. Sionis.

419
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,320
但恕我直言

金狮帮是我们的家族事业
the Golden Lions are a family business.

421
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,360
去他的家庭  无意冒犯  但去他的
Fuck family. All due respect, but fuck that.

422
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,440
家庭就是幻觉
Family's a fucking illusion.

423
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,070
你知道我家给了我什么吗  什么都没有
You know what my family gave me? Nothing.

424
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,580
我知道传言怎么说

"凌晨五点喝金汤力"  "我想吃鸭子"
"Gin and tonics at 5:00." "I'll have the duck."

428
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,850
诸如此类的  捏造的胡话
Blah, blah, blah. Fake fucking fucks.

429
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,580

我找到了贝尔蒂内利钻石

431

马上这座城市就是我的了

432

不仅是东区

433
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,250
我想得很宏伟  宝贝

435
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,040
建立我们自己的家庭
We could make our own family.

436
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,240
赛恩尼斯先生
Mr. Sionis,

437
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:42,080
金狮帮在哥谭市运作已经将近一百年了
the Golden Lions have operated in Gotham for nearly 100 years.

438
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,750
我们不需要你的保护
We have no need of your protection.

439
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,540
他会后悔的
He's gonna regret that.

440
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,580
你能不能好好考虑一下  就当是为了我
Will you sleep on it? Will you do that for me?

441
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,130
跟你那美娇妻说一说
Run it by that beautiful wife of yours,

442

446
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,720
? 如果没有女性的话 ?
? Without a woman or a girl ?

447
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,650
谁玩得很开心  你们玩得很开心
Who's having a good time? You are.

448
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,800
餐食还不错吧
Food is good?

449

还需要鸡尾酒吗
Do you need any more cocktails?

450

453

? 这是男人的世界 ?
? This is a man's world ?

454
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:53,780
? 但它什么也不是 ?
? It wouldn't be nothing ?

455
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:59,830
? 如果没有女性的话 ?
? Without a woman or a girl ?

456
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,440
金丝雀在罗曼的酒吧唱了好多年

他叫她"我的小鸟"

459
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,440
她被他牢牢攥在手心里

没人在乎我们其他的身份

我不知道你觉得我是谁  女士
Yeah, I don't know who you think I am, lady,

477

养父母
Foster parents.

别那么跟我说话

你说得对  我知道

你跟她有相同的能力

她是不是也想让你好好利用呢

571
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,980
你对我妈妈一无所知

当她被发现死在路边时
And when she was found dead in the street,

577
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,740
你人在哪  你们警察又在哪

现在你跑上门来
Now you wanna come and knock on my door

579

叫我帮你
and ask me to help you out

580
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,140
犯下和她当年一样的错吗
and make the same mistake she did?

581
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,510
那祝你好运

582

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,210
在我的管辖之下绝对不会再发生这种事

斯普兰桥战士投响了
The Sprang Bridge Soldiers capituated.

587
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,310
是投降  他们当然投降了
"Capitulated." Of course they did.

588
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,640
我和你说过干掉乔能杀鸡儆猴
I told you that Keo scene would send a message.

589
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,480

00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,060
我的东西
My things!

698
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,280
操他妈的  我的要求不过分吧
Fucking fuck! I don't ask for much, do I?

699
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,850
-是的  -为什么这种事发生在我身上
- No. - Why is this happening to me?

700
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:57,840
为什么
Why?

701
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,360
我会帮你拿回钻石的
I'm gonna get your diamond back.

702
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,540
我保证
I promise.

703
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:09,010
不如我们下楼干掉那个贱人哈莉吧
Why don't we go downstairs and kill that Harley bitch?

704
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,080
出出气
Blow off a little steam.

705
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,420
我早就想干掉她了
Yeah, I have wanted to do that for quite some time.

706
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:20,310
好  我去换衣服
Okay. I'll go get changed.

707
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,080
妈的  卡珊
Shit, Cass.

708
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:45,540
不管多大的代价  我都要拿回我的钻石
I don't care what it takes, I want my diamond back.

709
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,020
我们在想办法
We're working on it.

710
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,260
我们先好好玩玩吧
Now, let's go have a little fun.

711
00:41:55,550 --> 00:42:00,330
哈琳·奎泽尔
Harleen Quinzel.

712
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,030
你好  罗米
Hiya, Romy.

713
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,240
你知道你为什么在这里吗
Do you know why you're here?

714
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,870
说到我和罗曼·赛恩尼斯
When it comes to me and Roman Sionis,

715
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:12,760
这个问题的回答有很多可能性
there are a lot of possible answers to this question.

716
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,230
打断他司机的双腿
Breaking his driver's legs.

717
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,600
有一次我念错了"意式浓缩"
There's that time I called it an "Expresso."

718
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,800
是女人这个事实就能气死这个人
Having a vagina in the first place pisses this guy off.

719
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,560
不停打断他说话  就像我现在这样
Constantly interrupting him, like I'm doing right now.

720
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,120
-你来是因为...  -天呐  别说了
- You're here because... - Oh, God, stop.

721
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,710
你要一边打开一箱子
You're gonna do that thing where you open up

722
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,350
奇怪的酷刑工具
a weird-ass case of torture devices

723
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:33,910
一边让人难以理解地细说你的宏伟计划
while inexplicably detailing your master plan

724
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,480
还有我怎么不配合你
and how I don't fit into it.

725
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,300
我正在构建一个更好的...
I'm building a better...

726
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,710
说真的  你不必这么做  真的
Seriously, you don't have to. Really!

727
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,050
你在构建一个犯罪帝国
You're building a criminal empire

728
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,520
因为老爸把你从杰纳斯集团赶出去了
because Daddy kicked you out of Janus Corp.

729
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,590
你觉得这么做是向他示威
And you think this is a big "Fuck you,"

730
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,520
但其实是为了赢回他的尊重
but in actuality it's a very misguided attempt

731
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,430
这样做反而会误入歧途
to win back his respect.

732
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:48,720
我懂  你真的没你自己想的那么复杂
I get it. You're really not as complicated as you think.

733
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,060
你也没你自己想的那么聪明
And you're really not as clever as you think,

734
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,060
-因为我现在要割开你的喉咙  -圣诞老爷
- because now I'm gonna slice your... - Oh, Jesus Christmas.

735
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,050
现在你会说你要杀了我以儆效尤
Now you're gonna say that you wanna kill me to set an example.

736
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:57,390
天呐  你太没创意了
Christ, you're boring.

737
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,150
-我要杀了你  -妈的
- I wanna kill you... - Shit.

738
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,110
因为没有了小丑罩着你
...because without the Joker around,

739
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,080
我可以杀你
I can.

740
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:10,280
就算你叽叽喳喳说个不停
For all your noise and bluster,

741
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,790
但也不过就是个傻姑娘
you're just a silly little girl

742
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,810
没人在身边保护你
with no one around to protect her.

743
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,440
-等等  -怎么
- Wait. - What?

744
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,930
-别杀我  -想得美
- Don't kill me. - Ha! Right.

745
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:24,960
不不不  说认真的  罗米  罗曼
No, no, no. Seriously. Romy, Roman.

746
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,380
别这样  我们肯定可以
Come on. There's gotta be something,

747
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,940
可以想办法解决的
something we can figure out.

748
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,030
等一下  你丢了东西对吧
Wait, wait! You lost something, right?

749
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,740
你丢了东西  我听到你说了
You lost something. I heard you say it.

750
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,790
丢了颗钻石
A diamond.

751
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,450
没错
Yeah.

752
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,470
我可以帮你找回钻石
I can help you find it.

753
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,810
说真的  看看我的口袋
Seriously. Look in my pocket.

754
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,860
另一个口袋
Other pocket.

755
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:02,840
我要自己创业了
I'm starting up my own business.

756
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,040
看到上面写什么吗  倒数第二行
See what it says? Second from the bottom.

757
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,410
没人比我对东区更了若指掌
I know the East End better than anybody.

758
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:14,990
你想把这钻石找回来吗  我在行
You want this diamond back? I'm your gal.

759
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,510
J先生有次丢了张
Mr. J once lost a rare photograph

760
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,670
埃莉诺·罗斯福的罕见裸照
of a nude Eleanor Roosevelt,

761
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:21,330
我在罗宾森公园的一个鸟巢里找到了
and I found it in a bird's nest in Robinson Park.

762
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:22,480
你要是放我走
If you let me go,

763
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:26,830
就暂时的  我会帮你把钻石拿回来
just for now, I'll get you that rock back.

764
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,160
你还能失去什么  要是你的人先找到了
What have you got to lose? If your boys find it first,

765
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,770
我发誓  你到时候杀我也不迟
swear to God, you can kill me later.

766
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:34,020
跟你拉钩  心划十字  以屁起誓
Pinky swear. Cross my heart, hope to fart.

767
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,930
你太烦人了
You're so tiresome!

768
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,900
你如果要我饶你一命
If you want my mercy,

769
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:41,780
封好你脸中央那个洞  给我听好
shut that hole in the middle of your face and listen.

770
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,130
你要去把我的钻石拿回来
You're gonna get me my diamond.

771
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:56,070
? 手上一吻或许通用 ?
? A kiss on the hand may be quite continental ?

772
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:59,600
? 但钻石才是姑娘的挚爱 ?
? But diamonds are a girl's best friend ?

773
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,290
? 一吻或许隆重 ?
? A kiss may be grand ?

774
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:07,770
? 但吻也付不了那公寓的房租 ?
? But it won't pay the rental on your humble flat ?

775
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:10,840
? 付不了快餐店的饭钱 ?
? Or help you at the automat ?

776
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,370
? 钻石 ?
? Diamonds ?

777
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,180
? 钻石 ?
? Diamonds ?

778
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,940
? 钻石 ?
? Diamonds ?

779
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:21,380
? 钻石 ?
? Diamonds ?

780
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,150
我会等着的
I will be waiting.

781
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:28,860
? 但是钻石 ?
? But diamonds ?

782
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,480
? 钻石才是姑娘的挚爱 ?
? Diamonds are a girl's best ?

783

你要在今天午夜前送来
I'll give you till midnight.

784
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,370
否则我就割下你这张漂亮的小脸蛋
And then I'm gonna peel off that pretty face

785
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:42,850
腌制保存
and pickle it.

786
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,080
懂吗
Okay?

787
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:49,550
你们可以说我老套
Call me old-fashioned,

788
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,450
但我一直以为
but I always thought the guy

789
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,610
应该是男人给姑娘钻石
was meant to get the girl a diamond.

790
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:01,670
我不会让你失望的  罗米  我保证
I won't let you down, Romy. I promise.

791
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,570
就定价五十万好了
Let's make it half a mil.

792
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,950
有人跟她竞争  这事会有趣很多
It's more fun if she's got competition.

793
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,560
给哥谭市所有雇佣兵发悬赏令
Send it to every mercenary in Gotham.

794
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:11,570
你就是那个没人想听的歌手
Hey, you're that singer no one listens to.

795
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:13,810
你就是那个没人喜欢的混球
Hey, you're the asshole no one likes.

796
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,350
老天  谁他妈给我打电话  什么事
Jesus. Who the fuck is this? What?

797
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:35,500
出事了
We've got a situation.

798
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,360
有个孩子  钻石在她手上
This kid, she's got the diamond.

799
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:38,890
她叫卡珊德拉·该隐
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

800
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,910
见鬼了
Holy fuck.

801
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,730
卡珊德拉·该隐在哪
Where can I find Cassandra Cain?

802
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:47,520
好了  讲明白了

帮我一把
A little help.

831
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,510
她就非得一直逃跑吗
Does she have to keep running?

832
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:15,480
罗曼  你个有钱的混蛋

我刚炸了谁

Do I look like I'm worth half a million dollars?

849
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,660
-不太像  -你抓错小孩了
- Not really. - You've got the wrong kid.

850
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,080

你语调中有变化
The inflection in your voice,

859
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,000
你没法跟我有视线接触
the way you can't hold eye contact,

860
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,850
你还是个肮脏的小偷
and the fact that you're a filthy little thief,

861
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:09,120
全都表明你清楚得很
all suggest that you do.

862
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,860
你可以直接给我  不然我也可以

But trust me when I say, you're not gonna like

865
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,620

what he's gonna do to ya.

866
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:19,710
快点  给我

869
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:28,070
你再说一遍
One more time.

870
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:30,630
-我没法给你  -为什么
- I can't give it to you. - Why not?

871
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:32,110
因为我吞了  行了吧
Because I ate it, okay?

872
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:40,160
很好
Yes.

873
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,340
我们在这里干什么
What are we even doing here?

874
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,670
有两种办法可以把钻石从你肚子里取出来
There are two ways that diamond's coming outta ya.

875
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:48,590
这种
This way,

876
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,240
或者这种
or this way.

877
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,270
我也觉得
That's what I thought.

878
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:57,800
再说了  我家没吃的了
Also, I'm outta groceries.

879
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,130
你当雇佣兵多久了
So, how long you been a mercenary?

880
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:05,680
你从哪里拿到
Hey, where did you get...

881
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,690
你一直忙着看我的右手
You're so busy looking at my right hand,

882
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:10,430
你想都没想过我的左手
you haven't even thought about my left.

883
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:12,250
你的左手跟我的手铐在一起
Your left hand is cuffed to mine.

884
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,770
我得学学这招
I'll have to learn that one.

885
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:21,170
我们能买这个吗
Can we get this?

886
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,960
你没打算逃跑吧
You're not gonna try to run, are you?

887

听好  要是我真的值五十万
Look, if there's really a half mil on my head,

00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:27,420
我觉得我最好还是
I figure I'm better off with

889
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,810
跟不会把我开膛破肚的人待在一起
the person who's not gonna cut me open.

890
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:33,180
行吧  但你要是想跑  我会杀了你的
Fine. But if you try to run, I will kill you.

891
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,920
我才不在乎你是不是孩子
I do not care that you're a kid.

892
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:38,890
我看见了
I saw that.

893
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:43,110
不过说真的  你怎么取得现在的成就的

Being a pickpocket's fine and all, but I got real potential.

899
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,490
我要怎么变得跟你一样
I mean, how do I be like you?

900

疯狂的部分不用  其他的教教我

第一  没人跟我一样
Number one, no one is like me.

902
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,750
哪怕只是跟我接近
If you wanted to even come close,

903

把你的裙子脱了

站起来  给她割开裙子

1054
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:01,920
很好  你拿到了
Good. You got it.

1055
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,590
你追踪短信了吗
Did you trace the messages?

1056
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:05,920
你从犯罪现场偷证据
You stole evidence from an active crime scene,

1057
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,000
然后寄到我的办公室

1058
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:10,260
芮妮  你在想什么
Renee, what were you thinking?

1059
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:13,250
悬赏那个孩子的人是罗曼
Roman is the one that put a price on the kid's head.

1060
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:14,940
好吧  我必须这么做
Okay? I had to.

1061
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:15,850
我现在没空解释...
I can't get into it right now...

1062
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:18,100
芮妮  你需要帮助
Renee, you need help.

1063
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,750
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

1064
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:22,100
她说得对
She's right.

1065
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:26,330
你是个好警察  蒙托亚  但你迷失了方向
You are a good cop, Montoya, but you've lost your way.

1066
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,600
什么
What?

1067
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:30,650
对不起  好吧
I'm sorry. Okay?

1068
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:32,260
你让我别无选择
You gave me no choice.

1069
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:34,630
-你出卖了我  -对不起
- Did you sell me out? - I'm sorry.

1070
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:36,580
你被停职了
You're suspended.

1071
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,660
把你的警徽和枪交出来
Your badge and your gun, now.

1072
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:47,270
如果你看过什么警匪片的话
If you've ever watched any cop movie ever,

1073
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:50,040
就会明白现在开始才是关键
you know that this is when shit gets real.

1074
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,110
警察什么都不在乎
What's the point of the badge,

1075
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,580
还要警徽干什么
when it means fuck all anyway?

1076
01:07:57,810 --> 01:07:59,250
对吧  警长
Right, Captain?

1077
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,410
警察都是在被停职后
No cop ever gets anything done

1078
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:04,090
才有所作为的
until after they've been suspended.

1079
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:07,980
本来我应该担心的
Which would've had me worried,

1080
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:10,740
但我还有更急迫的事
only I had more pressing concerns.

1081
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,640
所以你永远都不应该
And that is why you should never partake

1082
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,640
缴纳联邦所得税
in paying federal income taxes.

1083
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:17,070
你会碰到指甲油的
You'll ruin your nails.

1084
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:21,300
谢谢
Thank you.

1085
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:23,910

01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:27,860
你说他们找不到我们的
You said they wouldn't find us.

1088
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:30,870
冷静  没人知道我们在这
Chillax. No one knows we're here.

1089
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,670
哈琳·奎泽尔  我是哥谭警察
Harleen Quinzel, this is Gotham Police.

1090
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:35,640
好吧  他们知道
Okay. So they know.

1091
01:08:35,890 --> 01:08:37,150

1094

1095
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:46,530
我听到你在里面  开门
I can hear you! Open the door.

1096
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,680
那是什么
What is that?

1097
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:51,640
地狱里见吧  哈莉
See you in hell, Harley!

1098
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:56,410
到桌子下面去
Get under the table!

1099
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:00,170
布鲁斯  布鲁斯
Bruce? Bruce!

1100
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,710
过来  别
Come here! No!

1101
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:13,070
布鲁斯
Bruce?

1102
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,480
过来  布鲁斯
Come here, boy. Bruce?

1103
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:21,530
布鲁斯
Bruce?

1104
01:09:22,730 --> 01:09:24,110
布鲁斯
Bruce?

1105
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,470
说不通啊
This doesn't make sense.

1106
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:30,330
没道理  我不明白
It doesn't make sense. I don't understand.

1107
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:32,290
没人知道我们在这
No one knew we were here.

1108
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,370
没人知道我们在这  除了...
No one knew we were here, except...

1109
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,170
医生
Doc.

1110
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:38,010
我的天  医生
My God. Doc?

1111
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:41,490
医生  他在哪
Doc? Where is he?

1112
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:44,130
医生
Doc?

1113
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:48,350
我找不到布鲁斯  我找不到它  我...
I can't find Bruce. I can't find him. I...

1114
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:56,020
不
No.

1115
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,600
对不起  莲花
I'm sorry, lotus flower.

1116
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,390
你出卖了我
You sold me out?

1117
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:03,940
太多人给我开出了太高的价
Too many people offering me too much money.

1118
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:08,110
我现在都有钱再开一家新的餐馆了
I have enough now to open up a new restaurant.

1119
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:09,730
一家好餐馆
A really nice one.

1120
01:10:09,730 --> 01:10:11,410
但是  医生
But, Doc,

1121
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,480
是我啊
it's me.

1122
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,810
都是生意而已
It's just business.

1123
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,210
接来下的事并不美好
This next bit ain't very pretty.

1124
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,140
-你说得对  -哈莉
- You're right. - Harley?

1125
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,190
他说得对
He's right.

1126
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,190
生意就是生意
Business is business.

1127
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:57,490
小鬼在我手上
I've got the kid.

1128
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:01,290
但我需要重新商讨我们的条件
But I'm gonna need to renegotiate the terms of our deal.

1129
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:03,250
我把她交给你后
If I hand her over,

1130
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,680
所有追杀我的人都要收手
I want everyone who's after me to back off.

1131
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:09,010
奎茵  立刻把钻石交给我
Quinn, bring me the rock now

1132
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:11,190
我就保证你的安全
and I guarantee your safety.

1133
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:14,530
这城里我说了算  我会保护你的
I own this town. You'll have my protection.

1134
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:16,070
好吧
Fine.

1135
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:20,680
一小时后在娱乐街陷阱奇幻屋见面
Meet me at Amusement Mile. The Booby Trap. In one hour.

1136
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:31,760
别评头论足了
Quit judging.

1137
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,230
扎斯
Zsasz!

1138
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,120
来吧  小鬼
Come on, kid.

1139
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:46,220
我给你找个安全地方
Let's get you somewhere safe.

1140
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:48,100
找到她们了
We got them.

1141
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,170
小鸟
Little bird!

1142
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:56,420
你今晚要替扎斯先生开车
You're gonna be driving Mr. Zsasz tonight.

1143
01:11:56,940 --> 01:12:01,230
去娱乐街陷阱奇幻屋
Go. Fetch. Amusement Mile. The Booby Trap.

1144
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:03,080
一定要留活口吗
Do we have to bring them back?

1145
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,970
我觉得你对付得了两个小姑娘
I think you can manage a couple of little girls.

1146
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,390
把钻石带回来就行
Just bring me back my diamond.

1147
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,900
怎么了
What is it?

1148
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:00,880
没什么
Nothing.

1149
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:15,190
靠边停车
Pull over.

1150
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:16,590
什么
What?

1151
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,240
立刻给我停车
Pull the fucking car over now.

1152
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:23,520
我要上厕所
I gotta take a leak.

1153
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:29,950
她背叛了你  老大  她背叛了你
She betrayed you, boss. She betrayed you.

1154
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:31,380
你确定
Are you sure?

1155
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:33,750
你的小鸟是个该死内鬼
Your little bird's a fucking rat.

1156
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:42,930
你想让我杀了她吗
You want me to kill her?

1157
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:47,770
不
No.

1158
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:49,910
不  不
No. No.

1159
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,610
我去找你
I'll come to you.

1160
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:30,380
我以为我们是朋友  而你...
I thought we were friends. And you...

1161
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:31,880
你也看到那么多人追杀我了
You saw what it's like for me out there.

1162
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,610
我别无选择
I didn't have a choice.

1163
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:37,060
如果你在他来之前拉出来  那就万事大吉了
And if you go before he gets here, everything will be fine.

1164
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:40,310
哈莉
Harley.

1165
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:43,510
对不起  小鬼  真心的
I'm sorry, kid. I am.

1166
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:55,140
好快
That was fast.

1167
01:14:57,990 --> 01:14:59,470
她在...
She's in...

1168
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,170
卡珊德拉·该隐在哪
Where's Cassandra Cain?

1169
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:03,800
又是你
You? Again?

1170
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:13,920
你喝多了
Are you drunk?

1171
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,270
来
Come on.

1172
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:17,330
好
Okay.

1173
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:40,950
正中胸部
Right in the tit.

1174
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,820
卡珊德拉·该隐在哪
Where's Cassandra Cain?

1175
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:50,580
卡珊
Cass.

1176
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:00,770
你毁了我的三明治
You killed my sandwich!

1177
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:08,860
再见  小鸟
Bye-bye, birdie.

1178
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:14,800
不公平
No fair.

1179
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,600
那真有必要吗
Was that really necessary?

1180
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,880
你没有我了解她
You don't know her like I do.

1181
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:20,620
卡珊
Cass?

1182
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:25,790
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

1183
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,120
我带你离开这里
I'm gonna get you outta here.

1184
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:31,310
她真把你捆在马桶上了
Did she really tape you to a damn toilet?

1185
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:35,350
真好
This is nice.

1186
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:37,920
你还清醒
You're still conscious.

1187
01:16:40,270 --> 01:16:41,660
你还有知觉
You can still feel?

1188
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:45,150
看着我  这下你是个好姑娘了吗
Look at me. Are you a good girl, now?

1189
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:50,650
"我是个好姑娘  我是个好姑娘"
"I'm a good girl. I'm a good girl."

1190
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,190
每次我亲手
I got one

1191
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:05,520
送一只小鸟离开这个世界
for all the little birds

1192
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,880
我都文一个文身
I helped fly away from this world.

1193
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:12,160
我给你留了个特别位置
I'm saving a special spot for you.

1194
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,590
就在这里
Right here.

1195
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:21,480
你得安静点
You're gonna have to be quiet.

1196
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:23,820
你们在做什么
What are you guys doing?

1197
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:30,380
我知道钻石在哪里了
I know where the diamond is.

1198
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:33,620
还在你体内吗
Is that rock still inside you?

1199
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,270
老天
Oh, God.

1200
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:42,680
停下
Stop.

1201
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:46,430
搞什么  扎斯
The hell, Zsasz?

1202
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:48,170
把她开膛破肚
Cut her open.

1203
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:49,490
别胡闹了
Stop fucking around.

1204
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:51,080
你听见了
You heard me.

1205
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:53,060
把她开膛破肚
Cut her fucking open.

1206
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:56,370
不  等等  她只是个孩子
Okay. No, no. No, no, no. See, she's just a kid.

1207
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:58,940
你是个肮脏的内鬼
You're a filthy fucking rat.

1208
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:00,090
我是内鬼
I'm a rat?

1209
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:03,940
我早知道你不可信任  罗曼的小鸟
I knew you couldn't be trusted. Roman's little bird.

1210
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:06,280
你这该死的小鸟
You little fucking bird.

1211
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,430
所以他才需要我替他留神
That's why he needs me to look out for him.

1212
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:14,230
所以他才需要我照顾
That's why he needs me to take care of him.

1213
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:18,770
你知道你只是太多疑了  扎斯
You know you're just being paranoid, Zsasz.

1214
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:20,490
是吗
Yeah?

1215
01:18:20,490 --> 01:18:22,020
向我证明
Prove it to me.

1216
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:25,280
把她的小肚子剖开
Rip open her little tummy.

1217
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,600
这不可能
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

1218
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,320
马上动手  把她开膛
Now! Rip it open!

1219
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:44,940
你这渣滓
You piece of shit!

1220
01:18:53,410 --> 01:18:54,890
不许动
Freeze!

1221
01:18:58,230 --> 01:18:59,840
谁也不许动
Don't fucking move.

1222
01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:03,740
你他妈是谁
Who the fuck are you?

1223
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:12,420
去把那小鬼带来
Go get the kid.

1224
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:13,390
好
All right.

1225
01:19:13,390 --> 01:19:15,520
退后
Back the fuck up!

1226
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,140
-离我远点  你们全都是  -把那玩意放下来
- Get away from me. All of you. - Put that shit down.

1227
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:20,260
冲他们开枪  小鬼
Shoot them, kid.

1228
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:24,520
你  把那愚蠢的罗宾汉玩意放下
You, put that stupid-ass Robin Hood piece of shit down!

1229
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:27,080
-卡珊  没事的  冷静...  -别动
- Cass, it's okay. Just calm... - Don't move!

1230
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,440
好
Okay.

1231
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:31,400
我不知道这是怎么回事
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

1232
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,530
但我知道这个人渣
But I know that this shit stick...

1233
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:36,570
刚刚想把我开膛
just tried to gut me.

1234
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:38,930
而你
And you.

1235
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:42,450
我还以为你不一样
Thought you were different.

1236
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:46,980
对不起  小鬼
I'm sorry, kid.

1237
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,990
看来我就是个坏人
I'm just a terrible person, I guess.

1238
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:01,920
我重振旗鼓了
Ooh, I'm back.

1239
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,730
我感觉我刚刚闯入了
Okay, I feel like I've just walked in on

1240
01:20:03,730 --> 01:20:05,380
我完全不关心的局面
something I don't give two shits about.

1241
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:07,600
那家伙死了  所以我要走了  行吗
This guy's dead, so I'm just gonna get outta your hair. Cool?

1242
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,830
不  等等  她撒谎  她是赛恩尼斯的手下
No. Wait. She's lying. She works for Sionis.

1243
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:13,130
什么  我是赛恩尼斯的手下
Excuse me? I work for Sionis?

1244
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:17,170
我不会让你把那小鬼卖给他的
I'm not letting you sell the kid to him.

1245
01:20:17,170 --> 01:20:18,710
我不是要把那小鬼卖给他
I wasn't going to sell the kid.

1246
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:20,340
我是要用那小鬼做交易
I was going to trade the kid.

1247
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:22,300
对  好保住你自己  对吗
Yeah. To save your own stupid skin. Huh?

1248
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:23,260
我自己也不觉得光荣
I'm not proud of what I did,

1249
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:25,220
但半个城市都在追杀我
but I had half the city after me.

1250
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:27,210
包括该死的十字弓杀手
Even the fucking Crossbow Killer.

1251
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:29,110
我不是十字弓杀手
I'm not the Crossbow Killer!

1252
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:33,020
他们叫我...
They call me...

1253
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:34,680
海伦娜·贝尔蒂内利
Helena Bertinelli.

1254
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,700
该死的
For fuck's sake.

1255
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:38,060
贝尔蒂内利灭门案那个吗
As in the Bertinelli massacre?

1256
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:42,100
妈呀  了不得的童年阴影
Sheesh kebab. That is childhood trauma, right there.

1257
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:49,480
我杀了加兰特
I killed Galante.

1258
01:20:53,470 --> 01:20:55,540
我杀了他的行刑队
I killed his firing squad.

1259
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,880
我杀了维克多·扎斯
I killed Victor Zsasz.

1260
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:09,670
现在我完事了
And now I'm done.

1261
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:12,990
干得好
Bravo.

1262
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:19,340
你们不介意的话  我要走了
So if you don't mind, I'm gonna leave now.

1263
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:23,980
我真不想告诉你残忍的真相  甜心
I hate to be the one to break it to you, sweetheart,

1264
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:25,630
但你的事情还没完
but you are not done.

1265
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:28,830
你觉得是谁资助了加兰特夺权行动
Who do you think funded galante's little power grab, huh?

1266
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:30,580
加兰特是和塞恩尼斯合作
Galante was working with Sionis.

1267
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:33,000
罗曼杀了你全家就为了找那颗钻石
Roman killed your whole family looking for that rock.

1268
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,270
你觉得他不会杀了这小鬼
You don't think he's gonna kill this kid?

1269
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:39,180
那颗钻石是我们阻止他的唯一机会
That diamond is our only chance of stopping him.

1270
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:42,230
伙计们  你们得看看这个
You guys. Hey, I think you should see this.

1271
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,330
是赛恩尼斯
It's Sionis.

1272
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:01,750
我们倒大霉了
We're fucked.

1273
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:04,110
他带了支军队来
He bought himself an army.

1274
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,660
他们都是冲我来的
They're all here for me.

1275
01:22:16,370 --> 01:22:17,830
是不是
Aren't they?

1276
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:26,340
-不是  -不是吗
- No. - They're not?

1277
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:28,050
不是  他们不是冲你来的
No, they're not.

1278
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:29,540
你们知道那是什么意思吗
Do you know what that means?

1279
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:31,710
意思是他不仅仅为那小鬼而来
That means he's not just after the kid anymore.

1280
01:22:31,710 --> 01:22:33,350
他是为我们所有人而来
He's after all of us.

1281
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:35,930
他当然是冲我来的  我抢了他的东西
He's sure as hell after me. I just robbed him.

1282
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:39,310
你背叛了他  你杀了他的好伙计
You just betrayed him. You just killed his BFF.

1283
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:42,560
而你傻到要对他立案侦查
And you're dumb enough to be building a case against him.

1284
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:46,050
除非我们都想要惨死
So, unless we all wanna die very unpleasant deaths

1285
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:49,450
然后让罗曼搜索这小鬼的肠子
and let Roman go finger-fishing in the kid's intestinal tract,

1286
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:52,350
不然我们就得合作
we're gonna have to work together.

1287
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:54,630
和你
With you?

1288
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:55,960
对
Yeah.

1289
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,120
我们得合作
We're gonna work together,

1290
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,180
我们要从这里全身而退  行吗
and we'll get outta here in one piece, okay?

1291
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:04,660
行
Okay.

1292
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:07,490
好吧  可以
Yeah. Okay.

1293
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:11,830
行吧
Sure.

1294
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:13,230
好
Yes!

1295
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:16,070
但我们需要一些厉害武器
But we are gonna need some serious hardware.

1296
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:23,270
这些可以吗
Will this do?

1297
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,120
不可以
No.

1298
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:27,830
完全不可以
Not at all.

1299
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:31,910
我们死定了  我们都死定了
We're dead. We're fucking dead.

1300
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:34,910
那个讨厌的混球  他居然全拿走了
That slimy jizznozzle! I can't believe he took it all!

1301
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:35,660
我们完了
We're fucked.

1302
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:38,860
-见鬼  -来看看这些
- Fuck! - Uh, there's this.

1303
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:46,100
好
Okay.

1304
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:02,290
朋友们  兄弟们  哥谭市的男人们
Friends, brothers, men of Gotham.

1305
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:07,210
我资助你们  我保护你们
I have funded you. I've protected you.

1306
01:24:07,790 --> 01:24:11,010
我给你们擦屁股  让你们免受牢狱之灾
I've scratched your backs and kept you outta jail.

1307
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:14,210
现在是时候回报我了
Well, now it's time to say thank you.

1308
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:18,490
给那些小婊子们点厉害
Go show those little bitches

1309
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:21,450
让她们知道不能招惹罗曼·塞恩尼斯
you don't mess with Roman Sionis.

1310
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,380
活捉那个女孩  赏金五十万
Half a mil to whoever brings me the girl alive.

1311
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:27,910
其他随便杀
The rest you can kill.

1312
01:24:33,470 --> 01:24:34,530
牛逼
Dope.

1313
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:38,260
不不不  这件不行
Oh, no, no, no. Not that one.

1314
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:40,430
有纪念意义  试试这件
Sentimental value. Try this.

1315
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:43,310
你开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

1316
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:45,190
什么  把两姐妹撑起来
What? Gotta take care of the girls.

1317
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:47,370
这不好玩吗  就像睡衣派对一样
Isn't this fun? It's just like a sleepover.

1318
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:50,000
我们应该叫披萨  调酒
We should order pizza. Make cosmos.

1319
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,180
-哈莉  专心点  -好
- Harley, focus. - Okay. Yeah.

1320
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:54,820
不错啊  你这套弓箭
Hey, nice. What the hell is up

1321
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:55,940
有什么说法吗
with this bow and arrow shtick?

1322
01:24:55,950 --> 01:24:57,480
这不是弓箭
It's not a fucking bow and arrow.

1323
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,540
这是十字弓  我不是十二岁
It's a crossbow. I'm not 12.

1324
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:00,910
我喜欢这姑娘  她好暴躁
I love this chick. She's got rage issues.

1325
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:02,670
我才不暴躁
I don't have rage issues.

1326
01:25:02,670 --> 01:25:05,360
心理学上认为
You know, psychologically speaking,

1327
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,090
复仇很少能带来我们想要的宣泄
vengeance rarely brings the catharsis we hope for.

1328
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:08,930
是
Yeah.

1329
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:12,200
准备好了吗  坏蛋们就在外面
Are we ready? Bad guys, just outside.

1330
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:17,850
见鬼  蹲下
Shit. Get down.

1331
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:20,470
从这里下去
Down here!

1332
01:25:22,930 --> 01:25:23,520

1336
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,030
怎么
What?

1337
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,380
你太酷了
You are so cool.

1338
01:25:57,690 --> 01:25:59,050

Okay. This way.

1339

准备好  女士们
Get ready, ladies.

1340
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:21,920
别担心  你能撑过去的
Don't worry. You're gonna make it.

1341
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:23,160
-知道吗  -好
- Okay? - Okay.

1342
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:25,750
什么鬼  快走  快走
What the... Go! Go, go, go!

1343
01:26:26,530 --> 01:26:27,380

Fuck.

1344
01:26:29,870 --> 01:26:30,820
该死
Shit.

1345
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:42,390
该死
Shit!

1346
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:03,170
混蛋
Motherfucker.

1347
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:17,830
放开我
Let me go!

1348
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:19,500
抓到你了
Gotcha.

1349
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,060
这边
This way!

1350
01:27:22,190 --> 01:27:23,940
快来  没事的  过来
Come on. Come on. It's okay. Come on.

1351
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:25,470
你不该看到这个
You shouldn't have to see this.

1352
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:27,720
给  帮我保管这个  好吗
Here, hold on to this for me, okay?

1353
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:28,590
只需要想着这个
That's all you think about.

1354
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:30,960
闭上眼睛  紧紧握住  知道吗
Just close your eyes and hold it tight. Okay?

1355
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,130
趴下  快  你会安全的
Here. Get down. Come on. You'll be safe.

1356
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:17,410
金丝雀
Canary!

1357
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:19,690
你还好吗
You okay?

1358
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:22,190
我们得走这边
We gotta go this way!

1359
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:25,980
还来
More?

1360
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,310
她怎么还有时间换鞋
When the fuck did she have time to do a shoe change?

1361
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:29,320
快走
Come on.

1362
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:37,240

蹲下
Get down!

01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,310
拜托  不要了
Please, no more.

1371
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:49,020
原谅我了吗
So, forgive me yet?

1372
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:50,330
别碰我
Get off me.

1373
01:29:54,970 --> 01:29:57,550
还有谁饿了  我知道一个卖玉米卷的好地方
Anyone else hungry? I know a great taco spot.

1374
01:29:57,550 --> 01:29:58,930
-我快饿死了  -我喜欢玉米卷
- I'm starving. - I love tacos.

1375
01:29:58,940 --> 01:29:59,720

1378
01:30:11,890 --> 01:30:14,340
呼吸  保持呼吸  让我看看
Just breathe. Just breathe. Let me check it.

Aren't you glad you wore that? Sexy and bulletproof.

1382
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:26,890

-一颗子弹  -救救我
- One bullet? - Please help me!

1387
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,270
谁还有子弹吗
Has anyone got any bullets?

1388
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:38,540
该死  我没了
Fuck. I'm out.

1389
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,540
我出不去  我需要穿过去
I can't get out there. I just need to get through.

1390
01:30:43,090 --> 01:30:44,870
-我们必须走  必须行动  -该死
- We gotta go. We gotta move. - Shit.

1391
01:30:44,870 --> 01:30:47,020
各位  他们上车了
Guys, they're in the car.

1392
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:48,180
他们要走了
They're getting away.

1393
01:30:48,570 --> 01:30:50,210
-进去  -放开我
- Get in there! - Get off!

1394
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,490
该死  我没箭了
Shit! I'm out.

1395
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:56,610
快想办法  他们包围过来了
Guys, come on. They're closing in.

1396
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,410
金丝雀  你知道你必须做什么
Canary, you know what you have to do!

1397
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,870
捂上耳朵  你最好把她带回来
Cover your ears! You better get her back.

1398
01:31:24,210 --> 01:31:26,150
我就说她有迷死人的嗓音
Told ya she had a killer voice.

1399
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:48,710
需要带你一程吗
Need a ride?

1400
01:32:14,690 --> 01:32:15,490
打她
Get her!

1401
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:00,510
给我借点力
Whip me!

1402
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:01,370
什么
What?

1403
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:03,420
-给我借点力  -好
- Whip me! - Okay.

1404
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,850
小鬼
Kid!

1405
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:13,790
哈莉
Harley!

1406
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:16,160
开枪
Shoot her!

1407
01:33:24,490 --> 01:33:25,340
哈莉
Harley!

1408
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:27,210
踩刹车
Hit the brakes!

1409
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:47,860
不
No!

1410
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:30,640
小鬼
Kid!

1411
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:44,400
哈莉
Harley!

1412
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:06,380
我们都喜欢戏剧性  不是吗
Well, we always did share a love of the dramatic. Didn't we?

1413
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:10,040
瞧瞧我们现在
And look at us now.

1414
01:35:11,890 --> 01:35:14,680
你不明白吗  你想杀了我
But don't you see? You're trying to kill me.

1415
01:35:14,690 --> 01:35:16,860
而我是唯一能保护你的人
I'm the only one who can protect you!

1416
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:22,470
你明知靠自己活不了  奎茵
You know you can't stand on your own, Quinn.

1417
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:24,140
你不是那种人
You're not the type!

1418
01:35:25,050 --> 01:35:27,910
可我呢  你需要我
But me? You need me!

1419
01:35:42,410 --> 01:35:45,640
罗米宝贝  问题是
Here's the thing, Romy baby.

1420
01:35:47,570 --> 01:35:51,360
你的保护是基于人们害怕你
Your protection is based on the fact that people are scared of you.

1421
01:35:51,790 --> 01:35:53,910
就像他们害怕J先生
Just like they're scared of Mr. J.

1422
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:01,920
但他们应该怕的是我
But I'm the one they should be scared of.

1423
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:04,950
不是你  不是J先生
Not you, and not Mr. J.

1424
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:07,620
因为我是牛炸天的哈莉·奎茵
'Cause I'm Harley fucking Quinn.

1425
01:36:15,370 --> 01:36:16,720
该死
Shit.

1426
01:36:18,150 --> 01:36:20,180
真是太尴尬了
That was super embarrassing.

1427
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:21,530
确实是
Sure was.

1428
01:36:21,530 --> 01:36:25,750
你以为你能打败我  你真是白痴
You think you can beat me? You're a fucking moron.

1429
01:36:27,050 --> 01:36:28,640
对不起  小鬼
I'm sorry, kid.

1430
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:30,860
抱歉我曾想把你卖了
And I'm sorry I tried to sell you.

1431
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:32,690
那挺混蛋的
That was a dick move.

1432
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:35,730
无论如何
For what it's worth,

1433
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:40,530
你让我想成为一个不那坏的人
you made me want to be a less terrible person.

1434
01:36:42,850 --> 01:36:46,250
如果我们要相互道歉  我也该告诉你件事
If we're apologizing for shit, I should tell you something.

1435
01:36:46,250 --> 01:36:47,790
谁让你说话了
Excuse me!

1436
01:36:47,790 --> 01:36:49,920
我偷了你的东西
I stole something from you.

1437
01:36:50,210 --> 01:36:52,570
你个手脚不干净的小坏蛋
You slippery-fingered little turd.

1438
01:36:52,570 --> 01:36:54,040
我偷了你的戒指
I took your ring.

1439
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:54,890
戒指
My ring?

1440
01:36:58,500 --> 01:36:59,460
牛逼
Dope.

1441
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:20,960
卡珊  哈莉
Cass! Harley!

1442
01:37:21,130 --> 01:37:22,290
我们没事
We're okay.

1443
01:37:26,170 --> 01:37:28,190
-你没事吧  -没事
- You okay? - Yeah.

1444
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:30,550
-他死了  -是的
- He's gone? - Mmm-hmm.

1445
01:37:30,550 --> 01:37:32,690
很好  去他的
Good. Fuck that guy.

1446
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:34,860
没错  吃玉米卷吗
Yeah. Tacos?

1447
01:37:35,890 --> 01:37:37,010
不  说真的
No, but seriously.

1448
01:37:37,010 --> 01:37:39,150
你用弓箭帅爆了
You were very impressive with that bow.

1449
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:40,250
非常帅
Very impressive.

1450
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:41,440
是十字弓
It's a crossbow.

1451
01:37:41,530 --> 01:37:42,570
非常感谢
I appreciate that. Thank you.

1452
01:37:42,570 --> 01:37:43,840
晨起鸡尾酒
Morning margaritas!

1453
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,080
谢谢  我来拿
Thank you. I got you.

1454
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:46,940
-你喝酒吧  小鬼  -喝
- You drink, right, kid? - Yeah.

1455
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:48,090
不许
I don't think so.

1456
01:37:48,150 --> 01:37:50,470
我喜欢那个名字  女猎人
And I love that fucking name, Huntress.

1457
01:37:50,470 --> 01:37:51,800
-真的吗  -当然
- Really? - Yeah.

1458
01:37:51,810 --> 01:37:53,040
非常好的名字
Great name.

1459
01:37:55,310 --> 01:37:59,790
我喜欢你穿着紧身裤还能踢那么高
I really like how you were able to kick so high in those tight pants.

1460
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:01,090
-没错  超酷  -是的
- Yeah, that is cool. - Yeah.

1461
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:02,000
谢谢
Thanks.

1462
01:38:02,930 --> 01:38:05,590
多谢你的车
Thanks for the car.

1463
01:38:06,930 --> 01:38:07,880
不客气
You're welcome.

1464
01:38:08,740 --> 01:38:10,900
小鬼  如果那玉米卷饼不能让你拉屎
Kid, if that burrito doesn't make you shit,

1465
01:38:10,910 --> 01:38:12,290
我真不知道还有什么能
I don't know what will.

1466
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:15,860
等我一下
Give me a minute.

1467
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:18,710
棒
Yes!

1468
01:38:18,930 --> 01:38:20,060
对头
Right.

1469
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:24,250
我让她试了西梅汁  泻药
I've given her prune juice, laxatives.

1470
01:38:24,250 --> 01:38:26,260
那小鬼的肠胃简直是钢铸的
I mean, the kid's got a stomach made of steel.

1471
01:38:26,260 --> 01:38:28,820
知道吗  我欠你一声抱歉
And you know what? I owe you an apology.

1472
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:30,230
我吗
Me?

1473
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:34,140
我低估了你  对不起
I underestimated you. And I'm sorry.

1474
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:36,810
我习惯了
I'm used to it.

1475
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:41,210
哈莉  把滤网拿来
Harley! Bring the colander.

1476
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:43,590
女士们  我去了
Ladies.

1477
01:38:43,770 --> 01:38:45,220
祝你过滤开心
Have fun with that.

1478
01:38:46,910 --> 01:38:49,220
现在怎么办
So, what now?

1479
01:38:49,430 --> 01:38:51,670
赛恩尼斯不在了  但迟早
Sionis is gone, but it's just a matter of time

1480
01:38:51,670 --> 01:38:54,630
会有别的混蛋企图完成他开启的恶事
before some other asshole tries to finish what he started.

1481
01:38:54,630 --> 01:38:55,520
没错
Right.

1482
01:38:55,660 --> 01:38:59,090
我们必须把城市从内到外清洗干净
We gotta clean this city from the inside out.

1483
01:38:59,470 --> 01:39:02,100
她总是说话像八十年代电影里的警察吗
Does she always talk like the cop in a bad '80s movie,

1484
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:03,030
只有我这么觉得吗
or is that just me?

1485
01:39:03,030 --> 01:39:04,470
去你的  去你的
Fuck you. And fuck you.

1486
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:05,330
怎么
What?

1487
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:07,700
我们这次干得特别棒
I mean, we were amazing there.

1488
01:39:07,710 --> 01:39:09,590
没错  绝对的
Yeah! Hell yeah!

1489
01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:12,780
我十分认同  所以我也来一下
I agree completely. So I'll do that, as well.

1490
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:13,820
谢谢
Thank you.

1491
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:15,010
好的
Right.

1492
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:20,060
她偷了我的车
She stole my fucking car!

1493
01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:21,020
什么
What?

1494
01:39:25,780 --> 01:39:26,280
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1495
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:27,680
我知道你们在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

1496
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:30,170
你们在想我归根结底还是混蛋
You think I'm a dick after all that.

1497
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:34,020
但你们听到那警察怎么说了  赛恩尼斯不在了
But you heard what the cop said. Sionis is gone.

1498
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:38,660
那几个人  她们会没事的
And those guys? They're gonna be just fine.

1499
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:43,120
蒙托亚的老大去陷阱奇幻屋把混混们逮捕了
Montoya's boss picked up the gangbangers at the Booby Trap.

1500
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:47,460
而且又一次把功劳都揽到自己身上
And took all the credit while he was at it. Again.

1501
01:39:53,550 --> 01:39:55,660
这致命一击让她明白
It was the kick in the balls she needed to see that

1502
01:39:55,660 --> 01:39:58,860
她无需向那些吹牛的混蛋证明自己
she had nothing to prove to those blowhard assholes.

1503
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,070
她当天就辞职了
She quit the same day.

1504
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:08,830
我们读取了钻石上的秘密银行代码
We got the secret bank codes off the diamond.

1505
01:40:08,830 --> 01:40:10,940
女猎人拿回了家族的钱
And Huntress got her family money back.

1506
01:40:12,510 --> 01:40:15,750
她用那笔钱资助了一个打击犯罪的小队
She's using it to fund a little crime-fighting outfit.

1507
01:40:18,350 --> 01:40:21,930
她们自称猛禽小队
They call themselves the Birds of Prey.

1508
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:25,090
我称她们为傻傻善心人
I call them dorky little do-gooders.

1509
01:40:28,190 --> 01:40:31,080
钻石本身值一大笔钱
The rock itself was worth a chunk of change,

1510
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:32,250
所以我当掉了
so I pawned it.

1511
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:36,380
我用这笔钱创办了一个在东区兴风作浪的小公司
And I invested the cash in a little startup making waves in the East End.

1512
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:42,180
我还找回了布鲁斯
And I found Bruce.

1513
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:44,570
它在唐人街流浪
He was wandering around Chinatown.

1514
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:48,650
我想这证明了鬣狗确实有九条命
I guess it proves the theory that hyenas really do have nine lives.

1515
01:41:08,850 --> 01:41:12,170
没错啦  我让小鬼当了我的学徒
Yeah, yeah. I made the kid my apprentice.

1516
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,190
随你们说我心软
Call me a softy.

1517
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:16,620
你们敢吗
I dare ya.

1518
01:48:40,820 --> 01:48:43,160
你们这些傻瓜还在看吗
Are you dummies still sitting there?

1519
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:45,400
好吧  既然你们坚持了这么久
Fine. Since you stuck it out this long,

1520
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:47,680
我告诉你们一个超级大秘密
I'll tell you a super-duper secret secret.

1521
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:49,300
但你们不能告诉别人
But you can't tell anyone.

1522
01:48:49,380 --> 01:48:52,090
你们知道蝙蝠侠...
Okay. Did you know that Batman...
