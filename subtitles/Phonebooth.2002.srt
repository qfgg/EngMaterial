-All right, no harm being gracious. -Yeah.

122
00:08:26,945 --> 00:08:29,406
好了  事实上最好的方法是 你亲自把它送过去
Okay. Actually, better off, deliver it over yourself.

123
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:31,575
-你就会有机会多认识一些人 -我会亲自送过去的
-Get to know the players. -I'll do that.

124
00:08:31,658 --> 00:08:33,076
谢谢你愿意花时间教我
Thank you for teaching me.

125
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,121
-亚当  你没有西装吗? -我真的没有
-And, Adam, don't you have a suit?. -Actually, no.

126
00:08:36,204 --> 00:08:38,206
拿去吧  去买套西装
Here. Get yourself one.

127
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:41,418
-我很快就会开始付你薪水 -那真的是太棒了
-I'm gonna start paying you soon. -Yeah, I hope so.

128
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,504
-有一大堆找你的留言 -我开会要来不及了  先搁着吧
-You got a bunch of messages. -I'm late for a meeting. Hold them.

129
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:45,714
-好的 -就这样
-All right. -All right.

130
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,509
-再见  史都 -再见  亚当
-See you, Stu! -See you, Adam!

131
00:08:49,593 --> 00:08:51,136
城市饭店

132
00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:20,748
-对不起 -我正在打电话
-Excuse me. -I'm trying to make a call here.

133
00:09:20,874 --> 00:09:24,252
你的披萨来了  一半腊肠 一半蘑菇的特脆口味
This is for you. Half-pepperoni, half-mushroom, extra crisp.

134
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:26,880
你听说过有人会把披萨 外送到电话亭吗?
You ever heard of delivering a pizza to a phone booth?.

135
00:09:26,921 --> 00:09:28,423
我没听过这种事
I don't think so.

136
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:32,677
把披萨送给在百老汇跟八街路口 的五十三街电话亭里打电话的男士
Gentleman occupying phone booth, 53rd, between Broadway and 8th.

137
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:35,138
你弄错了
It's a mistake.

138
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,391
你要我怎么处理这个披萨? 钱都已经付了
What am I supposed to do with the pie?. It's all paid for.

139
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:40,518
在街角那边 有一个流浪汉
There's a homeless guy around the block.

140
00:09:40,643 --> 00:09:42,300
把披萨送给他并告诉他
Give him the pizza and say

141
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,522
"你可以离开  但这披萨跟定你了"
"You can turn away, but you can't make it go away."

142
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:47,650
他会以为我想毒死他 那些流浪汉最会乱想了
He'll think I'm trying to poison him. They always get that idea.

143
00:09:47,692 --> 00:09:50,278
把那个该死的披萨拿开  好吗?
Get off the fucking pizza, all right?.

144
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:53,781
你不应该那么说的
That language is uncalled for.

145
00:09:53,865 --> 00:09:55,825
我的老天爷
Holy shit!

146
00:09:55,908 --> 00:09:59,537
对不起  请把它还给订披萨的人
I'm sorry. Please return to sender.

147
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:01,789
快滚开
Fuck off.

148
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:04,500
拿去吧  这是五块钱  把披萨吃掉
Here you go, $5. Eat the pizza yourself.

149
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,295
你看起来很需要好好地吃一顿
You look like you could use a good meal.

150
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:27,523
你好
Hello.

151
00:10:27,732 --> 00:10:32,236
潘  你相信有个疯子 刚刚想外送披萨来给我吗?
Pam, could you believe some nut case just tried to deliver me a pizza?.

152
00:10:32,236 --> 00:10:36,407
你为什么每天会在同一个时间 在相同的电话亭打电话给我?
Why are you always in the same phone booth, same time, every day?.

153
00:10:36,448 --> 00:10:40,619
-你在休息  对吧? -谢天谢地  我们今天忙死了
-Well, it's quitting time, right?. -Thank God, we were mobbed today.

154
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:41,871
你今天还好吗?
So how's your day?.

155
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:45,040
现在觉得好多了 甜心
It's getting better by the minute, sweetheart.

156
00:10:45,124 --> 00:10:47,501
今天你帮哪个最有名的明星 做宣传呢?
Who's the most famous person you publicized today?.

157
00:10:47,585 --> 00:10:49,795
-就是你啊 -真的吗?
-You. -Really?.

158
00:10:49,837 --> 00:10:53,424
我告诉几个专栏作家梅尔吉勃孙 在为他的新片寻找女主角
I told a few columnists Mel Gibson was looking for actresses for his film.

159
00:10:53,465 --> 00:10:57,428
我说可能的人选包括了 卡麦蓉狄亚  茱莉亚萝伯兹...
And I said the possibilities were Cameron Diaz, Julia Roberts...

160
00:10:57,469 --> 00:11:00,180
以及我最喜欢的客户  也就是你
...and my favorite client, you.

161
00:11:00,264 --> 00:11:01,473
你真的不必那么做
You didn't really do that.

162
00:11:01,598 --> 00:11:03,892
你希望被人注意 首先得常常让人听见你的名字
First step toward being noticed is being mentioned.

163
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:06,228
我刚刚到城市饭店 开完会出来
I just got out of a conference at the City Hotel.

164
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:08,021
我想或许你可以 赶过来
I was thinking you could come down.

165
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:12,276
我要介绍你认识一些人 我们可以一起喝几杯
There are a couple of people and a few martinis I'd like to introduce you to.

166
00:11:12,276 --> 00:11:14,236
-史都  我-- -听我说  潘
-Stu, l-- -Listen, Pam. Pam. Pam.

167
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:16,780
我们应该好好谈谈 你的事业  快来吧
It's about time we talked about your career. Come on.

168
00:11:16,822 --> 00:11:22,494
我真的很想去  但我答应过我同学 我会参加学校的彩排
I feel awful but I promised my scene partner that I would rehearse for class.

169
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:25,956
我们要演出征服情海的一场戏 我饰演薇妮齐薇格的角色
We're doing a scene from Jerry Maguire. I'm playing Renee Zellweger's part.

170
00:11:25,956 --> 00:11:28,792
太棒了  听着  我调开 开会的时间是希望能跟你见面...
That's great. Look, I rescheduled a meeting to see you...

171
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:30,877
但我想我应该能把它调回来
...but I guess I can reschedule it back.

172
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:33,463
-你在生气吗? -别担心  我没有生气
-Are you mad?. -Don't worry about it. I'm not mad.

173
00:11:33,505 --> 00:11:35,173
明天再说吧
Maybe tomorrow.

174
00:11:35,298 --> 00:11:36,717
是啊  再见
Yeah, later.

175
00:11:36,842 --> 00:11:38,427
-听我说  史都.... -什么事?
-Look, Stu.... -What?.

176
00:11:38,552 --> 00:11:40,262
我爱你
Big kiss.

177
00:11:40,345 --> 00:11:41,930
我也是
You too.

178
00:11:52,858 --> 00:11:55,068
-你好 -这真的是太有趣了
-Yeah. -Isn't it funny?

179
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:57,737
你听到电话铃声 那可能是其他人的电话...
You hear a phone ring, and it could be anybody...

180
00:11:57,821 --> 00:12:00,532
但电话铃声一响 你会很自然地去接起它  对吧?
...but a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn 't it?

181
00:12:00,574 --> 00:12:01,700
什么?
What?.

182
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:04,536
我希望你了解 你让我有多伤心
I hope you realize how you've hurt my feelings.

183
00:12:04,577 --> 00:12:08,290
-你到底是谁? -别想挂电话
-Who the fuck is this?. -Don't think about leaving that phone.

184
00:12:08,331 --> 00:12:11,001
-你打错电话了  老哥 -那个披萨非常好吃
-Wrong number, pal. -It was a perfectly delicious pizza.

185
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:13,378
你真的会很后悔 自己没有收下它
You're certainly going to wish you had accepted it.

186
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,923
你一定是在开玩笑 关于披萨的事  那真的很有趣
Naturally, this is part of the gag. The pizza bit. That was funny shit.

187
00:12:16,923 --> 00:12:20,301
我本来要送披萨给你 让你有力气应付接下来的事
Well, its purpose was to keep your strength up for what's coming next.

188
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:23,638
-接下来我会把电话挂掉 -不  你不会那么做的
-What's coming next is I'm hanging up. -Oh, no, you won 't.

189
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,683
-你得学会服从我 -服从你?
- You're going to learn to obey me. -Obey you?.

190
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:29,435
-你到底是谁? -我只是一个喜欢看着你的人
-Who is this?. -Someone who enjoys watching you.

191
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,603
看着我?
Watching me?.

192
00:12:30,728 --> 00:12:35,066
对  我喜欢你今天的穿着 蓝黑色的西装  非常具意大利风味
Yes, I love the suit you're wearing today. Black on raspberry sorbet. Very Italian.

193
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:38,111
你--?你在哪里?
Where--?. Where are you?.

194
00:12:38,194 --> 00:12:42,573
这里有好几百扇窗户 你为什么不自己来找找看呢?
There are hundreds of windows out there. Why don 't you check them out?

195
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:49,998
-我现在在做什么? -你在抓头
-So, what am I doing now?. - You're scratching your head.

196
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:53,751
现在你把头发往后梳
Now you're brushing your hair back.

197
00:12:54,627 --> 00:12:57,713
那么做太不智了  史都
That's not very nice, Stu.

198
00:12:58,423 --> 00:12:59,924
你叫我史都?
Did you call me Stu?.

199
00:13:00,883 --> 00:13:04,679
-谁是史都?我不认识叫史都的人 -怎么?你要我叫你史都华吗?
-Who' s Stu?. I don' t know any Stu. -Why, do you prefer Stuart?

200
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,889
在这个地区 很多人都认识我
A lot of people in this neighborhood know me.

201
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:10,810
史都华薛帕德  家住西五十一街 1326号三楼前座
Stuart Shepard, 1 326 West 5 1st Street, Third Floor, front.

202
00:13:10,852 --> 00:13:14,021
-去找其他人开玩笑吧  老兄 -我也知道潘蜜拉麦费登的事
-Go mind-fuck some other guy, pal. -I know Pamela McFadden too.

203
00:13:14,105 --> 00:13:17,108
挂断电话 对你没有任何一点好处
It's not in your best interest to disconnect me.

204
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:19,652
可能有人会因此受伤
Someone could get hurt.

205
00:13:19,735 --> 00:13:22,697
怎么了?史都
What's the matter, Stu?

206
00:13:22,738 --> 00:13:25,574
如果你是连我都无法捧红的 超级烂演员...
If you' re some fucked-up, failed actor I wouldn' t handle...

207
00:13:25,616 --> 00:13:29,328
或是被我开除的助理 我一定会逮到你并且毁了你
...or some prick intern I fired, I will hunt you down and I will crush you.

208
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,330
你将永远无法在这个城市工作
You will never work in this town.

209
00:13:31,414 --> 00:13:32,915
我有办法把人捧成神
I can turn people into gods...

210
00:13:32,998 --> 00:13:36,710
就算你现在还没被毁掉 我也能把你逼得走投无路
...and I can turn you into a total fucking loser if you weren't one already.

211
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:40,131
你听到了吗? 我惹毛你了吗?喂
Do you hear me?. Am I upsetting you?. Hello.

212
00:13:40,172 --> 00:13:43,384
喔  你以为我想做什么? 你以为我是来报复你的吗?
Oh, you think I'm gonna, what?. Pay you off or something?.

213
00:13:43,425 --> 00:13:46,303
-告诉我你到底想做什么 -现在你想跟我说话了
-T ell me what you want. -Now you want to talk to me.

214
00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:48,556
是我的助理亚当 唆使你这么做的吗?
Did Adam at my office put you up to this?.

215
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,517
不  这完全是我一个人的主意
No, I thought this up all by myself.

216
00:13:51,517 --> 00:13:53,143
随便你  我要挂电话了
Keep thinking. I'm hanging up.

217
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:57,982
我会帮你跟你太太凯莉打招呼 待会再联络
I'll say hi to your wife, Kelly, for you. Talk to you later.

218
00:13:58,274 --> 00:14:00,484
搞什么--?
What the--?.

219
00:14:02,486 --> 00:14:05,823
现在无法执行 回拨功能--
The callback feature cannot be activated--

220
00:14:06,073 --> 00:14:07,866
混蛋
Motherfucker.

221
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:39,940
-告诉我你到底想做什么 -我要你专心听我说
-T ell me what you want. -I want your complete attention.

222
00:14:40,983 --> 00:14:44,986
-你是演员吗? -没错  我是你没捧红的演员
-Are you an actor?. - Yes. One of your pathetic failed ones.

223
00:14:44,986 --> 00:14:47,531
-红不起来真的是让人很难过 -你说的对
-lt' s tough when you' re not known. - Tell me about it.

224
00:14:47,572 --> 00:14:51,910
你不必费力找我把我毁了 反正我在这里也找不到工作
You don 't have to hunt me and crush me. I can't get work in this town as it is.

225
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:55,497
我在百老汇及曼哈顿演过 一些小角色  但现在我失业了
I've done some off-Broadway, some off-Manhattan plays, but that dried up.

226
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:58,583
所以我做服务生跟清洁工 赚些小钱来付房租
Now I wait tables, clean toilets, anything to make the rent.

227
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,460
现在我成了一个大笑话
I'm a walking cliche.

228
00:15:00,544 --> 00:15:02,587
我可以帮你 安排试镜的机会
I can help you. I can get you auditions.

229
00:15:02,712 --> 00:15:05,048
试镜?你不是经纪人 你是搞公关的
Auditions? You're not an agent. You're a publicist.

230
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,551
对  但我有关系 我认识经纪人  我能帮你安排
Yeah, but I have contacts. I know agents. I can get you an audition.

231
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:10,679
-真的吗? -没错
-Really? -Yeah.

232
00:15:10,762 --> 00:15:13,974
喔  我希望 你能打电话给某人
Well, there is someone I'd like you to call.

233
00:15:14,015 --> 00:15:15,225
是谁
Name it.

234
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,562
试试你踏进电话亭后 第一个拨出的电话号码
Try the number you dialed when you first got into the booth.

235
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,273
-我不知道你在说什么 -真的吗?
-I don't know what you're talking about. -No?

236
00:15:22,357 --> 00:15:24,442
那么你的运气不错 因为我把它记下来了
Lucky you then, because I wrote it down.

237
00:15:24,526 --> 00:15:28,154
我看得到你拨了哪些号码 快来看看潘是不是还在工作
I can see every number you pressed. Let's see if Pam is still at work.

238
00:15:28,196 --> 00:15:30,448
-不 -看来我得亲自打电话给她
-No. -Then I guess I'll have to do it.

239
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:33,660
-听着  千万别那么做 -太迟了  电话已经接通
-Look, don' t! -Too late. It's already ringing.

240
00:15:33,743 --> 00:15:38,206
-我会接上扩音器以便你听见对话 -别开玩笑
-I'll put her on speaker so you can hear. -You' re fucking kidding me.

241
00:15:38,206 --> 00:15:42,168
史都  我从不开玩笑
Stu, I never kid.

242
00:15:47,215 --> 00:15:50,843
-喂 -喂  潘
-Hello. - Well, hello, Pam.

243
00:15:50,885 --> 00:15:54,180
-你好  哪位? -我是史都的好朋友
-Hi, who' s this?. -It's a good friend of Stu's.

244
00:15:54,222 --> 00:15:57,266
-他没有多少好朋友 -你认识史都?
-And he hasn 't got many. -You know Stu?.

245
00:15:57,308 --> 00:16:00,520
我知道他在说谎
I know he lies.

246
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:02,605
-你是谁? -别担心
-Who is this?. -Don 't worry about that.

247
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:06,442
史都正在听我们说话 他听得到我们所有的对话
Stu's listening in. He can hear what we 're saying about him.

248
00:16:06,442 --> 00:16:09,904
-史都  真的吗?你也在吗? -潘  快把电话挂掉
-Stu, is that true?. Are you there?. -Pam, hang up the goddamn phone!

249
00:16:09,904 --> 00:16:12,114
她听不到你说话  史都
She can 't hear you, Stu.

250
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:16,494
潘  恐怕史都并没有 完全对你坦白
Pam, I'm afraid Stu hasn 't been totally honest with you.

251
00:16:16,536 --> 00:16:18,204
-你是什么意思? -别这么做
-What do you mean?. -Don' t do this.

252
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:20,915
-史都一直在骗你 -潘  快挂掉电话
-Stu has been lying to you. -Pam, hang up.

253
00:16:20,957 --> 00:16:23,251
为什么 一个有移动电话的人...
Now, why would a man who has a cell phone...

254
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:26,796
每天都要从电话亭 打电话给你
...call you every day from a phone booth?

255
00:16:26,796 --> 00:16:31,967
-他说那样子比较安静 -潘  那真的是太蠢了
-Because he said it' s quiet. -Pam, that's just stupid.

256
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:34,720
那是因为他太太 会检查他的移动电话帐单
It's because his wife checks his cell phone bills.

257
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:40,101
-那样就不会有你的电话记录 -我的天啊
-No record of his calls to you. -Jesus Christ.

258
00:16:40,101 --> 00:16:44,146
-他说他未婚 -他已经结婚了
-He said he wasn't married. -Oh, he 's married.

259
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:48,067
他太太叫做凯莉  我从没见过她 但她的声音很好听
Her name is Kelly. I've never seen her but she sounds lovely.

260
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,903
你觉得他为什么 要邀请你到城市饭店?
Why do you think he invites you to the City Hotel?

261
00:16:50,945 --> 00:16:53,030
-低俗的女孩只适合到廉价的饭店 -混蛋
-Cheap rooms for cheap girls. -Asshole.

262
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:56,116
他说他要捧红你 那样子你就会跟他上床
He 's telling you all this so you'll sleep with him.

263
00:16:56,158 --> 00:16:58,827
-他在说谎  潘  别听他的 -我知道  好吗?
-He' s lying, Pam. Don' t listen. -I know that, okay?.

264
00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:01,413
虽然我来自蒙大拿州 但那里也有男人
I may be from Montana, but we have men there also.

265
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,916
我并没有计划 要跟他上床
I wasn' t planning on sleeping with him.

266
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,460
只是现在 我在这里认识的人不多
I just don't know a lot of people here right now.

267
00:17:06,502 --> 00:17:09,713
他长得很帅 还说他会帮我
And he's cute and he said that he would help me.

268
00:17:09,713 --> 00:17:14,385
-你从来没问过我的婚姻状况 -他从来没有捧红过任何人  再见
-You never asked me if I was married. -He's never made anyone a star. Bye.

269
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:16,720
喂
Hello?.

270
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:18,013
现在轮到你了  史都
Back to you, Stu.

271
00:17:18,097 --> 00:17:20,974
我得趁下个混蛋占便宜之前 阻止一场闹剧
Gotta hit this trick before the next bitch takes my score.

272
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:25,979
-快滚开 -滚开?把电话挂掉  混蛋
-Go away. -Go away?. Hang up the phone, nigga.

273
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:34,780
大混蛋 居然还瞪我  死王八
This motherfucker, you don't eyeball me. Bitch.

274
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,783
你为什么要这么做? 我伤害过你吗?我--
Why are you doing this?. Did I ever harm you?. Did l--?.

275
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:40,744
-我们现在得打电话给凯莉 -她不在家
-Now, let's call Kelly. -She's not home.

276
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:44,122
但我相信 她应该在哥伦布的店里
Oh, but I'm sure she 's at the shop on Columbus.

277
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:45,874
你怎么会知道这些事?
How the fuck do you know all this shit?.

278
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:51,171
快打电话给她  按下"自动拨号一" 那是她的专属代码
Speed dial her. Press "auto one. " That's her button.

279
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:54,007
-我要说什么? -你为什么不说实话呢?
-What am I supposed to say?. -Why don 't you try the truth?

280
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:57,010
-你有外遇 -我没有背着凯莉乱搞  我没外遇
- You're cheating. -l' m not cheating on Kelly. I never have.

281
00:17:57,052 --> 00:17:59,513
-你说这又是怎么一回事呢? -听着  你也是男人...
-Then what do you call it? -Look, you' re a guy...

282
00:17:59,638 --> 00:18:02,224
有时候你只想知道 自己还有没有机会
...sometimes you want to know it' s a possibility.

283
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:04,142
那就像虽然你有个温暖的家
It' s like having a beautiful home...

284
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,436
但你还是梦想着 要去度个小假
...but you still dream of that quick vacation.

285
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,232
住进豪华饭店里 享受着漂亮的风景跟游泳池
You know, some nice hotel room with a great view, maybe a pool.

286
00:18:10,232 --> 00:18:12,317
那只是一个梦想 事实上你根本没有离开家
It's just a fantasy. You never leave home.

287
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,654
-你明白我的意思吗? -凯莉是你的家  潘是汽车旅馆
-Do you hear what I'm saying?. -Kelly is a home and Pam is a motel.

288
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:18,490
-相信她们知道了一定很感动 -去你的
-I'm sure they'll both appreciate that. -Fuck you.

289
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:21,284
嘿  你怎么说个不停
Hey, that kind of language is uncalled for.

290
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:24,454
你不能将这里占为己有 这可是我做生意的地盘
You can't take up the whole booth. This here's my business.

291
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,539
纽约市 不光只有这个电话亭
This is not the only phone in New York.

292
00:18:26,664 --> 00:18:29,542
第八大道上只剩这个电话亭 还能使用
It's the only one on 8th Avenue that's working.

293
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:34,380
-胡说  到餐厅借电话  快滚开 -混蛋  这是我的电话  快点--
-Bullshit! Go in a restaurant, but get lost. -Motherfucker, this is my phone. Get--

294
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,301
该死  混蛋 你害我伤到手
Goddamn it, man! You done made me hurt my dick hand.

295
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:42,180
我相信你用另一只手 还是能做生意  快滚开
I'm sure you're just as good with the other hand. Yeah, go away.

296
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:47,560
我会再回来的  混蛋 我会再回来的  王八蛋  别挡路
I'll be back, motherfucker. I will be back, bitch. Get out of my way!

297
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,898
我很担心你 我还以为她会痛扁你一顿
I was worried for you. I thought she was gonna put an eye out with that hand.

298
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:54,859
不管你是谁 很明显地你非常聪明
Whoever you are, you're obviously a very intelligent man.

299
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:57,654
我生活压力很大 我觉得自己快被逼疯了
I know what stress does. It's all I can do from going crazy myself.

300
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:00,865
-你的意思是我疯了吗? -不  你只是日子不好过
- You're calling me crazy? -No, you're going through a difficult time.

301
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,492
拜托别打电话给我太太
Look, please don't call my wife.

302
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,994
我给你我办公室电话号码 我们好好谈一谈
Let me give you my office number. We'll talk.

303
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:08,081
我认识一个很不错的摄影师 他可以帮你拍些漂亮的艺术照
I know a reasonable photographer who will do some headshots.

304
00:19:08,122 --> 00:19:10,917
史都  你真的以为 我是演员吗?
Stu, do you really think that I'm an actor?

305
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,921
我不是演员 我不需要你  史都  真的
I'm not an actor. I have no use for you, Stu. None.

306
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:17,965
我只希望你能告诉凯莉 真正的你是什么样的人
I would just like you to tell Kelly the truth about yourself.

307
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,552
你要打电话给凯莉 告诉她潘的事
So are you going to call Kelly and tell her about Pam?

308
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,888
-还是要我来打呢? -不
-Or do I have to? -No!

309
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,475
天啊  不  我来打
Jesus, no. I'm doing it.

310
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:31,979
拨号中 凯莉

311
00:19:32,146 --> 00:19:34,440
你很紧张吗?史都
Feeling kind of nervous, Stu?

312
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,406
-喂 -把电话移到话筒旁让我听声音
-Hello. -Hold it to the receiver so I can hear.

313
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,700
-史都 -是我
-Stu?. -Yeah.

314
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:48,704
-你在哪里? -我在一个电话亭里
-Where are you?. -l' m in a phone booth.

315
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:53,375
老公  我刚接到一个男人打来的电话 他说你会打电话给我...
Baby, I just got this call from this guy who said you' d be calling me...

316
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:57,129
你会从电话亭打电话 告诉我一件很重要的事
...from a booth to tell me something important.

317
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,590
有很多人会打恶作剧电话 捉弄别人  亲爱的
There's a lot of prank calling going on today, baby.

318
00:19:59,673 --> 00:20:02,343
-告诉她你邀请女人... -闭嘴
-Tell her you invite women... -Shut up.

319
00:20:02,384 --> 00:20:04,386
到隐密的饭店喝一杯
...to have drinks at discreet hotels.

320
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,389
我不是在跟你说话  老婆
I' m not talking to you, baby.

321
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:08,682
有人来了
Someone 's got company.

322
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,851
-那个女人是谁? -那混蛋有移动电话
-Who' s that woman?. -Bitch got a cell phone!

323
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:14,521
-有个妓女想打电话 -他叫我妓女
-Some hooker is trying to use the phone. -He just called me a hooker.

324
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:19,068
-你确定真的没事? -我们是伴游
-Are you sure there's nothing wrong?. -We are escorts. Escorts.

325
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:21,070
告诉她你想跟别的女人 上床
Tell her you want to sleep with other women.

326
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,947
有一个人 在散布跟我有关的谣言
There is this person and he's saying things about me.

327
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,449
那些事都不是真的
Things that might not be true.

328
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:29,870
如果他打给你--快滚开 不然我要报警了
And if he calls you-- Get the fuck out of here before I call the cops!

329
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,914
亲爱的  我想 跟别的女人上床
Honey, I want to sleep with other women.

330
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,666
听着  凯莉  不管他说了什么 别相信他
Look, Kelly, whatever he says, don't believe him.

331
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:38,003
-我什么都没做 -因为潘要彩排
-I haven't done anything. -Only because Pam had to rehearse.

332
00:20:38,045 --> 00:20:40,088
闭上你的鸟嘴
Shut the fuck up!

333
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:44,801
史都  我不知道你在说什么 你把我吓坏了
Stu, I don't know what you're talking about, but you're scaring me.

334
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:46,345
对不起  老婆
I'm sorry, baby.

335
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:50,182
你能到店里来一趟吗? 我们得面对面地谈一谈
Can you just come over to the store so we can talk in person?.

336
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,643
-我觉得怪怪的 -我会想办法赶过去  别担心
-I feel kind of weird. -Yeah. Look, I'll try. Don't worry.

337
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,687
-少来了 -是啊  王八蛋
-Come on! -Yeah, bitch!

338
00:20:55,812 --> 00:20:57,481
-我也爱你 -"我爱你"
-I love you too. - "I love you. "

339
00:20:57,564 --> 00:21:00,484
快点滚开 不然我要把你们送进监牢里
Get out of here before I have you deported to Jersey.

340
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:02,819
-你是个天杀的混蛋 -你是个臭婊子
-You're a fucking ass! -And you're a dirty skank.

341
00:21:02,903 --> 00:21:08,074
-你打算怎么办? -你老妈才是臭婊子
-What are you gonna do about it?. -Your mama is a skank, bitch!

342
00:21:08,074 --> 00:21:10,994
你没有跟你太太 说实话  对吧?
You didn't tell your wife the truth, did you, Stu?

343
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,413
你可以感觉得到她真的爱你
And you can tell she really loves you.

344
00:21:13,455 --> 00:21:15,624
有个大美人那么关心你 感觉一定很棒
Must be nice to have a pretty girl care for you.

345
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,667
你为什么要搞砸她的生活? 她从来就没有伤害过你
Why screw up her life?. She never did you harm.

346
00:21:17,751 --> 00:21:19,502
每个人都会造成伤害
Everybody does harm.

347
00:21:19,753 --> 00:21:21,671
够了  这个王八蛋完了
That's it. This mind-fuck is over.

348
00:21:21,755 --> 00:21:27,636
史都  你一挂掉电话 我就会杀了你
Stu, if you hang up, I will kill you.

349
00:21:28,261 --> 00:21:32,098
你手里拿着望远镜 要怎么杀我呢?
What are you going to do about it with your goddamn binoculars?.

350
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,850
我从没说过我拿着望远镜
I never said I had binoculars.

351
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:37,187
但我能看到 你的超高倍数放大影像
I have a highly magnified telescopic image of you.

352
00:21:37,228 --> 00:21:40,523
什么样的设备 会附有这样的装备呢?
Now what kind of device has a telescopic sight mounted on it?

353
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:43,318
什么?你拿着来福枪?
What?. You mean like a rifle?.

354
00:21:43,401 --> 00:21:46,988
三十厘米口径  700型 还附有一流的修正器...
A.30-caliber bolt-action 700 with a carbon-one modification...

355
00:21:46,988 --> 00:21:50,283
以及最先进的 韩夏达特军事用望远镜
...and a state-of-the-art Hensholdt tactical scope.

356
00:21:50,408 --> 00:21:54,746
-而它正瞄准了你 -我的头发看起来如何?
-And it's staring straight at you. -Yeah, how' s my fucking hair?.

357
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:58,833
在这个距离开枪  子弹射出的洞口 大约只有金橘那么大
At this range, the exit wound ought to be about the size of a small tangerine.

358
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:02,754
你挺高明的  少来这一套
Nice try, pal. Go to hell.

359
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:07,342
那应该能让你 吓得目瞪口呆吧?
Now, doesn't that just torque your jaws?

360
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,552
我喜欢
I love that.

361
00:22:09,635 --> 00:22:12,221
你知道的  就像在电影里 当好人...
You know, like in the movies just as the good guy...

362
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:14,932
打算杀掉坏蛋时 他会扣下板机
...is about to kill the bad guy, he cocks his gun.

363
00:22:15,391 --> 00:22:17,477
他为什么不事先扣下板机呢?
Now why didn 't he have it cocked?

364
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:21,689
因为扣板机的声音太可怕了
Because that sound is scary.

365
00:22:21,689 --> 00:22:23,232
很酷  对吧?
It's cool, isn 't it?

366
00:22:23,316 --> 00:22:27,028
你在这里开枪 一定会引起混乱
Look, you shoot a gun here and there'll be pandemonium.

367
00:22:27,028 --> 00:22:29,572
你听到了吗? 这个地方会挤满了警察
Do you hear me?. There will be cops all over this block.

368
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:34,785
你如此认为吗? 不妨试试看  一  二
Do you think so? Let's see. One. Two.

369
00:22:34,785 --> 00:22:37,079
没有用的
That won't help you.

370
00:22:37,204 --> 00:22:38,914
三
Three.

371
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:45,588
史都  你看看每一个人 尖叫声此起彼落
Stu, look at everybody. Look at all of the people screaming, Stu.

372
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,007
警察来了
Here come the cops.

373
00:22:48,132 --> 00:22:51,969
狙击手在屋顶上 枪声大做  打中了电话亭
Sniper on the roof. Gunfire, hit the deck.

374
00:22:52,011 --> 00:22:55,765
史都  你在听我说话吗?
Stu, you still with me?

375
00:22:55,806 --> 00:22:58,142
像个男子汉一样站起来
Stand up and be a man.

376
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:04,565
你是说你毫无任何理由 只是想把我杀了?
So do you mean you would whack me for no particular reason?.

377
00:23:04,565 --> 00:23:10,571
不  我有很多理由 而且你一直在帮我制造理由
No, I have plenty of reasons, and you keep giving me more.

378
00:23:10,821 --> 00:23:14,158
-你要我杀了他吗? -该死  不要
-Shall I take care of him? -No! No. Shit, no.

379
00:23:14,366 --> 00:23:16,952
那应该很容易
It would be so easy.

380
00:23:17,036 --> 00:23:18,704
拿去
Here.

381
00:23:18,829 --> 00:23:20,414
拿去
Here.

382
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,628
你刚刚用十块钱打发了那男人
Stu, you just gave that gentleman $ 1 0 to walk away.

383
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:30,090
你救了他的命 你真是个感性的家伙
You saved his life. You do have a sensitive side.

384
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:34,011
-你要拿多少钱才会放了我? -就看你有多感性吧
-How much to let me go?. -Let's see how sensitive you really are.

385
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:38,098
我现在瞄准了你
I'm aiming at you right now.

386
00:23:38,098 --> 00:23:42,978
你感觉到子弹的热力吗?
Can you feel it, the heat of it?

387
00:23:42,978 --> 00:23:45,439
少来了  史都  你可以感觉到
Come now, Stu, you can feel it.

388
00:23:45,522 --> 00:23:47,816
集中注意力
Concentrate.

389
00:23:47,983 --> 00:23:50,444
集中注意力
Concentrate.

390
00:23:50,527 --> 00:23:52,321
看看我要射击的地方
Take a look at where I'm going.

391
00:23:54,781 --> 00:23:57,117
你表现得 比其他人好很多
You're doing so much better than the others.

392
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,120
你知道十天前 那个德国色鬼...
You read about the German porn king shot 1 0 days ago...

393
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,913
在三十八街 跟第八街口被杀的事吗?
...at 38th and 8th?

394
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:05,542
他以为他是个艺术家 不承认他只是一个恋童癖
He thought he was an artist and wouldn 't admit he was just a pedophile.

395
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:08,086
相信我  他有很多机会 能够逃过一劫
Believe me, he had plenty of chances to come clean.

396
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,382
你一定也知道那个股市经纪人 在四十七街跟第十街口被杀的事
You must have read about the corporate executive shot at 47th and 1 0th.

397
00:24:12,424 --> 00:24:15,385
但你不知道的是 他卖掉他所有的股票
What you didn 't read was that he cashed in all of his stocks...

398
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,847
免得股价崩盘被套牢 但其他的小户却因此失去了一切
...just before the bottom fell out, while all the little guys lost everything.

399
00:24:19,598 --> 00:24:22,392
如果那时他愿意 改过自新...
Now if he had been willing to make amends...

400
00:24:22,517 --> 00:24:24,853
把钱分给大家 结局或许会不一样
...share the money, things might have been different.

401
00:24:24,936 --> 00:24:29,941
请告诉我 我现在瞄准你身上的哪个地方?
Please, tell me, where am I aiming now?

402
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,320
-我的肩膀下面 -哪一边?
-Below the shoulder. - Which one?

403
00:24:33,403 --> 00:24:35,447
右肩
The right shoulder.

404
00:24:35,572 --> 00:24:38,658
-你去死吧  宝贝 -这真是太难得了  史都
-Love to love you too, baby! -That's phenomenal, Stu.

405
00:24:38,742 --> 00:24:41,911
你表现得比其他人好很多
You're doing so much better than the others.

406
00:24:41,953 --> 00:24:45,165
对那些凶杀案还有什么印象吗?
What do you remember about those killings, Stu?

407
00:24:45,165 --> 00:24:46,332
我不知道
I don' t know.

408
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:49,252
喔  你不是一向自认聪明吗? 猜猜看吧
Well, you think of yourself as a smart guy, Stu. Try.

409
00:24:49,294 --> 00:24:53,047
-他们被射死  我不知道  好吗? -好吧  我给你一个暗示
-They got shot. I don' t know, all right?. -Okay, I'll give you a hint.

410
00:24:53,089 --> 00:24:56,718
皮夹  手表 他们什么东西都没丢
Wallets, watches, everything was left on their bodies.

411
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:59,804
因为他们没有被抢 他们是遭到了处决
Because they weren't robberies. They were executions.

412
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:01,598
他们不必遭受那些的
They didn't have to be.

413
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,600
我到底做错了什么事? 为什么是我?
What did I do to deserve this?. Why me?.

414
00:25:03,683 --> 00:25:08,271
如果你一定想知道答案 那么你还没有做好准备
If you have to ask, then you're not ready to know yet.

415
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:11,816
-就是这里  该死  快点 -天啊  在电话亭里的家伙
-Right here. Shit. Come on. -Jesus. You, in the booth.

416
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:12,984
-快点 -现在又怎么了?
-Come on. -Now what?.

417
00:25:13,109 --> 00:25:15,695
你知道你让我的生活 有多么痛苦吗?
You got any idea how much pain you' re making in my life?.

418
00:25:15,778 --> 00:25:17,405
-嘿  看着我 -我听到了
-Hey, look at me. -Look, I hear you!

419
00:25:17,572 --> 00:25:20,491
看着我的眼睛 把电话挂断  快走出来
Look me in the eye. Hang up the phone and walk away.

420
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:23,202
-别那么做 -我有我自己的问题
-Don't do it. -I got my own problems.

421
00:25:23,286 --> 00:25:25,246
我就是你的问题 你知道为什么吗?
I'm your problem. You know why?.

422
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:29,083
我手下的女孩一直对我大吼 "理昂  他不肯离开电话亭"
My girls keep yapping at me, " Leon, he won't share the phone."

423
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,543
"理昂  他叫我们滚开"
" Leon, he told us to fuck off."

424
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,630
"除非你让他离开那个电话亭 不然我们会逼疯你"
"We're gonna make you nuts unless you make him get off the fucking phone."

425
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:38,843
-我只想做生意 -我同意  但我不能挂断电话
-I'm trying to run a fucking business. -I sympathize, but I can't get off the call.

426
00:25:38,884 --> 00:25:41,929
不  你不了解我的意思 我手下有一堆女孩
No, you don't understand me. I got the G-string union here.

427
00:25:41,971 --> 00:25:43,389
她们都快把我搞疯了
They're breaking my balls.

428
00:25:43,472 --> 00:25:46,100
我得容忍她们的胡言乱语 但我不会把你放在眼里
I gotta live with their shit, but not yours.

429
00:25:46,183 --> 00:25:50,062
我再好意地跟你说一次 挂掉电话  走出来
So I'm saying this once, nice, all right?. Hang up the phone. Walk away.

430
00:25:50,104 --> 00:25:52,690
-他的确很有礼貌 -他身上带了移动电话
-He did say it nicely. -He got a cell phone up in there too.

431
00:25:52,732 --> 00:25:55,735
-他根本不必打公用电话 -我没办法挂掉电话
-lt ain't even like he need a phone! -I can't get off the call!

432
00:25:55,735 --> 00:25:59,321
闭嘴  你听到了吗? 我真的觉得吵死了
Shut the fuck up! Do you hear that shit?. It's like nails on a chalkboard.

433
00:25:59,363 --> 00:26:01,991
除非我照她们的话做 不然她们是不会闭嘴的
They ain't gonna fucking stop, till I get their way.

434
00:26:02,116 --> 00:26:06,829
-我的头很痛  朋友 -好吧  我会付钱请你走开
-I'm getting a fucking headache, pal. -All right. I'll pay you to go away.

435
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:09,957
我不要你的钱 我要你挂断电话走出来
I don't want your money. I want you to hang up the phone and get out.

436
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:14,128
-一百二十块  它都是你的了 -每个人都可以被收买  对吧?
-$ 1 20. It's all yours. -Everybody has their price, right, Stu?

437
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:17,089
你要付我一百二十块 租下这个烂电话亭吗?
You're gonna give me $ 1 20 to rent the booth the bums piss in?.

438
00:26:17,172 --> 00:26:20,009
-对  我是个大好人 -我觉得他不太对劲
-Yeah, I'm a nice guy. -Something ain't right with him.

439
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,511
你看看那个家伙 满头大汗的样子
Look at that sweat pouring off that son of a bitch.

440
00:26:22,553 --> 00:26:25,973
-我们惹上一个有病的家伙 -或许他得了传染病
-This one sick mother we started with. -It's probably catching too.

441
00:26:26,015 --> 00:26:27,224
-嘿 -他有爱滋病
-Yo. -He's got AlDS.

-$500 gets you indefinitely. -Wait up! Hold the fuck up!

446
00:26:37,443 --> 00:26:42,739
他怎么说服你的? 什么?现在连你都成了大混蛋?
How come he's defying you, huh?. What, you got bitch in you now?.

447
00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:48,537
-我不是叫你闭嘴吗? -你何不用这种语气跟他说话呢?
-Did I say shut the fuck up?. -Yeah, now talk to him like that!

448
00:26:48,537 --> 00:26:50,622
天啊  你喜欢这么做吗?
Jesus Christ. Are you enjoying this?.

449
00:26:51,873 --> 00:26:54,668
-你需要帮助吗? -听着  我可以自己处理
-Do you need help? -Look, I'm handling it.

451
00:26:56,712 --> 00:27:00,090
我本来不打算杀你 但你让我改变了心意
I wasn't gonna kill you before, but you changed my fucking mind.

452
00:27:00,924 --> 00:27:05,262
如果我是你  我会乖乖听话的 他会杀了你的
I would take off if I was you. He gonna kick your ass.

453
00:27:05,262 --> 00:27:08,181
-他会杀了你的 -快滚开

485
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:29,095
"好的  我都听到了" 不等于"好的  杀了他吧"
"Yes, I can hear you," not, "Yes, kill him!"

486
00:28:29,262 --> 00:28:31,722
你说话的时候 应该要小心自己的措词
You ought to be more careful with what you say.

487
00:28:31,806 --> 00:28:33,850
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

488
00:28:33,975 --> 00:28:36,227
-混蛋  为什么? -不是我干的
-Motherfucker, why?.! -lt wasn' t me!

489
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:39,230
-枪在哪里?你看到枪了吗? -去你的
-Where's the gun?. Do you see a gun?. -Fuck you!

490
00:28:39,313 --> 00:28:42,942
你对他开枪  混蛋 我都看到了  他带了枪
You pumped one into him, bitch! I saw it! He's got a Glock!

491
00:28:42,984 --> 00:28:45,820
趴下  大家快趴下 他有枪
Get down! Get the fuck down! Daddy got a Glock!

492
00:28:45,903 --> 00:28:49,282
什么枪?我没有枪 那只是电话
What Glock?. I don't have a fucking Glock! It's a telephone!

493
00:28:49,323 --> 00:28:53,953
你杀了我的男人  混蛋 他们会剥了你的皮  把你分尸
You shot my man, daddy! They gonna skin and fry your ass!

494
00:28:53,995 --> 00:28:58,999
你杀了我的爱人  混蛋 你是个天杀的大混蛋
You shot my baby, daddy! Mr. Motherfucker! Mr. Motherfucker!

495
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:01,168
拜托  少来了  快进来
Please, come on! Come in here, bitch!

496
00:29:01,377 --> 00:29:02,503
你最好赶快逃命  混蛋
Better run, motherfucker!

497
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:05,965
警察来了 我希望他们杀了你
The cops is coming and I hope they fry your ass down!

498
00:29:06,006 --> 00:29:07,883
我哪里都去不了  对吧?
I'm not going anywhere, am l?.

499
00:29:08,008 --> 00:29:12,221
如果你对那家伙好一点 我也不会这么做
If you had dealt with the man decently, this might not have been necessary.

500
00:29:12,221 --> 00:29:15,349
我给他钱 还要把我的表送给他
Look, I offered him money. I offered him my watch.

501
00:29:15,391 --> 00:29:18,143
但你不尊重他 那才是他真正想要的东西
But not your respect, which is what he really wanted.

502
00:29:18,185 --> 00:29:22,273
你看不起他 如同那个披萨外送员
You were dismissive like you dismissed the nice pizza guy.

503
00:29:22,815 --> 00:29:26,485
你的罪恶感 来自于你看不起身边的人
You are guilty of inhumanity to your fellow man.

504
00:29:26,527 --> 00:29:28,320
我没有犯任何的错
I' m not guilty of a goddamn thing.

505
00:29:28,404 --> 00:29:32,157
你得为自己做的事负责任 当个男子汉  史都
Take responsibility for what you've done, Stu. Be a man.

506
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:35,577
这点子真棒 你开枪杀了他  我却要负责任?
I love this fucking spin. You shoot the guy, and I'm fucking responsible?.

507
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:37,538
喔  你应该好好想一想
Well, looked that way from up here.

508
00:29:37,621 --> 00:29:40,582
我不知道我对你做了什么 但不管我做了什么  我都很高兴
I don't know what I did to you but whatever it was, I'm glad.

509
00:29:40,582 --> 00:29:42,751
我希望自己能够狠一点 我希望你死掉
I wish it had been worse. I wish you died!

510
00:29:42,876 --> 00:29:47,381
-太棒了  你终于愿意说实话 -告诉我你到底是谁
- Yes, finally some honesty. -Just tell me who you are.

511
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:51,260
我是个你不会注意到的人 我不是你那个世界的人
No one you'd ever notice. I don 't run in your circles.

512
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,137
-你到底是做什么的? -我喜欢观察别人
-And what is it you do?. -I watch.

513
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:57,099
-你喜欢观察别人? -没错  当你的生活开始走下坡...
-You watch?. - Yes, well, what else is there to do...

514
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,560
你得缩回你的小世界时 你会做些什么事呢?
... when life turns on you and you've retreated into some small room?

515
00:30:00,644 --> 00:30:02,020
你会从窗户往外看
You look out your window.

516
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:06,024
看到很多人进出这个电话亭 每天都有相同的人来这里打电话
You see people come in and out of this phone booth. The same ones every day.

517
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:09,194
你会帮他们取名字 想像他们的生活
You make up names for them. You imagine their stories.

518
00:30:09,987 --> 00:30:13,407
但最后你会厌倦于想像 于是开始追逐他们
But eventually, you get tired of imagining and follow one of them.

519
00:30:14,491 --> 00:30:16,451
你听到他说的所有谎言
And you hear all of his lies.

520
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:19,538
决定他的罪过 应该受到惩罚
And you decide that his sins should be punished.

521
00:30:19,579 --> 00:30:24,292
拿着移动电话大吼大叫的人 无法吸引我的注意力
Some guy shouting into a cell phone full of self-importance isn 't gonna notice me.

522
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:29,589
但我注意到那个德国色鬼 还有那个黑心的股票经纪人
But I noticed that German porn king, and I noticed that corrupt executive.

523
00:30:29,589 --> 00:30:31,841
我也注意到你  史都
And I noticed you, Stu.

524
00:30:33,093 --> 00:30:37,055
-我真是受宠若惊 -总机553  有什么紧急状况?
-l' m flattered. -Operator 553. What is your emergency?.

525
00:30:37,097 --> 00:30:38,306
请回答
Will you please respond?.

526
00:30:38,431 --> 00:30:40,000
一个在五十三街跟八街口电话亭里
What was so interesting about a guy

527
00:30:40,183 --> 00:30:41,935
打电话的人有什么好稀奇的?
in a phone booth on 53rd and 8th?.

528
00:30:41,935 --> 00:30:43,979
史都秀比电视节目精彩
The Stu Show. Better than TV.

529
00:30:44,104 --> 00:30:47,607
听着  我何德何能 会被拿着来福枪的杀手挑上?
Look, how'd I get so lucky to be picked up by a killer with a rifle?.!

530
00:30:47,607 --> 00:30:52,112
你娶了凯莉 又找潘来偷腥
You had it made. Kelly at home, Pam on the side.

531
00:30:52,112 --> 00:30:56,157
我见过潘一次 我跟踪她到餐厅  她是个大美人
I saw Pam once. I followed her to her restaurant. Lovely.

532
00:30:56,157 --> 00:30:58,701
你过着令人称羡的生活 史都
Life has given you more than your fair share, Stu.

533
00:30:58,785 --> 00:31:01,246
但看来你并不觉得满足
But it appears you don 't appreciate it.

534
00:31:01,287 --> 00:31:04,249
听着  听我说 外表是可以伪装的
Look, look, listen, appearances can be deceiving.

535
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:08,211
或许我看起来很有自信 事实上我真的很需要别人帮忙
I may look confident, but I'm really, actually just crying out for help!

536
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:09,671
我需要帮助  你知道吗?
Help! You know?.

537
00:31:09,796 --> 00:31:15,218
我想要帮你  史都 但你不肯帮自己
I'm trying to help you, Stu, but you won't help yourself.

538
00:31:18,304 --> 00:31:21,182
-该死 -怎么了?史都
-Fuck. -What's the matter, Stu?

539
00:31:23,976 --> 00:31:26,562
-你对我开枪 -你应该学乖了  史都
-You shot me! -It's time you learn, Stu.

540
00:31:26,646 --> 00:31:30,358
-欺骗是得不到奖赏的 -欺骗  我欺骗了谁?
-Deception can 't go unrewarded. -Deception! What fucking deception?.

541
00:31:30,358 --> 00:31:36,239
你需要报警 或是叫救护车来吗?
"Are you in need of immediate police or medical response?"

542
00:31:36,697 --> 00:31:39,951
该死  你窃听这个电话亭
Shit. You bugged the fucking booth.

543
00:31:39,992 --> 00:31:42,537
所以你才会知道我的事 你才会知道潘的事
That's how you knew. That's how you knew about Pam.

544
00:31:42,578 --> 00:31:46,749
-你不该跟我说谎的 -听着  我根本没有跟你说谎
- You picked the wrong person to lie to. -Look, I didn' t pick you.

545
00:31:46,749 --> 00:31:49,502
你的时髦西装 吸引了我的注意力
It must have been your flashy suit that attracted me.

546
00:31:49,543 --> 00:31:52,505
我因为身上的衣服被你挑上? 那就是你杀死理昂的原因?
I get fucked on account of my clothes?. That why you killed Leon?.

547
00:31:52,546 --> 00:31:54,548
我杀死理昂 不是因为他穿了什么样的衣服
I didn't kill Leon because of the way he dressed.

548
00:31:54,674 --> 00:31:57,510
那两个家伙也是吗? 他们也穿的很称头吗?
And those other two guys as well?. Did they dress too nice?.

549
00:31:57,551 --> 00:32:00,846
当你走在街上时 你一定觉得自己很高贵
You must feel really expensive when you walk out the door.

550
00:32:01,055 --> 00:32:02,431
太棒了  警察来了
All right, here come the cops.

551
00:32:02,556 --> 00:32:04,141
你打算怎么做?逃跑吗?
What are you gonna do?. Run?.

552
00:32:04,266 --> 00:32:06,560
不  我不是懦夫 我不像我认识的某些人
No, I'm not a coward like some people I know.

553
00:32:06,685 --> 00:32:09,522
-若你现在离开  应可以全身而退 -你把理昂的死怪到我头上
-You can get away if you run now. - You'll blame me for Leon.

554
00:32:09,563 --> 00:32:12,733
不  我会坦诚 我用我的电话杀了他
No, no, l' ll confess I shot him with my fucking phone.

555
00:32:12,858 --> 00:32:15,444
那么我得请你 记住一件事  史都
Well, then I urge you to keep one thing in mind, Stu.

556
00:32:15,528 --> 00:32:18,906
看看你的胸口  你知道 我的枪法有多准多狠
Take a look at your chest. You saw how accurate I can be, how lethal.

557
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:20,950
现在就杀了我吧 你可以逃之夭夭
Kill me now, and you give yourself away.

558
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:23,494
没有灭音装置我是逃不了的 那些家伙...
Not with a silencer. It would take these guys...

559
00:32:23,577 --> 00:32:27,039
得花上一整天的时间才能想通 这一枪不是他们的人开的
...the rest of the day to figure out it wasn't one of their own men that did it.

560
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,667
你可能会因为拿出皮夹这个动作 被打成蜂窝
You can be shot 4 1 times for pulling out your wallet.

561
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:33,754
放下你的武器 双手举高走出来
Throw down your weapon and come out with your hands raised.

562
00:32:33,796 --> 00:32:35,881
-别理他 -是啊  如果他们开枪呢?
-Ignore him. -Yeah, what if they open fire?.

563
00:32:36,006 --> 00:32:38,801
他们不会开枪 看看你的四周  史都
They won 't. Look around you, Stu.

564
00:32:38,884 --> 00:32:41,303
你看到那些 拿着摄影机的观光客了吗?
Do you see the tourists with the video cameras?

565
00:32:41,387 --> 00:32:43,222
他们希望警察 会开枪杀了你...
The ones hoping the cops will blow you away...

566
00:32:43,305 --> 00:32:46,266
那么他们就能销售这卷 最残忍的警匪枪击案录影带?
...so they can sell the tape to The Most Gory Police Shootouts?.

567
00:32:46,308 --> 00:32:49,103
别担心  他们会让警方 保持最完美的形象
Don't worry, they'll keep the police on their best behavior.

568
00:32:49,144 --> 00:32:54,441
只要你不采取敌对的行动 你应该可以平安无事
So long as you don't take hostile action, you should be safe.

569
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:56,068
平安?你觉得这样很安全吗?
Safe?. You call this safe?.

570
00:32:56,151 --> 00:33:00,614
一整个分局的警察 拿着枪指着我
I got a whole fucking precinct here with guns pointed my way.

571
00:33:01,114 --> 00:33:06,453
双手举高 慢慢地走出电话亭
With both hands raised, moving slowly, step out of the booth.

572
00:33:06,453 --> 00:33:09,373
如果发现你有使用武器的迹象 我们会立刻还击
If we see any signs of a weapon we will respond.

573
00:33:09,456 --> 00:33:11,208
你们不会那么做的  我没有武器
You won't because there isn't any!

574
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:13,335
把听筒放下 双手高举
Put down the phone and raise your hands!

575
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,629
听着  我办不到 我在讲一通很重要的电话
Look, I can't. I'm on an important call.

576
00:33:16,088 --> 00:33:17,714
请你仔细说明一次
Verify this information for me.

577
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:20,258
电话亭里的那个人 开枪杀了那边那个家伙...
The guy in the booth shot that guy over there...

578
00:33:20,342 --> 00:33:22,344
他一直待在电话亭里 讲电话
...and stuck around to make a phone call.

579
00:33:22,427 --> 00:33:25,013
对  那个妓女 是那么说的
Yeah, that's what the hookers are saying.

580
00:33:25,097 --> 00:33:27,766
好吧  把扩音器拿来
All right, give me the horn.

581
00:33:31,645 --> 00:33:36,691
-我命令你配合我们的指令 -我很忙  好吗?待会再来吧
-Sir! I'm ordering you to fully comply. -I'm busy, all right. Come back later.

582
00:33:36,691 --> 00:33:40,195
-非常好  史都 -快走出电话亭...
-Very good, Stu. -Step out of the booth...

583
00:33:40,195 --> 00:33:43,698
双手高举 我是在命令你
...and raise your hands. I am giving you an order.

584
00:33:43,698 --> 00:33:46,159
这里由我发号施令  对吧?史都
I give the orders here, Stu, don 't I?

585
00:33:46,284 --> 00:33:48,620
这家伙希望我们 杀了他  队长
This guy is looking for us to kill him, captain.

586
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:51,289
他想让警察杀了他? 喔  那是不可能的
Suicide by a cop?. Well, that's not gonna happen.

587
00:33:51,665 --> 00:33:53,416
快把尸体搬开
Get that body out of here fast.

588
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,919
派个人去搬开尸体 打电话叫救护车把尸体运走
Somebody get the body. Tell the ambulance to get the body.

589
00:33:56,503 --> 00:34:00,840
每天有好几千人死掉 但你把一具尸体...
Thousands of people die every day, but you put one dead body...

590
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,635
放在繁忙的街道中间 那会逼得大家抓狂
...in the middle of a busy street and it makes people crazy.

591
00:34:03,676 --> 00:34:09,265
看看这些家伙 你可以感觉到他们的恐惧
Look at these guys. You can smell the fear.

592
00:34:09,307 --> 00:34:13,603
-十个警察 -这让我想起了越南
-T en cops. - This reminds me of Nam.

593
00:34:13,603 --> 00:34:15,772
-越南? -没错  越南
-Vietnam?. - Yes, Vietnam.

594
00:34:15,855 --> 00:34:19,025
我那时还太小  无法从军 但我看过照片
I was too young to go, but l' ve seen pictures.

595
00:34:19,108 --> 00:34:23,071
照片无法表达出真相  史都 你无法想像那种恐惧跟压力
Well, pictures can 't do it, Stu. You can 't imagine the fear, the stench.

596
00:34:23,112 --> 00:34:26,949
遭到焚烧的尸体 孩子们把手榴弹丢进你的鞋子里
Napalm-charred bodies, children leaving grenades in your boots.

597
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:30,620
-你因为参战受到唾弃 -我回家后发现大家都朝我吐口水
-Then you got blamed for the war. -I came home and people spit on me.

598
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,955
对  这个国家 应该跟你道歉
Yeah, this country owes you an apology.

599
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:36,959
听着  我能够想像你还是个小孩子 从战场中回家的样子...
Look, I just had this vision of you, of a kid, coming back from the war...

600
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:40,755
你习惯杀人 没办法找到工作  与世隔绝
...inured to the killing, not able to get work, isolated.

601
00:34:40,755 --> 00:34:43,299
我想那会是一个很感人的故事...
I think that could be made into an affecting story...

602
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:45,718
你知道的 大家会了解这个故事
...and, you know, one that everyone understands.

603
00:34:45,802 --> 00:34:48,304
我想警察 也会站在你那一边
And I think cops are on the side of vets.

604
00:34:48,387 --> 00:34:51,974
你真的很可悲  史都 你为何不清醒一点?
You are pathetic, Stu. Why don't you wake up?

605
00:34:52,016 --> 00:34:56,020
被火焚烧的尸体 打越战时我已经五十岁了
Napalm-charred bodies? I'd have to be 50 to be in that war!

606
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,939
请你不要再误导我了
Stop fucking with my head, please!

607
00:34:58,189 --> 00:34:59,273
我得跟他谈谈
I'm gonna go talk to him.

608
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:01,233
我们应该等 特警队的谈判高手来
Shouldn't we wait on the ESU negotiator?.

609
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,695
他们二十分钟后才会到 我不想冒那个险
They could take 20 minutes. I'm not gonna take a chance on this one.

610
00:35:04,695 --> 00:35:06,113
我要亲自处理这件事
I'm gonna handle this.

611
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,659
先生  我现在要解除武装
Sir! I'm taking out my weapon.

612
00:35:10,659 --> 00:35:13,245
我会把枪放在车上
Putting my weapon down on the car.

613
00:35:13,287 --> 00:35:15,289
-队长要上了 -我没有武器
-The captain's going in. -I'm not armed.

614
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:18,667
-是啊  我也没有武器 -我叫做雷米
-Yeah, neither am l. -My name is Ramey.

615
00:35:18,709 --> 00:35:20,753
-爱德华雷米队长 -好吧
-Captain Ed Ramey. -All right.

616
00:35:20,795 --> 00:35:22,755
-你叫什么名字? -我不想跟你做朋友
-What's yours?. -I don't want to be friends.

617
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:26,050
我不知道 你看起来很需要朋友的帮助
I don't know. It looks like you could use a friend right now.

618
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:29,053
-告诉他你已经有朋友了 -我已经有朋友了
-Tell him you've already got a friend. -I already got a friend.

619
00:35:29,178 --> 00:35:30,262
你是指那个 跟你在通电话的人吗?
Is that who you're talking to on the phone?.

620
00:35:32,306 --> 00:35:35,059
听着  我只是想听听你的说法 就是那样而已
Look, I just want to hear your side of it. That's all.

621
00:35:35,184 --> 00:35:38,604
我什么都不会说 我也没有开枪杀人
I ain't got no side of it, and I didn't shoot anybody.

622
00:35:38,687 --> 00:35:40,648
你看到我身上有枪了吗? 你看
You see a fucking gun anywhere?. Look.

623
00:35:40,731 --> 00:35:43,525
枪就在你的后裤袋里 我看到了  他....
It's in your back pocket! I see it! He been....

624
00:35:45,194 --> 00:35:48,155
先生  你的口袋里 有武器吗?
Sir, do you have the weapon in your pocket?.

625
00:35:48,238 --> 00:35:52,076
没有  我只有一只移动电话 跟香烟  我没有枪
No. I got a cell phone and I got cigarettes. I got no fucking weapon.

626
00:35:52,076 --> 00:35:54,912
你为什么要在电话亭里 打公用电话?
Then what are you doing in a phone booth making calls?.

627
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:57,456
-你想看看吗?看吧 -嘿
-You want to see it?. Here. -Hey!

628
00:35:57,706 --> 00:35:59,625
别乱动  大家别开枪
Don't reach for that! Hold your fire!

629
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:02,753
你不必那么做 我知道里面有什么东西
I don't need to see it. I know what's there.

630
00:36:02,836 --> 00:36:06,340
有很多目击证人 看到你开枪
I got plenty of witnesses over here who saw you use it.

631
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:08,342
他们什么都没看到 因为我没有开枪
They didn't see it because it didn't happen!

632
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:12,054
-叫他们闭嘴 -他死了  你说你没有开枪
-Shut them up! -He's dead, but it didn't happen?.

633
00:36:12,095 --> 00:36:15,641
-那么是谁开的枪呢? -别告诉他  史都
-Then who did it?. -Mustn't tell him, Stu.

634
00:36:15,682 --> 00:36:18,226
-我不知道 -你是跟他距离最近的人
-I don't know. -You were the closest one to him.

635
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,687
-你一定看到了整个经过  帮帮我 -不
-You must've saw it happen. Help me. -No.

636
00:36:20,729 --> 00:36:24,566
-这家伙害我觉得很紧张 -听着  你别管这件事
-This guy is getting on my nerves. -Look, stay the fuck out of this.

637
00:36:24,608 --> 00:36:26,610
你到底在跟什么人 通电话?
Who do you keep talking to on the phone?.

638
00:36:26,735 --> 00:36:29,863
-没什么 -你的朋友、父母还是你的爱人?
-Nobody. -Your friend, your parent, your lover?.

639
00:36:29,863 --> 00:36:33,742
-谁? -小心点  史都华
-Who?. -Careful, Stuart. Careful.

640
00:36:33,742 --> 00:36:35,827
我的心理医生
My psychiatrist.

641
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:40,332
-太棒了  我该想到这一点的 -我懂了  你的医生叫什么名字?
-Excellent. I should've thought of that. -I see. What' s this doctor' s name?.

642
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:42,500
如果我们知道他是谁 那能帮我们一个大忙
It would be really helpful to us if we knew.

643
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:46,379
他叫我不要告诉你  好吗? 这是私人的秘密
He says not to tell you, all right?. It's privileged information.

644
00:36:46,379 --> 00:36:48,840
非常好  史都华 看吧  你已经开始上手了
Very good, Stuart. See, now you're having fun.

645
00:36:48,882 --> 00:36:52,636
-是啊  随便你怎么说 -我尊重你的隐私权
-Yeah, whatever you fucking say. -I respect your right to privacy.

646
00:36:52,761 --> 00:36:56,431
我也看过心理医生 那是局里的安排
I've been through therapy myself. The department provided it for me.

647
00:36:56,431 --> 00:36:59,934
我知道当警察的人不应该这么说 但有时候...
I know it's not good form for a cop to be saying that, but sometimes...

648
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:04,314
你知道的  环境、压力-- 我也有问题  因此赔掉了我的婚姻
...you know, circumstances, stress-- I had issues. I lost my marriage over it.

649
00:37:04,606 --> 00:37:07,067
叫他别再靠近
Tell him not to come any closer.

650
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:10,403
别再靠近我  快停下来 退后几步
Don't come any closer. Stop there. Go back a few steps.

651
00:37:10,445 --> 00:37:12,697
-退回刚刚的地方 -好的  没问题
-Go back to where you were! -Okay. No problem.

652
00:37:12,781 --> 00:37:16,659
-好了 -你有一些私人问题
-That's right. -So you got some intimacy issues.

653
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:20,538
我也一样  我只想知道 到底发生了什么事?
I got those too. All I want to know is, what happened, man?.

654
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:24,584
-叫他念你的权利给你听 -念我的权利给我听
-Tell him to read you your rights. -I want you to read me my rights.

655
00:37:24,584 --> 00:37:26,419
别再问问题
Stop asking questions.

656
00:37:26,961 --> 00:37:30,256
你有权保持沉默 你有权聘请律师
You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney.

657
00:37:30,423 --> 00:37:34,052
如果你请不起律师 政府会帮你请一个律师
If you cannot afford one, an attorney will be provided for you.

658
00:37:34,093 --> 00:37:37,847
好吗?现在你至少得告诉我 你叫什么名字?
All right?. So now, can you at least give me your first name?.

659
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,974
-只要告诉我你叫什么名字就好 -别告诉他
-Just your first name. -Don't tell him.

660
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:43,478
我有权不告诉你 我的名字
It' s my right not to have any first name.

661
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,355
-你没有枪  也不说出你的名字 -没错
-No gun, no name. -That's right.

662
00:37:46,439 --> 00:37:50,067
-你非常清楚自己的权利 -叫他把你的律师找来
-You're highly underprivileged. -Demand your lawyer.

663
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:51,944
把我的律师找来  好吗?
And go get my lawyer too. All right?.

664
00:37:52,028 --> 00:37:55,156
我要请律师到这里来 洽谈我要投降的事
I want an attorney brought down here to negotiate my surrender.

665
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,825
-这一招太聪明了  史都 -我了解  但是...
-Just brilliant, Stu. -I understand that, but...

666
00:37:57,867 --> 00:38:01,329
要请律师冒着生命危险 到这里来真的是很困难
...it' s gonna be difficult to get a lawyer to come and risk his life.

667
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:03,706
-一旦你把枪交出来-- -我怎么办得到?
-Once you hand over the gun-- -How can l?.

668
00:38:03,831 --> 00:38:06,042
你根本不让我把手 放进我的口袋里
You won't let me put my hand in my pocket?.

669
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:09,295
我们会帮你把枪拿出来 现在你要做的事...
We'll take it out for you. All you have to do...

670
00:38:09,337 --> 00:38:13,549
就是高举双手乖乖地走出来 你不会有事的
...is step out with your hands raised. Nothing will happen to you.

671
00:38:13,549 --> 00:38:15,634
-这是行不通的 -史都
-It's not gonna work. -Stu, Stu.

672
00:38:15,718 --> 00:38:17,261
-什么? -问他一个问题
-What?. -Ask him a question.

673
00:38:17,386 --> 00:38:20,347
他太太是不是厌倦了 跟他上床呢?
Ask him if his wife got tired of sleeping with him.

674
00:38:20,389 --> 00:38:25,019
-我....该死  我办不到 -你绝对办得到  史都
-l.... Fuck. I can' t do that. -Oh, sure you can, Stu.

675
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:27,897
问他是不是不举 他是不是无法满足她
Ask him if he couldn 't get it up, if he couldn 't satisfy her.

676
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,733
-你想离开那个电话亭吗? -不行  我办不到
-Are you gonna step out of the booth?. -I can't. No.

677
00:38:30,858 --> 00:38:34,612
-你不想离开那个电话亭吗? -快问他
-You' re not stepping out of the booth?. -Ask him.

00:38:34,653 --> 00:38:38,115
-你不愿意吗? -快问他
-ls that a no?. -Ask him!

679
00:38:38,407 --> 00:38:41,160
-这攸关你们两个的性命安全 -先生
-Both your lives depend on it. -Sir?.

680
00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:48,167
队长  你无法满足 你太太的性欲吗?
Captain, you couldn' t satisfy your wife sexually?.

681
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,590
-你说什么? -问他现在会不会自慰?
-Excuse me?. -Ask him if he abuses himself now?

682
00:38:54,631 --> 00:38:57,718
-他会不会在寂寞的夜晚自慰? -去你的  我的天啊
-Does he masturbate on lonely nights? -Fuck. For God's sake!

Say it!

684
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:05,720
快问他  不然我要杀了他
Say it or I will blow him away!

685
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:08,545
-你现在都靠自慰吗? -嘿
-So do you whack off now?. -Hey!

686
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,093
我会去帮你 把律师找来  好吗?
I'm gonna see about that lawyer for you, okay?.

687
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:18,805
-好的 -放轻松
-Yes. -Just relax.

688
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:24,186
-史都  我想你伤了他的心 -我要知道是谁在跟他通电话
-Stu, I think you hurt his feelings. -I wanna know who' s on that phone.

689
00:39:24,186 --> 00:39:28,774
找技术人员过来 我要知道那个人到底是谁
I want a techie here. I need to talk to somebody about that phone.

690
00:39:28,774 --> 00:39:32,152
你觉得我们太过份了吗?史都华 我们应该投降吗?
Do you think we went too far, Stuart? Should we give ourselves up?

691
00:39:32,194 --> 00:39:34,696
或许我该请人 来洽谈我投降的事
Maybe I'd like someone to negotiate my surrender.

692
00:39:34,738 --> 00:39:38,325
-我相信我们能解决这件事 -我不把自己的命交给别人处理
-I'm sure we can work that out. -I won't just spill my guts to anyone.

Why the fuck would Larry King come here?.

696

Because you're friends. Who else could you get, huh?

701
00:40:05,352 --> 00:40:09,439
面对现实吧  你是个无名小卒 你的信用已经破产
Face it, Stu, you're smalltime. And you've got a credibility problem.

702
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:12,359
你不必担心 我的信用问题  好吗?
Don' t fucking worry about my credibility! All right?.

703
00:40:12,442 --> 00:40:14,319

You couldn't do this for your clients if your life depended on it.

706
00:40:22,827 --> 00:40:25,330

-They' re here to cover me dying. -How ungrateful.

709

那些摄影机会让警察 格外地谨慎
Those cameras will make the police very careful.

710
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:38,009
-快为他们笑一个 -你可以听到他们的通话内容吗?
-So come on, smile a little for them. -Can you tap into that phone call?.

711
00:40:38,009 --> 00:40:39,802
-那应该不是问题 -但是...
-Should be no problem. -Except...

712
00:40:39,886 --> 00:40:43,598
我们得先拿到许可令 若他真是跟他的心理医生通电话

Look, tracing, that's not a violation, right?.

715

-只要我们不监听就行了 -好吧  就这么办吧
-As long as we don't listen in. -Okay, this is what I want you to do.

I want you to find who he's talking to and their current location.

You're the man, Stuart. You're the center of attention.

721
00:41:08,748 --> 00:41:13,419
这将会成为全国性的新闻 ABC  CBS  CNN  UPN....
Wait till this goes national: ABC, CBS, CNN, UPN....

722
00:41:13,419 --> 00:41:15,922
所有的电视台 都会播出你的新闻  史都
You're gonna hit the whole alphabet, Stu.

723
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:18,090
再过一个星期大家就会忘了我
I' ll be forgotten about in a week.

724
00:41:18,215 --> 00:41:20,593
没有人会记得 受害者的姓名
No one ever remembers the names of the victims.

725
00:41:20,676 --> 00:41:24,597
反而是凶手可以登上 时代杂志封面  对吧?
It's the killers that get the cover of Time magazine. Right?.

726
00:41:24,597 --> 00:41:29,101
好好想一想  你会成为名人 泰德邦迪  约翰韦恩嘉西...
Think about it. You'd be famous. Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy...

727
00:41:29,101 --> 00:41:31,896
还有该死的杰佛瑞达莫 说个受害者的名字  你一定办不到
...fucking Jeffrey Dahmer. Name a victim. You can't.

728
00:41:31,937 --> 00:41:34,815
总之我不配 成为众人注目的焦点
Anyway, I don't deserve to be the center of attention.

729
00:41:34,899 --> 00:41:38,360
-他们要报导的人应该是你 -我不喜欢受人注目
-lt ought to be you they're covering. -That attention would embarrass me.

730
00:41:38,402 --> 00:41:42,323
-我知道他们有多期待报导这件事 -恐惧如何启发你的创意?
-I know exactly the spin to put on this. -How terror inspires your creativity?

731
00:41:42,323 --> 00:41:46,410
听着  这只是媒体的狂热 好吗?你可以请来芭芭拉华特丝...
Listen, this could be a media frenzy, all right?. You'd get Barbara Walters...

732
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,829
你还能请来赖利金 如果你还对他有兴趣
...I mean, Larry King if you still wanted him.

733
00:41:48,913 --> 00:41:53,876
那似乎代表着 我应该放过你  乖乖地投降
That approach seems predicated upon me surrendering without killing you.

734
00:41:55,002 --> 00:41:59,173
听着  我们能帮你争取到同情 还能请来作家帮你写书
Listen, we can make you sympathetic, sit with a writer, bang out a book.

735
00:41:59,173 --> 00:42:03,761
还能帮你拍电影 让所有的美国人支持你
You know, movie of the week. Get America on your side.

736
00:42:03,761 --> 00:42:06,805
好吧  你杀了理昂 因为他想杀我
All right, you killed Leon because he was gonna kill me.

737
00:42:06,847 --> 00:42:09,892
你为了保护我所以杀了理昂 好吗?
You killed Leon to protect me. All right?.

738
00:42:09,975 --> 00:42:13,145
在一个谁都不理谁的城市里 你勇敢地挺身而出
In a city where nobody looks out for anybody, you took a stand.

739
00:42:13,187 --> 00:42:14,563
我是你最好的证人
I'm your best witness.

740
00:42:14,688 --> 00:42:17,983
你要我相信你 可以帮我全身而退?
So you want me to trust you to get me out of this?

741
00:42:18,025 --> 00:42:21,361
没错  我要你相信我 相信我
Yes, I do. I want you to trust me. Trust me.

742
00:42:21,403 --> 00:42:25,657
史都  你一定以为我疯了
Stu, you must think I'm crazy.

743
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:39,004
-该死  布拉曼来了 -我会应付他
-Oh, shit. Here comes Braman. -l' ll take care of him.

744
00:42:40,213 --> 00:42:43,550
你们应该等我到了之后 再开始跟嫌犯展开接触
Hey. Should' ve waited for me to initiate contact with the suspect.

745
00:42:43,592 --> 00:42:45,927
我已经跟嫌犯说过话 需要你帮忙的话我会告诉你
I established a rapport. Let you know if I need help.

746
00:42:46,011 --> 00:42:47,929
你是想上电视吗?
Are you grandstanding for TV cameras?.

747
00:42:48,055 --> 00:42:50,891
还是你想把这件事 交给专家来办呢?
Or do you want to leave this to a professional?.

748
00:42:50,974 --> 00:42:53,643
在专家还没有到之前 我会亲自处理这件事
Until a professional gets here, I'll handle it.

749
00:42:53,769 --> 00:42:58,398
你是个风趣的家伙  好吧 如果有人因此丧命  你也完了
You're a funny guy. All right, you get somebody else killed, it's on your head.

750
00:42:58,398 --> 00:43:00,609
你懂吗?
Got it?.

751
00:43:00,734 --> 00:43:03,904
我打算这么做  好吗? 城市饭店在这里
This is what I want to do, okay?. This is the City Hotel here.

752
00:43:03,945 --> 00:43:08,199
我要派三个人守在大厅 这里派五个神枪手
I want three guys in the lobby here. And five sharpshooters up here.

753
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:10,368
想办法派两个神枪手 守在地铁站
See if you can get me two in the subway.

754
00:43:12,203 --> 00:43:14,539
搞什么?
What the fuck?.

755
00:43:15,165 --> 00:43:18,460
-你不打算接电话吗? -不行  我不能碰电话
-Not going to answer it? -I can't. I can't reach for the phone.

756
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:21,004
-警察会以为我要拔枪 -我敢说一定是凯莉打来的
-The cops will think it's a gun. -I'll bet it's Kelly.

757
00:43:21,087 --> 00:43:23,673
她或许听说了整件事 她一定非常担心你
She's probably heard what you did. She's sick with worry.

758
00:43:23,757 --> 00:43:25,967
我没有办法让她安心 对吧?
I'm not gonna make her feel any better, am l?.

759
00:43:26,051 --> 00:43:28,678
喔  你可以请她 原谅你  史都华
Well, you could ask her to forgive you, Stuart.

760
00:43:28,762 --> 00:43:34,100
你可以坦诚你犯过的错 求她原谅你  让你放下心中的重担
You could confess your sins and beg for absolution, come clean.

761
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,853
你会落到这个地步 就是因为你没有说实话
You're in this position because you're not telling the truth.

762
00:43:36,895 --> 00:43:38,855
我会落到这个地步 因为你手上有枪
I' m in this position because you got a gun!

763
00:43:38,938 --> 00:43:43,818
不  史都华  这是你的罪 你惯于逃避现实跟欺骗
No. Stuart, that is the sin of spin. Avoidance and deception.

764
00:43:43,818 --> 00:43:48,615
我给了你机会改过自新 快告诉她吧
You're being given a chance here to make things right. Now, talk to her.

765
00:43:48,615 --> 00:43:52,869
-听着  我办不到  求求你 -我要你接电话
-Look, I can' t. Please. -I am telling you to answer that phone!

766
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,997
-对不起 -你不能过去
-Excuse me! Excuse me! -You can' t cross in front of here!

767
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,124
快接电话
Answer it!

768
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:01,919
-听着  我办不到  求求你 -别逼我伤害你
-Look, I can' t. Please. -Don 't make me hurt you!

769
00:44:02,003 --> 00:44:04,589
-跟你太太说话 -那不是她打来的电话
-Talk to your wife! -lt' s not her calling.

770
00:44:04,672 --> 00:44:11,304
-你怎么能那么肯定? -电话是你打来的  你这个混蛋
-How can you be so sure? -lt' s you. It' s you, you miserable fuck!

771
00:44:11,304 --> 00:44:15,224
该死  你逮到我了 你还是能让我对你刮目相看
Damn, you got me! You continue to impress.

772
00:44:15,224 --> 00:44:17,560
你可以开枪杀了我 但你希望动手的人是他们
You could shoot me, but you want them to do it!

773
00:44:17,643 --> 00:44:19,395
-没错  那是个好方法 -是啊
- Yes, well, that's an option. -Yeah.

774
00:44:19,562 --> 00:44:21,188
-队长 -什么事?
-Captain. -Yeah?.

775
00:44:21,314 --> 00:44:23,816
这位女士说那家伙是她丈夫 这是她的身份证
This lady says the perp' s her husband. Here' s her lD.

776
00:44:23,941 --> 00:44:27,194
-我看到新闻时只觉得不可思议 -你觉得他是在跟谁通电话呢?
-I couldn't believe when I saw this. -Who do you think he's talking to?.

777
00:44:27,278 --> 00:44:32,908
我不知道  今天稍早 我跟他通过电话  我告诉他...
I don't know. I spoke to him earlier today and I told him...

778
00:44:32,908 --> 00:44:35,828
-有个男人打电话给我 -有男人打电话给你
-...that there was a man who called me. -A man?.

779
00:44:35,911 --> 00:44:38,456
你跟别的男人说话 让他觉得很生气吗?
Did this upset him, that you were talking to other men?.

780
00:44:38,581 --> 00:44:42,626
对  他的确很生气 但事情不是你想的那样
Yes, he did seem a little upset, but it's, no-- It's not like that.

781
00:44:42,626 --> 00:44:46,714
-我根本不知道那个人是谁 -他的心理医生是谁?
-I didn't even know who this guy was. -Who's his psychiatrist?.

782
00:44:46,756 --> 00:44:49,467
-他没有心理医生 -那只是你看到的那一面
-He doesn't have one. -That you know of.

783
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:51,300
我认识他三年  跟他结婚一年
I've been with him three years, married for one.

784
00:44:51,593 --> 00:44:53,637
如果他在看心理医生我一定会知道
I'd know if he was in therapy.

785
00:44:53,637 --> 00:44:56,640
我祈祷他最好有在看心理医生 我是离婚后才开始去看心理医生
I wish to God he had been. I saw somebody after my divorce.

786
00:44:56,682 --> 00:44:59,768
他阻止我拿起枪 做出我会遗憾的事
It kept me from picking up a gun, doing something I would regret.

787
00:44:59,852 --> 00:45:03,314
-听我说  史都没有杀人 -女士  在现在的情况下...
-Look, Stu didn't kill anyone. -Ma'am, under the circumstances...

788
00:45:03,355 --> 00:45:07,026
你得好好想想你的丈夫 是不是你认识的那个人
...you need to consider whether your husband is who you thought he was.

789
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:10,237
因为根据现场目击证人的说法 他有一把枪...
'Cause according to these witnesses over here, he has a gun...

790
00:45:10,279 --> 00:45:13,866
他用那把枪杀人  我们得祈祷 他不会再使用那把枪
...he has used that gun and let's pray to God that he doesn't use it again.

791
00:45:13,907 --> 00:45:15,117
队长
Captain?.

792
00:45:15,284 --> 00:45:19,246
如果你想到他会有什么问题 请你一定要告诉我
If you can think of any dispute he's having currently, please, tell me.

793
00:45:19,246 --> 00:45:23,750
我们撤空了城市饭店 我可以在电话亭附近布置狙击小组
We're clearing City Hotel. I can stage an assault unit within feet of the booth.

794
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:27,379
还能在电话亭上方 安排狙击手
We've also got sharpshooters securing rooftop positions.

795
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:29,882
-你们就定位后通知我一声 -没问题
-Let me know when you're in position. -Absolutely.

796

电话来源追踪得如何了?
What about that wire tap?.

797
00:45:31,508 --> 00:45:34,636
我们正在努力中 你得等上一阵子  好吗?
We're working on it. You gotta hold tight a while, all right?.

798
00:45:34,678 --> 00:45:37,556
-没问题 -好吧
-Yeah, no problem. No problem. -Okay.

799

你太太就在我身边
I have your wife with me.

805
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,413
所以你才会知道电话不是她打的 你骗了我
That's how you knew she wasn't calling. You deceived me.

806
00:46:01,496 --> 00:46:03,498
-史都 -她不是我太太

听着  她不是我太太
Look, she' s not my wife!

810
00:46:11,798 --> 00:46:15,802
她是个该死的烂演员 我没办法捧红她  她就一直缠着我
She' s some fucked-up, failed actress I wouldn't handle. She's stalking me!

811
00:46:15,844 --> 00:46:18,888
这不是你自己编的吧? 你是他太太  对吧?
You aren't making this up?. You are his wife, right?.

812
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:22,767

00:47:44,849 --> 00:47:47,226
你没事吧?
You okay?.

839
00:47:47,768 --> 00:47:50,646
我没事
Yeah, I'm fine.

840
00:47:51,021 --> 00:47:53,691
你以为她不知道 她被盯上了吗?
You'd think she didn't know she was being watched.

841
00:47:53,816 --> 00:47:57,486
-什么? -美女们总是心里有数
-What?. -But beautiful women always know.

842
00:47:57,528 --> 00:48:01,365
-你是指凯莉吗? -她们都摆出趾高气扬的样子...
-You talking about Kelly?. -That false indifference, superior air...

843
00:48:01,407 --> 00:48:05,035
那只是她们勾引男人的方法 她们希望别人能注意她们
...it's just a tease. They want eyes on them.

844
00:48:05,077 --> 00:48:08,581
她为什么化妆 做头发  打扮的漂漂亮亮的?
Why does she put on her makeup, do her hair, dress so nicely?

845
00:48:08,622 --> 00:48:10,916
这不是为了 她很少能看到的丈夫
Not for her husband that she hardly ever sees.

846
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:14,128
不  她希望别人能注意到她 我就注意到她了
No, it's for somebody else to notice. I notice.

847
00:48:14,295 --> 00:48:16,964
你在做什么? 离她远一点  别去烦她
What are you doing?. Stay away from her. Leave her alone.

848
00:48:17,006 --> 00:48:19,174
我要完成她的心愿
I'm giving her what she wants.

849
00:48:19,258 --> 00:48:23,512
我敢说你从来没有像我这样 注意过凯莉
I bet you've never looked at Kelly the way I am right now.

850
00:48:25,431 --> 00:48:28,851
-你休想伤害她 -我真的不敢吗?
-Don't you dare fucking hurt her. -Don't I dare?

851
00:48:28,892 --> 00:48:30,894
伤害她的人 不是我  史都华
I'm not the one who has hurt her, Stuart.

852
00:48:30,978 --> 00:48:33,939
他们不知道我们打算 怎么对付他们  对吧?
What they can't know is what we do to them in our minds. Right?

853
00:48:34,022 --> 00:48:37,192
-你这个大变态 -最完美的犯罪手法
-You sick fuck! -The perfect violation.

854
00:48:39,111 --> 00:48:41,154
-别把她扯进这件事来 -你有多少次...
-Leave her out of this. -How many times...

855
00:48:41,238 --> 00:48:46,201
心里头想着要跟潘 在那间饭店的房间里做爱呢?
...have you had sex with Pam in that hotel bedroom in your head?

856
00:48:46,201 --> 00:48:50,122
凯莉不在后 你真的会想念她吗?
Would you really miss Kelly if she was gone?

857
00:48:50,372 --> 00:48:54,001
够了  我受不了了 我不会再跟你说话
That's it. Not another word. I'm not talking to you.

858
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:56,211
你选择赌上 其他人的生命
Your choices put other people in jeopardy.

859
00:48:56,294 --> 00:48:59,464
你什么时候才会学到教训?
When are you gonna learn that?

860
00:48:59,548 --> 00:49:03,468
太好笑了  史都华  你好好看清楚
This is funny. Stuart, look uptown.

861
00:49:03,468 --> 00:49:07,389
这些天才还在电信箱边 试着要监听我们的谈话
These geniuses are still at the juncture box trying to tap in.

862
00:49:07,389 --> 00:49:11,059
但我在电话线的两端 装上了加密装置
Only I have installed an encryption device at both ends of the line.

863
00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:12,853
他们根本无法找到我在哪里...
There 's no chance of a trap trace...

864
00:49:12,936 --> 00:49:17,941
他们拼了老命 想把监听设备装上去  那太可悲了
...so now they've gotta try some fancy LoJack instrument. It's really sad.

865
00:49:17,941 --> 00:49:21,111
希望你没有把希望 放在那些笨蛋身上
I hope you weren 't pinning your hopes on those morons.

866
00:49:21,152 --> 00:49:24,197
事实上我是用伪造的号码 用无线传输跟你通话
Truth is, I'm on a wireless A.D. S. with a cloned number.

867
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,535
他们得花上半个小时 才知道是我是从费城发话
It'll take a half an hour to find out I call forwarded through Philadelphia.

868
00:49:28,535 --> 00:49:33,206
我得告诉你一件事 在他们还没有找到我前就会结束
And let me tell you, this will all be over before they can get a dial tone.

869
00:49:33,248 --> 00:49:36,835
我们无法追踪或接听他们的通话 电话线全部缠成一团
We can' t get a trace or break into the line. It' s like a ball of rubber bands.

870
00:49:36,876 --> 00:49:40,422
我就知道这个案子不太对劲 你继续去想办法
I knew there was something weird about this. You keep working on it.

871
00:49:47,387 --> 00:49:50,849
史都  史都华  少来了 你这么做太孩子气了
Stu. Stuart, come on, you're behaving like a child.

872
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:52,725
你还是不愿意 跟我说话吗?
Still gonna give me the silent treatment?

873
00:49:52,892 --> 00:49:57,105
喂  史都华  别这么做  拜托你 少来了
Hello. Stuart, don 't do this, please. Come on.

874
00:49:57,105 --> 00:49:59,941
我高贵的妈妈以前常这样对我 她总是用这一招来对付我
My sainted mother used to do this. She used to dish this out.

875
00:49:59,983 --> 00:50:02,610
史都华  求求你别这么做
Stuart, please don 't do this.

876
00:50:02,694 --> 00:50:06,072
史都华  你害我想起 我那不快乐的童年
Stuart, you're bringing back my unhappy childhood.

877
00:50:06,114 --> 00:50:11,577
史都华  跟我说话  拜托你 我受不了了  史都  求求你--
Stuart, talk to me! Please, talk to me! I can 't take it! Stu, please--

878
00:50:12,203 --> 00:50:14,914
我是开玩笑的 我的童年非常快乐
I'm kidding. I had a very happy childhood.

879
00:50:14,956 --> 00:50:19,627
又是我们的大美女 我本来不打算要杀她...
Hey, there 's our girl again. I wasn 't planning on killing her...

880
00:50:19,627 --> 00:50:22,296
但我的计划有变
...but plans change.

881
00:50:23,005 --> 00:50:25,133
告诉我 你到底要我做什么
Just tell me what the fuck you want from me.

882
00:50:25,216 --> 00:50:29,595
喂  你还在啊 我还以为我又在自言自语
Hello. There you are. I thought I was talking to myself again.

883
00:50:29,595 --> 00:50:32,265
你有什么心愿我都会帮你完成 说吧
Anything you want. I'll do it. Just tell me.

884
00:50:32,348 --> 00:50:38,104
告诉凯莉你的真面目 还有你的小爱人
Tell Kelly about the real Stu, about your little motel.

885
00:50:38,104 --> 00:50:42,650
-那样子你就会放了我们吗? -有何不可呢?
-And then you' ll let us go?. -Why not?

886
00:50:45,528 --> 00:50:47,571
-凯莉 -这是个好的开始
-Kelly! -That's a start.

887
00:50:47,655 --> 00:50:49,407
-亲爱的 -把她拉回来
-Baby! -Hold her back!

888
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:50,866
-嘿 -跟我说话
-Hey! -Talk to me!

889
00:50:50,991 --> 00:50:53,369
-抓住她  把她拉回来 -什么事?
-Grab her! Keep her back! -Yes?.

890
00:50:53,494 --> 00:50:54,787
我在听你说
I'm listening.

891
00:50:56,247 --> 00:50:57,915
凯莉  我打电话给一个女人
Kelly, I called some woman.

892
00:50:58,874 --> 00:51:01,335
-每天都打 -每天都打
-Every day. -Every day.

893
00:51:01,418 --> 00:51:06,090
我被这个女人吸引 我打电话给她....
I was attracted to this other woman. And I called her and....

894
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:12,555
-我想上她 -我想跟她上床
-I wanted to fuck her. -And I wanted to sleep with her.

895
00:51:13,347 --> 00:51:19,103
不  我想上她
No. I wanted to fuck her.

896
00:51:21,397 --> 00:51:27,444
-快说 -我想上她
-Say it. Say it! -And I wanted to fuck her.

897
00:51:27,444 --> 00:51:33,742
-对不起 -不论你做了什么我都不在乎
-l' m sorry. -Whatever you did, I don' t care.

898
00:51:33,742 --> 00:51:37,162
请你快点出来 好吗?
Please, just come out of the booth. Okay?.

899
00:51:37,162 --> 00:51:42,000
那就是我做的好事 对不起
That' s all I did. That' s all I did. I'm sorry.

900
00:51:44,419 --> 00:51:48,215
好吧  我已经照你的话去做 我已经受够了
All right, I've done what you asked. That's it. I've had enough of this.

901
00:51:48,298 --> 00:51:50,550
我还没有玩完
I haven't.

902
00:51:50,634 --> 00:51:56,014
-你说过你会放了我们 -我改变了心意
-You said you'd let us go. -I changed my mind.

903
00:51:56,098 --> 00:51:59,184
你这个大混蛋  你不能这么做 你不能这么对我
You miserable fuck. You can't do this. You can't do this to me.

904
00:51:59,226 --> 00:52:02,896
听着  我照你说的去做 你要我做的事我都做了
Look, I took all your shit. I did everything you fucking asked.

905
00:52:02,938 --> 00:52:04,523
你骗我 我受够了
You lied to me. I'm done with this.

906
00:52:04,648 --> 00:52:09,027
你真的受够了 你想做什么随便你  再见
I've fucking had enough. You can go fuck yourself! Later.

907
00:52:09,236 --> 00:52:11,655
-他挂掉电话了 -或许他们决定要投降了
-He hung up. -Maybe they already got a trace.

908
00:52:11,738 --> 00:52:14,533
特警队
ESU, ESU?.

909
00:52:17,953 --> 00:52:19,913
-我要投降了 -他出来了
-I'm giving myself up! -He's coming out!

910
00:52:19,996 --> 00:52:22,707
-小心 -我要看到你丢掉武器
-Heads up! -I want to see you toss away your weapon!

911
00:52:22,958 --> 00:52:25,752
把武器丢到电话亭外面 待在原地别动
Throw the weapon outside the booth! Stay where you are!

912
00:52:26,169 --> 00:52:29,214
-先缴械 -别伤害他  求求你们
-First, the weapon! -Don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him!

913
00:52:29,297 --> 00:52:31,967
-我没有枪 -待在原地别动
-There's no fucking gun! -Stay right where you are!

我要你转身  十指交握 放在头后面  好吗?
I want you to turn around. Interlock your fingers behind your head. Okay?.

915
00:52:38,515 --> 00:52:42,352
-求求你把枪给他们 -凯莉  不
-Please give them the gun! -Kelly, no!

916
00:52:42,936 --> 00:52:45,772

919
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:55,031

920
00:52:55,198 --> 00:52:57,158
不要动
Freeze! Don't move.

921
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,661
快停火

924
00:53:08,211 --> 00:53:11,589
-快停火 -拜托你们
-Hold. Hold. -Please.

925
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:15,718
-去接电话吧 -你在搞什么?
-Go ahead. Answer it. -What the fuck are you doing?.

926
00:53:15,802 --> 00:53:17,679
他要出来了
He's coming out!

927
00:53:18,179 --> 00:53:19,555
快接电话
Answer the phone.

928
00:53:24,477 --> 00:53:27,230
-你这个懦夫 -嗨  史都
-You fucking coward. -Hi, Stu.

929
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:31,317
你刚刚发了一顿脾气 说了一些气话...
Now, you've had your little tantrum and you said some things in anger...

930
00:53:31,317 --> 00:53:33,611
我愿意忘了这一切
... that I am willing to forget.

931
00:53:34,904 --> 00:53:37,490
带她回车上去 我要她待在车子里
Get her back in the car! I want her in the car.

932
00:53:37,573 --> 00:53:40,493
如果他不是凶手 凶手会是谁呢?
If he's not the shooter, then who the fuck is?.

933
00:53:44,163 --> 00:53:46,582
队长  那通电话 到底是怎么一回事?
Captain, what the fuck is up with the phone calls?.

934
00:53:46,707 --> 00:53:48,417
-我们可以重新来过吗? -你说谎
-So can we start over? -You lied.

935
00:53:48,501 --> 00:53:51,879
除非自己遭到背叛 不然你不会知道被背叛的痛苦
You can't know the pain of betrayal until you've been betrayed.

936
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:54,840
凶手就在附近的建筑物里 我要你去跟特警队谈谈
Sniper in one of these buildings. I want you to talk to ESU.

937
00:53:54,882 --> 00:53:57,385
我要你找到 躲在建筑物里的凶手
I want you to get one of these guys, this building.

938
00:53:57,468 --> 00:54:02,014
挨家挨户地搜索 直到你找到那家伙为止  好吗?
Start looking up there from window to window till you find the perp. Okay?.

939
00:54:02,014 --> 00:54:06,185
我要你安静 而且迅速地展开行动  好吗?
I want you to do it quickly, and I want you to do it quietly. All right?.

940
00:54:08,145 --> 00:54:09,730
特警队的指挥官在哪里?
Where's the ESU sergeant?.

941
00:54:09,939 --> 00:54:11,315
你说过我们可以离开的
You said we could go.

942
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:13,651
-你说过你会放了我们 -别激动  史都华
-You said you'd let us go. -Relax, Stuart.

943
00:54:13,734 --> 00:54:15,778
没有人能第一次就做好
Nobody gets it right the first time.

944
00:54:15,861 --> 00:54:19,531
你已经表现的比其他人好了 你会有机会结束这一切
You've done better than others. You will get a chance to end this.

945
00:54:19,573 --> 00:54:22,159
-我只是还没有玩够 -我玩够了
-I'm just not finished yet. -Yeah, well, I am.

946
00:54:22,242 --> 00:54:24,536
-你没有筹码能留下我 -除了对死亡的恐惧吗?
-There' s nothing keeping me. -Besides the fear of death?

947
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:27,081
我可以低头躲过你的射击 我可以全身而退
I dive out and you've got one shot. I'm gonna be dancing.

948
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:30,751
-你以为你能打中我吗? -我可以找几个靶子来练习
-You think you can get me?. -I could go for some target practice.

949
00:54:30,793 --> 00:54:32,000
你只要一开枪  他们就能找到你 
One shot, they look for you.

950
00:54:32,148 --> 00:54:33,504
你开了第二枪就等于送自己上西天
Second shot, you give yourself away.

951
00:54:33,587 --> 00:54:35,547
动手吧  史都华  挂掉电话
Go on, Stuart, hang up!

952
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:39,009
把你的生命交给那些 带着自动武器的警察
Trust your fate to friendly men in flak jackets with automatic weapons.

953
00:54:39,343 --> 00:54:43,555
我相信你可以解释 为什么那个家伙会死掉
I'm sure you can patch up that little misunderstanding about the dead body.

954
00:54:43,555 --> 00:54:46,099
-警察无法证明我杀了人 -你有杀人动机
-Cops can' t prove I killed anyone. - You had motive.

955
00:54:46,183 --> 00:54:48,810
-他们找不到凶器 -现场有很多目击证人
-No weapon. -Plenty of loudmouth witnesses.

956
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:50,103
找不到凶器  他们就无法定我的罪
No gun and I walk.

957
00:54:50,229 --> 00:54:52,189
-你确定? -是的
-Are you sure? -Yes!

958
00:54:52,272 --> 00:54:56,735
是吗?你杀了一个人 忘记自己把枪藏在哪里了?
Yeah? You murder a guy and you forget where you stashed your gun?

959
00:54:56,735 --> 00:54:59,863
你为什么不推开头顶那块天花板 摸摸看呢?
Why don't you lift the plastic ceiling panel and feel around?

960
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:04,451
找找看吧
Peekaboo!

961
00:55:09,664 --> 00:55:13,251
日光灯旁边放着什么东西呢? 摸摸看  史都
What's up next to the florescent bulb? Check it out, Stu.

962
00:55:13,293 --> 00:55:15,921
警察一看到我伸手去拿东西 他们会对我开枪的
Cops see me reach for something, they'll blow me away.

963
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:17,672
只有一个方法能知道答案
There's only one way to find out.

964
00:55:17,798 --> 00:55:21,510
那个家伙身上的子弹 是从你的来福枪射击出来的
Look, the slugs in that dead guy, they came from your rifle.

965
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:24,638
它们根本就不是手枪子弹 我看过很多的警匪片
They're not gonna match a handgun. I've seen enough cop shows.

966
00:55:24,638 --> 00:55:28,058
子弹在撞击后会变成碎片 史都华  那没有什么好比对的
Hollow points fragment on impact, Stuart. There's nothing to match.

967
00:55:28,099 --> 00:55:30,894
-上面没有枪 -你不相信我吗?
-Only there's no gun up there. -Don 't take my word for it.

968
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:35,190
你自己去看看吧 里面还装满了子弹
See for yourself. There are rounds left in it.

969
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:38,151
-我根本就不在乎 -少来了  别让我失望
-I totally couldn't give a shit. -Come on. Don't disappoint me.

970
00:55:38,276 --> 00:55:41,946
运用你的想像力  你有机会的话 就会对我开枪  对吧?
Use your imagination. You'd shoot me if you got the chance, wouldn't you?

971
00:55:41,988 --> 00:55:45,158
我会得意的大笑
With a big fucking smile on my face.

972
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:47,869
那样才对
There's the spirit.

973
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:51,539
如果我告诉你 我就在戏院的四楼呢?
Now, what if I told you I was just above the theater, four floors up?

974
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:54,417
你看到粉红色的窗帘了吗?
See the pink curtains?

975
00:55:54,542 --> 00:55:57,128
对了  史都华  就是那里
There you go, Stuart. Yes.

976
00:55:57,212 --> 00:55:58,880
你好
Yoo-hoo!

977
00:55:59,005 --> 00:56:01,591
你好
Yoo-hoo!

978
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:07,347
你为什么要那么做?
Why would you do that?.

979
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:12,268
因为这么做很好玩 我们现在拉成平手了  史都华
Because it's fun. The odds are even now, Stuart.

980
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:14,228
那不就是你想要的吗?
Isn 't that what you wanted?

981
00:56:14,354 --> 00:56:17,106
你知道我在哪里 你手上有枪
You know where I am, and you have a gun.

982
00:56:17,148 --> 00:56:21,694
只要你有机会 你会杀了我
If you have it in you, you can take me down.

983
00:56:23,654 --> 00:56:25,073
该死
Fuck!

984
00:56:25,198 --> 00:56:29,535
-他们会在我开枪前杀了我 -或许你说的对
-They' d kill me before I got a shot. -Oh, you're probably right.

985
00:56:29,535 --> 00:56:30,995
事实上我不在那里
I'm not really there anyway.

986
00:56:31,162 --> 00:56:35,208
你只会打坏 别人家的窗帘
You would've just spoiled some nice lady's curtains.

987
00:56:38,669 --> 00:56:42,048
看来有人看到新闻了
Looks like someone watches the news.

988
00:56:43,341 --> 00:56:47,178
-谁? -你的小爱人
-Who?. - The motel.

989
00:56:48,971 --> 00:56:52,016
-我的天啊 -我想她得拍张艺术照
-Oh, God. -I think she could use a new headshot.

990
00:56:52,058 --> 00:56:54,477
-不 -那么就把枪拿下来
-Don' t! -Then take down the gun.

991
00:56:54,602 --> 00:56:58,522
-听着  她跟这件事无关 -她当然跟这件事有关
-Look, this has nothing to do with her! -She has everything to do with this.

992
00:56:58,522 --> 00:57:01,233
你跟她会在这里 因为你打了电话给她
You're here and she's here because you called her.

993
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:05,821
快把枪拿下来 别逼我伤害潘  史都华
Now, take it down! Don't make me hurt Pam, Stuart.

994
00:57:05,863 --> 00:57:08,199
-把枪拿下来 -大家准备好
-Take down the gun! -Hey, everybody, get ready.

995
00:57:08,282 --> 00:57:11,202
等一下 我们看看他要做什么  好吗?
Hold on, hold on. Let's just see what he does, all right?.

996
00:57:11,285 --> 00:57:12,661
看看他要做什么
Let's see what he's doing.

997
00:57:16,999 --> 00:57:18,417
上面什么东西都没有
There's nothing there.

998
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:22,463
但凶器上有你的指纹 警察一定会很乐
Nothing but your fingerprints on the finest cop killer money can buy.

999
00:57:22,463 --> 00:57:24,300
快点  史都  让我看看你有多狠
Come on, Stu. Let's see it.

1000
00:57:24,527 --> 00:57:26,592
该死  不  我不会把它拿下来的
Fuck, no! It's staying there.

1001
00:57:26,592 --> 00:57:28,844
好吧  那么得有人 来取代你
Fine, then someone will have to take your place.

1002
00:57:28,928 --> 00:57:31,347
少来了  史都 你是最称职的人选
Come on, Stu, you're in a perfect position.

1003
00:57:31,472 --> 00:57:34,183
-你怎么知道? -你得在她们之间做选择
-How do you figure?. - You get to choose between them.

1004
00:57:34,266 --> 00:57:38,896
是潘蜜拉还是凯莉?该由我选吗? 她们之中得有人来代替你
Pamela or Kelly? Should I choose? One of them can take your place.

1005
00:57:38,979 --> 00:57:40,731
别这么做
Don' t do this!

1006
00:57:40,856 --> 00:57:44,818
你得好好地思索你的感觉 我以为你只爱凯莉
You've got to be more in touch with your feelings. I thought you only loved Kelly!

1007
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:46,904
-没错 -但你对她说谎
-It's true! -But you lie to her.

1008
00:57:46,987 --> 00:57:48,489
事情很复杂
It's complicated.

1009
00:57:48,572 --> 00:57:52,284
那么我会把事情简单化  史都华 我会除掉你的诱惑  我选潘
Then I'll uncomplicate it, Stuart, by removing temptation. I say Pam.

1010
00:57:52,326 --> 00:57:55,078
不  听我说  这不是潘的错 这都是我的错
No! Look, this isn't Pam's fault. This is all my fault!

1011
00:57:55,162 --> 00:57:56,538
她是无辜的
She's innocent!

1012
00:57:57,497 --> 00:58:02,085
滴答滴答 我们没时间了  好吧  就是凯莉了
Ticktock, ticktock. Time's running out. Okay, Kelly, then.

1013
00:58:02,085 --> 00:58:03,545
-那是你的决定 -不  求求你
- You decide. -No, please!

1014
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:06,506
少来了  史都 你还不懂游戏规则吗?
Come on, Stu. Don 't you get the game yet?

1015
00:58:06,548 --> 00:58:09,593
你是个自私的男人 做好选择  救自己一命
You're a selfish guy. Pick one and save yourself.

1016
00:58:10,385 --> 00:58:12,929
金发还是棕发?我们没时间了
Blond or brunette? Time 's running out.

1017
00:58:13,055 --> 00:58:17,059
你或她们?凯莉或潘? 凯莉或潘?
You or them? Kelly or Pam? Kelly or Pam?

1018
00:58:17,059 --> 00:58:19,394
快一点  史都
Come on, Stu!

1019
00:58:19,478 --> 00:58:21,855
快住手
Stop this.

1020
00:58:22,022 --> 00:58:25,317
-我再也受不了了 -你在做什么?快站起来
-I can' t take this anymore. -What are you doing? Get up!

1021
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:28,236
-我在找我的戒指  你看-- -站起来  史都华
-I was looking for my ring. Look-- -Get up, Stuart!

1022
00:58:28,278 --> 00:58:32,824
像个男子汉一样站起来 你让自己蒙羞了
Stand up and be a man. You're embarrassing yourself.

1023
00:58:35,619 --> 00:58:37,037
队长  我懂了  听我说
Captain! I got it. Listen.

1024
00:58:37,162 --> 00:58:42,208
狙击手说他看到目标 从口袋拿出一个黑色的小东西
The rifleman reports subject pulled a small, dark object out of his pocket.

1025
00:58:42,208 --> 00:58:45,295
好了  这家伙想在全国联播网上 演出自杀好戏
All right. You're looking at a suicide on national fucking TV.

1026
00:58:45,337 --> 00:58:47,255
你要我接手吗?
You gonna let me take this over?.

1027
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:49,674
叫大家稍安勿噪 千万别开火
Tell everybody to hold on, to hold their fire.

1028
00:58:49,758 --> 00:58:53,053
大家别开火  保持警戒状态
Everybody hold. Stay ready, but hold.

1029
00:58:53,678 --> 00:58:58,516
-史都华  你开始惹毛我了 -你不能这么做
-Stuart, you're beginning to annoy me. -You can't do this.

1030
00:58:58,516 --> 00:59:02,729
史都 别再拖下去了  也别再找借口
Stu. No more spinning, no more excuses.

1031
00:59:04,522 --> 00:59:07,692
你在做什么?听我说 求求你听我说
What' re you doing?. Look, listen. Listen, please listen to me.

1032
00:59:07,775 --> 00:59:09,152
别再拖下去了  史都华
No more delays, Stuart.

1033
00:59:09,277 --> 00:59:11,946
听着--我跪下来 求你不要杀我
Look-- l' m on my knees begging you not to kill me.

1034
00:59:11,988 --> 00:59:14,449
如果你再装出可怜兮兮的样子 我就会杀了你
I will if you keep up this pathetic spectacle.

1035
00:59:14,574 --> 00:59:16,618
对不起  是他打来的  他在说话
Excuse me! He's on the phone, talking.

1036
00:59:16,701 --> 00:59:19,287
你从那么高的地方 可以杀掉你想杀的人
From up in your high window, you could kill anyone.

1037
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:22,332
-对  我知道  史都华 -好吧  所以....
- Yes, I know that, Stuart. -All right, and....

1038
00:59:22,373 --> 00:59:24,959
你可以用你的来福枪 干掉那些警察
You could pick off any of the cops, with your rifle.

1039
00:59:25,001 --> 00:59:26,753
闭嘴  快站起来
Shut up and stand up!

1040
00:59:26,878 --> 00:59:29,005
听着  你为什么要威胁凯莉?
Look, why threaten Kelly?.

1041
00:59:29,047 --> 00:59:31,674
你喜欢她在店里 跟你讲电话的声音
You liked how she sounded on the phone at the store.

1042
00:59:31,758 --> 00:59:34,385
求求你别伤害她 别伤害我太太
Please don't hurt her. Don't fucking hurt my wife.

1043
00:59:34,469 --> 00:59:37,513
我不一定要开枪杀了你 但你逼得我别无选择
This doesn't have to end with me shooting you. You leave no choice.

1044
00:59:37,555 --> 00:59:40,558
-快站起来 -好吧
-Now, get up! -All right.

1045
00:59:40,808 --> 00:59:44,645
好吧  你打算怎么办? 告诉我你打算怎么办
Okay, how does this end?. T ell me how this ends.

1046
00:59:44,645 --> 00:59:46,564
戏即将落幕
The stage is almost set.

1047
00:59:46,647 --> 00:59:50,026
大家都会边吃晚餐 边看你的死亡纪事
People are gonna be eating dinner watching you die.

1048
00:59:50,192 --> 00:59:53,404
有人用狙击的方式杀人
We got a sniper situation here.

1049
00:59:53,571 --> 00:59:55,531
打到你店里的电话 是怎么一回事?
What about that phone call to your store?.

1050
00:59:55,615 --> 00:59:58,868
今天下午我接到一通电话 我还以为那是通恶作剧电话
I got a phone call this afternoon. I think it was a prank call.

1051
00:59:58,951 --> 01:00:01,746
他告诉我史都会从电话亭 打电话给我
He told me Stu would be calling me from a phone booth.

1052
01:00:01,871 --> 01:00:04,165
追查她的通话记录 要花多少时间?
How long will it take to get a record of her calls?.

1053
01:00:04,248 --> 01:00:07,251
如果他也是使用转接电话 情况就跟现在差不多
If he's using that secure line, we won't know more than now.

1054
01:00:07,293 --> 01:00:11,255
或许他没有那么做  他也是个人 他跟我们一样会犯错
Say he didn't. Let's assume he's a human, makes mistakes like all of us.

1055
01:00:11,255 --> 01:00:14,550
我得查出那个电话号码 我一直都想知道对方是谁
I need to get that number. I've been waiting for that number.

1056
01:00:14,633 --> 01:00:17,887
打电话来的是个男人 听起来大概三十几岁
It was a guy. He sounded like mid-30's.

1057
01:00:17,928 --> 01:00:21,765
薛帕德太太  你最好待在车里 好吗?
Mrs. Shepard?. It would be safer if you got back in the car, okay?.

1058
01:00:21,807 --> 01:00:23,726
-请你回车上去 -谢谢
-Please get back in the car. -Thank you.

1059
01:00:23,809 --> 01:00:27,563
我要你把特警队调到百老汇大道 请他们在那里待命
I want you to divert incoming ESU units to Broadway and hold them there.

1060
01:00:27,605 --> 01:00:29,815
-你要我疏散人群吗? -好的
-Want me to clear the streets?. -Yeah.

1061
01:00:29,899 --> 01:00:33,569
不  我不希望那个枪手 知道我们的行动
No, no, no. I don't want the sniper to be aware of any of our movements.

1062
01:00:33,611 --> 01:00:35,321
他已经知道我们布署的位置
He's already got position on us.

1063
01:00:35,446 --> 01:00:38,032
别让他发现 我们知道很多事  好吗?
Let's not let him know we know too much, okay?.

1064
01:00:38,782 --> 01:00:40,743
-乔纳 -什么事?
-Hey, Jonah. -Yeah.

1065
01:00:40,826 --> 01:00:42,453
别抬头
Don't look up.

1066
01:00:45,372 --> 01:00:47,666
请神枪手 搜索那些房间
Get me sharpshooters looking at those windows.

1067
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:50,461
-没问题  队员 -我会在这里帮我们争取一点时间
-You got it, captain. -I'm gonna buy us some time here.

1068
01:00:50,544 --> 01:00:52,129
好的
All right.

1069
01:00:58,552 --> 01:01:01,805
史都  我可以过去 跟你谈一谈吗?
Stu! It's okay if I come out and talk to you for a second?.

1070
01:01:01,847 --> 01:01:03,765
-我不知道 -这家伙很寂寞
-I don't know. -This guy is so lonely.

1071
01:01:04,474 --> 01:01:08,478
-他真爱说话 -你做了一个恶梦...
-All he wants to do is talk. -You' re walking through a bad dream...

1072
01:01:08,478 --> 01:01:11,607
-发现自己一直醒不过来 -他真的在考验我的耐心
-...and you can' t wake up. -Now he 's really testing my patience.

1073
01:01:11,648 --> 01:01:13,775
你想醒过来吗?史都
You wanna wake up, Stu?.

1074
01:01:13,859 --> 01:01:19,072
我想  但有一些事 我不能告诉你
I wanna, but I got issues I can' t talk about.

1075
01:01:19,072 --> 01:01:24,286
-你在跟你的心理医生讲电话吗? -没错  我付他加班费
-That your psychiatrist on the phone?. -Yeah, yeah. I' m paying him overtime.

1076
01:01:24,286 --> 01:01:27,414
你的行为真的很勇敢
That was pretty brave what you did.

1077
01:01:27,873 --> 01:01:30,834
我是指你对你太太承认那些事
I mean, admitting all that stuff to your wife.

1078
01:01:30,876 --> 01:01:34,546
-你觉得如释重负  对吧? -我应该有那种感觉的
-lt was liberating, right?. -Should've been.

1079
01:01:34,588 --> 01:01:37,799
如果我可以 对我太太更坦白一点  那么...
Maybe if I could be more honest with my wife then...

1080
01:01:37,799 --> 01:01:40,635
我不知道 结局应该会不一样
...I don't know, something would've turned out different.

1081
01:01:40,677 --> 01:01:42,429
拜托
Oh, please.

1082
01:01:42,554 --> 01:01:46,474
-信任是关键  你相信我吗?史都 -安排这家伙上欧普拉秀吧
-Trust is the key. You trust me, Stu?. -Get this man a seat on Oprah.

1083
01:01:46,474 --> 01:01:50,562
我想  但有一些事 我不能告诉你
I wanna, but I got the issues I can't talk about.

1084
01:01:50,562 --> 01:01:53,106
对  那些事攸关生死 叫他退后
Yes, lethal issues. Tell him to stay back.

1085
01:01:53,148 --> 01:01:55,316
听着  别再靠近
Look, don't come any closer.

1086
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,153
嘿  我不想害你 或是让你感到为难
Hey, I don' t wanna cause or make anything harder for you.

1087
01:01:58,236 --> 01:02:02,157
潘  雷米  凯莉  街上的人们 这些人的命都掌握在你手中
Pam, Ramey, Kelly, people on the street, you've got lives in your hands.

1088
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,535
我说过这是私人谈话 你到底想做什么?
I told you it's a private conversation. What the fuck do you want?.

1089
01:02:05,618 --> 01:02:09,289
我想让你知道 电话亭外面是很安全的
I wanna let you know that it's safe outside the booth.

1090
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:11,624
-才怪 -总是"走出电话亭"
-It's not. -lt' s always, "Get out of the booth!"

1091
01:02:11,708 --> 01:02:14,669
我喜欢待在这个电话亭里 好吗?这是我的世界
I like it in the fucking booth! All right?. It's my world.

1092
01:02:14,711 --> 01:02:17,297
这是我的电话亭 我不会出去的  好吗?
This is my booth, and I'm not coming out. All right?.

1093
01:02:17,422 --> 01:02:19,299
-我永远都不会出去 -我们不会逼你出来...
-Never. -We're not gonna force you out...

1094
01:02:19,716 --> 01:02:22,093
因为可能会出现 擦枪走火的状况...
...because there could be some miscalculation...

1095
01:02:22,135 --> 01:02:25,555
我永远都不会知道 为什么会发生这种事
...and then I would never find out why this happened.

1096
01:02:26,097 --> 01:02:32,020
史都  我怕我得做好准备...
Stu, I'm afraid. I'm afraid that I'm gonna be standing by...

1097
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:36,190
我的手下会开枪 射杀某人...
...and my men are gonna shoot some guy...

1098
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:42,738
当我们知道他手拿着什么东西 一旦我们把他的尸体翻过...
...and when we find out what's in his hand, once we turn over his body...

1099
01:02:42,738 --> 01:02:45,408
看到他用什么东西 来威胁大家时....
...and we see what he was threatening people with....

1100
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:49,036
我们知道 那只是一本小圣经
We realize that it was just a little black Bible.

1101
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:53,374
-或是一只移动电话 -别逼我  史都
-Or a cell phone. -Don't push me, Stu.

1102
01:02:56,586 --> 01:02:58,337
我不会让那种事发生
I'm not gonna let that happen here.

1103
01:02:58,796 --> 01:03:01,048
我只是要打一通电话 一通烂电话--
I wanted to make a phone call. One lousy call--

1104
01:03:01,132 --> 01:03:03,301
够了  史都
That's enough, Stu.

1105
01:03:03,384 --> 01:03:07,888
-那通电话带来坏消息? -那是最可怕的梦魇
-You got some bad news on that call?. -The worst.

1106
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:10,016
我想说你想拔腿就跑
I bet you want to jump off the edge.

1107
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,894
-我觉得自己不断地往下坠落 -我要狠狠地教训他
-l' ve been falling ever since. -I'm gonna push him over the edge.

1108
01:03:13,978 --> 01:03:15,563
只要你的一句话
Just say the word.

1109
01:03:15,688 --> 01:03:17,273
着地的时候到了
It's time to land.

1110
01:03:17,606 --> 01:03:21,152
-一着地我就死定了 -我会接住你的
-When you hit bottom, you die. -l' m your safety net.

1111
01:03:21,193 --> 01:03:24,363
拜托你  开口求我吧
Oh, please, say the word.

1112
01:03:24,405 --> 01:03:27,825
如果我告诉你你想知道的事 你也会死
If I tell you what you wanna know, you' ll die too.

1113
01:03:27,825 --> 01:03:30,160
没错
Exactly.

1114
01:03:32,997 --> 01:03:34,832
-我要走了 -很好
-l' m going. -Good.

1115
01:03:36,709 --> 01:03:40,087
史都  我们打过电话 给你的律师
But, Stu, we put a call out to your lawyer.

1116
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:42,381
你太太给了我们电话号码
Your wife, she gave us the number.

1117
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:50,556
我会请我最得力的手下 去把他找出来  好吗?
And I got my best men working on bringing him down. Okay?.

1118
01:03:51,014 --> 01:03:53,058
够了  那个队长死定了
That's it. The captain gets a bullet.

1119
01:03:53,475 --> 01:03:55,018
快点离开 你听到我说的话了吗?混蛋
Get out of here! Hear what I said, asshole?.

1120
01:03:55,102 --> 01:03:59,440
-快离开这里  快滚 -别再演了  史都
-Get out of here, go on, now! Go! -Enough of this sideshow, Stu.

1121
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,610
-你要为你犯的罪受罚 -原来你是个宗教狂
- Your sins have caught up to you. -So this is all some religious thing?.

1122
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:07,239
那是个好理由  宗教狂热份子 杀了迷信流行的公关人员
That explains it. Bible-crazed killer picks on fashion-obsessed PR guy.

1123
01:04:07,322 --> 01:04:09,908
-告诉我你想做什么 -每个人都希望...
-Tell me what you want, then. -What everyone wants...

1124
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:12,369
坏蛋们 能受到应有的制裁
...for the bad guy to get what he deserves.

1125
01:04:12,369 --> 01:04:14,663
把那把枪拿出来
Go for the gun.

1126
01:04:14,746 --> 01:04:16,957
-你要我自杀? -没错
-Kill myself?. - Yes.

1127
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,376
那将会是罕见的无私行为
It would be a rare, unselfish act.

1128
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,758
-目标做出危险动作 -除非有命令  谁都不准轻举妄动
-We got hostile action. -Nothing is hostile until I say it is.

1129
01:04:27,259 --> 01:04:29,720
-听着  我找不到枪 -凯莉  潘  她们死定了
-Look, I can't find it. -Kelly, Pam, bam! Bam!

1130
01:04:29,803 --> 01:04:32,055
好吧  我找到它了
All right! Look, I found it. I got it.

1131
01:04:32,139 --> 01:04:35,392
-让大家都能够看到它 -警察会杀了我
-Then let's see it. Let everyone see it. -The cops'll kill me.

1132
01:04:35,392 --> 01:04:39,146
没错 你终于进入了状况
Yes. You're talking prime-time material now.

1133
01:04:39,146 --> 01:04:41,106
-你大费周章只为了看我被杀死? -不
-All this shit just to watch me die?. -No.

1134
01:04:41,231 --> 01:04:46,653
我要你做出你该做的事 你想活命的话就得说实话
To get you to do what's right. If you wanna save yourself, confess.

1135
01:04:46,653 --> 01:04:49,281
-我已经把一切都告诉凯莉了 -真的吗?
-I already told Kelly everything. -Everything?

1136
01:04:49,364 --> 01:04:52,534
不  别再找借口 说些似是而非的话  史都华
No. No more excuses and half-truths, Stuart.

1137
01:04:52,576 --> 01:04:56,579
你得对着摄影机 说出你心里的秘密
You look out into those cameras and you bare your soul.

1138
01:04:56,579 --> 01:04:59,416
电视似乎能够让人 说出心里最邪恶的意念
TV seems to help bring out the worst in people.

1139
01:04:59,499 --> 01:05:01,251
你会表现的很好
You should be fine.

1140
01:05:01,418 --> 01:05:05,004
-技术人员有什么进展吗? -还没有
-How' re those techs doing?. Anything?. -No, not yet. Not yet.

1141
01:05:05,088 --> 01:05:09,717
我们还没有找到你的律师 史都  但我们很接近了  好吗?
We haven' t found your lawyer yet, Stu. But we' re getting close. Okay?.

1142
01:05:09,717 --> 01:05:14,139
史都华  我给你一个机会 找回真正的自己
Stuart, I'm offering you a chance to redeem yourself.

1143
01:05:14,222 --> 01:05:16,975
少来了  在你深爱的人面前 跟数百万个陌生人及我的面前...
Come on, humble yourself in front of your loved ones...

1144
01:05:17,016 --> 01:05:21,688
好好地坦白吧 不照我的话做你就得死
...and millions of strangers and me. It's do-or-die time.

1145
01:05:21,688 --> 01:05:23,898
什么? 你找不到比我更坏的人吗?
What, you couldn' t find anyone worse than me?.

1146
01:05:24,023 --> 01:05:27,193
你没找上凶手或是虐待小孩的家伙 你找上一个公关人员...
Not a murderer or a child molester but a publicist...

1147
01:05:27,193 --> 01:05:29,696
他对漂亮的女演员 心存遐想
...who has fantasies about pretty little actresses.

1148
01:05:29,946 --> 01:05:32,573
把钱花在意大利制的西装 跟干洗费上...
Who spends money on ltalian suits and dry cleaning...

1149
01:05:32,615 --> 01:05:36,202
所以人们会认为他是个大人物 他不会花时间对别人好...
...so people think he's important. Who doesn't waste time being nice...

1150
01:05:36,202 --> 01:05:38,663
除非那些人对他来说有利用价值 我这么做有罪吗?
...to people who are of no use to him. These are my crimes?.

1151
01:05:38,705 --> 01:05:44,085
史都华  我知道你的罪行 告诉他们
Stuart, I know your crimes. Tell them.

1152
01:06:07,858 --> 01:06:10,486
我从来不会为别人做事...
I've never done anything for anybody...

1153
01:06:10,569 --> 01:06:13,239
除非我可以利用他们 我一直在玩弄...
...who couldn't do something for me. I string along...

1154
01:06:13,364 --> 01:06:16,701
一个孩子 我发誓我会付他薪水
...a kid with promises that l' ll pay him money.

1155
01:06:16,742 --> 01:06:18,911
我一直耍着他玩 因为他很崇拜我
I keep him around because he looks up to me.

1156
01:06:18,994 --> 01:06:23,416
亚当  如果你在看电视 别当公关  你可以有更好的成就
Adam, if you're watching, don't be a publicist. You're too good for it.

1157
01:06:23,416 --> 01:06:29,588
我见人说人话  见鬼说鬼话 我欺骗我的朋友
I lie in person and on the phone. I lie to my friends.

1158
01:06:29,588 --> 01:06:33,968
我欺骗报社跟杂志社 他们用我的谎言去欺骗更多的人
I lie to newspapers and magazines who sell my lies to more and more people.

1159
01:06:33,968 --> 01:06:39,515
我本身就是一个大谎言 我应该去选总统的
I'm just a part of a big cycle of lies. I should be fucking president.

1160
01:06:39,515 --> 01:06:44,311
我穿着一身意大利制西装 因为在心里觉得自己是大草包
I wear all this ltalian shit because underneath, I still feel like the Bronx.

1161
01:06:44,311 --> 01:06:47,064
我想我需要这些衣服 跟这只手表
I think I need these clothes, and this watch.

1162
01:06:47,147 --> 01:06:52,111
这只价值两千块的表是假的 我也是
My $2000 watch is a fake, and so am l.

1163
01:06:52,194 --> 01:06:55,280
我蔑视 所有我该珍惜的事
I neglected the things I should've valued most.

1164
01:06:55,364 --> 01:06:57,241
我重视这些鸟事
I valued this shit.

1165
01:06:58,158 --> 01:07:04,748
我拿掉婚戒打电话给潘 凯莉  她就是潘
I take off my wedding ring to call Pam. Kelly, that's Pam.

1166
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:08,627
-有人拍到潘了吗? -别怪她
-Somebody got a 20 on this Pam?. -Don't blame her.

1167
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:11,171
我从来没跟她提过我已经结婚 如果我真的告诉她...
I never told her if I was married, and if I did...

1168
01:07:11,213 --> 01:07:13,048
她会叫我回家
...she would've told me to go home.

1169
01:07:14,841 --> 01:07:19,388
凯莉  看到现在的你 我觉得自己很可耻
Kelly, looking at you now, I'm ashamed of myself.

1170
01:07:21,056 --> 01:07:27,145
我是说我努力打造这个形象 史都薛帕德是个大混蛋...
I mean, I work so hard on this image, on Stu Shepard, the asshole...

1171
01:07:27,145 --> 01:07:32,275
他完全不理会真正的自己 我证明了自己是个无可救药的人
...who refers to himself in third person, that I only proved I should be alone.

1172
01:07:33,151 --> 01:07:37,197
我一直装出很伟大的样子 我真的撑不下去了...
I've been dressing up as something I'm not for so long...

1173
01:07:37,197 --> 01:07:40,992
我好害怕你不会喜欢 真正的我
...I'm so afraid you won't like what's underneath.

1174
01:07:41,034 --> 01:07:46,456
但这就是我 我是个有血有肉  有弱点的人
But here I am. I'm just flesh and blood and weakness.

1175
01:07:48,667 --> 01:07:50,585
我真的好爱你
I love you so fucking much.

1176
01:07:56,716 --> 01:08:02,430
我会把婚戒拿掉 因为它提醒了我是怎么伤你的心
I take off this ring because it only reminds me of how I've failed you.

1177
01:08:02,430 --> 01:08:05,475
我不想失去你
And, I don't wanna give you up.

1178
01:08:05,517 --> 01:08:09,771
我想努力做个好人 但现在这一切由不得我选择
I wanna make things better, but it may not be my choice anymore.

1179
01:08:10,438 --> 01:08:13,149
你应该去找更棒的男人
You deserve better.

1180
01:08:28,414 --> 01:08:31,960
-你不会放我走的 -没错
-You're not gonna let me go. -No.

1181
01:08:32,001 --> 01:08:35,964
你从来都没有那么想过 我知道骗子是什么样的嘴脸
You never were. I know a thing about lies.

1182
01:08:36,005 --> 01:08:38,049
我也非常清楚 什么是谎言
I know a thing or two about liars as well.

1183
01:08:38,132 --> 01:08:41,052
你为什么要坦白?
Then why the confession?

1184
01:08:46,933 --> 01:08:49,519
我那么做不是为了你
I didn't do it for you.

1185
01:08:51,145 --> 01:08:53,314
-就在那里 -我知道了
-Right there. -Yeah, got that.

1186
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:57,610
队长  打给他太太的电话 时间是两点十七分...
Captain, captain. The call to his wife originated at 2: 1 7...

1187
01:08:57,610 --> 01:09:00,071
发话地点是 巴克利饭店的房间
...at a hard line from the old Barkley Hotel.

1188
01:09:00,154 --> 01:09:02,448
-查到房号了吗? -604
-You got a room?. -604.

1189
01:09:02,782 --> 01:09:05,535
就是街角的第二排窗户 特警队正准备进攻
Second window from the corner. ESU units holding.

1190
01:09:05,952 --> 01:09:07,620
叫他们从五十二街进去
Bring them in from 52nd Street.

1191
01:09:07,662 --> 01:09:11,290
封锁所有的门窗跟紧急逃生口 还有所有可能的出入口
Cover the windows, doors, fire escape, every goddamn point of exit.

1192
01:09:11,332 --> 01:09:14,293
-特警队  请从五十二街进去-- -史都
-ESU, ESU, come in from the 52nd-- -Stu!

1193
01:09:14,418 --> 01:09:17,213
-你的律师来了 -门跟紧急逃生口....
-Your lawyer's coming down now! -Doors, fire escapes....

1194
01:09:17,296 --> 01:09:18,673
就是现在
Now!

1195
01:09:19,298 --> 01:09:21,676
至少你现在 可以安心地死去
At least you'll die with a clean conscience.

1196
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:25,262
不  该死的人是你 仔细听  你可以听到他们的脚步声
No, you' re the one that' s gonna die! Listen, you can hear them now.

1197
01:09:25,304 --> 01:09:27,056
他们去抓你了  你知道为什么吗?
They' re coming to get you. Know why?.

1198

You hear a phone ring, and it could be anybody.

But a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it?
