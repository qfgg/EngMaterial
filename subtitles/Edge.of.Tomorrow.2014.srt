00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,000
我其实不是一个士兵
I'm not a...soldier, really.

154
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,590
不  你当然不是
No, of course you're not.

155
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,290
这就是为什么我把你
That's why I'm embedding you

156
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,630
跟几十万士兵放在一起
with several hundred thousand men and women who are.

157
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,340
这是一种荣幸  将军
While it is an honor, general,

158
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,850
可我恐怕必须谢绝了
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to decline.

159
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,320
我受不了血腥场面
Can't stand the sight of blood.

160
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,010
这又不是剪纸游戏
Not so much as a paper cut.

161
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,710
坐在这儿想一下
Uh, but, uh, si-sitting here thinking about this,

162
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,880
我脑子里已经有好几个名字
uh-uh-uh, a couple of names come to mind

163
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,480
我觉得可以推荐给您
that I feel I could recommend to you. It's...

164
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,400
这不是提议  少校  这是命令
It's not an offer, Major. It's an order.

165
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,100
将军  我是美国军方的军官
General, I am an officer in the United States' military.

166
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,450
你甚至没有权力命令我
You don't even have the authority.

167
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,150
我跟你的指挥官说过了
I have spoken to your C.O.

168
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,090
你现在归我管
You are now under my command.

169
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,930
当然  你能保持现在的军衔
You will retain your present rank, of course.

170
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,680
我秘书那里有详细资料
My secretary has all the details.

171
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,650
好好干  少校
Do a good job, Major.

172
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,780
祝你好运  你可以走了
Good luck. You are dismissed.

173
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,100
将军
General?

174
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,250
我刚刚鼓舞了上百万人
I just inspired millions of people...

175
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,220
来加入你的军队
to join your army.

176
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,420
可是当尸体被运回家乡时
And when the body bags come home,

177
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,960
人们将寻找替罪羊
and they're looking for someone to blame...

178
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,360
你觉得对我来说
How hard do you think it would be

179
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,050
说服人们归罪于你会有多难
for me to convince people to blame you?

180
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,670
我想将军您应该不希望这样
I'd imagine that the general would prefer to avoid that.

181
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,750
你在威胁我吗  少校
Are you blackmailing me, Major?

182
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,500
我更希望
I would prefer...

183
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,210
明天可以不用去前线
not to be filming acts of heroism and valor

184
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,650
拍摄那些英勇的事迹
on that beach tomorrow.

185
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,190
你不用去
You won't be.

186
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,270
很高兴我们能解决这个问题
I'm glad we could, uh, work this out.

187
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,530
如果可以的话  将军  我...
Now if you'll excuse me, General, I...

188
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,480
谢谢
Thank you.

189
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,470
抓住这个人
Arrest this man.

190
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,620
什么
What?

191
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,760
停下
Stop right there!

192
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,670
喂  停下
Hey! Stop!

193
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,210
抓住他
Hold it!

194
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,780
左翼  前进
Left flank, march!

195
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,210
向后  转
About-turn!

196
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,740
供应于十分钟后结束
Supplies closing in ten minutes.

197
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,900
排好队
Get yourselves in line!

198
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,150
西斯罗机场

199
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,260
加入机械战队

200
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:46,750
全金属婊子

201
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,790
全金属婊子

202
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,610
全金属婊子

203
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,420
站起来  你这废物
On your feet, maggot!

204
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,680
不该对长官这样说话  军士
That is no way to address an officer, Sergeant.

205
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,700
我就是这么跟一个呆瓜新兵说话的
It's how I address a slack-jawed recruit

206
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,590
然后我会拿鞋跟捅烂他的屁眼  废物
right before I bust his hole with my boot heel, maggot.

207
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,880
等一下  军士
Hold up there, Sergeant.

208
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,280
有什么能帮你的吗  先生
Can I help you, sir?

209
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,370
我到底在哪里  军士
Where the hell am I, Sergeant?

210
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,280
前沿作战基地西斯罗机场
Forward operating base Heathrow.

211
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,450
你刚和一群新兵一起来的
You just came in with the fresh recruits.

212
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,420
我看起来像新兵吗
Do I strike you as a fresh recruit?

213
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,110
不  先生  你不像
No, sir, you do not.

214
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,610
我是威廉姆·凯奇少校
My name is Major William Cage.

215
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,350
-我是一名美国军官  -军官
- I'm an American officer. - Officer?

216
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,670
这是新兵训练营
This is processing.

217
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,620
这里没有军官
There's no officers down here.

218
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,030
我来处理  军士
I got this, Sergeant.

219
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,570
你到底是怎么到新兵营来的
How the hell did you end up in processing?

220
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,430
是因为什么
What was it?

221
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,940
扑克之夜还是单身派对
Poker night? Bachelor party?

222
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,050
如果对你来说没有区别  军士
If it's all the same to you, Sergeant,

223
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,960
我希望能跟我在华盛顿的长官解释
I'd like to explain that to my commanding officer in Washington,

224
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,560
所以如果你能带我去打电话  我可以...
so if you'll just take me to a phone, I can...

225
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,780
你听到了吗
Haven't you heard?

226
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,970
我们正在紧急备战阶段
We're t-minus-haul-ass-h-hour.

227
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,750
我们正在整军准备入侵法国
We're fixing to invade France.

228
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,330
整个前沿作战基地都被封锁了
This whole F.O.B.'s on lockdown.

229
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,980
没有任何电话往来
No calls. In or out.

230
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,300
-你叫法雷利  -没错
- Your name is Farell. - That's right.

231
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,980
法雷利军士长
Master sergeant Farell.

232
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,290
法雷利军士长  你是一位美国人
Master sergeant Farell, you're an American.

233
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,680
不  长官  我来自肯塔基
No, sir. I'm from Kentucky.

234
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,850
好吧  看着我
Okay. Well, look at me.

235
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,570
看看我在什么地方
And look at where I am.

236
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,990
我是被强迫送来的
I've been railroaded.

237
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,280
很明显我不属于这里
It's obvious I don't belong here.

238
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,150
拜托了  中士
So please, Sergeant,

239
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,000
肯定有方法能打电话的
there has to be a way I can make a phone call.

240
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,820
我会解决你的问题的  长官
I'll get you sorted out, sir.

241
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,730
谢谢
Thank you.

242
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,850
走这边
Right this way.

243
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,720
你从肯塔基哪里来的  军士长
Where you from in Kentucky, Sergeant?

244
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,180
一个叫科学山的小镇
Little town called Science Hill.

245
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,830
听说过吗
Heard of it?

246
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,830
现在听说了
I have now.

247
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,010
你呢  你从哪里来的
How 'bout you? Where you from?

248
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,240
克兰伯里[也译作蔓越莓]  新泽西
Cranbury, New Jersey.

249
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,040
他们种了不少蔓越莓  对吧
They grow a lot of cranberries there, do they?

250
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,790
番茄  最最好吃的番茄
Tomatoes. Best you ever had.

251
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,620
那为什么要叫克兰伯里[蔓越莓]呢
Why they call it Cranberry, then?

252
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,260
那他们为什么把它叫做科学山呢
Why they call it Science Hill?

253
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,920
从来没问过  我不关心
Never asked. Don't care.

254
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,530
您先走
After you.

255
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,170
你不是带我去打电话的对吧  军士长
You're not taking me to a phone, are you, sergeant?

256
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,590
不  我不是
No, I am not.

257
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,580
似乎目前为止你唯一说的实话
Seems about the only honest thing you said to me

258
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,240
是你的名字
so far is your name.

259
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,900
这里写着你是个逃兵
It says here you're a deserter.

260
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,340
写着你在伪装军官时被抓获
It says here you were caught impersonating an officer.

261
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,890
还写着你可能会尝试打出电话
It says here you'd likely try to make an outside call,

262
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,020
甚至不惜牺牲基地的安全
even compromise security of this operation.

263
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,940
绞尽脑汁逃避明天的作战任务
Anything to get out of combat duty tomorrow.

264
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,920
不过这些都不会发生
But that's not gonna happen.

265
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,060
绝无可能   二等兵凯奇
Ever...private Cage.

266
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,790
流言很可怕
Rumor is a terrible thing.

267
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,930
今晚之前  这些人都会知道
Come nightfall, these men will all reach the same conclusion.

268
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,760
你是个懦夫  还是个骗子
That you're a coward and a liar,

269
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,760
认为自己的命比他们的重要
putting your life above theirs.

270
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,840
好消息是你还有希望  二等兵
The good news is there's hope for you, private.

271
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,430
参与光荣的战斗
Hope in the form of glorious combat.

272
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,750
战斗是最伟大的救赎
Battle is the great redeemer.

273
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,270
是锤炼真英雄的浴火熔炉
The fiery crucible in which the only true heroes are forged.

274
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,190
唯一一个众生平等的地方
The one place where all men truly share the same rank,

275
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,710
不管他们本来是什么样的废物
regardless of what kind of parasitic scum they were going in.

276
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,360
注意了
Hey, yo!

277
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,410
队员们
Squad!

278
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,780
这位是二等兵凯奇
This here is private Cage.

279
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,380
二等兵凯奇  这里是J小队
Private Cage, J Squad.

280
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,190
那不是军官的制服吗
Isn't that an officer's uniform?

281
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,010
军官可不会用这样的袖扣
Those sure ain't officer cufflinks.

282
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,530
大家的早上都很充实嘛
I see everyone is havin' a productive mornin'.

283
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,480
这让我十分骄傲
You know, it gives me a swell of pride

284
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,130
有你们这样的精兵
knowin' soldiers of your...

285
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,550
去主导明天的战役
caliber will be leadin' the charge tomorrow.

286
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,180
锐如尖矛
Tip of the spear.

287
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,050
利如刀锋
Edge of the knife.

288
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,830
捅进了我的...屁眼
Crack of my...ass.

289
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,660
该死
Oh, shit.

290
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,670
二等兵基梅尔
Private Kimmel,

291
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,920
我是怎么看待在营房里赌博的
what is my view of gamblin' in the barracks?

292
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,270
你不喜欢  法雷利军士长
You dislike it, Sergeant Farell.

293
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,810
南希  我为什么不喜欢
Nance, why do I dislike it?

294
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:45,860
因为这会让我们觉得
'Cause it entertains the notion

295
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,890
我们的命运掌握在别人手里
that our fate is in hands other than our own.

296
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,420
我对于命运这个词
And what is my definitive position

297
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,760
是怎么定义的  一起说
on the concept of fate, chorus?

298
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,340
时刻准备  严守纪律
Through readiness and discipline,

299
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,080
命运由我们自己掌控
we are masters of our fate.

300
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,920
你可能会觉得这种观点十分讽刺
You might call that notion ironic.

301
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,870
不过相信我  你会接受的
But, trust me, you'll come around.

302
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,860
二等兵凯奇是一名逃兵
Private Cage is a deserter.

303
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,260
拯救他是你们所有人的责任
I'm making you all personally responsible for his deliverance.

304
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,280
明早六点他要做好战斗准备
He will be combat ready at oh-six-hundred tomorrow.

305
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:15,960
战斗准备
Combat ready?

306
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,260
二等兵凯奇身陷幻想中
Private Cage is under the delusion

307
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,260
觉得自己不属于这里
he does not belong here.

308
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,050
我们必须打破他的幻想
We must dissuade him of this delusion.

309
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,350
如果他尝试逃跑
If he tries to run,

310
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,030
你们完全可以把他打到生活不能自理
feel free to dissuade him until he can't piss standing up.

311
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,360
不  不  军士长  你必须听我说
No, no. Sergeant, you have to listen to me.

312
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,260
我永远无法做好战斗准备
I will never be combat ready.

313
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,130
我嫉妒你  凯奇
I envy you, Cage.

314
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,040
明早你就会受到洗礼的
Tomorrow morning, you will be baptized.

315
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,330
重获新生
Born again.

316
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,820
十分钟体能训练
P.T.! Ten minutes!

317
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,610
穿错制服了  二等兵
you're not in uniform, private.

318
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,500
所有备战妥当的中队
Could all combat-ready squadrons...

319
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,010
又是新的一天  同志们
It's a new day, people.

320
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,220
命运在召唤我们
Destiny calls.

321
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,900
全世界都期盼着我们能赢
The world expects only one thing from us that we will win.

322
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,160
地雷呢
Where's the claymores, please?

323
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,660
我的宝贝们呢
Where's my babies?

324
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,620
{\pos(67.5,164)}小心爆炸

325
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,620
{\pos(100.95,216)}克莱莫地雷

326
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,990
基梅尔  让我们一举拿下它
Come on, Kimmel, let's have it!

327
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,910
我的天啊  基梅尔
Oh, for Chris sake, Kimmel.

328
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,400
这样自在啊
I gotta be free, man!

329
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,880
好了  准备上战场
All right, man, let's get this show on the road.

330
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,070
我也得重装上阵了
I gotta suit up.

331
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,540
那是什么声音
What's that noise? That...

332
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,780
走吧
Let's go.

333
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,050
听我说  兄弟
Listen, man,

334
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,380
我从未穿过战甲
I've never been in one of these.

335
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,090
我也没试过
Yeah, well, I've never been with

336
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,600
同时跟两个女孩上床
two girls at the same time before.

337
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,010
但如果有机会
But you can bet when that day comes,

338
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:14,860
我一定能搞定
I'll make it work.

339
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,340
等等  基梅尔
Hey, hey, hey. Yeah, Kimmel...

340
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,590
我是格里夫
It's Griff.

341
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,840
格里夫  格里夫  我求你了
Griff. Griff. You bet.

342
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,350
你想想看
Just think about this, man.

343
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,210
我可能会用它伤害到别人
I could hurt somebody with...

344
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,650
开启安全模式就好了
Not with the safety on, you won't.

345
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,400
赶紧就位  兄弟
Get a shift on, mate. Come on!

346
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,480
准备好了吗
You ready?

347
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,000
安全模式在哪里开
Aw, Where is the safety?

348
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,950
非常正确
Exactly.

349
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,000
请勿穿行

350
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,950
时间到
It's time.

351
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,100
我的天  这不是全金属...
Bloody hell, it's the full metal b...

352
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,240
动起来
Move!

353
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,280
-格里夫  -军士长
- Griff. - Sarge?

354
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,080
照顾好二等兵凯奇
Take care of private Cage.

355
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,130
一整天吗
What, all day?

356
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,670
我的直觉告诉我  不用那么久
Somethin' tells me it won't be nearly that long.

357
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,670
出发吧
Let's go!

358
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,160
格里夫  凯奇
Griff! Cage!

359
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,630
-凯奇  -凯奇
- Cage! - Cage!

360
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,390
我们失去了德国
We lost Germany.

361
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,000
失去了法国
We lost France.

362
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,900
如果今天再输
If we lose today,

363
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,880
就不用再打了
we won't get to fight another.

364
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,520
我知道你们的压力很大
I know the pressure on you is enormous.

365
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,570
两分钟后空降
Two minutes to drop.

366
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,870
害怕是正常的
It's all right to be scared.

367
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,560
记住  没有恐惧就没有勇气
Remember there's no courage without fear.

368
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,940
伙计
Oi, mate!

369
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,010
你的战甲好像有点问题
I think there's something wrong with your suit.

370
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,480
对  有个死人在里面
Yeah. There's a dead guy in it.

371
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,150
下去后管好自己  先生
Hey, watch your back out there. Sir.

372
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,190
没人会管你
No one else will.

373
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,380
一分钟
One minute!

374
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,200
一分钟后空降
One minute to drop!

375
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,690
干嘛
What?

376
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,590
我怎么把武器的安全模式打开
How do I turn the safety off of my weapon?

377
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,200
什么
What?!

378
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,740
我要怎么把武器的安全模式...
How do I turn the safety off...

379
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,070
天啊
Oh, my god!

380
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,530

Get ready!

381

30秒后空降
Thirty seconds to drop!

382
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,900
听我的指令
On my mark!

383
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,960
做好空降准备
Stand by to deploy!

384
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,590
拉好空降索
Activate drop lines.

385
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,650
记住
Remember...

386
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,450

凯奇  要么跳要么死
Cage! Drop or die!

395
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,620
我们成功了
We made it!

396
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,470
感谢上帝  我们成功了
Thank God, we made it!

397
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,550
选择语言
Select language.

398
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,140
快走
Let's move it!

399
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:08,980
我们需要支援
We need help!

400
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,330
请求立即支援
Someone help us out! We need it now!

401
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,570
我的
What the...

402
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,800
二等兵凯奇
Private Cage!

403
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,570
你走错方向了
You goin' the wrong way.

404
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,440
你会想念这一刻的
You're gonna miss your moment.

405
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,330
什么情况啊
What the hell?

406
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,110
它们不应该知道我们会来的
They're not supposed to know we're even coming.

407
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,210
我们这是进了屠宰场啊
We walked into a slaughterhouse, man.

408
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,630
简直就是屠宰场
It's a slaughterhouse!

409
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,850
振作起来  福特
Pull yourself together, Ford!

410
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,510
动起来  兄弟们

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,560
调整好队形
Get in line!

412
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,330
南希  报告下战况
Nance, get me a sit-rep.

413
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,320
-安全模式  -格里夫  福特守住侧面
- Safety! - Griff, Ford, cover the flank!

414
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,600
安全模式  安全模式
My safety! My safety.

415
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,300
我要怎么调到安全模式
How do I get my safety?

416
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,670
-南希  快点  -追踪到了
- I'm waitin', Nance! - I got traces!

417
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,110
在五百米以外  它们的速度很快
Five hundred meters and they're coming in fast!

418
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,430
狗日的
Sumbitch.

419
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,680
别挡路
Get outta the way!

420
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,520
想活下来就给我列好队
Look alive if you wanna stay that way!

421
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,680
射击就位
Firing positions!

422
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,670
它们来了
Here they come.

423
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,880
来势汹汹  数量惊人
Mean as hell and thick as grass.

424
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,610
等它们再靠近点
Wait till they're right on us.

425
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,380
再过几秒
A few more seconds.

426
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,640
格里夫  后退
Griff, fall back!

左右左
Left, right, left!

431
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,510
全金属婊子

432
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,390
全金属婊子

433
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,570
全金属婊子

434
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,590
加入机械战队

435
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,390
加入机械战队

436
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,280
站起来  你这废物
On your feet, maggot!

437
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,810
在我拿鞋跟捅烂你的
Get in line before I bust your hole

438
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,350
屁眼前站好队  废物
with my boot heel, maggot!

439
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,630
让我来  军士长
Hold up there, sergeant.

440
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,890
有什么能帮到你的吗  先生
Can I help you, sir?

441
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,530
法雷利军士长
Sergeant Farell.

442
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,550
这是
Is it...?

443
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,640
那是我的名字
That is my name.

444
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,690
我想我知道了
I think I get it.

445
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,750
怎么回事
What was it?

446
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,910
扑克之夜
Poker night?

447
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,340
还是单身派对
Bachelor party?

448
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,590
我也不知道
You know, I'm not sure.

449
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,080
常有的事
It happens.

450
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,820
我会帮你安排好的  先生
I'll get you sorted out, sir.

451
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,900
让我帮你拿吧
Let me take those for you.

452
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,260
今天是几号
What... What day is it?

453
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,930
对于你来说吗
For you?

454
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,680
审判日
Judgment day.

455
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,210
你还是有希望的  二等兵
The good news is there's hope for you, private.

456
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,590
参与光荣的战斗
Hope in the form of glorious combat.

457
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,590
战斗是最伟大的救赎
Battle is the great redeemer,

458
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,570
是锤炼
the fiery crucible

459
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,470
-真英雄的浴火  -真英雄的浴火
- in which the only true heroes - in which the only true heroes

460
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,700
熔炉
are forged.

461
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,360
你刚刚是在打断我吗  二等兵
Did you just interrupt me, private?

462
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,040
军士长  你
Sarge, you're...

463
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,340
你绝对不会相信
You're... you're not gonna believe

464
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,510
我接下来要说的话
what I'm about to tell you.

465
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,800
当然不信
No, I'm not.

466
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,230
我讲到哪里了
Now, where was I?

467
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,710
是锤炼
The fiery crucible...

468
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,760
是锤炼
The fiery crucible

469
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,300
真英雄的浴火熔炉
in which the only true heroes are forged.

470
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,320
唯一一个众生平等的地方
The one place where all men truly share the same rank,

471
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,070
不管他们本来是什么样的废物
regardless of what kind of parasitic scum they were goin' in.

472
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,660
欢迎来到地狱  亲爱的
Welcome to hell, honey.

473
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,480
队员们  这个是二等兵凯奇
Squad! This here is private Cage.

474
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,910
二等兵凯奇
Private Cage.

475
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,560
这里是J小队
J squad.

476
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,250
那不是军官的制服吗
Isn't that an officer's uniform?

477
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,050
军官可不会用这样的袖扣
They sure ain't officer cufflinks.

478
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,360
我十分骄傲
You know, it gives me a swell of pride

479
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,090
知道有你们这样的精兵
knowing soldiers of your...

480
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,940
去主导明天的战役
Caliber will be leadin' the charge tomorrow.

481
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,520
锐如尖矛  锋如刀刃
Tip of the spear, edge of the knife,

482
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,090
捅进了我的屁眼
crack of my ass.

483
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,690
二等兵基梅尔  我怎么看待在营房里赌博的
Private Kimmel, what is my view of gamblin' in the barracks?

484
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,140
很反感  法雷利中士
Dislike it, sergeant Farell.

485
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,520
南希  我为什么反感
Nance, why do I dislike it?

486
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,860
因为这会让我们觉得
Because it entertains the notion

487
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,190
我们的命运受他人掌控
that our fate is in hands other than our own.

488
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,910
我对命运这个词
And what is my definitive position

489
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,900
是怎么定义的  一起说
on the concept of fate, Chorus?

490
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,150
时刻准备  严守纪律
Through readiness and discipline,

491
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,030
命运由我们自己掌控
we are masters of our fate.

492
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,330
你可能会觉得这种观点十分讽刺
You might call that notion ironic.

493
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,470
相信我  你会接受的
Trust me, you'll come around.

494
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,670
我的天啊  基梅尔
Oh, for Chris sake, Kimmel.

495
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,200
这样自在啊
I gotta be free, man!

496
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,050
好了  准备上战场
All right, man, let's get this show on the road.

497
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,170
我也得重装上阵了
I gotta suit up.

498
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,580
走吧
Let's go.

499
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,630
分离
Disengaged.

500
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,790
你有毛病啊
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you, man?

501
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,250
你没穿过战甲吗
Haven't you ever been in one of these before?

502
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,230
也许吧
Maybe.

503
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,870
你知道安全模式在哪里开吗
Do you know where the safety is?

504
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,010
不确定
I'm not sure.

505
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,760
很好
Good.

506
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,400
我知道你们的压力很大
I know the pressure on you is enormous.

507
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,570
两分钟后空降
Two minutes to drop.

508
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,800
害怕是正常的
It's all right to be scared.

509
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,620
记住  没有恐惧就没有勇气
Remember there's no courage without fear.

510
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,740
伙计
Ey! Oi, mate!

511
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,790
你的战甲好像有点问题
I think there's something wrong with your suit.

512
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,380
对  有个死人在里面
Yeah. There's a dead guy in it.

513
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,700
下去后记得小心  先生
Hey, watch your back out there, sir.

514
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,430
没人会管你
No one else will.

515
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,990
我去  你个狗娘养的
Jinx, bitch!

516
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,790
听我的指令
On my mark!

517
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,510
做好空降准备
Stand by to deploy!

518
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,130
拉好空降索  30秒后空降
Activate drop lines, thirty seconds.

519
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,690
降到地上
Hit the street...

520
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,020
快跳  快跳
Go! Go!

521
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,480
天啊  我们成功了
Woo-hoo! We made it!

522
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,680
-感谢天  我们成功了  -小心后面
- Thank God, we made it! - Behind you!

523
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,160
小心
Look out!

524
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,520
来了
Incoming!

525
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,460
我受伤了  我受伤了
I'm hit. I'm hit.

526
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,450
有多严重
How bad is it?

527
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,720
流了很多血吗
Is there... is there a... a lot of blood?

528
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,380
你胸口上有个洞
You have a hole in your chest.

529
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,900
真的吗
Really?

530
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:21,890
你刚是拆了我的电池吗
Did you just take my...my battery...battery?

531
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,210
不  不  不
No, no, no, no.

532
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,770
我的天
Holy fuck!

533
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,850
左  右  左
Left, right, left.

534
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,370
站起来  你这废物
On your feet, maggot!

535
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,730
法雷利军士长
Sergeant Farell!

536
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,960
-法雷利军士长  -能帮你什么吗
- Sergeant Farell. - Can I help you, sir?

537
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,390
我是比尔·凯奇少校
My name is major Bill Cage.

538
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,040
美国军事演说家
I'm U.S. Army media relations.

539
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,850
我没有参加单身派对或者赌博
I was not at a bachelor party or a poker game.

540
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:45,880
你左边口袋有封指令
You have an order in your left pocket

541
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,540
说我冒充军官  作为一个逃犯被抓了
that says I'm a deserter caught impersonating an officer.

542
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,200
但里面没说你是
But what it doesn't say is that your...

543
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,000
你是法雷利军士长
your name is master sergeant Farell

544
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,710
来自肯塔基州的科学山镇
from Science Hill, Kentucky.

545
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,720
如果你能给我30秒
And if you'll give me thirty seconds

546
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,680
解释我为什么知道这些
to explain how I know that,

547
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:58,870
你也许就能拯救基地里的所有人
you may just save the lives of every soldier on this base.

548
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,390
你得听我说
You have to listen to me!

549
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,580
它们知道我们要偷袭
They know we're coming!

550
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,910
它们正等着我们
They're waiting for us!

551
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,240
我亲身经历过
I have been there!

552
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,470
亲眼看到过
I've seen it!

553
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,720
你们都得完蛋了
You're all doomed!

554
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,030
你们都得完蛋了
You're doomed!

555
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,480
好了好了  我没事了
Okay, okay, okay. Okay, I'm fine.

556
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,500
我没事
I'm fine.

557
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,520
这是J小队吧
This is j squad. Yes?

558
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,980
这是J小队
This is j squad, yes.

559
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,150
我本不应该知道的  不过没事
Not that I should know that, but okay.

560
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,560
你们之前有见过我吗
Have any of you met me before?

561
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,900
混蛋  我不认识你
Bitch, I don't know you.

562
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,320
很好  谢谢你
Exactly! Yes! Thank you.

563
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,080
你叫南希  你叫比布尔
Your name is Nance. You're Bibble.

564
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,340
基布尔  不  是基梅尔
Kibble... Kimmel!

565
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,740
你经常裸身上阵
You fight balls out. Literally.

566
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,680
福特  斯金纳  格里夫
Ford. Skinner. Griff.

567
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,770
你叫
You're...

568
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,760
他话很少
He doesn't talk much.

569
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,650
他们在床上玩牌
But there's a card game under the bed.

570
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:40,730
真是多谢你了  混蛋
Thanks a lot, asshole.

571
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,550
基梅尔有一手同花顺
Uh, Kimmel's working on a flush.

572
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,390
黑桃  不  是梅花
Uh, spades... no, clubs.

573
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,210
你将要逼他们吃掉这些纸牌
And you're gonna make them eat those cards.

574
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,770
我说得没错吧
Am I right?

575
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,520
听我说
Now...

576
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,370
接下来我要说的可能会很疯狂
What I'm about to tell you sounds crazy.

577
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,550
但都是真的
It's true.

578
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,750
你们得听我的
And you have to listen to me.

579
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:09,240
这是决定你们性命的时刻
Your very lives depend on it.

580
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,370
一分钟后空降

飞船快要爆炸了

飞船快要爆炸了

00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,320
南希  他在说什么
Nance! What is he saying?

585
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,070
飞船快要爆炸了
The ship is about to explode!

586
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:35,340
有人听到我说话吗

- Activate drop lines. - The ship is about to explode!

589
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,050
天啊  我们成功了

590
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,700
感谢上帝  我们成功了
Thank god, we made it!

591
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,080
我会拿鞋跟捅烂你的屁眼

592
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,000
太好了  我们成功了

感谢上帝  我们成功了

594
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,020
抱歉  我这是在救你
I'm sorry! I'm trying to save you.

595
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,220
我们将遭遇大屠杀
We're getting slaughtered.

596
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,270
你得带我们从海滩突围
You need to get us off this beach.

597
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,410
我们得快走

598
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,380
这艘沉船马上就要爆炸了

站起来  你这废物
On your feet, maggot!

608
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,320
在我拿鞋跟捅烂你的屁眼前
Get in line before I bust your hole

609
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,030
站好队  废物
with my boot heel, maggot!

610
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,180
你还是有希望的  二等兵
Good news is there's hope for you, private.

611
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,550
战斗是最伟大的救赎
Battle is the great redeemer.

612
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,720
是锤炼真英雄的浴火熔炉
The fiery crucible in which the only true heroes are forged.

613
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,190
唯一一个众生平等...
The one place where all men truly sh... share the...

614
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:57,610
队员们  这位是二等兵凯奇
Squad, this here is private Cage.

615
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:00,050
我是士兵凯奇  你们一定是J小队吧
Private Cage. And you must be J squad.

616
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,040
很高兴见到你们
It's good to meet you.

617
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,820
你穿的是军官服吗
Isn't that an officer's uniform?

618
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,290
-军官可不会...  -军官可不会用这样的袖扣
- Those sure ain't officer's... - These sure ain't officer's cuff links.

619
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,230
钥匙应该在
Keys in the...

620
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,250
左侧口袋
left pocket probably.

621
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,350
士兵凯奇是个逃兵
Private Cage is a deserter.

622
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:22,010
拯救他是你们
I'm making you all personally responsible

623
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,520
所有人的责任
for his deliverance.

624
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,790
明早六点他要做好战斗准备
He will be combat-ready by oh-six-hundred tomorrow.

625
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:28,700
二等兵凯奇身陷幻想中
Private Cage is under the delusion

626
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,210
觉得自己不属于这里
he does not belong here.

627
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,130
我们必须打破他的幻想
We must dissuade him of this delusion.

628
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,330
如果他尝试逃跑
If he tries to run,

629
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,070
-你们完全可以把他...   -不  不可能
- feel free to dissuade him until... - oh, no, no, no.

630
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,750
我不会背弃大家的
I'm... I'm not going to run from you guys.

631
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,110
这绝对不可能
It's... not a chance.

632
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,830
打到生活不能自理
Till he can't piss standin' up.

633
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,290
谢谢你  法雷利军士长
Thank you, sergeant Farell.

It's gonna be my twentieth battle tomorrow, man.

646
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,800
你才没打那么多仗  老兄
You haven't been in twenty battles, mate.

647
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,820
-我也参战无数  -明天一登滩
- I have too. - You're gonna dump your load

648
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,090
你就得缴械投降
the second we hit the beach tomorrow.

649
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,080
你们俩快他妈闭嘴吧
Why don't you two get yourselves a nice hot cup

650
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,590
不吹牛能死啊
of shut-the-hell-up!

651
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:22,640
姑娘  你真有意思

什么事  谁允许你进来的
Yes? Who said you could talk to me?

693
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,020
我脸上有什么东西吗  大兵
Have I got something on my face, soldier?

694
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,800
你  你说过
You did. You did.

695

明天  在海滩
Tomorrow. At the beach.

你让我醒来后找你

699
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:58,420
你知道我在说什么
You do know what's happening to me.

700
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,320
跟我来
Come with me.

701
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,450
立刻
Now.

702
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,250
除了我  不要跟任何人提起这件事
You don't talk to anyone about this but me.

703
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,770
因为最好的情况是
'Cause the best case scenario

704
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,750
你被送进精神病院
is you're gonna end up in a psych ward.

705
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,170
最糟的是  被当成解剖研究对象
And the worst case, you'll get dissected for study.

706
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,750
-听懂了吗  明白吗  -明白
- Are we clear? Yes? - Yes.

707
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,330
你第一次死的时候  有什么事发生

708
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,200
-你杀死了一个变种  -是的

709
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,270
说具体点
Describe it.

710
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,080
它长得很不一样
It was different.

711
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,670
个头比较大  是蓝色的  
It was, uh, bigger. Bluish.

712
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,680
它的血都浇在你身上了
And you got covered in its blood.

713
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,750
确实如此
As a matter of fact, I did.

714
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,280
他们知道我们明天会登滩
They know we're coming on the beach tomorrow.

715
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,320
那是一场大屠杀  对吗
It's a slaughter, isn't it?

716
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,010
你怎么会知道
How do you know this?

717
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,500
你能不能  等等
Could you just... wait!

718
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,160
等等  等一下
Wait. Wait.

719
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,880
你能不能解释一下
Look, would you please just explain to me

720
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,330
到底是怎么回事
what the hell is happening?

721
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,310
我也曾和你一样
What happened to you happened to me.

722
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,310
我也会死而复生  但现在不能了
I had it. I lost it. Okay?

723
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,030
那太好了  这可以被治愈
I mean, that's great. There's a cure.

724
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,000
我如何才能摆脱这种境况
How do I get rid of this?

725
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,360
首先  你得帮助我
First, I need your help.

726
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,010
怎么帮助你
Help with... with what exactly?

727
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,000
赢取战争胜利
Winning the war.

728
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,280
走吧  快点
Let's go! Come on!

729
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,860
武器维修室

730
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:35,280
武器维修室

731
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,050
武器维修室

732
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,480
丽塔  他是谁  丽塔  你怎么来了
Rita, what is this? Rita? What are you doing here?

733
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,740
你得告诉我出了什么大事
You gotta give me some warning.

734
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,830
他是谁
Who's this?

735
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:44,410
他就是参加凡尔登战役之前的我
He's me. Before Verdun.

736
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,660
他能帮助我们
He's gonna help us.

737
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,130
什么  你说他也
What? You-you mean he's...

738
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,280
没错
Yes.

739
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,750
他什么时候死的  死在哪儿
When did he die? Where?

740
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,380
死在明天的登滩行动
On the beach. Tomorrow.

741
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,860
我背后伸出几根手指
How many fingers am I holding up behind my back?

742
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,360
我怎么知道
How should I know that?

743
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:06,640
好吧
Okay.

744
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,810
那么
So...

745
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,300
这是我们第一次对话
This is the first time we've had this conversation.

746
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,580
你用这个扎他试试
You should try this on him.

747
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,220
这到底是什么玩意儿
What the hell is that?

748
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,260
那没用的
It doesn't work.

749
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,320
他现在见过幻像了吗
Has he had any visions yet?

750
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,340
什么幻象
Visions of what?

751
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,440
好吧  看来还有时间
Okay, so there's still time.

752
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,130
-是的  -时间  
- Yes. - Time? Look.

753
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,420
抱歉  这到底
I... I'm sorry. Which is...?

754
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,460
这是谁
Who is this?

755
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,660
你是谁
Who are you?

756
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,690
我是卡特尔博士
I'm Dr. Carter.

757
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:28,120
研究粒子物理  先进的微生物学
Particle physics. Advanced microbiology.

758
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,290
他也是唯一相信
He's also the only other person

759
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,230
你离奇经历的人
who'll believe what's happening to you.

760
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,830
没有人比他更了解变种
No one understands mimic biology better than him.

761
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,980
{\an8}伦敦街道  政府机关所在地

762
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,980
他是怀特霍尔首屈一指的分析师
He's a top analyst at Whitehall.

763
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,830
在遇到丽塔之前  我确实如她所说
Well, I mean, I was until I met Rita

764
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,090
但现在我只不过是个
and now I'm just a...

765
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,610
异想天开的神经病修理工
a "Mechanic with psychiatric delusions."

766
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,640
卡特尔  给他看看
Carter. Show him.

767
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,410
是啊  好的
Yeah, right.

768
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,280
好了  首先
Right. Well, first of all...

769
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,830
你不是和一支军队在作战
You're not fighting an army.

770
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:59,370
你要把它想成单一生物
You have to think of this as a single organism.

771
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,520
这些游勇伞兵
Now...These common drones,

772
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,060
就像是它的爪牙
they act like its claws.

773
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,870
而你杀死的那只阿尔法
And alphas, like the one that you killed,

774
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:06,950
则比较罕见
are much more rare.

775
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:09,220
没错  据我推算  他们存在的概率为
Yeah. They're like one in six point one eight million,

776
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,110
-618万分之一  -对
- by my guess. - Yes.

777
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,750
他们相当于敌人的
They act as the enemy's...

778
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,650
他们就像是敌人的中枢神经系统
they're-they're like its central nervous system.

779
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:16,850
但这才是大脑
But this is the brain.

780
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,230
控制所有生物
It controls them all.

781
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,240
这就是欧米加
And this is the omega.

782
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:25,420
欧米加有控制时间的能力
And the omega has the ability to control time.

783
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:28,000
一旦阿尔法被杀
Whenever an Alpha is killed...

784
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:31,550
就会触发自动反应机制
An automatic response is triggered.

785
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,320
欧米加就会重置时间
The omega starts the day over again.

786
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,770
但是你看  这次它能够记住
But you see, this time it can remember

787
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:37,890
将会发生什么
what's going to happen...

788
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,440
就和你一样
Just like you do.

789
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,690
它在我们行动前
I-I-it knows exactly

790
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,060
就对我们的动作了如指掌
what we're gonna do before we're gonna do it.

791
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,190
-敌人能预知未来  -所以他们赢定了 它们赢定了
- And an enemy that knows the future can't lose. - It can't lose.

792
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,020
若果真如此
But if that's true,

793
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,380
你是怎么赢了凡尔登战役的
how did you win at Verdun?

794
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:51,980
是它故意让我们赢的
We were allowed to win.

795
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,620
它想让我们相信  我们能赢
This thing wants us to believe we can win.

796
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,900
它想让我们在这次侵袭中投入全力
It wants us to throw everything we have into the invasion.

797
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:02,080
没落行动不是我们的收官之战
Operation Downfall isn't our endgame,

798
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,390
是敌人的
it's the enemy's.

799
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,700
你要明白  这是一种极端先进  
The thing you've got to understand is

800
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,470
能够征服世界的有机体
this is a perfectly evolved, world-conquering organism.

801
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,230
据我们所知 有成千上百万
For all we know, there are thousands,

802
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,850
类似的生物
millions of those asteroids

803
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:17,380
像病毒一样游荡在宇宙中
floating around in the cosmos like a virus.

804
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,870
一旦条件成熟  他们就会登陆地球
And they're just waiting to crash-land into a world

805
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:21,620
大肆席卷而来
with just the right conditions.

806
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,110
他们只需要高级生命的躯体
All they need is for the dominant life form

807
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,480
用以袭击
to attack and...

808
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,470
到时候就再也没有任何力量能阻止
And there'll be nothing to stop the mimics

809
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:29,290
变种征服世界
from conquering the rest of the world.

810
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,710
除非你能改变结局
Unless you change the outcome.

811
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:34,560
我
Me?

812
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,480
你杀死那个阿尔法的时候
When you killed that Alpha,

813
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,980
你不经意地进入了敌人的神经系统
you inadvertently entered the enemy's nervous system.

814
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:38,990
凯奇
Cage.

815
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,200
欧米加重置时间的
You've seized control

816
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,090
能力转移到了你身上
of the omega's ability to reset the day.

817
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,790
这怎么可能
How's that even possible?

818
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,570
也许这就是他唯一的弱点
Perhaps this organism's only vulnerability,

819
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:51,200
他唯一的弱点就是人性
i-its only vulnerability is humanity.

820
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,980
抛开那些不论  你现在已经掌握这种能力了  
Regardless of that, you control the power now.

821
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:56,700
就像我在凡尔登战役中一样
Just as I did in Verdun.

822
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,220
我能重置时间
So I'm resetting the day?

823
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,820
好吧
Okay.

824
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,280
我要如何控制
How do I control it?

825
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,350
用死亡控制
You have to die.

826
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,810
每天都要死
Every day.

827
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,930
直到欧米加被摧毁为止
Until the omega's destroyed.

828
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,930
首先
First of all...

829
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,010
这介绍非常了不起
This is a terrific presentation.

830
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,980
棒极了
Terrific.

831
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,370
我认识将军
I know the general.

832
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,590
我们可以把这个给他看
We should take this to him.

833
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:39,890
把你知道的都告诉他
You just tell him everything you told me.

834
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,750
-他知道如何  -我见过将军了  凯奇
- He will know what... - I went to see the general, Cage.

835
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,350
每次都去
Any number of times.

836
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:46,530
精神病院  解剖研究
Psych ward. Dissection.

837
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:47,690
记得我说过的吗
Remember?

838
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:52,980
你们希望我怎么办
What are you expecting from me?

839
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,770
你有没有见过奇怪的东西
Have you seen anything strange?

840
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,350
他是不是在耍我
Is he shitting me?

841
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,130
-幻象  -是幻象
- Visions. - Visions.

842
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:04,010
你是否见过这样的幻象
Have you seen any visions like that?

843
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,880
当欧米加对它的能力失控时  它能感觉到
The omega senses when it's losing control of its power.

844
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,520
甚至它正在通过精神搜索追踪你
E-even now it's mentally searching to find you.

845
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:11,930
当它快找到你的时候
When it's close to finding you,

846
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:14,040
你会开始看见幻象
you will start having visions.

847
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,430
你就能看到它
You'll start to see that.

848
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:17,270
甚至能看到它身处何方
You'll even see where it is.

849
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,310
你见过这些幻象吗
And you had these visions?

850
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:22,400
见过
Yes.

851
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,490
但你最终还是看到了
But eventually you saw it.

852
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,630
亲眼见到它的真面目了
I mean, you actually saw it.

853
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:29,910
对吗
Right?

854
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,840
我没亲眼见过
Never in the flesh.

855
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:42,530
所以这些都只不过是理论罢了
So this is all just some...theory.

856
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,630
你也不知道这东西是否存在
You don't know if this thing even exists.

857
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:47,900
我在幻象中看见它在凡尔登
The visions showed me it was at Verdun.

858
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,010
我能看到它  只是
I could see it. I...

859
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:55,000
我在找到它之前失去了那种能力
I just...lost the power before I could get to it.

860
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:57,780
而当我们到凡尔登的时候
And by the time we took Verdun...

861
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,010
欧米加也消失了
The omega was gone.

862
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:08,560
好吧  我要做的就是等着这些幻象出现
Okay. So all I have to do is wait to have these...visions,

863
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:12,180
然后告诉你  这个叫做欧米加的东西在哪里
and then tell you where this...Omega thing is.

864
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,500
不  凯奇
No. Cage.

865
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,110
你要带我去找它
You're gonna get me there.

866
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,400
让我杀了它
And I'm gonna kill it.

867
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:20,660
带你去
Get you there?

868
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:22,450
我没有...
I'm not...

869
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,020
我都没受过专门的训练
I'm not even trained for combat.

870
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:41,640
{\an8}重新装弹

871
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,330
重新装弹

872
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,140
{\an8}重新装弹

873
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:04,320
凯奇  你还好吗
Are you all right, Cage?

874
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,810
我感觉好像哪里摔断了
I think I broke something.

875
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,110
哪里
What?

876
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:10,080
我的背
My back.

877
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,880
我现在只有嘴皮子有知觉
The only thing I can feel are my-my lips.

878
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,440
给我听好了  有条规则很重要
Now listen carefully. This is a very important rule.

879
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,660
这也是唯一的规则
This is the only rule.

880
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:23,470
一旦在战斗中受伤  务必让自己死掉
You get injured on the field, you better make sure you die.

881
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,140
为什么
Why?

882
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:28,570
上一次  我在战斗中受伤
Last time I was in combat, I was hit.

883
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,960
当时我失血过多  没死成
I was bleeding out. Just not fast enough.

884
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,930
我醒来的时候在战地医院
I woke up in a field hospital

885
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:37,570
输了三品托血  然后我就不行了
with three pints of someone else's blood and I was out.

886
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:41,350
我失去了那种能力  你明白吗
I lost the power. Do you understand?

887
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,170
-我们还是再来一遍吧  -什么
- Think we better start over. Don't you? - What?

888
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:51,960
没人知道二等兵凯奇去哪了吗
No one knows what happened to private Cage!

889
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:53,930
斯金纳  你这个白痴  他就在你旁边的
Skinner, you dumb-ass. He was right next to you.

890
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:54,780
你却说你不知道
You're tellin' me you don't know

891
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,540
那个小滑头去了哪吗
where that slippery son of a bitch went?

892
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,670
是的  中士
No, Sarge!

893
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,280
那行
All right.

894
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,910
不如我们再加五十个吧
Let's do another fifty, shall we?

895
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:03,470
开始
And one!

896
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,670
等下  我叫比尔·凯奇
No, wait! Wait. My name is bill Cage.

897
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,210
我们在沙滩见过  不  是明天
I... we met on the beach. We meet on the beach.

898
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:10,580
会见面  我拥有你以前的能力
Tomorrow. I have what you had.

899
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,990
好了  再来一遍
All right, let's go again.

900
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:24,720
记住  你没有时间多想
You don't have time to think. Remember.

901
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,970
光知道它们的位置是不够的
It's not enough knowing where they're going to be.

902
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,140
你得知道怎样干掉它们
You have to know how to kill them.

903
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:35,710
我只是  等下
I just, oh... hold on. Hold on.

904
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:37,440
听我说
Listen. Listen.

905
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:39,470
好吧
Okay.

906
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:40,390
动手吧
Do it.

907
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,590
站起来  你这只废物
On your feet, maggot!

908
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,300
停下  等等  等会
Stop! Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

909
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:52,100
停一下  等一会
Stop! Wait! Wait a second!

910
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:55,330
等一下
Wait a second. Wait a second.

911
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:56,900
我在想
You know, I've been thinking.

912
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,330
这东西能在我的血液里
I mean, this thing's in my blood.

913
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:02,920
也许我可以通过某些途径
So maybe there's some way...

914
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,090
传给你
I can transfer it to you.

915
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,420
我都试过了  没用的
I've tried everything. It doesn't work.

916
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,190
我是说  那个...你
I mean, have you...You know...

917
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,940
所有方法都试了吗
Tried all- all the options.

918
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:17,770
你是说性传播吧  试过了
Oh, you mean sex. Yep. Tried it.

919
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:19,430
试了多少次
How many times?

920
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,560
行了
All right.

921
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,760
左侧  左侧
Left, left! Left, left, le...

922
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:30,020
眼睛得睁大了
Keep your eyes open.

923
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:33,990
重来
Again.

924
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,610
重来
Again.

925
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:36,910
重来
Again.

926
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:40,930
重来
Again.

927
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:50,230
等一下  我觉得我没受伤
Just wait! Wait. I think I'm okay.

928
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:53,130
站起来  你这只废物
On your feet, maggot!

929
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:53,860
废物
Maggot!

930
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:54,640
废物
Maggot!

931
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,170
我已经够客气的了  废物  站起来
Now, I'm tryin' to be nice to you, maggot! Now, move!

932
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:00,950
凯奇  你还好吗
Are you okay, Cage?

933
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:02,910
当然  我很好  我没事
Oh yeah, yeah! I'm good! I'm good!

934
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,000
你的腿断了
Your leg's broken.

935
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,310
不不  我的脚趾还有知觉
No. I... I can still feel my toes.

936
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,480
不是吧
Oh, come on.

937
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:32,690
丽塔  丽塔  怎么回事  你在这做什么
Rita. R-Rita. What is this? What are you doing here?

938
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:34,010
这是谁
Who-who's this guy?

939
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:36,260
他和凡尔登之战前的我一样
He's me...Before Verdun.

940
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:37,540
什么意思  他是
What-what do you mean? He's...?

941
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:39,110
-对  没错  -他什么时候死的
- Yes. Yes. - When did he die?

942
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,520
-在哪死的  -沙滩上
- Where? - On the beach.

943
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,280
-明天  -我是比尔·凯奇  你是卡特尔博士
- Tomorrow. - I'm Bill Cage. You're Dr. Carter.

944
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,720
我们之前就有过这次谈话了
We've had this conversation before.

945
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,320
你在背后竖了两根手指
You have two fingers behind your back.

946
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,580
我看到幻象了
I've had the visions.

947
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:48,090
我看到了欧米加
I've seen the omega.

948
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:56,900
明天的战斗我们会败得很惨
It's...Pretty much game over tomorrow.

949
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,900
所以我们能直奔主题了吧
So, can we move this along?

950
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,690
好吧  在哪看见的欧米加
Okay. Okay... where?

951
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,020
那有个水坝
There's a dam.

952
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,390
在山里  我还看到了德语标志
It's in the mountains. I saw German writing.

953
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:08,300
你能找到具体位置吗
Do you think you can work out where that is?

954
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:10,960
我想符合描述的地点
W-well... I mean, there can't be too many places

955
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,880
就那么几个
that fit that description.

956
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,220
我尽量找到
I'll see what I can do.

957
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:14,760
训练结束了
Training's over.

958
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,360
我们明天见
I'll see you tomorrow.

959
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:18,010
我们连该去哪都还不知道
We don't even know where we're going.

960
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:19,300
很快就会知道了
We will soon enough.

961
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,060
你现在需要想的是
In the meantime, you need to figure out

962
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:22,920
我们如何在沙滩活下来
a way to get us off that beach.

963
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:47,210
接下来做什么  我们往哪
What next? Where we going?

964
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:49,130
往哪边  快想  往哪边 
Which way? Focus. Which way?

965
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:50,160
我在想
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

966
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,060
-好的  -我擦
- Okay. - Oh, man!

967
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,090
我们上次走了多远
How far did we make it?

968
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:57,800
这挺难说的  真的
You know, it's hard to say, really.

969
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,780
情况...
It's...

970
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:00,740
等下
Hold!

971
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:01,800
别走
Hold!

972
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,380
好  前进
Okay, go!

973
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:06,470
王八羔子
Son of a bitch!

974
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,140
我想是左侧前进  躲避 
I thought stepping left, ducking...

975
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:09,230
-听好了  往左前进  躲避  -好
- Just for the record, stepping left, ducking... - Fine.

976
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:11,340
往左前进  往右躲避
Stepping left, ducking right... stepping right.

977
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:12,700
-已经说得很明确了  -往左前进
- And it was pretty specific. - Stepping left,

978
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,320
往右躲避  继续
ducking right. Move on.

979
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:19,940
停下
Hold on!

980
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,980
记住  穿过战壕  正前方
Now remember, across the trench, twelve o'clock!

981
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,380
然后注意右侧
Then look to your right!

982
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:33,120
你说得不够明确  明白吗
You're not being specific. Do you understand?

983
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,080
我说过  你得讲清楚
I said... you need to be specific.

984
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,990
-好吧  但  -不然我必死无疑
- Uh, okay. But... look... - Otherwise, I'm dead.

985
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:37,190
听好  丽塔
Just... Rita.

986
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:40,230
凯奇
Cage!

987
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,240
冲到战壕顶端
...paces up to the top of the trench.

988
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:45,090
然后我往左走
I'm gonna step left.

989
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:47,010
那里有个变种  我把它干掉
There's gonna be a mimic there, which I'll kill...

990
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,180
装载机爆炸
...ship explosion.

991
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,370
我往西北方向前进30步
I'm gonna run thirty paces northwest.

992
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:01,160
然后在战壕顶部躲避
I'm gonna duck at the top of that trench

993
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,060
之后往左
and then I'm gonna turn left.

994
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,240
我脸上有东西吗
Have I got something on my face?

995
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:16,980
没有
No.

996
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:25,880
凯奇
Cage!

997
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,790
我们到处在找你
We've been lookin' everywhere for you.

998
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:29,740
凯奇
Cage!

999
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,750
凯奇  我们到处在...
Cage, we've been lookin'...

1000
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,070
兄弟们

1001
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:35,830
兄弟们  我们今天能不能...
Guys. Can we...just...

1002
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:37,760
缓一缓
not do this today?

1003
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,430
你说什么
What are you talkin' about?

1004
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:41,170
找不到你法雷利快把我们
Farell almost strung us up by our bollocks

1005
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:42,530
折磨死了
for losing track of you!

1006
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:47,000
好吧斯金纳  看着
Okay...Skinner. Watch this.

1007
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,030
现在我闭上眼睛
Now I'm gonna close my eyes.

1008
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:51,850
-好了吗  -好了
- Ready? - Yeah.

1009
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:59,110
混蛋
Stinking bastard.

1010
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:01,270
我不介意多做几个俯卧撑
I-I didn't mind the extra push-ups.

1011
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:13,300
兄弟们  又是新的一天
It's a new day, people.

1012
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:15,530
命运在召唤
Destiny calls.

1013
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:17,970
我们只要为世界做一件事
The world expects only one thing from us:

1014
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:19,120
那就是赢得战斗
That we will win.

1015
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,310
{\an8}前线传来的最新战况

1016
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:39,150
{\an8}我军伤亡惨重

1017
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:40,180
是时候
It's about time

1018
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,200
给它们点颜色看看了
we showed those things what we're made of.

1019
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,430
我父亲是不列颠战争中的飞行员
My father flew in the battle of Britain.

1020
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,470
美国佬是三年后才参战的
Three years before the yanks came into the war.

1021
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,130
我们势不可挡  非常有种  
Couldn't be broken. Backbone.

1022
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:53,730
我的叔叔乔治参加过诺曼底登陆战役
My uncle George landed on the beach at Normandy.

1023
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:54,640
是吗
Yeah?

1024
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,690
以他们的战斗力  这场战斗早就打完了
In their day, this war would have been over by now.

1025
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:59,690
它们到底想从我们这得到什么
What do they want with us, anyway?

1026
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,740
那还用说  矿产
It's obvious, isn't it? Minerals.

1027
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,080
-矿产  -没错  矿产
- Minerals? - Yeah, minerals. Metals.

1028
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,330
-它们想要氧气  -氧气  你再想想
- Oxygen, they want. - Oxygen? Think about it.

1029
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:06,760
争论这个有什么意义
What difference does it make?

1030
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,090
它们来了  也快赢了
They're here. They're winning.

1031
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:12,500
不管它们想要什么  都会得到
And whatever it is, they're gonna get it.

1032
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,190
你不是该去战场吗
Shouldn't you be over there?

1033
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,680
我上过战场
I've been over there.

1034
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,120
比你们次数都多
More times than anybody.

1035
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,280
事实上  我...
As a matter of fact, I'm...

1036
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:23,790
我死过好多次了
usually long dead by now.

1037
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:27,640
懦夫
Coward!

1038
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:31,840
怎么了
What's going on?

1039
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:33,740
停电了
The power's gone.

1040
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,900
我找到欧米加了
I found the omega. I found it.

1041
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,170
肯定在这  德国的卡内拉坝
It has to be here. Curnera dam, Germany.

1042
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:47,260
一定是这个没错
This has got to be it.

1043
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:48,420
完全符合你的描述
It fits the description perfectly.

1044
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:49,570
没错  你找到了
Yes, you found it.

1045
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:50,460
又找到了
Again.

1046
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:52,610
不过有什么意义呢
What difference does it make?

1047
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:54,720
我们永远无法到那
'Cause we're never gonna get there.

1048
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:57,810
不管我们怎么做
No matter what we do...

1049
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,730
不管我们如何精密策划
No matter how carefully we plan,

1050
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,580
我们都无法活着离开沙滩
we can't get off that beach.

1051
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,850
你能做到的  一定能
You can do this. You can.

1052
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,980
你还是每天到这来  我来训练你
You keep coming here every day and I'll train you.

1053
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,660
训练已经结束了
You already have.

1054
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,140
我等着呢  南希
I'm waitin', Nance!

1055
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:47,380
目标在五百米外  正在快速接近
Five hundred meters and closing fast!

1056
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:49,340
怎么回事
What the...?!

1057
00:57:58,190 --> 00:57:59,140
重新装弹
Reload.

1058
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:12,160
下面怎么做
What's next?

1059
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:16,970
一直向前  到山顶那
Straight shot... up the hill.

1060
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:17,980
好的
Okay.

1061
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:23,300
中士  那个新来的家伙  叫什么来着
Hey, Sarge, the new guy, what's his name again?

1062
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:29,910
我们需要一辆车深入腹地
We'll need a vehicle to get further inland.

1063
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,150
有什么问题吗
And what's the problem?

1064
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:33,780
问题在于下面会有伏击
The problem is the ambush waiting for us down there.

1065
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,570
我们还没找到车就会被杀掉
They kill us before we find a working car.

1066
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:37,260
好吧  那现在该怎么办
Okay. So, what's the current plan?

1067
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:39,120
那边还有两辆车没试过
The two cars we haven't tried yet.

1068
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,550
-那小货车  -好
- The minivan... - Yep.

1069
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,330
-和那辆绿色越野  -好
- ...and the green S.U.V. - Okay.

1070
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:44,620
我去试那辆越野  把变种引过去
So I'll head for the S.U.V., draw the mimics to me.

1071
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:45,810
你去试小货车
You go for the minivan.

1072
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:48,050
车子发动了你就走
You get it started, just go, take off.

1073
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:49,620
-不要等我  -好
- Do not wait for me. - Okay.

1074
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:51,060
等一下
Whoa... just...

1075
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,620
发动前别忘了把拖车解开
Don't forget to disconnect the caravan before you take off.

1076
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:55,960
速度要快
You are going to be in a hurry

1077
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,570
拖车是个累赘
and you don't want any dead weight.

1078
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:24,080
拜托
Come on.

1079
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:40,020
凯奇  上车
Come on, Cage!

1080
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,190
前线传回战况
On the front line.

1081
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:43,970
我军伤亡惨重
Our troops have suffered heavy casualties.

1082
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:46,490
敌方已突破多佛的安防
The enemy has breached security at Dover.

1083
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,330
我没看到有
I can't see.

1084
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:50,110
...寻找紧急避难场地
...seek shelter as a matter of urgency.

1085
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:50,850
你呢
Can you?

1086
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,500
变种已在朴茨茅斯  布莱顿
mimics have now been sighted at Portsmouth, Brighton

1087
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,820
及内陆的霍舍姆出现
and as far inland as Horsham.

1088
00:59:57,950 --> 00:59:59,490
政府提醒市民不要外出
The government advice at this point

1089
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:01,880
保持镇定
is to stay where you are and remain calm.

1090
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:03,870
如果您在车上
If you are in a vehicle,

1091
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:06,470
请锁好门窗待在车内
please lock doors and stay inside.

1092
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,040
我们...收到消息
We are... are now hearing accounts

1093
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,340
坎特伯雷及法汉姆遭到变种袭击
of mimic attacks at Canterbury, Farnham,

1094
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,590
我们...我们  我很抱歉
and... we... we... I'm sorry.

1095
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:17,010
敌方已在伦敦登陆
The enemy has reached London.

1096
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:17,860
重复一遍
Repeat...

1097
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,980
伦敦也受到了袭击
London is under attack.

1098
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:25,730
开得不错
It's good driving.

1099
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,850
我忘记把拖车解开了
I forgot to unhook the trailer.

1100
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,310
你不爱说话
You don't talk much.

1101
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:17,650
就这性格
I'm not a fan.

1102
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:19,260
不喜欢说话
Of talking?

1103
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:21,400
对  不太喜欢说话
Not a fan of talking. No.

1104
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:25,370
不过你还是和我说了
You know you eventually do talk to me.

1105
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:28,580
你告诉我
It's usually around Lyons.

1106
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:31,330
你和你家人去过里昂
You tell me about the time you went there with your family.

1107
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:32,770
你弟弟走丢了
Your brother got lost.

1108
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,520
我没去过里昂
I've never been to Lyons.

1109
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:38,860
你还告诉我你的中间名
You tell me your middle name.

1110
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:41,710
佩顿
Peyton.

1111
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:45,730
那也不是我的中间名
That's not my middle name.

1112
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:53,090
对了  你在游乐场找到了你弟弟
You found your brother in the arcade, by the way.

1113
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:57,980
估计是我编出来的  想让你安静些  
Well, maybe I made it all up just to keep you quiet.

1114
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,360
反正你的确和我聊天了
But you do talk to me.

1115
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,500
凯奇  我不需要了解你
Cage, I do not need to get to know you.

1116
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,840
如果你知道什么对你有利
And if you knew what was good for you,

1117
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,460
你就不会想了解我了
you wouldn't want to get to know me either.

1118
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,860
只有这样才能保命
It's the only way you make it through this thing.

1119
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:09,800
那亨德里克斯呢  你了解他吗
What about Hendricks? You get to know him?

1120
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,300
你怎么知道他的
How do you know that name?

1121
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:13,070
你提到过
You mentioned him.

1122
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:15,430
不可能
That's not possible.

1123
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:16,530
不然我怎么会知道他
Then how do I know his name?

1124
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:19,180
我什么时候说的  当时什么情况
When did I mention him? Under what circumstance?

1125
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:22,220
你不和我讲话是因为他吗
Is he why you won't talk to me?

1126
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:28,340
别再提起他了
Don't ever mention his name again.

1127
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,330
-怎么了  你还爱着他  -他死了
- Why? Are you... in love with him? - He's dead.

1128
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:38,320
我亲眼看着他死了300次
And I watched him die three hundred times,

1129
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:41,320
每个细节都历历在目
and I remember... every detail.

1130
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,170
每个细节都是
I remember everything.

1131
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:44,090
所以我不想谈这个
So I don't need to talk about it.

1132
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:50,380
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1133
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,270
战争就是这样
It's just war.

1134
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,510
什么都没有  我们走吧
There's nothing here. Let's keep going.

1135
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:22,700
我们得找到钥匙
We have to find the keys.

1136
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:25,490
弄点油就行了
Let's just siphon the gas.

1137
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:27,470
有飞机为什么还要开车
Oh, why drive when we can fly?

1138
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:29,220
开这玩意吗
In that thing?

1139
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,610
让我猜猜  你恐高
Let me guess. You're afraid of heights.

1140
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:33,030
我害怕会坠毁
I'm afraid of crashing.

1141
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,880
这没什么可丢人的
And not at all ashamed to admit it.

1142
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,850
没事的  凯奇  到时候就会了
You'll be fine, cage. You'll learn.

1143
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:39,880
怎么了
What is it?

1144
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,390
没什么  我没事
It's nothing. I'm fine.

1145
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:43,690
-到底怎么了  -没什么
- What is it? - It's nothing.

1146
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:44,860
丽塔
Rita.

1147
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:49,730
给我看看
Let me see.

1148
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:12,320
我们必须找到直升机的钥匙
We have to find the keys to the helicopter.

1149
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,230
钥匙肯定就在这附近
I'm sure they're around here somewhere.

1150
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:16,750
直升机的油箱是满的
You know the heli's full of fuel, though.

1151
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,520
我找到了一根软管
I found a hose.

1152
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:20,850
我们坐飞机  凯奇
We're flying, cage.

1153
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:26,910
就算我们找到了钥匙
Let's just say we find the keys.

1154
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,320
就算启动直升机
You know? Get that helicopter started.

1155
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,650
可我们没有既铠甲也没有弹药
We don't have our jackets or ammunition.

1156
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:35,040
再过几小时天就黑了
It's gonna be dark in a few hours.

1157
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:39,910
那还不如回农舍
Might be better off just going back to the farmhouse.

1158
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:42,030
看看有什么可拿的
Seeing what we could salvage.

1159
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:44,190
在那里待一个晚上
You know? Spend the night there.

1160
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:46,120
早上再回来
Come back here in the morning.

1161
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:48,570
蜷缩在火堆旁  开一瓶酒
And curl up by the fire and open a bottle of wine.

1162
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:54,670
我觉得我们该重来了
I think we should just reset.

1163
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:56,010
无路可走了
Whoa! It's a dead end.

1164
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:56,850
嗨  等等
Hey, just...

1165
01:05:56,850 --> 01:05:58,610
你到没什么  可我累了
if it's all the same to you, I'm tired.

1166
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:00,400
我很痛  我宁愿重来一次
I'm in pain. I'd rather just start fresh.

1167
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,140
听我说  给我点时间
I'll tell you what. Take a few minutes.

1168
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:04,860
咖啡已经准备好了  我会去找钥匙
Coffee's ready. I'll look around for the keys.

1169
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:05,680
应该找得到
That's productive.

1170
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,590
十分钟  好的
Ten minutes. Okay.

1171
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:08,960
之后我就会杀了你
And then I'm killing you.

1172
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,510
行
Fine.

1173
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:15,970
你竟然还能找到咖啡
I can't believe you found coffee.

1174
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:19,190
谢谢
Thank you.

1175
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:24,010
加糖  对吗
Sugar, right?

1176
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:25,130
是的
Yeah.

1177
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:31,710
谢谢
Thank you.

1178
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:34,230
等等  三包  你喜欢加三包
Ah, hold on. Three. You like three.

1179
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:50,200
那儿有一件衬衣  应该符合你的尺寸
There's a shirt over there. It should be your size.

1180
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:00,590
我们已经来这里几次了
How many times have we been here?

1181
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:08,230
几次了
How many times?

1182
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:10,640
钥匙在哪里
Where are the keys?

1183
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:13,770
-那该死的钥匙在哪  -好吧
- Where are the goddamn keys? - Yeah, okay.

1184
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:18,780
你会开飞机  是吗
You can fly it, can't you?

1185
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:20,130
不会  好吧  
No. Well, yes.

1186
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:21,560
是  我是说  我能起飞
I mean, I can take off.

1187
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:23,100
还不会降落  所以
I'm still working on my landing, so...

1188
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,300
那我们还在这里干什么
What are we still doing here?

1189
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:25,470
你在浪费时间
You're wasting time!

1190
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:27,670
丽塔  如果启动飞机你就会死
Rita, if you start that engine you die.

1191
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:32,800
你只能活这么久
This is far as you go.

1192
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:34,650
无论我做什么
No matter what I do...

1193
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:37,870
你都会死在这里
This is as far as you ever make it.

1194
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:49,090
有一个变种在距离20码的地方埋伏着
There's a mimic buried twenty yards away.

1195
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:51,460
你一启动引擎它就开始攻击
It attacks when you start the engine.

1196
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:55,400
带上弹药上飞机  凯奇
Get your weapon and get in the helicopter, Cage.

1197
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:57,350
田地里还有更多
There's more in the field back there.

1198
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:01,540
我们俩只能活一个
Only one of us ever makes it.

1199
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,200
上飞机
Get in.

1200
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,460
我们唯一没有试过的方法就是
The only thing we haven't tried is the version

1201
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:05,190
你离开这里  回到农舍
where you walk away. Just go back to the farmhouse.

1202
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:06,720
那里有一个地窖  那儿有食物
There's a cellar. There's food.

1203
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,460
你在那等我回来
You wait there till I get back.

1204
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:09,780
你会很安全
You'll be safe.

1205
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:12,110
我是一个战士  我心甘情愿
I'm a soldier. I volunteered.

1206
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:13,020
我不会逃避
I'm not walking away.

1207
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:14,230
你会死在这
You die here.

1208
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:15,550
就在这
Right here.

1209
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:19,100
我救不了你
I...can't save you.

1210
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:22,950
如果我去杀欧米加  你会死
And if I go on and kill the omega, you're dead.

1211
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:24,420
永远
Forever.

1212
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:26,600
我出事了又有什么关系
Why does it matter what happens to me?

1213
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,360
我希望
I wish...

1214
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:33,560
我不认识你
I didn't know you...

1215
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:36,980
但事实不是这样
But I do.

1216
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:10,080
我的中间名
My middle name...

1217
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:12,800
是萝丝
is rose.

1218
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:34,570
站起来  你这废物
On your feet, maggot!

1219
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:48,000
你还是有希望的  二等兵
The good news is there's hope for you, private.

1220
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:50,410
参与光荣的战斗
Hope in the form of glorious combat.

1221
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,010
战斗是最伟大的救赎
Battle is the great redeemer,

1222
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:56,360
是锤炼真英雄的浴火熔炉
the fiery crucible in which the only true heroes are forged.

1223
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:58,680
唯一一个众生...
The one place where all men...

1224
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:08,870
有事吗
Yes?

1225
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:11,830
谁允许你进来的
Who said you could talk to me?

1226
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,620
我脸上有东西吗  大兵
Have I got something on my face, soldier?

1227
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:22,800
不好意思打扰了  中士
I'm sorry to disturb you, sergeant.

1228
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:46,740
好了  伙计  准备上战场
All right, man, let's get this show on the road.

1229
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:47,890
我也得重装上阵了
I gotta suit up.

1230
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,710
快点  基梅尔  开始了
Come on, Kimmel, let's have it!

1231
01:11:50,770 --> 01:11:51,690
你的头盔呢
Where's your helmet?

1232
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:54,680
我从来不戴
Never wear one.

1233
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:56,580
是个累赘
It's a distraction.

1234
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,250
你喝醉了吗
Have you been drinking?

1235
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:02,500
再给我三个五五六的弹簧夹
I need three more clips of five-five-six,

1236
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:05,440
八个手雷  和一个备用电池
eight grenades and an extra battery.

1237
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:10,280
快去拿
Get it.

1238
01:12:18,770 --> 01:12:20,150
伙计
Ey! Oi, mate!

1239
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,280
你的战甲好像有点问题
I think there's something wrong with your suit.

1240
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:25,270
有个死人在里面
There's a dead guy in it.

1241
01:12:26,330 --> 01:12:28,650
天啊  我们成功了
Woo-hoo! We made it!

1242
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:30,180
感谢老天  我们成功了
Thank god, we made it!

1243
01:14:33,230 --> 01:14:33,960
干掉他
Finish it!

1244
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:30,400
它不在那
It isn't there.

1245
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:31,970
什么意思  欧米加不在那
What do you mean the omega isn't there?

1246
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:34,930
我猜它们不在那  它们知道我们会去
My guess is it never was. They knew we were coming.

1247
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:35,850
它们在那里埋伏我们
They ambushed us.

1248
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:37,250
幻想是一个陷阱
The visions were a trap.

1249
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:41,410
就像丽塔在凡尔登的幻想一样
Just like Rita's visions were a trap at Verdun.

1250
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:44,430
它本可以杀了我它但没有
It could have killed me but it didn't.

1251
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:45,920
它们只是要我的血
It's after my blood.

1252
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:46,900
所以他们知道你是谁
So they know who you are.

1253
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:50,280
他们想恢复自己的能量
They... they want their power back.

1254
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:51,940
他们迟早会得逞的
And they're gonna get it one way or another.

1255
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:53,850
除非我们找到欧米加
Unless we find the omega.

1256
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:56,180
没别的办法了  我们完了
The... there isn't any other way. We're finished.

1257
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:58,270
不  还没完
No. We're not finished.

1258
01:15:58,470 --> 01:15:59,800
那个没有用  我无法让它工作
That doesn't work. I-I can't get it to work.

1259
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,120
你在怀特霍尔造了一个原型
You built a prototype at Whitehall...

1260
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,770
是的  还害我丢了工作  托你的福
yes, and I got fired for it, thank you very much.

1261
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:05,140
话说回来  那到底是什么
Wh-what is this thing, anyway?

1262
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:06,090
是一个转发器
It's a transponder.

1263
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:07,140
把它插入阿尔法体内
You stick it into the Alpha,

1264
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:09,500
它会用波长信息连接欧米加
and it taps into the wavelength connecting it to the omega.

1265
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,350
这就是原理
That's the idea, anyway.

1266
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:12,890
但是我无法让它工作
But I can't get it to work.

1267
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:14,720
现在手头的设备根本不行
Not with the equipment I have on hand.

1268
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,500
怎样才能弄到你想要的东西
How do we get you what you need?

1269
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:19,240
好吧  这就是问题所在
Well, that's the thing.

1270
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,440
我在怀特霍尔造了一个
I mean, when I was at Whitehall I built one.

1271
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:22,730
都已经到测试阶段了
I was even ready to test it.

1272
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:24,440
当我跟上级反应的时候
When I told my superiors about it...

1273
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,600
我就丢了工作
Well, I lost my job.

1274
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,880
他们都觉得他疯了
They thought he was crazy.

1275
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:29,220
所以我们只要去怀特霍尔
So all we need to do is go to Whitehall.

1276
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:32,180
还没接近大门你就会被逮捕
You'd be arrested ten feet from the front door.

1277
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:33,830
精神病院  解剖  记得吗
Psych ward. Dissection. Remember?

1278
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:36,340
嘿  难道你忘了吗
Hey, hey, hey! Aren't you forgetting something?

1279
01:16:36,450 --> 01:16:39,210
转换器需要一个活体阿尔法才能工作
The transponder requires a live Alpha to make it work.

1280
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:42,760
我们不需要  我们有更好的
We don't need one. We got the next best thing.

1281
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:48,020
中国代表团出来的时候
When the Chinese delegation comes out...

1282
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,350
我们加快脚步
We pick up the pace.

1283
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,920
带黄袖章的人总能把你认出来
This guy with the yellow armband always recognizes you...

1284
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:57,130
把头低下  站在我的右边
So just keep your head down and stay to my right.

1285
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,100
干得好
Nicely done.

1286
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:10,120
三  二  一
Three, two, one.

1287
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:10,860
走
Go.

1288
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:11,680
一
One...

1289
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,100
六  七
Six, seven...

1290
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:16,920
八
Eight...

1291
01:17:24,030 --> 01:17:25,950
转身
And, turn.

1292
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:29,280
好  继续走  盯着前面
Okay. Keep walking. Just stare straight ahead.

1293
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:31,600
罗宾逊
Robinson.

1294
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:34,320
我说了别打扰我
I've asked not to be disturbed.

1295
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:35,570
最好是特别紧急的事情
This had better be critical.

1296
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:36,870
人类的命运
The fate of mankind.

1297
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:38,100
够紧急吗
Critical enough?

1298
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:40,320
真不敢我的眼睛
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

1299
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:42,290
我也见多不怪了
I've had more than my share of that.

1300
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:45,100
坐下  将军  离那张桌子远一点
Sit down, general. Stay away from the desk.

1301
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:47,820
如果我是你  就会听她的话
I'd take her very seriously if I were you.

1302
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:51,300
不得不佩服你  少将
Have to hand it to you, major.

1303
01:17:52,350 --> 01:17:53,480
今天你离开办公室的时候
When you left this office today,

1304
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,050
我从未想过你会再回来
I never imagined you'd be back,

1305
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:57,250
更别说还跟我授奖最多的战士一起
let alone with my most decorated soldier.

1306
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:58,460
我要给你讲个故事  将军
I'm gonna tell you a story, general.

1307
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:00,020
一开始听起来有些荒谬
And, at first, it's gonna sound ridiculous,

1308
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:03,240
但越到后面  越会显得合理
but the longer I talk, the more rational it's going to appear.

1309
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,460
跟他说过会儿打给他
Tell him you'll call back.

1310
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:05,570
告诉谁
Tell who?

1311
01:18:05,570 --> 01:18:07,510
博蒙特少将  从哈利法克斯打来的
Major general Beaumont, calling from Halifax.

1312
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,760
他的航班因为天气原因延误了
His plane has just been delayed. Bad weather.

1313
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:11,200
是
Yes.

1314
01:18:14,710 --> 01:18:16,450
谢谢  博蒙特  待会儿打给你
Thank you, Beaumont. I'll call you back.

1315
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:20,620
明天的侵袭将会是一场大屠杀
Tomorrow's invasion is a slaughter.

1316
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:22,550
登滩不过五分钟我就会死
I'm dead within five minutes of landing on that beach,

1317
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:24,870
和那些你派出去的所有士兵一起
along with every other soldier you are sending.

1318
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:27,450
因为敌人早知道我们的计划
And that's because the enemy knows we're coming.

1319
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,630
我怎么会知道  我临死前
How do I know this? Before I died,

1320
01:18:29,630 --> 01:18:31,860
杀死了一只变种  不过这只有些不寻常
i killed a mimic, only this one was different.

1321
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:34,050
它往我的血液里输送了一些东西
It passed something on to me. In my blood.

1322
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:36,820
现在我不停地重复同一天的生活
Now I live the same day over and over again.

1323
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:38,070
就和他们一样
Just like they do.

1324
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:39,460
就像薇拉塔斯基军士
Just like sergeant Vrataski...

1325
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:40,580
在凡尔登的时候一样
At Verdun.

1326
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:42,930
告诉你的秘书一切正常
Tell your secretary everything's fine.

1327
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:44,660
你说什么
Beg your pardon?

1328
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:50,480
对不起  上校  我以为只有你一个人
Um, I'm...sorry, general. I thought you were alone.

1329
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,400
没关系
It's fine.

1330
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,660
她打印了一些命令  等你签字
She typed up those orders for you to authorize.

1331
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:55,540
但是她忘了关于格林威治
But she left out the ones referring to the fuel dump

1332
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:56,610
燃油卸除的部分
at Greenwich.

1333
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,050
你叫爱丽斯
Your name is Iris.

1334
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:02,050
九月十七日出生
Your birthday is September seventeenth.

1335
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,140
上校私下动用了点关系
The general quietly pulled some strings,

1336
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:05,740
把你唯一的儿子安排在澳大利亚
stationed your only son in Australia,

1337
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:07,480
尽可能的远离这场战争
as far from the war as possible.

1338
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:09,370
告诉上校他的晚餐取消了
Tell the general his dinner's just been canceled.

1339
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:10,740
是刚刚接到命令
The call came in just now.

1340
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:14,480
你的晚餐已经被取消了
Your dinner was canceled.

1341
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:16,400
你忘记了燃料卸除的部分
You forgot the fuel dump.

1342
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,320
谢谢  爱丽斯  你可以出去了
Thank you, Iris. That'll be all.

1343
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:28,850
凯奇  行动吧
Cage, let's go.

1344
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:29,750
丽塔
Rita.

1345
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:30,800
-让我...  -我们在做什么
- Let me just... - What are we doing?

1346
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,890
不要再朝他开枪了  好吗
Please, don't shoot him again. Okay?

1347
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,830
等等  等等
Just ... just...

1348
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:40,010
上校
General, thi...

1349
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:42,230
这不是我们第一次谈话了
this isn't the first time we've had this conversation, okay?

1350
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:45,460
正是因为你太固执了
That's-that's- because you're-you're stubborn.

1351
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:47,870
你不会相信我所说的
You won't believe me when I tell ya

1352
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:49,250
卡特尔博士是对的
that Dr. Carter was right.

1353
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:52,270
敌人可以操控时间
That the enemy can manipulate time.

1354
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:53,650
侵袭必然会失败
The invasion will fail.

1355
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:55,930
不管你派遣的多少士兵
No matter how many bodies you throw at it.

1356
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:58,120
唯一能赢这场战争的方法
The only way to win this war

1357
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:01,380
是找到变种的能量来源
is by finding this power source of the mimic horde

1358
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,130
然后破坏它
and killing it.

1359
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:03,840
找到它的唯一途径
And the only means of finding it

1360
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:05,830
就在这个保险柜里
is in that safe right there.

1361
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:10,500
不管我们谈论多少次
No matter how many times we have this conversation...

1362
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:11,810
你都不会接受
You refuse to accept

1363
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:13,850
敌人明天会毁灭伦敦的事实
that the enemy breaks through to London tomorrow

1364
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:15,100
所以我们会输
and we lose.

1365
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:16,640
输的一干二净
We lose everything.

1366
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:25,780
我不得不说
Let's say for one moment...

1367
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,110
我不能合理地解释
That I can't rationally explain...

1368
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:32,300
你那令人印象深刻的小把戏
Your impressive parlor tricks.

1369
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:36,400
卡特尔博士告诉我
Dr. Carter told me...

1370
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:39,480
这个设备需要一个活的变种去启动
This device requires a live mimic to work.

1371
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:40,830
你要它做什么
What use is it to you?

1372
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:42,830
这是我的事情
That's my concern.

1373
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:43,820
正相反
On the contrary.

1374
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,580
你说的这关系到全世界
According to you, this concerns the whole world.

1375
01:20:46,910 --> 01:20:47,880
那么  如果你相信我所说的
Well, what would you do

1376
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,990
你会怎么做
if you believed everything I just told you?

1377
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:52,940
我会找到
I would locate this...

1378
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:55,040
-欧米加  -然后炸了它
- omega. - And bomb it out of existence.

1379
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,070
你在精神上无法与之匹敌
You're not mentally equipped to fight this thing.

1380
01:20:57,070 --> 01:20:58,260
你永远赢不了
And you never will be.

1381
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:16,700
接下来怎么办
What do we do now?

1382
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:20,170
不知道  我们还从未到过这一步
I don't know. We've never gotten this far.

1383
01:21:27,290 --> 01:21:27,890
放轻松
That was easy.

1384
01:21:27,890 --> 01:21:29,660
不要动
Now! Stop!

1385
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:30,810
不要轻举妄动
Stop right there! Don't move!

1386
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:32,200
不要动
Nobody move!

1387
01:21:33,850 --> 01:21:34,790
放下武器
Weapon!

1388
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:37,260
不要动
Stop!

1389
01:21:41,350 --> 01:21:42,770
他们逃跑了
They're off and away!

1390
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:44,440
我要怎么用这个东西
What am I supposed to do with this?

1391
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:47,180
插到你大腿上  马上
Stick it in your leg. Do it!

1392
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:06,840
凯奇  怎么了
Cage, what's happening?

1393
01:22:08,030 --> 01:22:09,040
告诉我
Talk to me.

1394
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:12,110
我感觉到了  它正把我带向那里
I feel it. It's tak-it's taking me there.

1395
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:13,960
你看到了什么
What do you see?

1396
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:17,420
卢浮宫
It's-it's the louvre.

1397
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:18,910
哪里  你现在在哪里
Where? Where are you?

1398
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,520
我在卢浮宫里  它被水淹了
I'm inside now. It's flooded.

1399
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:24,060
现在我正在往下  在一个停车场里
Now I'm going down. I'm in a-I'm in a garage.

1400
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:25,860
卢浮宫下面的停车场
A garage underneath the museum.

1401
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:28,060
你能看到欧米加吗
The omega. Can you see it?

1402
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:35,570
它在巴黎
It's in Paris.

1403
01:22:53,450 --> 01:22:54,180
丽塔
Rita!

1404
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:02,800
转头
Turn your head!

1405
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:04,820
呆在车里不要动
Stay in the car!

1406
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:08,540
把这辆车挪开  
Move away from the car! Move away!

1407
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,040
你做了什么
What have you done?

1408
01:23:38,130 --> 01:23:39,320
你对我做了什么
What have you done?

1409
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:43,980
你没事  你只是需要输血
You'll be fine. You just needed blood.

1410
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:46,510
你根本不知道你做了什么
You don't know what you've just done.

1411
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:48,610
我不能和你讲话
I'm not allowed to talk to you.

1412
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:49,870
还有一个人跟我一起
I was with someone.

1413
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:53,850
丽塔·薇拉塔斯基还活着吗
Rita Vrataski. Is she alive?

1414
01:23:54,290 --> 01:23:55,460
丽塔·薇拉塔斯基
Rita Vrataski.

1415
01:23:56,210 --> 01:23:56,930
求你了
Please.

1416
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:59,130
告诉我吧
Just tell me that.

1417
01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:03,010
求你告诉我
Please tell me.

1418
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:04,860
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1419
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:44,440
我只花三分钟就摆脱了这玩意儿  凯奇
I was out of those things in three minutes flat, Cage.

1420
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:45,470
你怎么回事
What's wrong with you?

1421
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:48,940
我以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

1422
01:24:49,490 --> 01:24:50,280
还没
Not yet.

1423
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:57,040
-抱歉  凯奇  -别别别
- Sorry, Cage. - No! Whoa-whoa.

1424
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,640
等等  等等  我不行了  我不行了
Wait! Wait! I'm out. I'm out.

1425
01:24:59,710 --> 01:25:00,810
他们给我输了血
They gave me blood.

1426
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:06,270
我失去那种能力了
I lost the power.

1427
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:09,460
我感觉到了
I feel it.

1428
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:12,320
我再也不能重置时间了
I can't reset the day anymore.

1429
01:25:27,870 --> 01:25:29,340
我们必须在侵袭开始前
We have to kill the omega...

1430
01:25:29,470 --> 01:25:30,980
杀死欧米加
before the invasion starts.

1431
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,000
我们只有不到3小时
That gives us less than three hours.

1432
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,410
我们得有一艘直达船才能赶到巴黎
We need a drop ship to get to Paris in time.

1433
01:25:38,610 --> 01:25:39,960
还需要一些士兵
Need more soldiers too.

1434
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:42,960
现在谁能疯狂到跟我们一起去Paris
Now who's crazy enough to follow us to Paris?

1435
01:25:50,050 --> 01:25:52,590
-凯奇  凯奇  -二位
-Cage! Cage! - Guys!

1436
01:25:52,590 --> 01:25:54,150
我们到处找你
We've been lookin' everywhere for you.

1437
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:55,280
听我说
Just...Listen.

1438
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,840
找不到你法雷利快把我们
Farell almost strung us up by our bollocks

1439
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:57,430
折磨死了
for losing track of you!

1440
01:25:57,430 --> 01:25:59,160
我知道  我知道  听我说
I know. I know. Just listen.

1441
01:25:59,570 --> 01:26:00,920
你们会对这个故事感兴趣的
You're gonna wanna hear this story.

1442
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,630
开头听起来可能会有些荒唐
Now, it's gonna sound ridiculous at first,

1443
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:03,750
但越到后面
but the longer I talk,

1444
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,760
会显得越合理
the more rational it's going to appear.

1445
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:06,600
是吗
Yeah?

1446
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:08,440
他知道我学校的名字
He named the school I went to.

1447
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,840
他还说我二年级的老师
And then he tells me my second grade teacher...

1448
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:13,180
外号叫麻痹症小姐
was called Miss Polio.

1449
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:14,280
她不让他去洗手间
She wouldn't let him go to the bathroom,

1450
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:15,690
所以他尿裤子了
made him wet his pants.

1451
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:17,330
闭嘴
Shut up.

1452
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:20,080
我是说
Look, I am telling you, man.

1453
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,670
他知道一切
He knows everything.

1454
01:26:22,150 --> 01:26:23,180
关于我们大家的一切
About all of us.

1455
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:24,460
扯淡
Bullshit.

1456
01:26:25,770 --> 01:26:28,300
他说你的名字其实不叫福特
He says your name ain't really Ford.

1457
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:30,690
福特是你的朋友
Says Ford was your friend.

1458
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:32,730
第一天上战场时就死了
Died in combat on his first day.

1459
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:35,630
你顶了他的缺  把你的薪水寄到他家
You took his place. Send your checks to his family.

1460
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:38,110
你这个小滑头
You slippery bitch.

1461
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,010
凯奇说敌人也了解我们
Cage says the enemy knows us too.

1462
01:26:40,130 --> 01:26:41,640
它们在海滩上等我们
They're waitin' for us on the beach.

1463
01:26:41,890 --> 01:26:42,890
我们都会战死
And we all die.

1464
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:44,680
整个侵袭就是场屠杀
The whole invasion is a slaughter.

1465
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:46,670
说得好
Well, this is great.

1466
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:48,990
还真是为明天的战斗鼓舞士气啊
Really good confidence booster for tomorrow.

1467
01:26:48,990 --> 01:26:49,820
谢谢你  凯奇
Thanks, Cage.

1468
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:51,310
我们能改变这一切  对吗
But we can change it, right?

1469
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:53,650
我是说  我们肯定能做些什么
I mean, there has to be somethin' that we can do.

1470
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:56,220
我们肯定   有办法能获胜
There has to be... a way that we can win.

1471
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,610
确实有机会
There is a chance.

1472
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:00,410
机会非常渺茫
It's a slim one.

1473
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:04,460
但是得跟我走  马上
But it means coming with me...right now.

1474
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:05,530
听着  哥们
Listen, pal.

1475
01:27:05,810 --> 01:27:08,490
我才不在乎你知道我们些什么
I don't really care what you think you know about us.

1476
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:10,390
我们才刚认识而已
We just met you.

1477
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:14,110
少来 我们为什么要跟他去战斗啊
Come on why would we follow him into combat?

1478
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:20,780
我没指望你们跟着我
I don't expect you to follow me.

1479
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:23,170
我希望你们跟着她
I expect you to follow her.

1480
01:27:27,690 --> 01:27:29,660
-那是全金属...  -J小队
-That's the full metal... - J squad.

1481
01:27:30,990 --> 01:27:32,370
这是丽塔·薇拉塔斯基
This is Rita Vrataski.

1482
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,770
-著名的...  -知道
- Otherwise known as... - Yeah, yeah.

1483
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:37,450
凡尔登天使
The angel of Verdun.

1484
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:49,130
好吧
Okay.

1485
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,450
又是新的一天  同志们
It's a new day, people.

1486
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,280
命运在召唤我们
Destiny calls.

1487
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:05,710
全世界都期盼着我们能赢
The world expects only one thing that we will win.

1488
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,680
今天必须全力以赴
Rest assured the enemy will thank you

1489
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,770
否则  敌人定会感谢你
for not giving a hundred percent today.

1490
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:10,740
队员们
Squad.

1491
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:15,590
J小队去哪里了
Where's J Squad?

1492
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:37,060
这个欧米加能控制时间
Right, okay. So this omega, it controls time.

1493
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:38,520
把那该死的鸟玩意儿
Just blow the new age piece of bollocks

1494
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:41,430
炸回老家  然后我们回家
back where it came from. And then we go home.

1495
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,380
有个阿尔法守护着它
Right, it-it's guarded by an Alpha.

1496
01:28:43,390 --> 01:28:45,240
直接杀死它  行吗
Just kill it. Okay?

1497
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:46,320
不行
No!

1498
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:48,030
凯奇刚才说了
You heard what Cage said.

1499
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:49,500
不要杀死阿尔法
Do not kill an Alpha.

1500
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:50,440
要是杀死阿尔法
If we kill an Alpha,

1501
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:52,340
欧米加就会重置时间
the Omega will reset this whole day.

1502
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,030
我们就会忘记这场谈话
We'll never even remember we had this conversation.

1503
01:28:55,030 --> 01:28:56,080
它们就会知道我们要去
And they're gonna know we're coming.

1504
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:57,260
那如果有个阿尔法要杀我
So what am I supposed to do

1505
01:28:57,260 --> 01:28:59,600
我该怎么办
if one of those Alphas is about to kill me?

1506
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,140
你说到重点了
You take a hit for the team.

1507
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:05,980
我们落地后
When we're on the ground...

1508
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:07,550
它们很快就会
There's not gonna be a lot of time

1509
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:08,800
知道我们来了
before they know we're there.

1510
01:29:10,650 --> 01:29:12,010
我们需要留个人在这儿盯着
We're gonna need eyes up here.

1511
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,070
我要进去  凯奇
I'm going in, Cage.

1512
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:28,640
30秒之后开战
Thirty seconds till contact.

1513
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:43,680
凯奇
Cage!

1514
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,150
不
Oh, no! Oh!

1515
01:29:45,230 --> 01:29:46,850
基梅尔  不
Kimmel! No!

1516
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,310
福特  出发
Ford! Let's go!

1517
01:29:57,310 --> 01:29:58,950
凯奇  跳  南希
Cage! Drop, Nance!

1518
01:29:58,950 --> 01:30:00,990
跟他说  丽塔  我们必须走了  跳
Talk to him, Rita! We gotta go. Drop.

1519
01:30:00,990 --> 01:30:02,800
凯奇  它们知道我们来了
Cage, they know we're coming, man!

1520
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:04,000
跳
Drop!

1521
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:06,160
跳  跳
Drop! Drop!

1522
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:08,860
跳
Drop.

1523
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:10,260
你没连上吊索
You're not hooked in.

1524
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:29,930
你怎么这么久才来
What took you so long?

1525
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:33,890
还有其他人吗
Any others?

1526
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:40,210
弹药不多了
We're low on ammo.

1527
01:32:40,370 --> 01:32:41,930
我带了把大砍刀
I've got one claymore.

1528
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:43,420
福特  你完蛋了
Ford, you're out.

1529
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:45,110
格里夫只剩半个弹匣了
Griff has only got half a magazine left

1530
01:32:45,110 --> 01:32:46,560
而且他走不了
and he can hardly move.

1531
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,220
我以为你能看到未来
I thought you could see the future.

1532
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:49,540
我从没活到过这一天
I haven't lived this day.

1533
01:32:50,850 --> 01:32:52,200
我不知道接下来会发生什么
I don't know what's gonna happen.

1534
01:32:52,610 --> 01:32:53,640
这不要紧
It doesn't matter.

1535
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:56,040
要紧的是我们要结束这一切
What matters is we finish this.

1536
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:57,840
怎么结束
With what?

1537
01:32:58,970 --> 01:33:00,900
格里夫连路都走不了
I mean, Griff can't even walk.

1538
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:02,630
我们有三个人已经挂了  得了吧
We're three men down. Come on.

1539
01:33:02,630 --> 01:33:03,840
我们要没时间了
Look. We're running out of time.

1540
01:33:03,850 --> 01:33:05,120
收集弹药
Collect your ammo.

1541
01:33:05,610 --> 01:33:06,830
我们和那个金字塔之间
There must be a thousand mimics

1542
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:08,340
肯定有成千上万个变种
between us and that pyramid.

1543
01:33:08,470 --> 01:33:09,170
那我们怎么办
So, what we gonna do?

1544
01:33:09,170 --> 01:33:10,650
直接走到大门口吗
Just walk up to the front door? Is that it?

1545
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:12,390
我们要是原地不动  只有死路一条
If we stay here, we die.

1546
01:33:12,390 --> 01:33:14,560
我们肯定过不去
Yeah? We'll never get through.

1547
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:16,200
我们能
We could.

1548
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:19,470
用它就行
In that.

1549
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:22,750
那艘船不会飞
That ship will never fly.

1550
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,040
不需要飞
Doesn't need to fly.

1551
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:29,450
只需要迅速把我们运过去
It just needs to get us across there with speed.

1552
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:31,570
要是引擎没坏
If the engines are still running,

1553
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:33,880
我们可以用动力杆导航
we could steer it with the power levers.

1554
01:33:35,190 --> 01:33:37,800
斯金纳  开路
Skinner...Clear a path.

1555
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:44,420
再试一次
Try it again, now.

1556
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:45,430
没有读数
No, it's not reading.

1557
01:33:45,430 --> 01:33:46,970
状态控制杆  降低
Condition lever, low.

1558
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:54,810
主电源  开启

我给你们争取点时间

你先顶着
You have to take over!

1586
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:53,660
不
No!

1587
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:05,460
丽塔
Rita!

1588
01:37:07,450 --> 01:37:09,100
砸开它  砸开它
Punch it! Punch it!

1589
01:37:47,150 --> 01:37:48,340
这算不了什么
We've been through worse.

1590
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:28,610
没事
Okay.

1591
01:38:30,850 --> 01:38:31,570
它在那儿
It's there.

1592
01:38:33,190 --> 01:38:34,290
在水里  那边
In the water. There.

1593
01:39:02,170 --> 01:39:03,240
是个阿尔法
That's an Alpha.

1594
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:06,300
我去把它引开
I'm gonna draw that thing away.

1595
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:08,900
你去杀死欧米加
You kill the Omega.

1596
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:09,640
不
No.

1597
01:39:10,150 --> 01:39:11,290
你走不了多远
You won't make it ten feet

1598
01:39:11,290 --> 01:39:13,580
它就会把你杀死  凯奇
before that thing kills you, Cage.

1599
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:14,350
我能做到
I can do it.

1600
01:39:14,350 --> 01:39:16,080
-拿着手榴弹  -我能做到

Listen to me.

1603
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:22,620
我们俩谁也逃不出这地方
Neither one of us is getting out of here.

1604
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:49,710
谢谢你  带我走这么远
Thank you...for getting me this far.

1605
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:56,550
你是个好人  凯奇
You're a good man, Cage.

1606
01:39:58,820 --> 01:40:00,810
我希望以前有机会多了解你一些
I wish I had the chance to know you better.

1607
01:43:31,270 --> 01:43:32,770
欢迎来London  少校
Welcome to London, Major.

1608

我是蒙哥马利下士
I'm corporal Montgomery,

1609

1612
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:52,890
今天日出前
Just before sunrise this morning...

1613
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,570
我们在巴黎探测到了一大股能量
A large surge of energy was detected in Paris.

1614
01:43:56,850 --> 01:43:59,780
我们还不知道这究竟意味着什么

1615
01:44:00,450 --> 01:44:03,130
但结果似乎是
But the result appears to be a total collapse

1616
01:44:03,130 --> 01:44:05,080
敌人战斗力的全面崩溃

1617
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:09,300
俄罗斯和中国军队正毫无阻碍地

1619
01:44:12,350 --> 01:44:14,920
明天  我们会向西部战线推进

1620

相信我们即将
We believe we are marching to claim a victory

1621
01:44:17,730 --> 01:44:19,040
为自己
for ourselves...

1622
01:44:19,570 --> 01:44:20,820
为我们所爱的人
for our loved ones,

1623
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:22,540
为我们的同胞
for our countrymen,

1624
01:44:22,850 --> 01:44:24,470
为全人类宣告胜利
for the entire human race.

1625
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:26,410
你们是谁  大声说
What are you?! Sound off!

1626
01:44:26,410 --> 01:44:27,390
是战士

1627
01:44:27,390 --> 01:44:29,180
-战士的天职是  -杀敌

1628
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:30,720
-战士的天职是  -杀敌

1629
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,550
你才没打那么多仗  福特
You have not been in twenty battles, Ford.

1630

我也参战无数
I have too.

1631
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:34,400
明天一登滩
You're gonna dump your load

1632
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:36,070
你就得缴械投降  福特
the second you hit the beach tomorrow, Ford.

1633
01:44:36,070 --> 01:44:37,500
你们俩快他妈闭嘴吧
How about you two go get yourselves

1634
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:39,500
不吹牛能死啊
a nice hot cup of shut-the-hell-up!

1635
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:40,970
姑娘  你真有意思

你看着吧  我明天一定会创下纪录
But I bet you I set some kind of record tomorrow.

1637
01:44:43,310 --> 01:44:45,340
逃跑第一名  福特
Yeah. Fastest time runnin' backwards, Ford,

1638
01:44:45,340 --> 01:44:47,110
被自己绊倒  摔个狗吃屎
slippin' in your own shit.

1639
01:44:47,460 --> 01:44:49,090
停下站好
Knock off the grab-ass!

1640
01:44:50,710 --> 01:44:52,090
你们是谁  大声说
What are you?! Sound off!

1641
01:44:52,090 --> 01:44:53,110
是战士

1642
01:44:53,110 --> 01:44:55,250
-战士的天职  -杀敌
- What do warriors do?! - Kill!

1643
01:44:57,610 --> 01:44:58,370
立正
Attention!

1644
01:45:38,970 --> 01:45:39,690
什么事
Yes?

1645
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:41,780
你想怎样
What do you want?

1646
01:45:46,230 --> 01:45:51,420
我只想明白  明白
I need to know now, know now

1647
01:45:51,430 --> 01:45:53,550
你能再爱我一次吗
can you love me again?

1648
01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:59,010
我只想明白  明白
I need to know now, know now

1649
01:45:59,010 --> 01:46:00,970
你能再爱我一次吗

1650
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:06,510
我只想明白  明白

你能再爱我一次吗
can you love me again?

1655
01:46:24,650 --> 01:46:26,400
我的行为无可原谅
It's unforgivable

1656
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:28,330
让你的身心深受打击
I stole and burnt your soul

1657
01:46:28,330 --> 01:46:30,540
这种行为和魔鬼无异吧
Is that what demons do?

1658
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:33,970
我的心智被魔鬼所占据
They rule the worst of me

1659
01:46:33,980 --> 01:46:35,950
让一切化为乌有
destroy everything

1660
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:38,520
让天使如你也受尽磨难
They bring down angels like you

1661
01:46:40,070 --> 01:46:43,840
我鼓起勇气勇敢站起
Now I'm rising from the ground

1662
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:46,120
向你发出疾呼
Rising up to you

1663
01:46:47,670 --> 01:46:51,300
血脉中鼓起了全部勇气
Filled with all the strength I've found

1664
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:53,910
如今的我无可阻挡
There's nothing I can't do

1665
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:56,700
好吧
All right

1666
01:46:56,700 --> 01:47:01,780
我只想明白  明白
I need to know now, know now

1667
01:47:01,780 --> 01:47:04,050
你能再爱我一次吗
Can you love me again?

1668
01:47:04,390 --> 01:47:09,500
我只想明白  明白
I need to know now, know now

1669
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:11,680
你能再爱我一次吗
Can you love me again?

1670
01:47:13,250 --> 01:47:14,370
好吧
All right

1671
01:47:16,990 --> 01:47:18,380
加油
Oh, come on

1672
01:47:18,610 --> 01:47:19,700
好吧
All right

1673
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:28,000
你能再爱我一次吗
Can you love me again?

1674
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:30,240
明  明  明  白 
know, know, know, know

1675
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,180
好吧
All right

1676
01:47:34,870 --> 01:47:38,630
我曾告诉过你我不能
I told you once I can't do this again

1677
01:47:38,710 --> 01:47:41,460
我不能  不能
Do this again, oh, no
