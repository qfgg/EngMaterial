1
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,860
这个男人值五百美金
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This man is worth $500,

2
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,580

伯特·"小孩"·卡森
悬赏五百美金

3
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,890
而这个男人决心领赏
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and this man's going to collect.

4
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,540
他就是杰克·卡希尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's Jake Cahill,

5
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,340
一个活在《赏金法》中的男人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and he lives by... Bounty Law.

6
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,400
你就是不能把他们活着带回来  是吧杰克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You don't ever bring them in alive, do you, Jake?

7
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,260
他们三打一  那可不行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Not when there's three of them and one of me.

8
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,640
你瞅啥  赏金杀手
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What are you looking at, bounty killer?

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,210
一个下巴就要被我打碎的丑货
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm looking at an ugly owl-hoot about to get his jaw busted.

10
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,350
业余的才抓活的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Amateurs try and take men in alive.

11
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,220
业余的一般成不了事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Amateurs usually don't make it.

12
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,510
不管你是死是活
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Whether you're dead or alive,

13
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,860
你只是《赏金法》杰克·卡希尔眼中的赏金
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}you're just a dollar sign to Jake Cahill on Bounty Law.

17
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,220
我是艾伦·金凯德
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This is Allen Kincade

18
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,060
目前正在NBC和银幕珍宝旗下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}on the set of the exciting hit NBC

19
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,060
大热电视剧集《赏金法》的片场
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and Screen Gems television series Bounty Law.

20
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,870
如果你以为看到了重影
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now, if you think you're seeing double,

21
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,270
别着急调整你的电视机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}don't adjust your television sets

22
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,490
其实你不算看走眼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}because, well, in a way, you are.

23
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,520
我右手边的是《赏金法》主演
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}To my right is Bounty Law series lead

24
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,960
杰克·卡希尔的扮演者瑞克·道尔顿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and Jake Cahill himself, Rick Dalton.

25
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,700
而左手边是瑞克的替身  克利夫·布思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And to my left is Rick's stunt double, Cliff Booth.

26
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,770
欢迎二位  感谢抽时间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Welcome gentlemen and thanks for taking the time

27
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,250
-跟我们聊聊  -我们的荣幸  艾伦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- to visit with us. - It's our pleasure, Allen.

28
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,980
瑞克  能跟观众说说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So, Rick, explain to the audience

29
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,580
替身都具体做些什么吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}exactly what it is a stunt double does.

30
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,010
那个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well...

31
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,390
演员需要做很多危险动作
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}actors are required to do a lot of dangerous stuff.

32
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,260
比如杰克·卡希尔中枪跌落马背
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Say Jake Cahill gets shot off his horse.

33
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,520
我可以从马上摔下来吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now, can I fall off a horse?

34
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,150
当然可以  我也摔过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yes, I can, and, yes, I have.

35
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,560
但如果我没摔对  扭了手腕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But say I fall off wrong and I sprain my wrist

36
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,010
或者脚踝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}or I... or I twist my ankle.

37
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,340
就会对拍摄造成负担
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now, that can put an undue burden on production

38
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,600
因为我可能一周都没法工作
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}because now maybe I can't work for a week.

39
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,460
所以克利夫就是来帮我分担的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So Cliff here is meant to help carry the load.

40
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,860
克利夫  你也是这么认为的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Is that how you'd describe your job, Cliff?

41
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,410
帮他分担吗  没毛病
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What, carrying his load? Yeah, that's about right.

42
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,850
下周我将去《迪克范戴克秀》的片场
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Join me next week on the set of The Dick Van Dyke Show,

43
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,570

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}where I'll be talking to comical cutups,

44

两位活宝谈笑风生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie.

50
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,370
能看看你的票吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Can I see your tickets?

51
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,260

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Yeah? - My car's in the shop,

他载我过来的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}so he gave me a ride.

74
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,000
胡扯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's a big fucking lie.

75
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,550
瑞克因为酒驾次数太多被吊销了驾照
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Rick got his driver's license taken away for too many drunk-driving tickets.

76
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,660

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, well, that's both flattering and-and embarrassing.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I hope the, uh, Rick Dalton double feature

92
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,090
没让您太痛苦...还有您太太
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}wasn't too painful for you and the... and the missus.

93
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,340
"痛苦"  怎么会呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, no. "Painful." Stop. What are you saying?

94
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,560
玛丽·爱丽丝喜欢西部片
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Mary Alice loves Westerns.

95
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,330
我俩约会那会儿看的全是西部片
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Our whole courtship, we watched Westerns.

96
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,170
-给你  -谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Here you go. - Thanks.

97
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,180

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's really good. And anyway, she goes to bed.

100
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,680
我开了一盒古巴雪茄
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I open up a box of Havanas.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and we drive them here to the ocean.

114
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,850
他们被逼入绝路了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They'll be up against the wall.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}three hours a day for two weeks.

129
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,470
并不只是因为我想出镜时帅一些  更因为...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Not just because I wanted to look good in the picture, but because I was...

130
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,510
我其实怕的要死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I was shit-scared of the thing, to be honest.

131
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,680
我可是他妈的迈克·刘易斯

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}All right, that's too hot.

135
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,480
有没有什么办法降温
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Anything we can do about that heat?

136
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,250
-瑞克  那可是喷火器  -好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Rick, it's a flamethrower. - Yeah.

137
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,360
我今天很早就去了办公室
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So I came to the office early today,

138
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,760
看了两集16毫米胶片的《赏金法》
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and I watched two episodes of Bounty Law on 16 mm.

139
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,780
乔迪·贾尼斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Jody Janice,

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And you brought him here to collect.

143
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,400
我不知道这鬼地方是哪儿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't even know where here is.

144
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,280
随便找了个近的地儿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It was just the closest place.

145
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,420
我在五英里外的地方抓住了他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Caught up with him about five miles outside of town.

146
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,250

你杀的那个男孩...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And that boy you killed...

149
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,070
就是乔迪·贾尼斯

151
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,920

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who's Major Nathin Maxwell Janice?

152

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Starring Rick Dalton.

155
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,150
然后档案室的蠢货送来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Then a couple of the jokers over in archival sent over

156
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,230
你演的一个小节目的录像
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}a kinescope of a little treat featuring you.

157

163
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,240
所以你过去几年都在电视剧里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So, uh, you've been doing guest shots

164
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,240
出演一些客串的角色吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}on episodic TV shows the last couple of years?

165
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,390
是的  我现在在为CBS台拍试播集
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah. Yeah. I'm doing a pilot f-for CBS right now.

166
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,690
剧名叫《兰瑟》  我演反派
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's called... It's called Lancer. I play the heavy.

167

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I did a Land of the Giants. Green Hornet.

169
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,630
还有一部叫...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I did that show, uh...

170
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,320
斯科特·布朗演的《宾果·马丁》
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Bingo Martin with that kid Scott Brown. Yeah.

171
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,660
还有一集《联邦调查局》这周日就播出
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I got a F.B.I. That-that airs this Sunday.

172
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,570
你在这些剧里都演反派吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You, um... You always play the bad guy on these shows?

173
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,210
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

174
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,050
片尾都有打斗戏吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So, and they have a fight scene at the end of them?

175
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,270
不是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, not... Not...

176
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,500
《巨人大陆》和《联邦调查局》没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Not Land of the Giants or F.B.I.,

177
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,780
-其他有  没错  -你都打输了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- but the rest, yeah. Yeah. - And you lose in the fight?

178
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,160
那当然  我演的是反派
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah. Yeah, of course. I'm... I'm the heavy.

179
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,730
啊  电视台的老诡计了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, that's an old trick pulled by the networks.

180
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,180
比如说《宾果·马丁》
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now, you take Bingo Martin, for example.

181
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,720
找了斯科特·布朗这个新人来演
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So you got a new guy like Scott Brown.

182
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,120
想要打造他的知名度
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You wanna build up his bona fides, right?

183
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,150
所以就从一个被砍的剧找个演员来演反派
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So you hire a guy from a canceled show to play the heavy.

184
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,130
在片尾他们打架的时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Then at the end of the show, when they fight,

185
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,520
让英雄战胜反派
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}it's hero besting heavy.

186
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,360
但观众看到的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But what the audience sees

187
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,220
是宾果·马丁把杰克·卡希尔打得落花流水
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}is Bingo Martin whipping Jake Cahill's ass.

188
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,520
明白了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You see?

189
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,190
下个星期是罗恩·伊利
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Then next week, it's Ron Ely.

192
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:53,750
是啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

193
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,500
你再给这些电视剧新星
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now, in another couple of years, playing punching bag

194
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,260
当两年沙包
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}to every swinging dick new to the network,

195
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,540
观众对你的印象
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}that's gonna have a psychological effect

196
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,130
就会受到影响  大打折扣
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}on how the audience perceives you.

197
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,080
没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Right.

198

00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,640
天啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, my God.

461

463
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,850
山姆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, Sam.

464
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,190
抱歉  我手湿了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Sorry about the wet hand.

465
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,510
没事  我都习惯尤尔这样了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, don't worry. I'm used to it with Yul.

466
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,010
我希望你知道  是我挑了你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I want you to know, I'm the one who cast you.

467
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,260
我非常高兴你能来演
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I couldn't be more delighted you're doing this.

468
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,590
谢谢你  山姆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, well, thank you, Sam.

469
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,790
我很感激  这角色很不错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I... I appreciate it. It's a good part.

470
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,650
没错  见过吉姆·斯泰西吗  主演
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, it is. Have you met Jim Stacy, the series lead?

471
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,540
还没有  没
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Uh, not yet, no. No.

472
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,680
你们一起会打个热火朝天的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, you guys are going to be dynamite together.

473
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:43,190
听起来很火爆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, it sounds exciting.

474
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,030
没错  激烈的碰撞
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, lightning in a bottle.

475
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,760
这是索尼娅  化妆发型师
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now, you met Sonya, makeup and hair?

476
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,390
你好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hi.

477
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:52,100
-这是瑞贝卡  服装师  -你好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- And this is Rebekka, who does costumes. - Hello.

478
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,280
-你好  -好啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Hi. - Howdy.

479
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,440
我希望给卡勒布做全新造型
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I want a whole new look for Caleb.

480
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,790
我不希望这部西部片的造型
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't want this Western costumed

481
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,500
撞了《大峡谷》和《伯南扎的牛仔》
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}the way they costumed The Big Valley

482
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,630
过去十多年的造型
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and Bonanza for the last decade.

483
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:04,120
我希望赋予造型时代精神
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I want a zeitgeist flair to the costumes.

484
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,780
不会与当时不符
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, nothing anachronistic,

485
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,120
1869年和1969年的共同点是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but where does 1869 and 1969 meet?

486
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,360
特别是涉及到你时  卡勒布
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Especially when it comes to you, Caleb.

487
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,960
首先  我要他留小胡子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}First off, I want to give him a mustache.

488
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:21,560
浓密  下垂  墨西哥革命领袖萨帕塔那样的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}A big, droopy, Zapata-like mustache.

489
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,620
然后是他的外套
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now, about his jacket.

490
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,170
我想让他穿嬉皮士外套
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I want to give him a hippie jacket.

491
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:28,410
他若是今晚穿着走进伦敦雾夜总会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Something he could wear into the London Fog tonight

492
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,490
就会是全场最嬉皮的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and look like the hippest guy in the room.

493
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,850
{\an3\fs16\bord0\fn微软雅黑\fad(0,0)\b0\pos(374,247)}南北战争的传奇人物

494
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,850
好  我们有件卡斯特将军的外套
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Far out. We got a Custer jacket.

495
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,620
袖子坠满流苏
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Fringes all down the arm.

496
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,290
现在变成棕黄色了  但只要我染成深棕色
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's tan now, but I dye it dark brown,

497
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,360
他今晚就能穿着去拉斯维加斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}he could hit the Strip in it tonight.

498
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,210
好姑娘
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's my girl.

499
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,760
-瑞克  还有你的头发  -我的头发怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Now, Rick, about your hair. - What about my hair?

500
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,410
我想给你换个发型
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I want to go with a different hairstyle.

501
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:47,920
什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What?

502
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,120
换个更嬉皮的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Something more hippie-ish.

503
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,820
你想把我打扮成嬉皮士吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You want me to look like a hippie?

504
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,570
别想成嬉皮士  而是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, think less hippie, more...

505
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,720
地狱天使机车帮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hells Angel!

506
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,430
-好吧  山姆  如果...  -给我...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Right. Say, Sam... - Get me the...

507
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,930
山姆  山姆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Sam. Sam, uh...

508
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,300
如果你让我从头到脚换上这些...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}if you got me covered up in all this...

509
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:10,300
垃圾
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}this junk, uh,

510
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,900
观众到时怎么知道是我呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}how's the audience gonna know it's me?

511
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,420
我就希望他们不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I hope they don't.

512
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:19,880
我不要他们看见杰克·卡希尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't want them to see Jake Cahill.

513
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,950
我要他们看见卡勒布
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I want them to see Caleb.

514
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,260
我是请你来当演员的  瑞克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I hired you to be an actor, Rick.

515
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,200
不是三流电视牛仔  你比那优秀多了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Not a TV cowboy. You're better than that.

516
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,660
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}《战斗》
每周日1:00-2:00播出

517
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:44,260
我一直想告诉你  管这事的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I've been meaning to tell you, the guy who gaffs this,

518
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,020
他是兰迪的哥们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}he's best friends with Randy,

519
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,670
《青蜂侠》的领班
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}the gaffer from The Green Hornet,

520
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,890
所以...没什么意义
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}so there really ain't no point.

521
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,560
兰迪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, Randy.

522
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,100
克利夫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Cliff.

523
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,550
看来你还在跟着瑞克混啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So you're still with Rick, huh?

524
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,540
还在这呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Still here.

525
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,090
他在里面吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He in there?

526
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,330
在  敲门就行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah. Just knock.

527
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,230
听我说  就安排他去服装部  好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, just put him in the wardrobe, all right?

528
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,190
能有什么坏处呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What's it gonna hurt?

529
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,120
之后如果你有需要  他就派上用场了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Then if you need him, you got him, all right?

530
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,760
但这样我就得跟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But then I gotta have a conversation

531
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,780
服装部助理沟通
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}with that wardrobe assistant,

532
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,210
要知道  那个婆娘可贱了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and, man, she's a fucking bitch.

533
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,570
我不想...  拜托了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I just don't... Please, I...

534
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:38,130
听着  兰迪  我在求你帮忙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, Randy, I'm asking you to help me out, man.

535
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,190
如果你要拒绝  就直接拒绝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}If the answer's no, the answer's no,

536
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,940
别找借口
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}not no with excuses.

537
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,960
哥们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, man.

538
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:48,510
这可不是名导安德鲁·麦克拉格伦的电影
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This ain't a fucking Andy McLaglen picture, you know?

539
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:51,450
我请不起一群一天到晚只在片场
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I can't afford to hire a bunch of guys to smoke cigarettes

540
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:53,000
坐着抽烟聊天的闲人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and sit around talking to each other all day

541
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,110
只因为他们也许派得上用场
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}on the chance that I might use them.

542
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:57,050
我的团队已经有四个人  瑞克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I got a four-man team here, Rick.

543
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,400
如果我需要更多人手  就得去申请
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}If I need more than that, I gotta get it approved.

544
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,560
你也知道  我得罩着我的兄弟们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And, you know, I gotta look after my dudes.

545
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,970
如果你那些兄弟更适合当我的替身
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, and if your dudes were a better match for me,

546
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,410
我会欣然接受
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'd say, "Okay, you got me,"

547
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,990
但情况不是这样  你也心知肚明
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but-but that's not the case, and you know it.

548
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,310
-他是最适合的人选  -可是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- He's a great match for me. - Yeah, no...

549
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:13,470
你想叫他做什么都行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, you could do anything you want to him.

550
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:16,550
从高楼跳下去  在身上点火
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Throw him off a building, right? Light him on fire.

551
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,720
哪怕开车撞他也没问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hit him with a fucking Lincoln, right?

552
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,350
发挥创意  你想怎么样都可以
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Get creative. Do whatever you want.

553
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:22,170
他能得到这个机会就很开心了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's just happy for the opportunity.

554
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:23,680
-瑞克  -什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Rick. - Yeah?

555
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,800
我不喜欢他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't dig him.

556
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,570
也不喜欢他带到片场的气氛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I don't dig the vibe he brings on a set.

557
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,340
怎么  你们以前有过节吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What, is there some old beef between the two of you?

558
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,840
-得了吧  兄弟  -怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Oh, come on, man. - What? What?

559
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,110
那家伙杀了自己的老婆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The dude killed his fucking wife.

560
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:46,180
老传闻你也信
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Come on, man. You don't believe that old shit, do you?

561
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,570
我真信  瑞克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yes, Rick, I do.

562
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:50,760
我和我老婆共事  她也相信
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I work with my wife, and she believes it.

563
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,130
她不希望那个小人来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}She doesn't want his creepy ass around.

564
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,440
这估计是史上最糟糕的天气了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You know, this is probably the shittiest weather ever.

565
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,890
在最糟糕的天气里  和一个人品最恶劣的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The shittiest weather on the shittiest boat

566
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,850
一起待在一艘最破烂的船上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}with the shittiest person.

567
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,700
我姐妹娜塔莉说  "他就是个废物"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Natalie, my sister, said, "He's a loser. He's a loser."

568
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,930
他们都这么说  "他丫就是个废物"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They all said it, "He's a fucking loser,"

569
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:13,210
我之前还不相信他们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and I didn't believe them.

570
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,110
所以愚蠢的人是我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So I guess I'm the fucking idiot.

571
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,950
现在你还不理我了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And now you're not gonna talk to me?

572
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,790
怎么  你不想吵架吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What, you don't feel like fighting?

573
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,220
但我他妈想吵架
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, I feel like fucking fighting

574
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,440
因为我已经独自一人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}because I've been up here by myself

575
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,790
在这艘破船上待了整整四小时了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}for four hours on this fucking shithole of a boat.

576
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:29,550
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

577
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,310
他可是战争英雄啊  操
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}H-he's a goddamn war hero. Fuck.

578
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,910
非常感谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, appreciate it.

579
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:47,230
你这个脓包  我带你去服装部吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, you fucking horse's ass. Let's get you over to wardrobe.

580
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,290
你先待在服装部
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now, I'll put you in wardrobe,

581
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:54,930
但你没做替身  我就不付你薪水
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but you don't stunt, I don't pay you.

582
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,050
谢谢你给我机会  兰迪  我不会让你失望的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Appreciate the opportunity, Randy. I won't let you down.

583
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,530
你认识我老婆珍妮特  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You know my wife Janet, don't you?

584
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:02,530
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

585
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,120
别让她看见你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Steer clear of her.

586
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,210
{\an3\fs16\bord0\fn微软雅黑\fad(0,0)\b0\pos(374,247)}拳王阿里本名

587
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,210
我很欣赏卡修斯·克莱  真的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now, I admire Cassius Clay, I do.

588
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,770
我欣赏的是  在他的运动里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What I admire is, in his sport,

589
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:12,920
有真实的格斗成分
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}there's an element of true combat.

590
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,800
卡修斯·克莱和索尼·利斯顿在擂台上相遇时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}When Cassius Clay meets Sonny Liston in the ring,

591
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,050
不是两名运动员在装模作样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}that's not two athletes posturing.

592
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,530
而是格斗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's combat.

593
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:22,570
那是两个男人在互相厮杀
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Two men trying to kill each other right now.

594
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:24,730
如果你不打败他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}If you don't beat him...

595
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,930
他就会杀了你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}he kills you.

596
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:29,560
那远超过竞技范畴
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's beyond athletics.

597
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:32,520
那远超过体育节目
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's beyond Wide World of Sports, you know?

598
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:35,240
那是两名战士展开致命搏斗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's two warriors engaged in combat.

599
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,710
我欣赏的就是这一点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's what I admire.

600
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:39,400
在武术比赛里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}In martial arts tournaments,

601
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,730
是不允许这样搏斗的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}they won't let you fight like that.

602
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:42,520
非常令人沮丧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's very frustrating.

603
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,710
你站在对手面前
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You stand in front of a guy,

604
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,560
你很想让他尝尝你的厉害
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and you just wanna let him have it. Ha!

605
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:48,690
但你不能
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But you can't.

606
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:52,420
你只能展示些花拳绣腿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So you gotta do this playacting, patty-cake version.

607
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,040
卡修斯·克莱  索尼·利斯顿  乔·路易斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Cassius Clay. Sonny Liston. Joe Louis.

608
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:57,340
我是指那个黑人拳手
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The colored boxer,

609
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,140
不是玩跆拳道那个混蛋白人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}not that white kickboxing asshole.

610
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:03,210
他们为了赢  不择手段
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They do what they need to do to win.

611
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,390
为击败对手
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They unleash as much punishment

612
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:08,080
他们拼尽全力  毫不留情
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}as they have to to defeat the other guy.

613
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:10,570
但在武术比赛中
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But in martial arts tournaments,

614
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,790
我也跟他们一样拼全力去赢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I do to win what they do to win.

615
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,860
我会释放出全部实力
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I unleash all my power.

616
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,510
我会夺人性命
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I kill people.

617
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,890
如果你和卡修斯·克莱对战  谁会赢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}If you fought Cassius Clay, who would win?

618
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:23,490
那绝不会发生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, that would never happen.

619
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:26,670
但如果真交手  你觉得会有什么结果
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But if you did, what do you think would happen?

620
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:29,060
我会把他打成瘸子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'd make him a cripple.

621
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,920
你  你叫什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, you. What's your name?

622
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,110
-我吗  -对  你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Me? - Yeah, you.

623
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:40,330
我叫克利夫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}My name's Cliff.

624
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:42,280
我是瑞克·道尔顿的特技替身
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm Rick Dalton's stunt double.

625
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,110
-特技人  -没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Stuntman? - Yeah.

626
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,740
你这个特技替身未免太过帅气了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You know, you're kind of pretty for a stuntman.

627
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:49,620
他们也是这么说的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's what they tell me.

628
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,180
我说了什么可笑的话吗  特技人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So did I say something funny, stuntman?

629
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,310
-算是吧  -什么事这么好笑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Yeah, you kind of did. - What's so funny?

630
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:58,940
我不想惹麻烦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Look, man, I don't want any trouble.

631
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,580
我只是来干活的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm just here to do a job.

632
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:02,680
但你在嘲笑我说的话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But you're laughing at what I'm saying.

633
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:04,370
可我并没说什么可笑的话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But I'm not saying anything funny.

634
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,110
你到底觉得有什么好笑的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So, what do you think is so funny?

635
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,510
我觉得...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What I think is...

636
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,000
你这人个子虽小  口气倒不小
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}you're a little man with a big mouth and a big chip,

637
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,890
而且你该感到羞愧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and I think you should be embarrassed

638
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:19,020
你只配当卡修斯·克莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}to suggest you'd be anything more than a stain

639
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,470
拳击短裤上的污渍
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}on the seat of Cassius Clay's trunks.

640
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:25,010
兄弟  你的口气才狂妄
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Brother, you're the one with the big mouth.

641
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,710
我很愿意让你闭嘴
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I would really enjoy closing it,

642
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:28,920
特别是当着我所有朋友的面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}especially in front of all my friends.

643
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,960
但我这双手被视为致命武器
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But my hands are registered as lethal weapons.

644
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:35,750
那意味着  如果我们交手
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That means, we get into a fight,

645
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,990
我不小心杀了你  我就得坐牢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I accidentally kill you, I go to jail.

646
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,740
任何人在交手过程中
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Anybody accidentally kills anybody

647
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,990
不小心杀了人  都得坐牢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}in a fight, they go to jail.

648
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:44,560
这叫过失杀人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's called manslaughter.

649
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:47,670
而且我认为"致命武器"只是借口
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I think all that "Lethal weapon" horseshit is just an excuse

650
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:50,020
让你们这些没真本事的不用来真的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}so you dancers never have to get in a real fight.

651
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:52,960
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay.

652
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,930
那来一场友好较量如何
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How about a friendly contest?

653
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:58,480
不打脸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No punching in the face.

654
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:00,170
三局两胜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Two out of three.

655
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,690
看谁先将对方打趴下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who puts who on the ground first?

656
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:07,330
不故意伤害对方  只是看谁先倒地
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Nobody tries to hurt nobody, just who ends up on their butt?

657
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,410

为什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}For what?

662

杀了他妻子后逍遥法外
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Killed his wife and got away with it.

665
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:02,230
不错嘛  加藤
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Not bad, Kato.

666

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Try that again.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What the fuck is going on here?

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, jackass, this is our series lead.

670
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,590
你他妈在想什么呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What the fuck are you thinking?

671
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,470

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're right, Janet. I'm sorry about that.

00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:00,630
别他妈叫我珍妮特  混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't fucking "Janet" me, you prick.

673
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:03,000
怎么了  宝贝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey. What's up, babe?

674
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,370
兰迪  你的废物杀妻好友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What's up, Randy, is that your loser asshole,

675
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:10,200
刚才痛揍了布鲁斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}wife-killing buddy boy here was beating the shit out of Bruce.

676
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,350
什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What?

677
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,590
-兰迪  -克利夫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Hey, Randy. - Cliff.

678
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:15,420
搞什么鬼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What the fuck, man?

679
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,040
我要说一下  没人能痛揍布鲁斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Let me just say, nobody beat the shit out of Bruce.

680
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:21,470
刚才只是场友好较量  他几乎都没碰到我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It was a friendly contest. He barely touched me.

681
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:24,330
车上那凹痕可不是这么说的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I think that dent in the car says something different.

682
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:27,950
我的老天啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, my God!

你他妈对我的车做了什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What the fuck did you do to my car?!

684
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:32,900
你他妈对她的车做了什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What the fuck did you do to her car?

685
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:34,620
我把这个小混球砸到车上了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I threw this little prick into it,

686
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,540

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but I did not know it was her car.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Get the wardrobe off, get your shit, and get fucked!

688
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:42,580

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Janet! - What?

689
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,540
我来处理
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I will handle this.

00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,540
那你他妈赶紧处理  兰迪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Then fucking handle it, Randy.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}get the wardrobe off, get your shit,

693
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,460
滚出片场
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and get off the lot.

694
00:49:57,550 --> 00:49:58,720
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Fair enough.

695
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,770
怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Aw. What's the matter?

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Are you afraid I'll tell Jim Morrison you were dancing

698
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:40,820
你听着保罗·瑞佛和奇袭者乐队的歌跳舞吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}to Paul Revere and the Raiders?

699
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:43,610
他们对你来说不够酷吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Are they not cool enough for you?

00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,070
这个头发蓬乱的混蛋是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who's this shaggy asshole?

701
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,960
你好  有什么事吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hello? Can I help you?

对  我想找泰瑞

705
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,480
泰瑞和坎蒂已经搬走了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, Terry and Candy don't live here anymore.

706
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,640
现在这里是波兰斯基的家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This is the Polanski residence now.

707
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,560
真的吗  他搬走了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Really? He moved?

708
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:12,890
该死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Dang.

709
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:15,720
你知道他搬去哪了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Uh, you know...? You know where?

710
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:18,830
我不确定  但这里的业主保罗可能知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm not sure, but the owner of the property, Paul, might.

711
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:20,190
他在客房
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's in the guest house.

712
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:23,050
是谁啊  杰
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who is it, Jay?

713
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,580
没事  亲爱的  是泰瑞的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's okay, honey. It's a friend of Terry's.

714
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,470
对  走后面的小路
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, just take the back path.

715
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,740
非常感谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thank you kindly.

716
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:33,100
女士再见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Ma'am.

717
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:51,450
-休息一小时  -瑞克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- All right, that's an hour! - Hey, Rick.

718
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:52,850
我知道现在是午餐时间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I know they just broke for lunch,

719
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:55,980
但你得等至少一小时才能吃
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but you need to wait at least an hour before you can eat.

720
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,030
-先让胶水晾干  -别担心  亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Give that glue a chance to dry. - Oh, no worries, honey.

721
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:03,510
我带着书呢  对了  坏人酒吧在哪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I got my book. Say, say, where's the bad-guy saloon?

722
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,740
直走穿过西部小镇
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You just go straight through the Western town,

723
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:08,190
右转再左转  就能看到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}take a right and a left, and you see it right there.

724
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:09,300
谢了  宝贝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Thanks, honey.

725
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:15,740
他弹跳怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How is his bounce?

726
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,530
能在那里装个弹跳装置吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Can I get a bounce there?

727
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:19,800
我去拿个可调扳手  马上回来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Just grab the crescent wrench, come right back.

728
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:21,460
尽快
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Just make it a quick one.

729
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:25,310
-蒂姆  -看着不错  就是那里

你好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hello.

732
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:16,130
你好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hello.

733
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:19,590
你好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hello.

734
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:23,040
如果...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Would...

735
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:26,990
我坐在你旁边看书会打扰到你吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Would it bother you if I sat next to you and read my book too?

736
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,580
我不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't know.

737
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,150
你会打扰我吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Would you bother me?

738
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,310
我尽量不打扰你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'll try not to.

739
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:40,120
坐吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Sit.

740
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:29,360
对不起  不好意思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Sorry. Sorry about that.

741
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,950
你不吃午饭吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You don't eat lunch?

742
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,840
我在午饭后有场戏要拍
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I've got a scene after lunch.

743
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:42,700
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah?

744
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:47,380
在拍戏前吃午饭会让我行动迟缓
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Eating lunch before I do a scene makes me sluggish.

745
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:49,440
我相信这是演员的职责...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I believe it's the job of an actor...

746
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,660
而且我用"男演员"而不是"女演员"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I say "Actor," Not "Actress,"

747
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,380
因为"女演员"这个词毫无意义
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}because the word "Actress" is nonsensical.

748
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:58,970
避免表演时出状况是演员的职责
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's the actor's job to avoid impediments to their performance.

749
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:03,540
发挥出最佳水平也是演员的职责
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's the actor's job to strive for 100 percent effectiveness.

750
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:07,580
当然我们不可能成功  但对成功的追求
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Naturally, we never succeed, but it's the pursuit...

751
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:09,860
还是有意义的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}that's meaningful.

752
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,320
-你是谁  -你可以叫我玛拉贝拉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Who are you? - You can call me Marabella.

753
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:17,090
玛拉贝拉  姓什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Mar... Marabella what?

754
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:18,940
玛拉贝拉·兰瑟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Marabella Lancer.

755
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,770
不  不  别这样  你的真名是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, no, come on, come on. What's your real name?

756
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:26,440
在拍摄时  我更喜欢人们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}When we're on set, I'd prefer to only

757
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,630
用角色的名字称呼我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}be referred to by my character's name.

758
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:31,290
这样能帮我入戏
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It helps me invest in the reality of the story.

759
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:34,050
我两种都试过  叫我角色名
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I've tried it both ways, and I'm always just

760
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:36,520
总会让我表现稍微好点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}a tiny bit better when I don't break character.

761
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:40,300
哪怕只是好一点点  我都愿意去做
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And if I can be a tiny bit better, I want to be.

762
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:46,020
你是那个反派  卡勒布·德卡图
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're the bad guy. Caleb DeCoteau.

763
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:53,610
我以为应该念卡勒布·德科塔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I thought it was pronounced Caleb "Dakota."

764
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,070
我很肯定是德卡图
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm pretty sure it's "DeCoteau."

765
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:00,000
德卡图
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}DeCoteau.

766

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What are you reading?

768
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,710
华特·迪士尼的传记
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's a biography on Walt Disney.

769
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:29,680
很精彩
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's fascinating.

770
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,330
他是个天才
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's a genius, you know.

771
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:34,840
那种50年100年才出一个的天才
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, a once-in-every-50 -or-100-years kind of genius.

00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:41,530
你在看什么书
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What are you reading?

775
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:44,850
就是本西部小说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Just a Western.

776
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:47,230
那是什么书  好看吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What does that mean? Is it good?

777
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:51,060
-很好看  -讲的什么故事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Pretty good. - What's the story?

778
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:54,070
我还没看完呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I haven't finished it yet.

779
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,110
我没问你完整的故事情节
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I didn't ask for the whole story.

780
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:59,170
大概讲什么的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What's the idea of the story?

781
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,700
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well... ahem,

782
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:05,610
故事的主角是位驯马牛仔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}it's about this guy who's a bronco buster.

783
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:08,540
就是讲他的生活经历
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's the story of his life.

784
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,780
这家伙叫汤姆·布里兹
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Guy's name is Tom Breezy,

但人人都叫他轻风{\fs14}[布里兹音同微风]{\fs}
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but everyone always calls him Easy Breezy.

786
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:17,730
轻风20来岁时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now, when Easy Breezy was in his 20s

787
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:20,750
年轻帅气  他能...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and-and-and young and good-looking, he could...

788
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:23,750
你随便扔给他什么马  他都能驯服
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He could break any horse that you could throw at him.

789
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,330
那时  他春风得意
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Back then, he just had a way.

790
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:30,470
他快40岁时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now he's into his, uh, late 30s

791
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:33,130

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and he takes a bad fall, and it messes up his hip.

792
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:35,370
他并没有  没有瘸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's not... He's not... He's not crippled

793
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:37,170
或者残废  但...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}or anything like that, but...

794
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:42,770
他的脊椎出了大毛病
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But he's got spine problems he never had before, and he spends, uh...

795

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}more of his days in pain than he ever did before.

796

天哪  这本小说听上去不错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Jeepers, this sounds like a good novel.

797
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,650
对  还行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, it's not bad.

798
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:56,370
你看到哪里了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Where are you in it?

799
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:58,700
大概看了一半
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Mm. About midway.

800
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:02,740
那轻风现在怎么样了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What's happening to Easy Breezy now?

801
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:05,780
他...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Uh, he's, um... He...

802
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,340
他已经不复当年了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He's not the best anymore.

803
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,650
老实说  差远了  而且...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}In fact, far from it. And...

804
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,810
他逐步向生活妥协  结果...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}he's coming to terms with what it's like to be slightly more...

805
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,360
却...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}use...

806
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:34,170
却一天比一天更没用
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Slightly more useless each day.

807
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,170
没事的  卡勒布
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I-it's okay, Caleb.

808
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:53,440
没事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's okay.

809
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:56,110
听起来这是本很伤感的书
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It sounds like a really sad book.

810
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,110
可怜的轻风
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Poor Easy Breezy.

811
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,650
我都要哭了  虽然我根本没看过这本书
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm practically crying, and I haven't even read it.

812
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,590
15年后你也会这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}About 15 years, you'll be living it.

813
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:06,820
什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What?

814
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:12,850
没什么  小可爱  我只是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Nothing, pumpkin puss. I'm just...

815
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,970
逗你玩呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm just teasing you.

816
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,870
你知道吗  你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You know something? You...

817
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,560
你对这本书的看法可能是对的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You might be right about this book.

818
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:25,150
它对我的触动比我想象的更深
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I think it hits harder than I gave it credit for.

819
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:31,150
我不喜欢"小可爱"这种名字
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't like names like "Pumpkin puss,"

820
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:33,340
但既然你不开心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but since you're upset,

821
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,990
我们以后再说这个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}we'll talk about that some other time.

822
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:32,520
我只到西木区
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm only going as far as Westwood Village.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}playing the heavy on the pilot.

844
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,810
而且我要告诉你  我就差一点点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I gotta tell you, I came damn close

845
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:48,850
就加入《麦克拉斯基的十四拳》了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}to being in The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.

846
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:50,850

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- No kidding. - Yeah.

告诉你  我...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Let me tell you, I...

848
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:54,880
我拿到这个角色纯粹靠运气
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I just got my part-part by sheer luck.

849
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,600
直到开拍前两周
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Up until two weeks before shooting,

850
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,340
这个角色还是费比安的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Fabian was in the part.

851
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:01,170
然后他在拍《弗吉尼亚人》时伤了肩膀
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Then-then he breaks his shoulder doing a Virginian.

852
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:02,770
这个角色就是我的了  所以...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's how I got it, so...

853
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:07,980
瑞克  问你点我听说的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, Rick, I gotta ask you something I heard about.

854
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,020
你差点就拿到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Was it true you almost

855
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:12,110
麦奎因在《大逃亡》里的那个角色  是真的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}got the McQueen part in The Great Escape?

856
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:16,640
-希尔兹  对吗  -其实是叫希尔兹上尉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Hilts, isn't it? - Captain Hilts, actually.

857
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:18,880
-试图逃跑了十七次  -是十八次
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Seventeen escape attempts. - Eighteen.

858
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,290
没试过镜  没开过会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Never had an audition. Never had a meeting.

859
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:22,840
也没见过约翰·斯特奇斯{\fs14}[大逃亡导演]{\fs}
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Never met John Sturges.

860
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,980
所以  我觉得我没有...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So, no, I don't think you could say I...

861
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,230
差点拿到了那个角色  但...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I almost got the part, but...

862
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:29,980
-隧道工  工程师  -飞人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Tunnel man, engineer. - Flier.

863
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:33,780
按美军的叫法  是前途无量的飞行员
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I suppose what's called in the American Army, a hotshot pilot.

864
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:38,630
但其实有一小段时间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But the story goes, for a brief moment,

865
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:41,570
麦奎因差点不想拍这个电影
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}McQueen almost passed on the movie,

866
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:42,820
就在那一小段时间里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and during that brief moment,

867
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:45,140
我显然已经进了四位候选人名单
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I, apparently, was on a list of four.

868
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:46,670
你有其他计划吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You have other plans?

869
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,260
我还没见过柏林
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I haven't seen Berlin yet

870
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,620
不管是从地面还是从天上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}from the ground or from the air,

871
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:52,180
我计划在战争结束前两种方法都试一次
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and I plan on doing both before the war's over.

872
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:53,270
你还有谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You and who?

873
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:56,830
-跟那三个乔治  -哪三个乔治
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Me and... Me and three Georges. - Which three Georges?

874
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:58,450
佩帕德  马海尔斯和查金斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Peppard, Maharis and Chakiris.

875
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:00,040
-天哪兄弟  -对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Oh, man. - Yeah.

876
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,280
没演这部戏一定很痛苦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's gotta hurt.

877
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,110
对  但我还是没演成
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, well, I didn't get it,

878
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,050
麦奎因演了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}McQueen did it,

879
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:08,030
而且说实话  我根本就没机会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and, frankly, I never had a chance.

880

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Captain Hilts.

882
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:14,790
那就二十天禁闭
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Twenty days.

883
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:16,260
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Right.

884
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:19,990
我出来的时候你还会在这里吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, you'll still be here when I get out?

01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:17,810
-台词  台词  -"说不定他已经这么做了"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Line. Line. Line, line, line. - "Maybe he already has."

1037
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:22,750
说不定...我操
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Maybe... Goddamn it!

能重拍这条吗  能暂停一下吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Can we just go back? Please, can we just cut?

1041
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:29,620
别啊  你把台词说完就行了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, really, just say the fucking line!

1042
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:31,430
说真的  山姆  拜托了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, really, Sam, please.

1043
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:32,940
-"说不定他已经这么做了"  -好吧好吧

我可以  我能行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I got it. I got it.

1048
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:46,380
我们退回去一点行吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Go back a bit, would you?

1049
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,210
他说得没错  回到原机位
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, he's right. Back to one.

1050
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:51,650
-好了  现在集中精力  -我会的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Okay, now, use all that, baby. - I'm gonna use it.

1051
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,900
-我一定集中精力  -找回状态  全神贯注
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Oh, I'm gonna use it. - Use it all. Put it all inside.

1052
01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:55,250
我会的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm gonna use it.

1053
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:58,460

开拍
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}action.

1055
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:05,470
我听说你把兰瑟逼得很紧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I heard you're pushing Lancer pretty hard,

1056
01:17:05,790 --> 01:17:08,330
但兰瑟很有钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but Lancer's got money.

1057
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:10,790
他总有一天
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}At some point,

1058
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:16,040
会雇人报仇的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}he's gonna hire some guns and push back.

1059
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,210
说不定他已经这么做了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Maybe he already has.

1060
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:24,330
或许吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Maybe.

1061
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:29,050
也许是我不喜欢兰瑟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Maybe I don't like Lancer.

1062
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:32,260
不喜欢他脚上的靴子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Maybe I don't like his boots.

1063
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:35,730
也不喜欢他穿着靴子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Maybe I don't like the way

1064
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:38,120
践踏别人的那副样子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}he uses those boots to step on people.

1065
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:44,190
我他妈刚才是怎么回事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What the fuck was that?!

1066
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:46,230
老天啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Jesus Christ!

1067

1068
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:49,440
废物
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Piece of shit.

1069
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:52,760
我去你的  瑞克  我对天发誓
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Fucking damn it, Rick, I swear to God.

1070
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:54,900
居然记不住台词  让自己
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Forgot your fucking lines, embarrassed yourself

1071
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:57,320
在那么多人面前难堪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}like that in front of all those goddamn people!

1072
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:00,000
喝了一晚上的酒  又管不住了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You were drinking all night, fucking drinking again,

1073
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,060
整整八杯威士忌
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}eight goddamn fucking whiskey sours.

1074
01:18:04,450 --> 01:18:06,590
我在搞毛啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Fucking bullshit.

1075
01:18:08,410 --> 01:18:10,750
你就是个可悲的酒鬼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're a fucking miserable drunk.

1076
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:13,470
居然连台词都记不住
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Not fucking remembering your fucking lines.

1077
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:14,410
我明明背过台词
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I practiced them,

1078
01:18:14,410 --> 01:18:16,960
但现在就跟完全没准备过一样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and now I don't look like I goddamn practiced them!

1079
01:18:16,970 --> 01:18:19,160
傻坐在片场的样子就像只狒狒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're sitting there like a fucking baboon!

1080
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:23,260

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I couldn't stop at fucking three or four. I have eight!

1082
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,340
为什么啊  你就是个酒鬼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why?! You're a fucking alcoholic.

1083
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:29,890
就这么喜欢喝吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You fucking drink too much, huh?

1084
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,380
每晚如此  每晚都他妈的如此
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Every fucking night. Every fucking night.

1085
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:34,310
行了  我受够了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's it, that's fucking it!

1086
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:35,630
必须做出行动了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's fucking it.

1087
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:37,990
现在就开始戒酒  听到了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You stop drinking right now, all right?

1088
01:18:37,990 --> 01:18:39,310
对自己发誓
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Make a promise to yourself.

1089
01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:40,630
马上戒酒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're gonna stop fucking drinking.

1090
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:43,010
不管了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, fuck it.

1091
01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:47,170
操
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Damn it!

1092
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:49,990

1095
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,670
他妈的瑞克·道尔顿到底是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}who the fuck Rick Dalton is, all right?

1096
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:57,990
我跟你说件事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Let me tell you something.

1097
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,700

你的脑花会溅满整个游泳池
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Your brains are gonna be splattered all over your goddamn pool.

你好啊  辣妹
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hello, hot stuff.

1108
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:28,070

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Looks like third time's the charm.

1109

特别好吃
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Real good.

1111
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:36,780
我那都是高档货
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They were the fancy kind.

1112
01:22:40,110 --> 01:22:40,930
要载我一程吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Give me a lift?

1113

查茨沃斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Chatsworth?

1116
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:51,080
你成天在伯班克大道上溜达
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You hitch up and down Burbank Boulevard all day

1117
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:53,410

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}till someone says they'll drive you to Chatsworth?

1118

1120
01:22:57,410 --> 01:23:01,470
估计他们下半辈子都会津津乐道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They'll be telling stories about the Hollywood hippie girl

1121
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,540

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Go down here and get on the Hollywood Freeway.

1136
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:46,070
我知道怎么走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I know where it is.

1137
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,190
你是以前经常在那里拍电影的老牛仔吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Are you some old cowboy guy that used to make movies there?

1138
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:54,890
怎么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What?

1139
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,360
我只是惊讶
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm just surprised how accurate

1140
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,760
你居然能把我描述得这么准确
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}that description of me really is.

1141
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:02,160
以前经常在斯潘牧场拍电影的老牛仔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Some old cowboy guy that used to shoot movies at Spahn Ranch.

1142
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:06,290
这么说你以前
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So you used to make Westerns at the ranch

1143
01:24:06,290 --> 01:24:07,940
就经常拍西部片吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}back in the old-timey days?

1144
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:12,700
如果你的"以前"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, if by "The old-timey days,"

1145
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:15,870
是指八年前的电视业的话  没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}you mean television eight years ago, yeah.

1146
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:17,550
你是演员吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Are you an actor?

这样就好多了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's way better.

1150
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:27,320
为什么好多了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why is that way better?

1151
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:29,590
演员都特别假
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Actors are phony.

1152
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:32,410
他们不过是说几句别人写的台词
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They just say lines that other people write

1153
01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:36,560
然后在白痴电视剧里假装杀人罢了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and pretend to murder people on their stupid TV shows.

1154
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,830
与此同时呢  每天都有活生生的人在越南丧命
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Meanwhile, real people are being murdered every day in Vietnam.

1155
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:04,560
想边开车边让我口吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Want me to suck your cock while driving?

1156
01:25:13,370 --> 01:25:14,140
你多大了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How old are you?

1157
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:16,300
什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What?

1158
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:18,020
你多少岁了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How old are you?

1159
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:21,560
天呐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Wow, man.

1160
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,960
好久都没人问我这个问题了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's the first time anybody asked that in a long time.

1161
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:27,970
回答我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What's the answer?

1162
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,220
好吧  是要玩什么儿童游戏吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay. We gonna play kiddie games?

1163
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:37,440
我十八  舒服了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Eighteen. Feel better?

1164
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:39,650
你有身份证明吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You got some ID, you know,

1165
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:42,050
比如驾照什么的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}like a driver's license or something?

1166
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:44,350
-你在开玩笑吧  -我没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Are you joking? - No, I'm not.

1167
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:47,960
我需要看到证件证明你十八岁了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I need to see something official that verifies that you're 18,

1168
01:25:48,450 --> 01:25:50,800
你当然没有了  因为你根本就没成年
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}which you don't have because you're not.

1169
01:25:54,610 --> 01:25:56,380
要说谁最会扫兴  老兄
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Talk about a bring-down bummer, dude.

1170
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:58,050
那肯定是你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's you.

1171
01:25:58,370 --> 01:25:59,120
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

1172
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:07,580
显然  我还没小到不能跟你上床
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Obviously, I'm not too young to fuck you.

1173
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:10,550
但是呢  你已经老到干不动我了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But obviously, you are too old to fuck me.

1174
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:14,830
我真正老到不能干的是  因为上床而进监狱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What I'm too old to do is go to jail for poontang.

1175
01:26:17,370 --> 01:26:18,950
我这一辈子都在躲避牢狱之灾
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Prison's been trying to get me all my life.

1176
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:20,170
现在我还没有进去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It ain't got me yet.

1177
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,270
如果有一天进去了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The day it does,

1178
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,420
也不能是因为你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}it won't be because of you.

1179
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:25,390
别介意哈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No offense.

1180
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:30,550
你还好吗  亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You all right, honey?

1181
01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:32,580
她很好  对吧  小不点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}She's just fine, ain't you, shorty?

1182
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:34,530
我没事  斯科特
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm fine, Scott.

1183
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:35,980
他们没伤害你吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They haven't hurt you?

1184
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:37,520
摄像机准备好了  道尔顿先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Camera's ready, Mr. Dalton.

1185
01:26:40,030 --> 01:26:40,920
我马上出来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'll be right out.

1186
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:43,530
战争
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The war.

1187
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,880
我和英国陆军一起去了印...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I rode with the British cavalry in Indi...

1188
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:41,930
各就各位  大伙儿  五秒后开拍
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Stand by, guys. We're going in five.

1189
01:27:57,630 --> 01:27:59,090
兰瑟的人来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Lancer's boys are here!

1190
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:02,400
那老家伙来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The old man here?

1191
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:03,390
不是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Nada.

1192
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,270
但他儿子来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But the son is.

1193
01:28:09,890 --> 01:28:11,410
波士顿的那个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The one from Boston.

1194
01:28:12,850 --> 01:28:13,630
我不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't know.

1195
01:28:14,410 --> 01:28:15,310
你是波士顿的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You from Boston?

1196
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:16,590
是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yes.

1197
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:18,240
是波士顿的那儿子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's the Boston one!

1198
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:21,930
让其他人在外面等着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Keep the others outside.

1199
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:24,550
让那兄弟进来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Let the brother come in.

1200
01:28:26,330 --> 01:28:27,590
你听到他说的了  波士顿小子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You heard him, Boston.

1201

你瞧  亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}See, honey?

1203
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:43,740
我说了他们会来谈判的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I told you they'd come to parlay.

1204
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:46,660
你还好吗  亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You all right, honey?

1205
01:28:46,710 --> 01:28:49,020
她很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, she's just fine.

1206
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:51,130
对吧  小不点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Ain't you, shorty?

1207
01:28:52,930 --> 01:28:54,080
我没事  斯科特
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm fine, Scott.

1208
01:28:54,950 --> 01:28:55,910
他们没伤害你吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}They haven't hurt you?

1209
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:57,950

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Not yet, I ain't.

1210
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:01,020
但一切都可能改变
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But that can all change...

1211
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:02,910
弹指一挥间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}like that.

1212
01:29:06,770 --> 01:29:07,460
告诉我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Say...

1213
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:09,540
你那瘸腿是怎么回事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}where'd you get that limp?

1214
01:29:11,410 --> 01:29:12,280
打仗时留下的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}From the war.

1215
01:29:14,170 --> 01:29:14,990
你是哪一方
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Which side?

1216
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:18,750
我和英国陆军一起去了印度
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I rode with the British cavalry in India.

1217
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:22,700
他们管那身行头叫什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What'd they call that outfit?

1218
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:24,750
孟加拉骑兵
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Bengal Lancers.

1219
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:30,910
这可真逗乐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now, now, now, that is funny.

1220
01:29:30,910 --> 01:29:33,170
-真好笑  -这不好笑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- That is funny. - That's not so funny.

1221
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:34,480
你没听懂吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't you get it?

1222
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,890
"孟加拉兰瑟"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"Bengal Lancer"?

1223
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:39,370
对哦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, yeah.

1224
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:40,740
现在我懂了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I get it now.

1225
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:43,690
-是挺好笑的  -没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- That is kind of funny. - It is.

1226
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,790
你知道绑架会被判绞刑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You do know kidnapping is a hanging offense.

1227
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:50,540
一枪崩了这小妮子也是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So is blowing the heads off little girls.

1228
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:55,560
但他们没法绞死我两回  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But they can only hang me once, right?

1229
01:29:56,590 --> 01:29:57,320
那么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So...

1230

你过来是为了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}you come down here for a...

1231
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:02,340
波士顿式的闲聊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}For a Boston social?

1232
01:30:03,150 --> 01:30:05,900
-还是我们谈谈价格  -多少钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Or we gonna talk price? - How much?

1233
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:09,960
我想五万美元能让我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'd say $50,000 would buy me

1234
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:12,920
在墨西哥买不少魔力鸡了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}a whole lot of chicken mole in Mexico.

1235
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:14,650
那可是一大笔钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's a lot of money.

1236
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:16,540
这小妮子值这一大笔钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, she's a lot of little girl.

1237
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:18,810
你不同意吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Or don't you agree?

1238
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:20,740
我同意
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I agree.

1239
01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:23,970
那接下去怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So, what's next?

1240
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:27,000
我会派人到你们的牧场
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, I'll send one of my boys out to your ranch

1241
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,440
告诉你们细节  但是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}to fill you in on all the details, but, uh...

1242
01:30:31,150 --> 01:30:34,920
有一个事我现在就可以告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}the one detail I'm gonna fill you in on right now is this:

1243
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:39,350
我可不要随便哪个墨西哥牛仔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't want no beaner bronco buster

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}handing me that $50,000.

1245
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:44,270
我要让那老家伙自己送来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I want the old man himself.

1246
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:49,160
默多克·兰瑟亲自把五万美金放我大腿上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Murdoch Lancer puts $50,000 in my lap...

1247
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,700
否则这小妮子就玩完
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}or I heave this little pitcher down a well!

1248
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:55,850
明白了吗  波士顿小子

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Give me evil, sexy Hamlet.

1253

沉沦其中
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Settle into it.

1254
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:18,350
享受其中
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Enjoy it.

1255
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:20,670
剪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And cut!

1256
01:31:23,050 --> 01:31:23,980
天哪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, boy.

1257
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:26,100
我没伤到你吧  玛拉贝拉

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I got pads on.

1260
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:32,070
而且我经常自己故意摔倒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I throw myself on the floor

1261
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:34,530
就为了好玩  就算没人付我工钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}just for fun, even when I'm not getting paid.

1262
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:36,440
大门可以了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The gate's clean.

1263
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:39,340
瑞克  瑞克  瑞克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Rick, Rick, Rick.

1264
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:40,350
把她摔出去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Put her there.

1265
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:41,930
-就是我想要的效果  -真的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- That was it. - Really?

1266
01:31:41,930 --> 01:31:43,900
简直太精彩了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That was absolutely fantastic.

1267
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:45,210
-谢谢  -我太喜欢了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Oh, thank you. - I loved it.

1268
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:47,070
你把小女孩往地上一摔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Your idea about throwing the little girl

1269
01:31:47,070 --> 01:31:48,920
这想法简直是神来之笔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}on the ground just worked like a charm.

1270

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- I figured you said Shakespeare, so... - Yeah.

1271
01:31:51,330 --> 01:31:52,390

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's right. That was...

1272
01:31:52,390 --> 01:31:54,620
那正是我说的"给我个惊喜"的意思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's what I mean by "Scare me."

1273

-我不知道  就是即兴  -妙极了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- I don't know. Improv. - That was wonderful.

1278
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:09,330

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It was just... That was a triple alliterative improv.

1279
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:10,940
这可不常听到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You don't hear those too often.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That doesn't sound like a whole lot of fun.

1355
01:37:40,290 --> 01:37:43,320

1367
01:38:19,270 --> 01:38:20,020
没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

1368
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:21,240

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Is he here now?

1369
01:38:22,220 --> 01:38:23,160
我想在吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I guess so.

1370
01:38:25,310 --> 01:38:27,630
所以乔治允许你们所有人住在这
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So George gave you all permission to be here?

01:38:29,150 --> 01:38:30,090
当然了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Course he did.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And y'all take care of him?

我们爱乔治
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We love George.

1375
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:40,230
那我能不能
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, is there anything wrong

1376
01:38:40,230 --> 01:38:42,630
过去跟老朋友打个招呼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}with me saying hello to an old friend?

1377
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:44,370
你现在不能见他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You can't see him right now.

1378
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:46,650
为什么我现在不能见他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why can't I see him right now?

1379
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:49,500
因为他在睡午觉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Because he's napping.

1380
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:53,160
现在是他睡午觉的时间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This is his nap time.

1381
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:06,090
我就自己去看看吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, I think I'll just go see for myself.

1382
01:39:07,470 --> 01:39:08,300
谁知道呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You never know.

1383
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:10,820
他说不定刚醒来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He might have just woke up.

1384
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:22,500
那夏威夷老家伙往这边过来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The old Hawaiian guy's coming this way.

1385
01:39:23,970 --> 01:39:25,330
好  你们都走开
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, y'all, beat it.

1386
01:39:25,730 --> 01:39:26,730
我来对付这家伙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'll handle this guy.

1387
01:39:31,690 --> 01:39:32,430
行吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Fine.

1388
01:40:17,860 --> 01:40:18,900
你就是熊妈妈吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You the mama bear?

1389
01:40:21,130 --> 01:40:23,280
-我能帮你吗  -希望能
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Can I help you? - I hope so.

1390
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:26,280
我是乔治的老朋友  想着过来打个招呼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm an old friend of George's. Thought I'd stop and say hello.

1391
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:27,760
你真是太客气了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's very nice of you,

1392
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:29,720
但现在时机不凑巧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but you picked the wrong time.

1393
01:40:29,870 --> 01:40:31,410
乔治现在正在睡午觉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}George is taking a nap right now.

1394
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:33,650
那太不幸了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, that is unfortunate.

1395
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:35,140
对  没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yes, it is.

1396
01:40:36,670 --> 01:40:39,540
-你叫什么  -克利夫·布思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What's your name? - Cliff Booth.

1397
01:40:39,670 --> 01:40:40,670
你怎么认识乔治的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How do you know George?

1398
01:40:40,730 --> 01:40:43,140
我以前在这牧场拍过西部片
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I used to shoot Westerns here at the ranch.

1399
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:45,260
你上回见乔治是什么时候了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}When was the last time you saw George?

1400
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,410
我想大概是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, I'd say about...

1401
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:50,770
八年前了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}eight years ago.

1402
01:40:52,310 --> 01:40:54,200
真抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh. I'm sorry.

1403
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:56,380
我不知道你俩关系这么好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I didn't realize the two of you were so close.

1404
01:40:57,810 --> 01:40:58,420
他醒来后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}When he wakes up,

1405
01:40:58,420 --> 01:40:59,710
我会告诉他你来过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'll let him know you came by.

1406
01:41:00,770 --> 01:41:02,780
我真的很希望自己去打个招呼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'd really like to say a quick hello now

1407
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:04,040
趁着我还在这
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}while I'm here.

1408
01:41:04,670 --> 01:41:05,910
毕竟长途跋涉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Came a long ways.

1409
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:08,620
我不知道什么时候还会再回来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't know when I'll get back this way again.

1410
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:11,880
我理解  但恐怕那不可能
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, I understand, but I'm afraid that's impossible.

1411
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:13,690
不可能
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Impossible?

1412
01:41:14,470 --> 01:41:15,960
为什么不可能
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why is that impossible?

1413
01:41:16,390 --> 01:41:18,500
因为我和乔治喜欢周日晚上看电视
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Because me and George like to watch TV on Sunday night...

1414
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:19,700
《联邦调查局》和《伯南扎的牛仔》
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}F.B.I. and Bonanza.

1415
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:22,450
但是乔治总是睡着  所以我让他睡午觉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}...but George finds it hard to keep awake, so I make him nap

1416
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:24,450
这样我就能好好看电视
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}so I don't get gypped out of my TV time.

1417
01:41:27,330 --> 01:41:30,630
是这样  红毛  我亲自上门
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, look, Red, I'm coming in there.

1418
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:34,910
就是要亲眼看看乔治过得怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}With my own two eyes, I'm gonna get a good look at George.

1419
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:37,100
这个东西
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And this...

1420
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:40,510
拦不住我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}ain't stopping me.

1421
01:41:44,610 --> 01:41:45,390
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Okay.

1422
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:47,740
随你的便
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Suit yourself.

1423
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:15,160
他在里面吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He back there?

1424
01:43:17,310 --> 01:43:18,720
走廊尽头的那扇门
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Door at the end of the hallway.

1425
01:43:20,710 --> 01:43:21,840
你可能得摇醒他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You might have to shake him awake.

1426
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:23,760
我今天早晨把他干翻了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I fucked his brains out this morning.

1427
01:43:29,270 --> 01:43:30,480
他可能累了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He may be tired.

1428
01:43:42,910 --> 01:43:44,410
八年前先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, Mr. Eight Years Ago?

1429
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:47,870
乔治瞎了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}George is blind,

1430
01:43:47,910 --> 01:43:49,610
所以你可能需要告诉他你是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}so you'll probably have to tell him who you are.

1431
01:44:16,140 --> 01:44:17,350
乔治  你醒了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}George, you awake?

1432
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:36,830
乔治
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}George?

1433
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:39,980
乔治
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}George?

1434
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:44,920
乔治
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}George?

1435
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:50,060
-乔治  -天啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- George! - Jesus.

1436
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:52,200
-乔治  -等等
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Hi, George. - Wait a minute.

1437
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,030
-出什么事了  -什么事都没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What's going on? - Everything's all right.

1438
01:44:55,220 --> 01:44:58,590
-抱歉把你吵醒了  -你是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- I'm sorry to disturb you. - Uh... Who are you?

1439
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,280
克利夫·布思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It's Cliff Booth.

1440
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:03,590
过来问候一下  看你过得怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Just stopped in to say hello and see how you're doing.

1441
01:45:03,590 --> 01:45:05,060
约翰·威尔克斯·布思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}John Wilkes Booth?

1442
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:06,410
不  克利夫·布思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, Cliff Booth.

1443
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:09,820
不认识
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who's that?

1444
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:12,900
我以前在这拍过《赏金法》  乔治
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I used to shoot Bounty Law here, George.

1445
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:14,890
我以前是瑞克·道尔顿的替身
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I was Rick Dalton's stunt double.

1446
01:45:15,250 --> 01:45:17,390
-谁  -瑞克·道尔顿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Who? - Rick Dalton.

1447
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:19,720
道尔顿兄弟吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The Dalton Brothers?

1448
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:21,160
不  瑞克·道尔顿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, Rick Dalton.

1449
01:45:22,970 --> 01:45:23,710
不认识
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who's that?

1450
01:45:24,190 --> 01:45:25,990
他是《赏金法》的演员
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He was the star of Bounty Law.

1451
01:45:27,180 --> 01:45:28,190
那你是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And who are you?

1452
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:30,390
我是瑞克的替身
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I was Rick's stunt double.

1453
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:33,000
哪个瑞克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Rick who?

1454
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:34,970
不重要了  乔治
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It don't matter, George.

1455
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,920
我们以前一起共事过  我只是想
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We were colleagues from the past, and I just wanted

1456
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:40,610
确认一下你一切都好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}to make sure you're doing okay.

1457
01:45:40,790 --> 01:45:43,240
-我可不好  -出什么事了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- I'm not doing okay. - What's the matter?

1458
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:44,590
我屁都看不见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Can't see shit.

1459
01:45:45,190 --> 01:45:46,710
你说这算不算"事"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Would you call that "The matter"?

1460
01:45:46,750 --> 01:45:48,450
这家伙狗屁都看不见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The man can't see shit, okay?

1461
01:45:48,450 --> 01:45:50,840
真遗憾  我听说了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I know. I'm sorry about that. I was told.

1462
01:45:51,310 --> 01:45:53,110
喳喳让我上床睡觉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Squeaky sent me to bed.

1463
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:56,050
你说的是前面那个红头发小姑娘吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Would that be the little redhead out front?

1464
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:01,030
你是不是有病
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What the fuck is the matter with you?

1465
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:03,160
你先是吵醒我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}First you wake me up,

1466
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:05,740
现在又假装我没告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and now you're pretending that I didn't tell you

1467
01:46:05,740 --> 01:46:07,690
我他妈是个瞎子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I was fucking blind!

1468
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:11,050
我怎么知道一直跟我在一起的姑娘
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How am I gonna know what the hell color the head

1469
01:46:11,050 --> 01:46:13,880
头发到底是什么颜色
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}of the girl is that's with me all the time?

1470
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:15,610
好吧  乔治
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, fair enough, George.

1471
01:46:19,450 --> 01:46:21,260
- 不  天啊  -来  乔治
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- No. Jesus Christ. - Come on, George. All right.

1472
01:46:22,810 --> 01:46:24,860
不是所有人都需要替身
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Everyone don't need a stuntman.

1473
01:46:32,830 --> 01:46:34,380
我不知道你是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't know who you are...

1474
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,530
但是你今天让我很感动
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}but you touched me today.

1475
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:42,570
你来看望我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You came to visit me.

1476
01:46:43,550 --> 01:46:45,430
现在我要继续睡觉了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now I got to go back to sleep.

1477
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:50,280
我今晚要看《联邦调查局》
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I got to watch F.B.I. tonight.

1478
01:46:50,990 --> 01:46:52,460
我要和喳喳一起看
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I watch it with Squeaky.

1479
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:56,380
我要是睡着了她会生气的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}She gets all pissed off if I fall asleep.

1480
01:46:57,670 --> 01:47:00,080
她生气会怎样  乔治
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What happens when she gets pissed off, George?

1481
01:47:01,770 --> 01:47:02,530
不会怎样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Nothing.

1482
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:06,620
我只是不想让她失望
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I just don't like to disappoint her.

1483
01:47:11,530 --> 01:47:14,460
所以你允许这些嬉皮士住在这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So you gave all these hippies permission to be here?

1484
01:47:20,870 --> 01:47:22,840
你到底是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Just who the fuck are you?

1485
01:47:23,450 --> 01:47:24,990
我是克利夫·布思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm Cliff Booth.

1486
01:47:25,420 --> 01:47:26,590
我是一个替身演员
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm a stuntman.

1487
01:47:26,630 --> 01:47:28,590
我们曾经是同事  乔治
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We used to work together, George.

1488
01:47:28,990 --> 01:47:31,080
我只是想确认你没事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And I just want to make sure you're okay.

1489
01:47:31,830 --> 01:47:34,720
而且那些嬉皮士也没有占你便宜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And that all these hippies aren't taking advantage of you.

1490
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:37,370
-喳喳  -对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Squeaky? - Yeah.

1491
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:40,000
她很爱我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}She loves me.

1492
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:44,310
看不惯忍着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So suck on that.

1493
01:47:53,630 --> 01:47:54,880
你多保重  乔治
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You take care, George.

1494
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:03,520
该死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Goddamn it.

1495
01:48:25,130 --> 01:48:26,250
你让我难堪了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You embarrassed me.

1496
01:48:27,610 --> 01:48:29,190
是的  对不起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, sorry about that.

1497
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,120
你和乔治的叙旧怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How'd your little talk with George go?

1498
01:48:34,170 --> 01:48:35,100
我们绑架他了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Are we kidnapping him?

1499
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:36,690
我可没这么说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Not the word I'd use.

1500
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:39,510
你已经跟他聊过了  这下你相信没事了吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now you've talked to him, you believe everything's all right?

1501
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:40,480
并不是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Not exactly.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}However, as the two men return home,

1667
02:01:58,190 --> 02:01:59,620
他们达成了一个共识
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}they've come to an understanding.

1668
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:00,580
是这样的...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, here it goes now.

1671
02:02:07,890 --> 02:02:11,630
我请不起你了  克利夫  知道吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I just I can't afford you anymore, Cliff. You know?

1672
02:02:11,970 --> 02:02:14,420
我自己的房子都快要供不起了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I can barely afford my own house anymore.

1673
02:02:14,770 --> 02:02:17,450
所以我的计划是把房子卖了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So I think the plan is to sell the house

1674
02:02:17,530 --> 02:02:21,340
在托卢卡湖买一套公寓  把剩下的钱存起来

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hopefully, I score come next pilot season.

1677
02:02:27,190 --> 02:02:28,040
好计划
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's a good plan.

1678
02:02:28,490 --> 02:02:29,040
是啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

1679
02:02:29,610 --> 02:02:33,040
到时候就知道我到底能不能闯出事业了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You know, by then, I'll know if I have a career or not,

1680
02:02:33,090 --> 02:02:35,920
看看我是会像艾迪·奥布莱恩说的那样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}if I'm a solid Los Angeles citizen

1681
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:37,100
变成个实打实的洛杉矶人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}like Eddie O'Brien says,

1682
02:02:37,230 --> 02:02:41,120
还是会离回密苏里更近一步
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}or if I'm one step closer to going back to Missouri.

1683
02:02:41,770 --> 02:02:44,960
所以等这整趟欧洲之旅结束后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So when this whole European journey is over,

1684
02:02:45,010 --> 02:02:45,900
我觉得我们...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I think we've, uh...

1685
02:02:47,890 --> 02:02:49,460
已经走到尽头了  克利夫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We've reached the end of the trail, Cliff.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}would be Rick and Cliff's final rodeo.

1689
02:03:08,380 --> 02:03:10,490
克利夫不知道自己之后要干些什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Cliff doesn't have a clue what he's gonna do.

1690
02:03:11,100 --> 02:03:13,210
两人唯一确定的就是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The only thing the two men know of for sure:

1691
02:03:13,410 --> 02:03:16,490
今晚  瑞克和克利夫要一起不醉不归
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Tonight, Rick and Cliff will have a good old-fashioned drunk.

1692
02:03:17,030 --> 02:03:17,770
两人都知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Both men know,

1693
02:03:17,900 --> 02:03:20,210
飞机降落埃尔塞贡多市的那一刻
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}once the plane touches down in El Segundo,

1694
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:22,470
对两人而言  就是一个时代的结束了

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The four of them hung out a little longer,

1775
02:09:24,810 --> 02:09:26,920
阿比盖尔还为他们弹了钢琴...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}with Abigail even playing the piano for them...

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}*Baby, are you holding?*

1779
02:09:41,270 --> 02:09:45,660
*抓住了一切  却放开了我*

然后她才回了房
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}until she returned to her room,

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What the hell do you think you're doing

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}bringing that noisy hunk of shit around here at midnight?

1840
02:14:33,580 --> 02:14:35,580
这条是私人道路  明白吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This is a private road, all right?

1841
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:38,510
你们是什么人  来找谁的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who are you? And who are you here to see?

1842
02:14:38,980 --> 02:14:41,590
不找谁  先生  我们只是迷路了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Nobody, sir. We just got lost and a little turned around.

1843
02:14:41,710 --> 02:14:42,960
放狗屁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Ah, horseshit.

1844

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}to smoke dope on a dark road, huh?

1846
02:14:49,630 --> 02:14:52,300
下次你想这么干  把你那破排气管修修
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Next time you want to try that, fix your fucking muffler.

02:16:12,240 --> 02:16:14,020
-查理是怎么说的  -他说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- What did Charlie say? - He said:

1868
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:18,280
"去泰瑞的老房子  杀了里面所有人"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}"Go to Terry's old house and kill everybody in there."

1869
02:16:19,070 --> 02:16:22,650
你们自己也听见了  他说"搞得邪气一点"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And you heard him yourself. He said, "Make it witchy."

1870
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:25,290
要么他真这么说过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now, he either said that,

1871
02:16:26,060 --> 02:16:27,430
要么我是个骗子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}or I'm a liar.

1872
02:16:29,010 --> 02:16:32,080
你们有人觉得我是个骗子吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now, are any one of you calling me a liar?

1873
02:16:35,150 --> 02:16:35,940
你呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How about you?

1874
02:16:36,960 --> 02:16:38,230
你觉得我是骗子吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Are you calling me a liar?

1875
02:16:39,950 --> 02:16:40,930
不  当然不是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, of course not.

1876
02:16:42,150 --> 02:16:42,690

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Who, Jake Cahill? - Yeah.

1881
02:16:50,430 --> 02:16:52,820
刚刚那个穿着睡袍的人是杰克·卡希尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That guy in the robe was Jake Cahill.

1882
02:16:53,390 --> 02:16:53,970
等等
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Wait a minute.

1883
02:16:54,230 --> 02:16:56,590
刚刚吼我的是他妈杰克·卡希尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That was fucking Jake Cahill that just yelled at me?

1884
02:16:57,290 --> 02:16:59,010
刚刚那人老一些  但我觉得是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}He was older, but, yeah, I think so.

1885
02:16:59,210 --> 02:17:00,330
这个叫瑞克的是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So who's this Rick guy?

1886
02:17:00,470 --> 02:17:02,270
老天啊  莎蒂  动动脑子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Jesus Christ, Sadie, get it together.

1887
02:17:02,470 --> 02:17:04,300
瑞克·道尔顿在五十年代一部名叫《赏金法》的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Rick Dalton played Jake Cahill on a cowboy show

1888
02:17:04,380 --> 02:17:05,670
牛仔电影里演了杰克·卡希尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}in the '50s called Bounty Law.

1889
02:17:06,220 --> 02:17:07,760
操你妈  凯蒂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Fuck you, Katie.

1890
02:17:07,790 --> 02:17:09,040
抱歉我不了解五十年代
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Sorry I don't know the name

1891
02:17:09,110 --> 02:17:10,880
电视上每个法西斯主义者的名字
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}of every fascist on TV in the '50s.

1892
02:17:11,060 --> 02:17:11,920
我简直不敢相信
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I can't believe

1893
02:17:12,030 --> 02:17:15,150
那个穿着睡袍的王八蛋居然是杰克·卡希尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}that asshole in the robe was Jake Cahill.

1894
02:17:15,720 --> 02:17:18,440
我小时候有个《赏金法》的午餐盒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}When I was a kid, I had a Bounty Law lunch box.

1895
02:17:18,510 --> 02:17:20,730
那是我所有的午餐盒中最喜欢的一个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That was my favorite of all my lunch boxes.

1896
02:17:22,140 --> 02:17:24,000
听听这个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Dig this!

1897
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:26,730
我们抽嗨了的时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}When we've been having our trip sessions,

1898
02:17:26,780 --> 02:17:29,020
我一直在脑子里思索一个点子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I've been expanding on this one idea in my head.

1899
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:30,560
好了  听好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}All right, dig it.

1900
02:17:31,330 --> 02:17:33,350
我们是看着电视长大的  你们懂我意思吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We all grew up watching TV, you know what I mean?

1901
02:17:34,860 --> 02:17:36,420
如果你是看着电视长大的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And if you grew up watching TV,

1902
02:17:36,650 --> 02:17:38,200
那就意味着你是看着谋杀长大的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}that means you grew up watching murder.

1903
02:17:39,660 --> 02:17:41,220
电视里播的每一部电视剧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Every show on TV

1904
02:17:41,220 --> 02:17:44,080
{\an3\fs16\bord0\fn微软雅黑\fad(0,0)\b0\pos(374,247)}情景喜剧

1905
02:17:41,220 --> 02:17:44,080
只要不是《我爱露茜》  就都是讲谋杀的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}that wasn't I Love Lucy was about murder.

1906
02:17:44,360 --> 02:17:46,480
所以我的想法是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So my idea is...

1907
02:17:47,540 --> 02:17:49,700
我们去杀教我们杀人的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}we kill the people who taught us to kill.

1908
02:17:51,780 --> 02:17:53,320
我们他妈的在哪呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, where the fuck are we, man?

1909
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:55,470
在该死的好莱坞啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We are in fucking Hollywood, man.

1910
02:17:55,800 --> 02:17:59,360
整整一代人都是看着这里的人杀人长大的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}The people an entire generation grew up watching kill people live here.

1911
02:17:59,750 --> 02:18:01,610
而这些杀人凶手却住在这里吃香喝辣
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And they live in pig-shit fucking luxury.

1912
02:18:02,080 --> 02:18:02,950
去他们的吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I say fuck them.

1913
02:18:03,430 --> 02:18:05,480
我们应该割掉他们的老二让他们吃下去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I say we cut their cocks off and make them eat it.

1914
02:18:06,300 --> 02:18:07,870
真是个好主意  莎蒂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's a great idea, Sadie.

1915
02:18:10,600 --> 02:18:11,930
你们两个准备好杀猪猡了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You two ready to kill some piggies?

1916
02:18:21,900 --> 02:18:23,820
等一下  该死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Wait a minute. Oh, shit.

1917
02:18:24,330 --> 02:18:26,260
对不起  我把刀忘在车里了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Sorry, I forgot my knife in the car.

1918
02:18:27,170 --> 02:18:28,420
我可以去...我能回去拿吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Can I go...? Can I go back and get it?

1919
02:18:29,740 --> 02:18:30,860
-去吧  -好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Yeah, sure. - Okay.

1920
02:18:31,210 --> 02:18:32,700
-快去  等一下  -怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Go on. Wait a minute. - What?

1921
02:18:33,050 --> 02:18:34,920
车锁上了  给你钥匙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I locked the car. You'll need keys to get in.

1922
02:18:39,770 --> 02:18:41,410
对  谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Right. Thank you.

1923
02:18:41,960 --> 02:18:43,760
-我去去就回  -好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Okay. I'll be right back. - Okay.

1924
02:18:44,130 --> 02:18:46,890
-快点  -好  马上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Just hurry up. - Yeah, just a little minute.

这个臭婊子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, that fucking bitch!

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Shh! Calm down.

1927
02:19:00,500 --> 02:19:01,620
那边就有一栋房子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}There's a fucking house right there.

1928
02:19:03,730 --> 02:19:04,500
现在怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What do we do now?

1929
02:19:04,730 --> 02:19:05,800
该怎么办就怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We do what we came to do.

1930
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:08,250
干完之后  各自搭车回家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And when we're done, we split up and hitch home.

1931
02:19:09,190 --> 02:19:10,040
还有问题吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Any more questions?

1932

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How many other people are here?

1950
02:23:43,170 --> 02:23:45,450
就一个在里面睡觉的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, just the one sleeping in the back there.

1951
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:49,200
去叫醒他  把他带到客厅来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Go get him and bring him into the living room.

1952
02:23:50,820 --> 02:23:51,770
他要是不来怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What if he says no?

1953
02:23:52,010 --> 02:23:53,290
不来不行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Don't take no for an answer.

1954
02:23:53,350 --> 02:23:54,810
你手里可有刀  去把他带来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're the one with the knife. Get him in here!

1955
02:24:05,180 --> 02:24:06,280
你是真的吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You are real, right?

1956
02:24:06,990 --> 02:24:09,870
我像甜甜圈一样真实  混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm as real as a doughnut, motherfucker.

1957
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:20,460
什么情况
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What the fuck?

1958
02:24:28,340 --> 02:24:29,170
去客厅
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Go to the living room.

1959
02:24:29,390 --> 02:24:30,430
这是怎么回事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What is going on, huh?

1960
02:24:36,210 --> 02:24:37,780
-快走  -好  好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Go! - Okay. Si, si.

1961
02:24:40,130 --> 02:24:40,940
这他妈是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who the fuck's that?

1962
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:42,140
我不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't know.

1963
02:24:43,800 --> 02:24:44,620
弗兰切斯卡
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Francesca.

1964
02:24:51,370 --> 02:24:51,950
什么...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What...?

1965
02:24:56,350 --> 02:24:57,450
我认识你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, I know you.

1966
02:24:58,170 --> 02:24:59,360
你们三个我都认识
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I know all three of you.

1967
02:25:01,070 --> 02:25:02,810
没错  斯潘牧场
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah. Spahn Ranch.

1968
02:25:03,920 --> 02:25:06,250
斯潘牧场
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Spahn Ranch. Yeah. Hoo!

1969
02:25:08,090 --> 02:25:11,210
我不知道你叫什么  但是我记得你的头发
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I don't know your name, but I remember that hair.

1970
02:25:12,150 --> 02:25:14,830
还有你  我记得你那苍白的小脸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And you, I remember your white little face.

1971
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:17,560
还有你骑着马
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And you were on a horsie.

1972
02:25:18,170 --> 02:25:18,720
没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah.

1973
02:25:21,370 --> 02:25:22,130
你是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You are...?

1974
02:25:22,890 --> 02:25:23,970
我是魔鬼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm the devil,

1975
02:25:24,780 --> 02:25:27,320
我来做魔鬼的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and I'm here to do the devil's business.

1976
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:32,160
不是  你的名字比这蠢多了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Nah, it was dumber than that.

1977
02:25:32,310 --> 02:25:34,530
好像是...雷克斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Something like... Rex.

1978
02:25:34,620 --> 02:25:36,720
-天啊  打死他  泰克斯  -泰克斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- God, shoot him, Tex! - Tex.

1979
02:25:40,310 --> 02:25:40,860
操
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Fuck!

1980
02:25:56,100 --> 02:25:57,430
他妈的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Son of a bitch!

1981
02:26:36,600 --> 02:26:37,210
喂  你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, you.

1982
02:26:40,170 --> 02:26:42,140
竟敢闯进我家来  混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How dare you come into my house, motherfucker!

1983
02:27:08,670 --> 02:27:10,140
哎呀呀
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Wow, man.

1984
02:28:03,240 --> 02:28:04,560
什么鬼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What the fuck?

1985
02:28:05,860 --> 02:28:07,070
我的天啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Jesus Christ.

1986
02:29:24,080 --> 02:29:25,340
天啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Holy shit.

1987
02:29:28,660 --> 02:29:31,160
弗兰切斯卡  弗兰切斯卡  宝贝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Francesca! Francesca, honey!

1988
02:29:51,400 --> 02:29:52,660
天堂道  10000街区
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}10,000 block, Cielo Drive.

1989
02:29:52,680 --> 02:29:54,920
你大约是什么时间遭遇这名入侵者的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Around what time was it when you confronted the intruder?

1990
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:57,940
大概是午夜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It was about midnight.

1991
02:29:58,190 --> 02:29:59,150
-午夜  -是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Around midnight? - Yeah.

1992
02:29:59,240 --> 02:30:00,230
你怎么知道是午夜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}How do you know it was midnight?

1993
02:30:00,710 --> 02:30:03,740
我当时  我当时在厨房
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, I was, uh... I was in the kitchen.

1994
02:30:04,530 --> 02:30:06,210
在调玛格丽塔  然后...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You know, I was making margaritas, and, uh...

1995
02:30:07,560 --> 02:30:09,540
我听到了很吵的汽车声
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I heard the sound of a noisy muffler.

1996
02:30:09,550 --> 02:30:11,370
我抬头看了下钟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I looked up at the clock.

1997
02:30:11,440 --> 02:30:13,250
上面的时间就是午夜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}It said... The kitchen clock said midnight.

1998
02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:15,260
正好十二点吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Twelve o'clock exactly?

1999
02:30:15,640 --> 02:30:17,810
也可能是十二点零五
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, it could have been 12:05.

2000
02:30:17,890 --> 02:30:19,320
-差不多那个时候  -然后你就再没看到他们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Something like that. - And you didn't see them again

2001
02:30:19,410 --> 02:30:21,030
直到那个女人在泳池里袭击你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}until the woman attacked you in the pool.

2002
02:30:22,190 --> 02:30:23,060
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No, no.

2003
02:30:24,310 --> 02:30:26,190
所以这些行凶者做了什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So, what did these perpetrators do?

2004
02:30:26,390 --> 02:30:28,360
行凶者  他们就是一群傻逼嬉皮士
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Perpetrators? They were hippie assholes.

2005
02:30:29,100 --> 02:30:31,700
两个嬉皮士从前门闯进来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Two of them burst through the front door there,

2006
02:30:31,770 --> 02:30:36,200
其中那个男的说他是魔鬼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and the guy hippie said he was the devil.

2007
02:30:37,130 --> 02:30:38,820
他还说  "我来做...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And he said, "I'm here to...

2008
02:30:40,080 --> 02:30:42,230
什么魔鬼的事"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}do some devil shit."

2009
02:30:42,290 --> 02:30:44,020
不是他的原话  但是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Or... That's not verbatim, but...

2010
02:30:45,010 --> 02:30:47,400
-"魔鬼的事"  -对  "魔鬼的事"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- "Some devil shit"? - Yeah, "Devil shit."

2011
02:31:01,660 --> 02:31:03,490
我们走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And away we go.

2012
02:31:07,730 --> 02:31:09,280
等等  等等
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

2013
02:31:09,380 --> 02:31:10,990
你去哪家医院  克利夫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What hospital you going to, Cliff?

2014
02:31:11,030 --> 02:31:12,120
我们那里见好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'll meet you there, huh?

2015
02:31:12,580 --> 02:31:14,400
别来医院找我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You don't want to meet me in no hospital.

2016
02:31:14,900 --> 02:31:16,590
去照顾你太太吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why don't you go take care of your lady.

2017
02:31:17,530 --> 02:31:19,780
她刚吃了五片安眠药
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}She just took five fucking sleeping pills.

2018
02:31:19,990 --> 02:31:21,620
能一直睡到十月的哥伦布日
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}She'll be asleep till Columbus Day.

2019
02:31:21,980 --> 02:31:23,590
这些家伙可能还得再来一次
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}These guys will probably have to come out here again

2020
02:31:23,660 --> 02:31:27,020
-把她弄醒  -我不会死的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- just to wake her ass up. - Hey, I'm not gonna die.

2021
02:31:27,090 --> 02:31:28,740
可能会瘸  但不会死的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I may get a limp, but I ain't gonna die.

2022
02:31:28,780 --> 02:31:30,960
-我的时间还没到  -好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- It's not my time yet, man. - All right.

2023
02:31:31,020 --> 02:31:33,090
所以不需要来医院看我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So no use waiting in some waiting room.

2024
02:31:33,190 --> 02:31:35,930
你现在应该脱光光钻进你老婆的被窝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Why don't you go lie naked with that fine creature.

2025
02:31:36,460 --> 02:31:37,660
明天再来看我吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Come visit me tomorrow.

2026
02:31:38,060 --> 02:31:39,190
带甜甜圈来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Bring bagels.

2027
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:42,870
你要是想为我做点什么  就照顾好布兰迪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You want to do something for me, check on Brandy.

2028
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:44,970
她可能有点受惊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}She may be a little shook up after that.

2029
02:31:44,970 --> 02:31:46,900
-可能会想跟你一起睡  -开玩笑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- She may want to sleep with you. - Are you kidding me?

2030
02:31:46,920 --> 02:31:49,180
她正跟弗兰切斯卡一起睡呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}She's sleeping with Francesca right now.

2031
02:31:49,230 --> 02:31:51,140
你可能再也领不回她了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You might never get her back. Ha, ha.

2032
02:31:51,640 --> 02:31:53,210
-我们得走了  -好的  克利夫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- We got to go. - All right, then, Cliff.

2033
02:31:53,630 --> 02:31:55,540
明天见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'll see you tomorrow, then.

2034
02:32:04,630 --> 02:32:05,860
你是个好朋友  克利夫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're a good friend, Cliff.

2035
02:32:07,910 --> 02:32:08,850
我尽力
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I try.

2036
02:32:41,620 --> 02:32:42,220
你好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hello?

2037
02:32:45,520 --> 02:32:46,300
我是杰·赛百灵
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm Jay Sebring.

2038
02:32:46,390 --> 02:32:47,880
波兰斯基家的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I'm a friend of the Polanskis.

2039
02:32:48,540 --> 02:32:50,590
你是瑞克·道尔顿吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You're Rick Dalton, right?

2040
02:32:51,370 --> 02:32:54,350
是的  我是瑞克·道尔顿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah. Yeah. I'm Rick Dalton.

2041
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:56,670
-住在隔壁  -我知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Live next door. - Oh, I know.

2042
02:32:56,970 --> 02:32:59,440
我还取笑莎伦说她就住在杰克·卡希尔的隔壁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I tease Sharon that she lives next door to Jake Cahill.

2043
02:32:59,820 --> 02:33:01,230
如果她想悬赏捉拿罗曼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}If she ever wants to put a bounty on Roman,

2044
02:33:01,360 --> 02:33:03,090
只要走去隔壁就可以了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}she just has to go next door, right?

2045
02:33:05,170 --> 02:33:05,900
说的对啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}No shit.

2046
02:33:07,130 --> 02:33:09,390
刚刚是发生什么事了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What the fuck happened?

2047
02:33:09,790 --> 02:33:12,110
那些该死的嬉皮士怪胎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, th-these fucking hippie weirdos,

2048
02:33:12,250 --> 02:33:14,640
他们闯进了我家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}they-they-they broke into my house.

2049
02:33:15,530 --> 02:33:16,770
什么意思  他们想抢劫你吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}What do you mean, like, trying to rob you?

2050
02:33:17,130 --> 02:33:18,630
我们不知道他们到底想干什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We don't know what the fuck they wanted.

2051
02:33:19,290 --> 02:33:20,490
是要抢我吗  我不确定
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Were they robbing me? I don't know.

2052
02:33:20,560 --> 02:33:23,170
还是嗑药磕嗨了乱来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Were they freaking out on some bummer trip?

2053
02:33:23,350 --> 02:33:26,390
谁知道呢  但他们想杀了我太太和我兄弟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Who knows? But they tried to kill my wife and my buddy.

2054
02:33:26,630 --> 02:33:29,800
-天啊  你说真的  -当然了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Jesus Christ. Are you serious? - Yeah, I'm fucking serious.

2055
02:33:30,320 --> 02:33:33,080
我兄弟和他的狗干掉了其中两个  然后...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now, my buddy and his dog killed two of them, and then...

2056
02:33:34,130 --> 02:33:36,690
妈的  我烧死了最后一个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, shit. I-I torched the last one.

2057
02:33:37,290 --> 02:33:38,760
-烧死  -是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- "Torched"? - Yeah.

2058
02:33:39,280 --> 02:33:40,760
我把她烧成了焦炭
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I burnt her ass to a crisp.

2059
02:33:41,630 --> 02:33:43,940
-你怎么做到的  -说出来你可能不信
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- How'd you do that? - Well, believe it or not, I...

2060
02:33:44,950 --> 02:33:47,020
我的工具房里有一把喷火器
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I got a flamethrower in my toolshed.

2061
02:33:47,110 --> 02:33:48,740
《麦克拉斯基的十四拳》里那把
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, from The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.

2062
02:33:49,740 --> 02:33:50,270
没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah!

2063
02:33:52,970 --> 02:33:54,300
就是那把
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's... That's the one.

2064
02:33:54,770 --> 02:33:56,910
而且它还能用  感谢上帝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, it still works too. Thank God.

2065
02:33:58,180 --> 02:33:59,100
大家都还好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Is everybody okay?

2066
02:33:59,700 --> 02:34:02,060
那些该死的嬉皮士可不怎么好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Well, the fucking hippies aren't,

2067
02:34:02,200 --> 02:34:03,490
这是肯定的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}that's for goddamn sure.

2068
02:34:03,950 --> 02:34:05,470
但我很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah. But I'm fine.

2069
02:34:05,620 --> 02:34:07,590
我老婆也没事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}You know, my wife's fine.

2070
02:34:07,630 --> 02:34:10,150
只是有点受惊而已
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}We're just a little shook up, is all.

2071
02:34:10,570 --> 02:34:13,010
-天啊  太可怕了  -是啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}- Oh, my God, that's terrifying. - Yeah.

2072

杰  亲爱的  外面没事吧

02:34:16,750 --> 02:34:18,180
现在没事了  亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Everything's okay now, honey.

2074
02:34:18,840 --> 02:34:21,180
但有几个嬉皮士闯进了隔壁邻居家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But some hippies broke into the house next door.

2075
02:34:21,750 --> 02:34:22,820
天啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, my God.

2076
02:34:23,590 --> 02:34:24,730
太可怕了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, that's terrifying.

2077

{\fs48\b0\bord0\shad0\fad(3500,1500)\fn方正行楷_GBK\i1\pos(192,260)}好莱坞往事

2103
02:38:52,170 --> 02:38:54,110
大家好  我是瑞克·道尔顿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Hi. This is Rick Dalton,

2104
02:38:54,180 --> 02:38:56,450
赏金猎人杰克·卡希尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}better known as bounty hunter Jake Cahill,

2105
02:38:56,810 --> 02:38:59,980
我在这里为红苹果香烟代言
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}speaking on behalf of Red Apple cigarettes.

2106
02:39:00,400 --> 02:39:03,480
我自己就抽红苹果香烟  抽了好多年
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now, I smoke Red Apples. Been smoking them for years.

2107
02:39:03,480 --> 02:39:05,760
因为红苹果烟草公司
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But since the Red Apple tobacco company's

2108
02:39:05,860 --> 02:39:07,970
创始于1862年
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}been around since 1862,

2109
02:39:08,650 --> 02:39:11,230
所以你们会看到杰克·卡希尔也抽红苹果
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}you'll see Jake Cahill smoke Red Apple too.

2110
02:39:12,160 --> 02:39:15,010
在杰克那个年代  红苹果是袋装的烟草
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now, back in Jake's day, Red Apple came in a pouch,

2111
02:39:15,150 --> 02:39:16,360
他得自己卷烟才行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}and he had to roll his own.

2112
02:39:17,240 --> 02:39:19,980
但是现在  红苹果在出厂时就卷好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}But today, Red Apple comes factory-rolled.

2113
02:39:20,330 --> 02:39:23,520
用最好的烟草获得最好的体验
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}For the best drag with the best tobacco flavor,

2114
02:39:23,960 --> 02:39:25,370
比其他任何未经过滤的香烟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}with less burn on your throat

2115
02:39:25,820 --> 02:39:28,190
都更能减少喉咙的灼烧感
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}than any other non-filtered cigarette.

2116
02:39:37,850 --> 02:39:40,190
这才是香烟的味道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Now, that's the way a cigarette should taste.

2117
02:39:41,440 --> 02:39:43,870
更好抽  更好的烟味
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Better drag, more flavor,

2118
02:39:44,510 --> 02:39:45,530
更不伤喉咙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}less throat burn.

2119
02:39:48,330 --> 02:39:49,600
这就是红苹果的风格
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}That's the Red Apple way.

2120
02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:54,720
快去寻找杰克·卡希尔的等身立牌吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}So look for this life-size standee of me, Jake Cahill,

{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}wherever fine Red Apple tobacco products are sold.

2122
02:39:58,510 --> 02:40:00,650
抽上一口  好好感受
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Take a bite and feel all right.

2123
02:40:01,810 --> 02:40:04,010
来一口红苹果
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Take a bite of a Red Apple.

2124
02:40:05,230 --> 02:40:06,320
就说是杰克派你来的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Tell them Jake sent you.

2125
02:40:10,350 --> 02:40:11,280
卡
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And cut.

2126
02:40:11,300 --> 02:40:12,900
这烟真他妈难抽
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}This cigarette tastes like fucking shit.

2127
02:40:13,110 --> 02:40:14,600
还有  这是谁选的照片
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}And, by the way, who chose this photo?

2128
02:40:14,690 --> 02:40:16,030
我的双下巴都出来了好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}I have a double chin. All right?

2129
02:40:16,180 --> 02:40:17,450
你们都瞎了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}Nobody notices that crap?
