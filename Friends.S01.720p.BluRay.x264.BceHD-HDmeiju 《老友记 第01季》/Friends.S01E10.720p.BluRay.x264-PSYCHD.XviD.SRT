1
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:11,421
各位 我想给你们介绍一个人
Guys? There's, uh, somebody I'd like you to meet.

2
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:15,629
等等 那是什么?
W-wait. What is that?

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,015
这是马赛尔 要打声招呼吗?      我不要
That would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?        No. No, I don't.

4
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,302
他很珍贵 你从哪里得到他的?
Oh, he is precious. Where did you get him?

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,596
我朋友贝瑟把他从实验室救出来的
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.

6
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,310
真残忍
That is so cruel.

7
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:28,647
怎么会有父母把孩子取名叫贝瑟?
Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?

8
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:34,175
那猴子的屁股上长了个罗斯
Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass.

9
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,951
罗斯 它要和你同住吗?
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?

10
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,330
对 卡萝离开后家里冷冷清清的
Yeah. I mean, it's been kind of quiet since Carol left, so

11
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,335
为什么不找个室友?
Why don't you just get a roommate?

12
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,542
不知道 我觉得人到了某种年纪 
Ah, I don't know. I think you reach a certain age

13
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,832
跟室友住有点可悲
having a roommate is kind of pathe, uh,

14
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:58,930
抱歉 我的意思是 在梵语中表示很酷的生活方式
sorry, that's "pathet", which is Sanskrit for "really cool way to live".

各位 我今晚唱的都是新写的歌
Hey guys, I'm doing all new material tonight.

20
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,362
十二首关于我妈自杀的新歌
I have 12 new songs about my mother's suicide

21
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,773
一首关于雪人的歌
and one about a snowman.

22
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,028
你最好先唱雪人
Might want to open with the snowman.

23
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,410
嘿 乔伊      嗨
Hey, Joey.        Hey, buddy.

24
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:07,613
结果怎么样?
So, how'd it go?

25
00:02:07,987 --> 00:02:10,376
我没得到那份工作
Ah, I didn't get the job.

26
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,297
怎么可能? 你是去年的圣诞老人
How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.

27
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:19,343
我不知道 某个胖子跟店经理有一腿
I don't know. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager.

28
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,547
他根本无法逗人开心 这就是政治
He's not even jolly. It's all political.

29
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:24,975
那你要当什么?
So, what are you gonna be?

30
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,143
我会当他的助手之一
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers.

31
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,306
真是个耻辱
It's just such a slap in the face, you know?

32
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,392
你们打算怎么过新年?
Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's?

33
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,817
怎么?新年有什么问题吗?
Gee, what? What is wrong with New Year's?

34
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,401
你是没有 你有保罗
Nothing for you. You have Paolo.

35
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,283
你不用面对那可怕的节日压力 
You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday

36
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,661
急需寻找有嘴唇的生物 
desperate scramble to find anything with lips

37
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,369
在球落下的那一刻 有个可以亲吻的对象 我真大声
just so can have someone to kiss when the ball drops. Man,I'm talking loud.

38
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:53,754
好吧 新年时保罗会在罗马
Well, for your information, Paolo's gonna be in Rome this New Year.

39
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,960
所以我会跟你们一样可悲
So I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.

40
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,170
你想得美
Yeah, you wish.

41
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:03,092
我受够了迪克拉克的节日疲劳轰炸
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday.

42
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,678
我提议 今年我们不约会 做个约定
I say this year, no dates, we make a pact.

43
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,843
就我们六个人一起吃晚餐
Just the six of us. Dinner

44
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,887
好啊      同意
Yeah, okay.        Alright.

45
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,434
我希望大家能更热烈一点
You know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.

46
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,687
好耶!
Woo! Yeah!

47
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,774
菲比 到你了      好的
Phoebe, you're on.        Oh. Oh, good.

48
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,782
各位 应观众热烈的要求 
Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand

49
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,113
欢迎菲比布非小姐
Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!

50
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,785
谢谢大家
Thanks. Hi.

51
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,579
首先我想先唱首 这个节日对我意义重大的歌曲
Urn, I want to start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.

52
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,094
我做了一个人 眼睛是煤炭做的
I made a man with eyes of coal

53
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:46,883
他有谜样的微笑
And a smile so bewitchin'

54
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,927
我要怎么承受
How was I supposed to know

55
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,847
我母亲死在厨房的事实?
That my mom was dead in the kitchen?

56
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,148
啦啦啦...
Lalala...

57
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,738
母亲的骨灰
My mother's ashes

58
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,151
甚至是她的睫毛
Even her eyelashes

59
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:13,326
安放在一个黄色的小坛子
Are resting in a little yellow jar

60
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,497
有时天寒地冻      我是老实说
And sometimes when it's freezing        I'm being honest here.

61
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,663
你不同意
You don't agree.

62
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,049
我有点想打喷嚏      你说得没错
I feel a little sneezy.        You're right.

63
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,676
现在我      不好意思 抱歉
And now I...        Excuse me? Excuse me?

64
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,587
吵闹的两位
Yeah, noisy boys.

65
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,266
你们有什么想跟大家分享吗?
Is it something that you'd like to share with the entire group?

66
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,851
没有 没事
No. No, that's that's okay.

67
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,108
如果有事如此重要 你们非得在我演唱时讨论
Well, come on, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing

68
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,270
那就重要到和大家分享
then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear

69
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,939
那家伙回家后一定会记得这教训
That guy's going home with a note.

70
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,951
没事 我只是说      请你大声点行吗?
No. I was, I was just saying to my        Could you speak up please?

71
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,331
抱歉
Sorry.

72
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:58,925
我只是在跟朋友说 你是我见过的最美丽的姑娘
I wa, I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my life.

73
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,377
他说黛瑞汉娜      黛瑞汉娜
And then he said that you said you thought        Darryl Hannah.

74
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,634
黛瑞汉娜是他见过最漂亮的女人
Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life.

75
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,613
我说 我喜欢她在"美人鱼"的演出 
And I said, yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot,

76
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:08,047
"华尔街"就一般般了
but not so much in in Wall Street.

77
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,012
她有种...      强硬特质
I thought she had kind of a        Hard quality.

78
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,725
黛瑞汉娜是传统的美 
And, uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way,

79
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,391
你则是散发出高雅的气质
you are, uh, luminous with a kind of delicate grace.

80
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,238
然后你就开始大吼了
Then uh, that, that, that's when you started yelling.

81
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,453
好 我们休息一会
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.

82
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,339
那家伙带回家的不只是教训而已
Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note.

83
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,387
过来 马赛尔 坐这
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.

84
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,802
菲比 我真不敢相信他还没吻你
Pheebs I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet.

85
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,812
到我和保罗第六次约会时 
I mean, God, by my sixth date with Paolo...

86
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,941
他就已经给我的胸部取名字了
I mean, he had already named both my breasts.

87
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,147
我是不是分享太多了?
Ooh, did I just share too much?

88
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,946
一点点
Just a smidge.

89
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,200
大卫是个科学家 做事一丝不苟
Davids, like, you know, scientist guy. He's very methodical.

90
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,207
我觉得很浪漫      我也这么觉得
I think it's romantic.        Me too. Oh!

91
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,413
你们看过"军官与绅士"吗?
Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?

92
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,623
嗯
Yeah.

93
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,289
他就像陪我去看那部电影的男生
Well, he's kind of like the guy I went to see that with.

94
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,967
除了 
Except

95
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:33,132
他更聪明 温柔 而且贴心
Except he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter

96
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,392
我只想一直和他在一起
I just, I just want to be with him all the time.

97
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:40,272
日以继夜 夜以继日
Day and night. And night and day.

98
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,024
还有特别的日子
And special occasions.

99
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,488
等等 我明白了 你要邀请他一起过新年 对不对?
Wait a minute, wait, I see where this is going. You're gonna ask him to New Year's. Aren't you?

100
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,070
你要毁约! 她要抛弃我们!
You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.

101
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,109
不 不 不 不 不 不
No, no, no, no, no, no.

102
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,204
好吧 我可以毁约吗?
Yeah, could I just?

103
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,663
好吧 因为我已经邀请了珍妮丝      什么?!
Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.        What?!

104
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,453
拜托 这是你定的约定啊
Come on, this was a pact. This was your pact.

105
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,289
我耐不住寂寞 我毁约了
I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.

106
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,551
可是 珍妮丝? 你们的分手糟透了
Yeah, but Janice? That that was like the worst breakup in history.

107
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,258
我不是说这是好主意 我只是说我毁约了
I'm not saying it was a good idea. I'm saying I snapped.

108
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,343
不好意思我迟到了
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.

109
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,062
太可笑了
Too many jokes.

110
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,567
一定要取笑乔伊
Must mock Joey.

111
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,239
很棒的鞋子吧?
Nice shoes, huh?

112
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,870
我快笑死了
Aah, you're killing me.

113
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,792
罗斯 他又在玩我的锅铲了
Ross. He's playing with my spatulas again.

114
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,796
他又不会玩坏的 不是吗?
Look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?

115
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,957
你一定要把他带来这里吗?
Do you always have to bring him here?

116
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,421
我不想把他单独留在家
Look, I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright?

117
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,133
我们今早吵了第一次架
We, we had our first fight this morning.

118
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:00,890
我觉得是因为我加班的关系 我说了不该说的话
I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean.

119
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,190
然后他就朝我扔了一坨屎
he threw some faeces.

120
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,272
你加班时我可以替你照顾他
You know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.

121
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,440
太好了 好 
Oh, that would be great. Okay.

122
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:17,076
但是如果你去 一定要假装你是去找他
But if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay?

123
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,784
而不是帮我忙
And you're not, like doing it as a favor to me.

124
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,995
好 但是他如果问 我就要实话实说了
Okay. But if he asks, I'm not going to lie.

125
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,129
但仍无法测试这个理论
But you can't actually test this theory.

126
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,761
因为现今粒子加速器的速度 
Because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough

127
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,844
仍无法模拟出这样的情况
to simulate these conditions.

128
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,635
好 那我有个问题      请说
Okay. Alright. I have a question then.        Yeah.

129
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,804
你打算吻我吗?
Were you planning on kissing me ever?

130
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,064
非常合理的问题 
Uh,that's definitely a valid question

131
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,445
答案是 
and, uh, the answer

132
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,901
是的
would be yes.

133
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,657
我有这个打算
Yes I was.

134
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:04,165
但我要这非凡的吻 
But see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss

135
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,293
发生在非凡的时刻 因为是你
that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, it's you.

136
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,704
当然
Sure.

137
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,921
对 但是等得越久 这个吻就越非凡
Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.

138
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,592
此时此刻
And now, we've reached a place

139
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,300
我只想
where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like...

140
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,307
扫去桌上的一切 把你丢上去
sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it.

141
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,514
而我不是会扫去一切的那种猴急的人
And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sort of fella.

142
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,856
大卫 我认为你正是那样的人
Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sort of fella.

143
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,112
我的意思是 你是个猛男! 
I mean, you're a sweeper!

144
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:32,269
只是被困在物理学家的体内
Trapped inside a physicist's body.

145
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,029
是吗?      没错 我肯定
Really?        Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm sure of it.

146
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,942
来吧 扫掉一切 把我丢上去
You should just do it. Just sweep and throw me.

147
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,530
现在?      就是现在
Now? Now?        Oh yeah, right now.

148
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,914
好 
Okay. Okay, okay.

149
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,375
嗯 这个很贵
You know what? This was just really expensive.

150
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,004
这个是礼物
And I'll take, this was a gift.

151
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:59,091
好吧 你现在比较像在打扫      额 管他的
Okay, now you're just kind of tidying.        Okay, what the hell? What the hell?

152
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,738
你想要我把你丢上去还是你自己跳? 
You want me to actually throw you or you, you wanna just hop?

153
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,015
我可以跳
I can hop.

154
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:26,247
告诉我 "不约会的约定" 对你们有何意义?
So tell me something, what does the phase "no date pact" mean to you?

155
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,452
真的很抱歉
I'm sorry, okay?

156
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,289
只是钱德约了人 菲比也约了人
It's just that Chandler has somebody and Phoebe has somebody.

157
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,670
我就想邀请搞笑巴比
I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

158
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,957
搞笑巴比? 你的前男友搞笑巴比?      对
Fun Bobby, your exboyfriend, Fun Bobby?        Yeah.

159
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,842
你还知道其他的搞笑巴比吗?
You know more than one Fun Bobby?

160
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,836
我刚好认识一个搞笑巴伯
I happen to know a Fun Bob.

161
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,681
好了
Okay. Here we go.

162
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,517
没有地方加牛奶了
Whoa, whoa, whoa. There's no room for milk.

163
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,858
好了 现在有了
There. Now there is.

164
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,152
所以在没有约会的夜晚 
Okay, so on our no date evening

165
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,483
三个人都有约会了
three of you now are gonna to have dates.

166
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,818
额 四个      四个
Uh, four.        Four.

167
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,608
五个      五个
Five.        Five.

168
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,782
抱歉 保罗提早搭飞机回来
Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.

169
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:08,699
我在店里遇见一位很性感的单身妈妈
Yeah. And I met this really hot single mom at the store. Ha, ha.

170
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,201
我这个小精灵怎能抗拒?
What's an elf to do?

171
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,587
所以只有我 孤单一人
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone...

172
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:15,837
当球落下的时候?
when the ball drops?

173
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,922
别这样 我们会办个大派对 没人会知道谁是谁
Oh. come on. We'll have a big party, and no one will know who's with who.

174
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,178
我现在真的不需要知道这些
Hey, you know, this is so not what I needed right now.

175
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,010
怎么了?      噢 是马赛尔
What's the matter?        Oh, it's, it's Marcel.

176
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,639
他一直拒我于门外
He keeps shutting me out, you know?

177
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,432
老是拖着双手不断绕圈子
He's walking around all the time, dragging his hands.

178
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,110
太奇怪了 我前几晚还跟他玩得很开心
That's so weird. I had such a blast with him the other night.

179
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,396
是吗?      是啊 我们一起玩 还看电视
Really?        Yeah, we played. We watched TV.

180
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:42,111
杂耍那部分实在太精彩了
That juggling thing is amazing.

181
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,071
什么?
What, uh...?

182
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,115
什么杂耍?
What juggling thing?

183
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,786
拿袜子当球耍啊 我以为是你教的
With the balled up socks? I figured you taught him that.

184
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:52,871
不是
No.

185
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,789
其实没什么大不了的 只是拿袜子当球耍而已
You know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks.

186
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,001
还有一颗香瓜
And a melon.

187
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,633
菲比 嗨      嗨 麦克斯 你认识大家了吗?
Phoebe. Hi.        Hi Max. Hey, do you know everybody?

188
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,672
不认识 你看到大卫了吗?
No. Have you seen David?

189
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,513
没有 他不在
No, he hasn't been around.

190
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,271
如果看到他 叫他打包 我们要去明斯克了
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.

191
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,604
明斯克?      明斯克 在俄罗斯
Minsk?        Minsk. It's in Russia.

192
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,693
我知道明斯克在哪里
I know where Minsk is.

193
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,317
我们申请到奖助金
Ha, ha. We got the grant.

194
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,529
全额赞助我们三年
Three years, all expenses paid.

195
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,319
你们什么时候走?
So when, when do you leave?

196
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,199
一月一号
January first.

197
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,503
哈罗?
Hello?

198
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,840
嘿 嗨      嗨
Hey.        Hi.

199
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,177
你怎么来了?      麦克斯跟我说了明斯克的事
Hi, what are you doing here?        Urn, well, Max told me about Minsk.

200
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,309
我是来恭喜你的 太令人兴奋了
So, congratulations! This is so exciting!

201
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,514
如果我们能去就更兴奋了
It'd be even more exciting if we were going.

202
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,184
你们不去?为什么?
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?

203
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,859
跟她说啊 大卫
Tell her, David.

204
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,425
"我不想去明斯克
"I don't wanna go to Minsk

205
00:13:02,425 --> 00:13:04,193
和李波森 亚马古基还有法兰克工作
to work with Lipson and Yamaguchi and Flank.

206
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:09,077
不 我想留在这里 和我的女友亲热"
No, no, no. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!"

207
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,034
好了 谢谢你 麦克斯
Okay, thank you, Max. Thank you.

208
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,158
那你真的不去吗?
So, so you're really not going?

209
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,578
我不知道 我不知道怎么办 
I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just

210
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,664
你来决定
You decide.

211
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,002
别这样      求你了
Oh, don't do that.        Please?

212
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,258
我在求你 我无法做决定
No. but I'm asking. I can't make a decision.

213
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,091
我不能 拜托你      好吧 留下来
I can't. Please, just        Okay. Stay.

214
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,803
留下来      留下来
Stay.        Stay.

215
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,017
你越来越厉害了
Getting so good at that.

216
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,313
都是麦克斯的东西
It was Max's stuff.

217
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,198
我喜欢菊芋
I love this artichoke thing.

218
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,960
不要告诉我里面是什么 我明天才开始节食
Oh. Don't tell me what's in it. The diet starts tomorrow.

219
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,383
你还记得珍妮丝吧?
You remember Janice.

220
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,086
历历在目
Vividly.

221
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,599
嗨      嗨 我是珊蒂
Hi.        Hi, I'm Sandy.

222
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,644
珊蒂 嗨 请进
Sandy, hi. Come on in.

223
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:34,050
你把孩子带来了?      对 可以吧?
You brought your kids.        Yeah. That's okay, right?

224
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,911
派对
Party.

225
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,828
那个东西不能进来
That thing is not coming in here.

226
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:44,247
"那个东西"? 你是这样接待客人的吗?
"That thin"? This is how you greet guests at a party?

227
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,292
我问问你 如果我是和我的新女友来
Let me ask you something. If I showed up here with my new girlfriend

228
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,926
你也不欢迎她么?
she wouldn't be welcome in your home?

229
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:52,089
你的新女友不会在我的咖啡桌上尿尿
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.

230
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,844
这事他比任何人都尴尬
Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone.

231
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:02,641
好吗? 他鼓足勇气回到这儿
Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here

232
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,517
假装什么都没发生过 
like nothing happened

233
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,730
好吧 不要让他靠近我就好了
All right. All right. Just keep him away from me.

234
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,365
谢了 来吧 马赛尔
Thank you. Come on, Marcel.

235
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,528
咱们去交际一下吧
What do you say you and I do a little mingling?

236
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:19,498
那好 我们待会儿见
All right, I'll, uh, catch up with you later.

237
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,874
天啊 瑞秋 
Oh, my gosh. Rachel, honey

238
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:31,169
你还好吧?保罗呢?
Are you okay? Where's Paolo?

239
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,969
罗马 那混蛋没赶上飞机
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.

240
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,966
然后你的脸就爆炸了?
And then your face exploded?

241
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,896
不是
No. Okay.

242
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,773
我在机场 正准备上出租车
I was at the airport, getting into a cab

243
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,650
有个女人 
when this woman

244
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,403
带着笔记本的金发女人 
this blond planet with a pocketbook

245
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,606
开始对我大吼
starts yelling at me.

246
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,491
说她先叫到出租车
Something about how it was her cab first.

247
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:58,746
我还没反应过来 她就开始扯我的头发
And then the next thing I know, she just starts, starts pulling me out by my hair.

248
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,749
我拿出口哨猛吹 
So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy

249
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,911
又来了三辆出租车
and three more cabs show up.

250
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:09,549
我正要进出租时 她又绊我
and as I'm going to get into a cab, she tackles me.

251
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:15,259
然后我撞到了路边 嘴唇被哨子割伤
And I hit my head on the curb and cut my lip on my whistle.

252
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:21,102
哦 大家在派对玩得好吗?
Oh! Everybody having fun at the party?

253
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,476
有人吃我做的蘸酱吗?
Are people eating my dip?

254
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,818
我上周在店里看到你时
You know, when I saw you at the store last week

255
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:41,866
大概是我第一次 在心里脱掉小精灵的衣服
it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.

256
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,126
哇 真淫荡
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.

257
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,253
对
Yeah.

258
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,258
嘿 孩子们
Hey, kids.

259
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,635
看看他 我不要求他整晚陪我
Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me

260

你从我身边跑掉了
You got away from me.

263

但被你找到了
But you found me.

他的棺材暂时不盖上
It's going to be an open casket, you know?

277
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:56,572
所以我至少能再见他最后一面
So at least I'll, I get to see him again.

00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,211
我请你来这个派对 并不代表我们
When I invited you to this party, I didn't necessarily think it meant that we

283
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,592
噢 不
Oh, no.

284
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,254
不会吧

很抱歉让你误会了      天哪
I'm sorry you misunderstood.        Oh, my God.

286
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,848
你听我说 钱德 你听我说
You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me.

287
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:30,607

One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.

288
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,773
赶快给我那东西
Oh, will you give me the thing?

289
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,237
嗨 麦克斯      小野洋子
Hi Max.        Yoko.

290
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,913
我决定自己去明斯克
I've decided to go to Minsk without you.

291
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,373
哇
Wow

292
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,333
少了你一切都会不同 
It won't be the same.

293
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,463
但至少明斯克不会变
but it will still be Minsk.

294
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,341
新年快乐
Happy New Year.

295
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,594
你还好吧?
Are you all right?

296
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,630
我没事 没事
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

297

298
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,939
不 我不要去明斯克

299
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,853
你一定要去明斯克
Oh, you are so going to Minsk.

300
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:21,069
你属于明斯克 不能为了我留在这里
You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just because of me.

301
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,827
我可以 如果去 我就得和你分手
Yes, I can. Because if I go, it means I have to break up with you.

302
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,080
我不能和你分手      可以 你可以
And I can't break up with you.        Oh, yes, yes, yes you can.

303
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,664
你只要说 "菲比 我爱你 但工作就是我的生命
Just say, uh "Phoebe, I love you, but my work is my life.

304
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,624
我现在只能这么做"
And that's what I have to do right now.

305
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,711
我会说 "你的工作? 你怎么能那么说?"
And I say, "Your work? Your work? How can you say that?"

306
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,006
然后你说 "我的心都碎了 
And then you say, urn "It's tearing me apart

307
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,923
但我别无选择 你能理解吗?
but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?"

308
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:49,060
我会说 "不 我无法理解解
And I say, "No. No. I can't understand that."

309
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,721
嗷      对不起
Uh. ow.        Sorry. Urn

310
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,479
然后你抱住我 
And, and then you put your arms around me

311
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:59,066
你抱住我      抱歉
And then you put your arms around me.        Oh, oh. Sorry.

312
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,653
然后你说你爱我 永远不会忘记我
And, urn, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.

313
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,990
我永远都不会忘记你
I'll never forget you.

314
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,369
然后说已经午夜了 你得走了
And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go

315
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,925
因为你想如果不能完成它
because you don't want to start the new year with me

316
00:20:13,925 --> 00:20:16,038
就无法和我开始新的一年
if you can't finish it.

317
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,219
我会想你的 
I'm gonna miss you

318
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,255
科学家
you scientist guy.

319
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,472
我们在时代广场为您实况报导
Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square.

320
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:35,606
时代广场的五彩纸片纷纷落下
We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square.

321
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,516
一年比一年盛大
It gets bigger and better every year

322
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,526
好了 孩子们
Here you go, kids.

323
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,489
然后孔雀就咬了我
And then the peacock bit me. Ha, ha.

324
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,524
请你在午夜时吻我
Please kiss me at midnight.

325
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,749
你看到珊蒂了吗?      我不知道怎么说
You seen Sandy?        Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this...

326
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,629
她和麦克斯 在摩妮卡的房间里 那个科学怪人
but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek.

327
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,461
你看 我还是告诉你了
Oh, look at that. I did know how to tell you.

328
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,794
嘿 各位 球要落下了
Hey, everybody, the ball is going.

329
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,462
什么?
What?

330
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,885
球要落下了
The ball is dropping.

331
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,886
再过二十秒就是午夜
In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.

332
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,064
兴奋的时刻即将到来
And the moment of joy is upon us.

333
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:20,477
看来"不约会的约定"奏效了
Looks like that "no date pact" thing worked out.

334
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,278
大家看起来都很开心 我讨厌这样
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.

335
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,815
不是每个人都开心 嘿 巴比
Not everybody is happy. Hey, Bobby.

336
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,446
一 新年快乐
One. Happy New Year!

337
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,830
这么说好了 我不是数学大师
You know, I uh, just thought I'd throw this out there. I'm no math whiz

338
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:41,668
但是这儿有三男三女
but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.

339
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:46,048
噢 我今晚谁都不想亲
Oh. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.

340
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,383
我谁都不能亲
I can't kiss anyone.

341
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,343
所以我要亲每个人?
So I'm kissing everyone?

342
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,262
不 你不能亲罗斯 他是你哥
No, no, no. You can't kiss Ross. That's your brother.

343
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,058
太好了 大家都能亲到 除了我
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.

344
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,598
好吧 谁来亲我?
All right. Somebody kiss me.

345
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:02,610
谁来亲我 已经午夜了 快来亲我 已经午夜了
Somebody kiss me.It's midnight. Somebody kiss me. It's midnight.

346
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,862
好吧 好吧 好吧
All right. All right. All right.

347
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,317
亲了
There.

348
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,369
我真的希望能成功
I wanted this to work so much.

349
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,496
我很投入 你知道么
I mean I'm still in there, you know?

350
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,913
帮他换尿布 抓跳蚤
Changing his diapers. Picking his fleas.

351
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:25,000
但他却视为理所当然
But he's just phoning it in.

352
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,760
真的很难接受这个事实 深爱某人却
Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much

353
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,297
却得不到回报
doesn't love you back, you know?

354
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,804
我想那贱人打断了我的牙齿
I think that bitch cracked my tooth.

355
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:41,804
