51
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,814
知道你会是代言什么么?      不知道
You know which one you're gonna be?        No, no.

00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,424
你会做切成块的土豆泥么?
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?

60
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,419
你知道土豆那样弄其实不对
You know they're not actually supposed to?

61
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,838
我切土豆块
I'll work on the lumps.

62
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,553

Well I'm off to Carol's.

76
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,363
我们为何不邀请她来?
Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?

77
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,934
因为她是我前妻
Ooh, ooh, because she's my exwife

78

86
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,550
就像一张没有皮的大脸
Kind of like a big face without skin.

87
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:17,640
哦 我有印象
Yes, heh, I'm familiar with the concept.

88

我们可以找找看      好
We can just look for it.        Okay.

89
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:30,745
哇 你们有很多怎么做女同性恋的书
Wow, you guys, heh, sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian.

90
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,951
嗯 你必须去上课
Well, you know, you have to take a course.

91
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,746
不然他们就不让你当同性恋
Otherwise they don't let you do it.

92
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:53,141
嘿 乌龟耶尔特 经典故事
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.

93
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,098
其实我正在念给宝宝听
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.

94
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,475
还没出生的宝宝?
The baby that hasn't been born yet?

95
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,859
你是不是
Uh, wouldn't that mean you're

96
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,691
疯了?
crazy?

97
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,486
你觉得宝宝在里面听不到声音么?
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?

98
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,912
你不是认真的吧? 你真的跟宝宝说话?
You're not serious. I mean, you really talk to it?

99
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,870
对 常常 我想让宝宝认得我的声音
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.

100
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,043
那你 你提到过我吗?
Do you, uh? Do you talk about me?

101
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:25,082
有 常提      真的?
Yeah, yeah. All the time.        Really?

102
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:30,763
不过 我们都称你为捐精子的泡泡
But, urn, we just refer to you as "Bobo the sperm guy".

103
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:46,229
如果她对宝宝说话 我想我也要有一点肚子时间
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think I should get some belly time too.

104
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,613
但我不是说我相信这个
I mean not that I believe any of this.

105
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,488
我信 我想宝宝可以听到所有的声音
Oh I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything.

106
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,027
真的?      我可以演示给你看
Really?        I can show you.

107
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,657
也许有点怪异
This will seem a little weird.

108
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,790
你得把头放到火鸡里面
But you put your head inside this turkey

109
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:03,166
然后我们大家都说话 你就可以听到我们说的
and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.

110
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,583
我想说我完全支持这个实验
I'd just like to say I'm totally behind this experiment.

111
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,795
事实上 我很愿意给你的脑袋抹上黄油
In fact I'd very much like to butter your head.

112
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,934

123
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,381

你跟这个节日到底有什么仇?
What is it with you and this holiday?

133
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,493
好吧 我九岁的时候
All right, I'm 9 years old.

134
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,325
我讨厌这个故事!
Aw, I hate this story.

135
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,410
我们刚吃完一顿丰盛的感恩节大餐
We've just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner

136
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:25,827
我嘴里 我记得的非常清楚 还塞满南瓜派
I have, and I remember this part vividly, a mouthful of pumpkin pie.

137
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:30,090
我父母就选择那个时刻告诉我 他们要离婚了
And this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.

138
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,625
哦 我的天!
Oh, my God.

139
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,112
一旦你有这样的负面印象
It's very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner

140
00:08:34,112 --> 00:08:36,217
就很难去享受感恩节大餐了
once you've seen it in reverse.

141
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,364
嗨
Hi.

142
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,118
我们一起工作过      有吗?
We used to work together.        We did?

143
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,116
对 在梅西百货的时候 你就是迷幻香水女孩 对吧?
Yeah, at Macy's. You're the Obsession girl, right?

144
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,703
是的      我就是"阿米许"香水的那个
Yes.        I was the Aramis guy.

145
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,667
阿米许?阿米许?阿米许?      哦!
Aramis? Aramis? Aramis?         Oh.

146
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:10,921
对 是你!
Yeah, right.

147
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,130
我跟你说 你是这行里最棒的
I gotta tell you, you're the best in the business.

148
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,965
别开玩笑了      我说真的
Get out.        I'm serious.

149
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:20,553
你太厉害了!你就懂什么时候喷 什么时候要往后退
You're amazing. You know when to spritz. You know when to lay back.

150
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:24,344
真的?我受宠若惊了
Really? You don't know what that means to me.

151
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:30,487
你今晚闻起来真香 你身上的是什么?
Mm, mm. You smell great tonight. Uh, what are you wearing?

152
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,065
什么也没有
Nothing.

153
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,619
听着 你要不要去喝一杯?
Listen, do you wanna go get a drink or something?

154
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,667
好的...
Yeah. that would be

155
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,005
怎么了?      突然想到我还有事
What's wrong?        I just remembered I have to do something.

156
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,215
什么事?
Oh. What?

157
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,964
离开
Leave.

158
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,380
等等 等等
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

159
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:07,729
马里奥没有告诉你的事
What Mario isn't telling you

160
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,892
性病 你永远不知道谁会染上它
VD: you never know who might have it

161
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,132
我猜你们全都看到了
So I guess you all saw it.

162
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,638
什么?      看到什么?
What?        Saw what?

163
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,518
不 我们只是在笑 你知道 笑是会传染的
No, we're just laughing. You know how laughter can be infectious.

164
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,367
嗨
Hey.

165
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:11,863
只好另找个地方过感恩节了
Set another place for Thanksgiving.

166
00:11:11,863 --> 00:11:14,333
全家人都以为我得了性病
My entire family thinks I have VD.

167
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,922
今夜的特别节目
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.

168
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,638
看起来不错 好!
Mm, looking good. Okay.

169
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:36,397
苹果汁在滚 火鸡在烤 山芋香喷喷
Cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming.

170
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,186
干嘛?
What?

171
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,775
不知道
I don't know.

172
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,235
就是和妈妈在厨房的感觉不太一样
It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.

173
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,827
够了 出去 别来烦我!
Ugh. All right, thats it. Get out of my way and stop annoying me.

174
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,701
哦 这就有点像了
Well, that's closer. That's...

175
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,865
我买到机票了!我买到机票了!
I got the ticket, I got the ticket.

176
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,613
再过五小时 就可以咻 咻 咻
Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.

177
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,713
哦 你不能再咻了
Oh, you must stop shooping.

178
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,250
好 我要去收拾行李了
Okay, I'm gonna get my stuff.

179
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,987
钱德 你要进来吗?
Chandler, will you just come in, already?

180
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:06,306
不 我宁愿和欢乐保持安全距离
No, thank you. I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.

181
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,968
小心!南瓜派来了!
Look out. Incoming pumpkin pie.

182
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,925
你以前来这一套的时候我们都笑了
Okay, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing,

183
00:12:17,925 --> 00:12:20,486
但这会儿不好笑了
but that's not funny anymore.

184
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:25,651
摩妮卡 我有个问题 我没看到土豆泥
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any Tater Tots.

185
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,864
这不叫问题
That's not a question.

186
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,780
但我妈总是会做这个 就像是个传统
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition.

187
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,918
叉子上有块火鸡肉 配点蓝莓酱 还有土豆泥!
You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a Tot.

188
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,127
我的意思是 不能和家人团聚已经太惨了
I mean, it's bad enough I can't be with my family

189
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,259
因为我的病
because of my disease.

190
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,632
好吧
All right, fine.

191
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,970
今晚的土豆有切成块的
Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps

192
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,679
还有做成泥的
and in the form of Tots.

193
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,514
哦耶
Yes.

194
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,264
好了 我要去跟我还没出生的宝宝说话去了
All right, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.

195
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,769
好      妈妈从不打人
Ah.        Okay, Mom never hit.

196
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,238
好了 全部搞定
Okay, all done.

197
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,575
菲比 你在搅烂土豆么?
What? Phoebe, did you whip the potato?

198
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,238
罗斯要吃切块的
Ross needs lumps.

199
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,453
哦 很抱歉 我只是 
Oh I'm sorry. Oh, I just I

200
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:19,792
我还以为我们要弄成泥 然后再放一些豌豆和洋葱
thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.

201
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,464
为什么要那样做?
Why would we do that?

202
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,920
就像我妈妈曾经做的一样
Then they'd be just like my mom used to make it

203
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,710
你知道 在她去世前
you know, before she died.

204
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,217
好吧 三种土豆吃法出现了
Okay, three kinds of potatoes coming up.

205
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,721
大家再见
Okay. Goodbye, you guys.

206
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,183
谢谢大家
Thanks for everything.

207
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:41,647
哦 天 你们看 对不起,很抱歉
Oh. God. look at Sorry. I'm so sorry.

208
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,740
最不可思议的事件发生了 超狗飞了
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has gotten away.

209
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:50,535
那个气球?      不 是真的卡通超狗
The balloon?        No, no, the actual cartoon character.

210
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,197
当然是气球!
Of course the balloon.

211
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,707
新闻全都在报导 在它抵达梅西百货之前
It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's...

212
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:00,211
它断线了 后来在华盛顿广场公园上被发现了
he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park.

213
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,113
我要到屋顶上去看 谁要跟我去? 
I'm going to the roof. Who's with me?

214
00:14:02,113 --> 00:14:03,544
我不行 我得走了
Well, I can't. I gotta go.

215
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,050
拜托 一只八十英尺的充气狗在城市上面游荡?
Come on, an 80 foot inflatable dog loose over the city?

216
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,212
这样的机会有几次?      几乎没有
How often does that happen?        Almost never.

217
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,182
钥匙拿了吗?      好
Got the keys?        Okay.

218
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,930
随时可以开始
Any time you're ready.

219
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,807
好
Okay.

220
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,977
好 开始了
Okay, here we go.

221
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:32,402
好 我要对着哪里说? 我的意思是
Okay, where am I talking to here? I mean, uh...

222
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:37,412
似乎只有那样才能让他听见 但是
Well there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but

223
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,951
对着隆起的部位就可以了
Just aim for the bump.

224
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,791
好
Okay.

225
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,876
好 好
Okay, okay.

226
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,087
好 开始
Okay, here goes.

227
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,844
你知道吗? 我做不到
You know, I, You know, I can't do this.

228
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,550
这太诡异了 我觉得跟傻子一样
This is, It's too weird. I feel stupid.

229
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,895
没关系 那就别做
All right, so don't do it. It's fine.

230
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,902
不用因为苏珊这么做你就非得也要做
You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.

231
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:10,736
哈罗 宝宝 哈罗 哈罗
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.

232
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,744
我们眼看超狗的影子坠向公园的那种感觉
that moment when we first saw the giant dog shadow fall over the park?

233
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,077
他们干嘛非得把它打下来? 真的很残酷
But did they have to shoot him down? I mean that was just mean.

234
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:23,420
现在火鸡应该是外焦
Okay, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside.

235
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,250
里嫩了
and juicy on the inside.

236
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,712
我们还站在这儿干什么?
Why are we standing here?

237
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,253
我们在等你开门 你有钥匙
We're waiting for you to open the door. You've got the keys.

238
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,172
不 我没有
No. I don't.

239
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:39,094
有 你有 我们要出门时 你说 "钥匙拿了"
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "Got the keys."

240
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:43,981
不 我没有 我是问 "钥匙拿了吗?"
No I didn't. I asked, "Got the keys?"

241
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,982
不 不 不 你是说 "钥匙拿了"
No, no, no. You said, "Got the keys."

242
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:51,398
你们谁有钥匙吗?
Either of you have the keys?

243
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,277
烤炉还开着      我得拿机票
The oven is on.        Oh, I've gotta get my ticket.

244
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,425
等一下 我们有你们的备用钥匙
Wait. We have a copy of your key.

245
00:15:57,425 --> 00:15:58,492
快去拿啊!快去!
Well, then get it, get it!

246
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,040
嘿 那种口气不会让我更快一点
Hey, hey. That tone won't make me go any faster.

247
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,000
乔伊      这倒可以
Joey.        That one will.

248
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,963
大家都对我说
And everyone's telling me

249
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,251
"你得选个专业 你得选个专业"
"You gotta pick a major. You gotta pick a major."

250
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:16,514
所以我鼓起勇气 选了古生物学
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.

251
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,300
你根本不知道我在说什么
And you have no idea what I'm saying,

252
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,099
因为 面对现实吧 你只是一个胎儿
because, let's face it, you're a fetus.

253
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,394
你会很开心你再没有腮了
You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.

254
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,402
你不用一直对他说话 你可以唱歌
Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it.

255
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:34,113
拜托 我才不要对着你的胃唱歌
Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, okay?

256
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,800
还顺利吗?      嘘 嘘 嘘
How's it going?        Shh. shh. shh.

257
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,903
我们开始了
Here we come

258
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,367
沿着街道走着
Walkin' down the street

259
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:45,251
每个人的脸上都很开心
Get the funniest looks from Everyone we meet

260
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,834
嘿 你感觉到了吗?      是的
Hey, uh, did you just feel that?        I did.

261
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,503
一直都这样?      不 这是第一次
Well, does it always, uh        No, no, that was the first.

262
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,093
继续唱 继续唱
Keep singing. Keep singing. Oh.

263
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,974
嘿 嘿 你是我的宝宝
Hey, hey, you're my baby.

264
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,431
我等不及要见到你
And I can't wait to meet you.

265
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:07,645
等你出来了 我要给你买百吉饼 然后一起去动物园
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel. And then we'll go to the zoo.

266
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,359
这次我有感觉到
I felt it that time.

267
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,020
嘿 嘿 我是你的爸爸
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy.

268
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,938
我是那个没有胸部的那个
I'm the one without any breasts.

269
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,197
不是那个      你们可以再快一点吗?
Nope, not that one.        Can you go any faster with that?

270
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,536
嘿 只有一个钥匙孔我却有一大堆钥匙
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys.

271
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,496
你自己试试
You do the math.

272
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,708
你们怎么会有这么多钥匙?
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?

273
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,589
以备不时之需 就像现在
For an emergency just like this.

274
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,215
听着 你这嘻皮笑脸的
All right, listen, smirky.

275
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,471
要不是因为你的愚蠢的气球
If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon

276
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,804
我早就在飞机上对着空姐这样指手画脚了
would be on a plane, watching a woman do this right now.

277
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,969
可是我没有
But I'm not.

278
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,309
我发誓你说你拿了钥匙
I swear you said you had the keys.

279
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,145
不 除非我拿了钥匙否则不会说我有
No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys.

280
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,105
显然我没有拿钥匙
And I obviously did not have the keys.

281
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,023
够了 不要再说钥匙了 谁都不准说钥匙
Okay, all right, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say "keys".

282
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:01,153
为什么要我拿钥匙?
Why would I have the keys?

283
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,321
因为你说你有
Aside from the fact that you said you did?

284
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,831
但是我没说      你应该有
But I didn't.        Well, you should have.

285
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,333
为什么?为什么?      因为
Why?        Because

286
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,539
为什么? 因为一切都是我的责任吗?
Why? Because everything is my responsibility?

287
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,330
我都做感恩节晚餐了还不够么?
Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone?

288
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,472
每个人都要不一样的土豆
Everyone wants a different kind of potato,

289
00:18:14,472 --> 00:18:16,672
所以我就做了各种各样的土豆
so I'm making different kinds of potatoes.

290
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,838
可是有谁在乎我想要哪种土豆?
You know, does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want?

291
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:23,634
没有 没有 没有
No. no. no!

292
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,848
菲比要豌豆和洋葱的
You know, just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions

293
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,979
马里奥先生要土豆泥
and Mario gets his Tots.

294
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:33,025
这是我的第一个感恩节晚餐 我 
It's my first Thanksgiving, and I...It's

295
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,653
全都焦了 我没能 
all burnt, and I can't

296
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,741
好了摩妮卡 现在只有狗听懂你的话 所以
Okay, Monica only dogs can hear you now, so

297
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,651
看 门开了 我们进去吧
Look, the door's open. Here we go.

298
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,286
天呐
Oh. God.

299
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,697
哦      哦
Ooh.        Oh.

300
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,999
哦 火鸡烤焦了!
Well, the turkey's burnt.

301
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:56,382
土豆毁了 土豆毁了 土豆毁了
Potatoes are ruined. Potatoes are ruined. Potatoes are ruined.

302
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,251
我们沿着...
Here we come

303
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,506
沿着街道走
Walkin' down the

304
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,721
这味儿可不像妈妈的厨房
This doesn't smell like Mom's.

305
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,808
是不像 对吧? 你要有土豆块 罗斯?
No. it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross?

306
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,268
给你 这就是你的土豆块
Well, here you go, buddy. You got one.

307
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,101
天 这下可好
Oh, God, this is great.

308
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:19,655
飞机走了 我想我只能留下了跟你们一起了
The plane is gone, so I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.

309
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:23,610
嘿 我们都有好的计划 现在这样不是任何人的首选
Hey, we all had better plans, okay? This was nobody's first choice.

310
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,198
哦 真的吗?
Oh, really?

311
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,909
那我为嘛忙得要死
So why was I busting my ass

312
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,415
想弄出一顿美味的感恩节大餐?
to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?!

313
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,951
这叫美味吗?      给我闭嘴!
You call that delicious?        You be quiet!

314
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,001
别吵了 别吵了 别吵了!
All right, stop it, stop it, stop it!

315
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,008
这才像感恩节的气氛
Now, this feels like Thanksgiving.

316
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,395
额      怎么了?
Ew.        What?

317
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:59,061
丑陋裸男 把他的火鸡从烤箱里拿出来了
Ugly Naked Guys taking his turkey out of the oven.

318
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,776
额
Eh.

319
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,863
哦 天呐 他不是一个人
Oh, my God. He's not alone.

320
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,243
丑陋的裸男 
Ugly Naked Guy

321
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:09,577
跟丑陋的裸女 共享感恩节大餐

322
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,459

323
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,162

00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,968
裸舞开场了
Ooh, ugly naked dancing.

326
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,675
他有伴真的很好
It's nice that he has someone.

327
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,524
我可以开始切了吗?
Shall I carve?

328
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:38,775
当然
By all means.

329
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,944
好
All right.

330
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,615
谁要浅色起司 谁要深色起司?
Oka who wants light cheese and who wants dark cheese?

331
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,494
我根本不想知道深色起司
I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.

332
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,284
有人要分吃这块吗?      我要
Does anybody wanna split this with me?        Ooh. I will.

333
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:56,919
你们得许愿才行
Mm. You guys have to make a wish.

334
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,916
许愿?      得了 你们是知道的 感恩节啊
Make a wish?        Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.

335
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:09,432
你抢到大块的 你刚才许什么愿?
Ooh. You got the bigger half. What did you wish for?

336
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,558
要比较大块的
The bigger half.

337
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,146
好 我想举杯庆祝
All right, I'd like to propose a toast.

338
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,399
举杯了 叮叮叮
A little toast here. Ding, ding, ding. Mm.

339
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,902
我知道这也许不是你们大家计划的感恩节
This isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving you planned

340
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,860
可是对我来说 今天的感恩节真的很棒 知道么
but for me this has been really great, you know?

341
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,777
我想这是因为今天没有离婚
I think because it didn't involve divorce

342
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,785
也没有人呕吐
or projectile vomiting.

343
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,787
我在想 如果你去维尔滑雪
I was just thinking, if you'd gone to Vail

344
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,874
或你去跟家人相聚 或要不是你得
or if you guys had been with your family, or if you didn't have

梅毒或什么的
syphilis and stuff

346
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,131
我们就不可能聚在一起
we wouldn't be all together, you know?

347
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,966
我想我真正想说的是 
So I guess what I'm trying to say

348
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:54,010
谢天谢地你们的感恩节计划全砸了
is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.

349
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,470
太感人了
That's so sweet.

350

谢谢
Thank you.

也预祝有个糟糕的圣诞节

00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,065
以及更糟的新年
And a crappy New Year

354
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,526
干杯      干杯
