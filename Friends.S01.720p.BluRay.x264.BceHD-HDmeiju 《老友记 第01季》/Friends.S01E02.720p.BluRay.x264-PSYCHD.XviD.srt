1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,290
你们男生不懂
What you guys don't understand is

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,540
亲吻对女生的重要性
for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,500
没错
Yeah, right.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,090
真的?
You serious?

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,090
真的
Oh, yeah.

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,680
初吻可以让你明白一切
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,760
当然      就是 我觉得对于男生
 Absolutely.        Yeah, I think, for us

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,020
接吻很大程度上像是序幕!
kissing is pretty much like an opening act.

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,770
像是你听Pink Floyd的音乐会之前不得不忍受的
I mean, it's like the standup comedian you have to sit through.

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,100
笑星们的表演一样
before Pink Floyd comes out.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,690
对 我们并非讨厌脱口秀
Yeah, and it's not that we don't like the comedian.

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,070
但那不是
It's just that that's not...

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,280
我们买票的原因
...why we bought the ticket.

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,200
问题出在于
See, the problem is, though

15
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,000
演唱会结束后 不论表演有多精采
after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,670
你们女生总还想再看脱口秀
you girls are always looking for the comedian again.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,880
我们在车上奋力杀出车阵
I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic

18
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,840
只是拼命让自己别睡着
basically just trying to stay awake.

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,930
是哦 给你一个建议 叫脱口秀主持人再度上场
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian.

20
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,890
否则下次
Otherwise, you're gonna find yourself

21
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,680
你们只能独自坐家里听唱片
sitting at home listening to that album alone.

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,770
我们还在谈论性吗?
Are we still talking about sex?

23

27
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,200
不 这样很好
No, it's good. It is good.

28
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,080
只是她看起来是不是有点烦恼吗?
It's just that, doesn't she seem a little angry?

29
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,000
她有麻烦事
Well, she has issues.

30
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,210
她有吗?
Does she?

31
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,630
他在外头乱搞女人 
He's out banging other women over the head with a club

32
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,680
而她却待家里设法去除地毯上乳齿象的味道
while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet.

33
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,970
玛莎 他们是穴居人
Marsha, see, these are cave people.

34
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,350
他们关心的问题是
Okay, they have issues like:

35
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,560
冰河愈来愈接近了 懂吗?
"Gee, that glacier's getting kind of close." See?

36
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,860
谈到问题 那不是你前妻吗?
Speaking of issues, isn't that your exwife?

37
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,740
我的?不是      是的,她是 嘿,你好
 My...no, no.        Yes, it is. Carol, hi.

38
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,490
是的,她是
Okay. Yes. Yes, it is.

39
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,070
我到冰河期找你怎么样?
How about I'll catch up with you in the Ice Age?

40
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,760
嗨!     嗨!
 Hi.      Hi.

41
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,520
那么
So...

42
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,190
你的气色好极了
You look great.

43
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,060
我讨厌看到这样
I hate that.

44
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,360
抱歉 谢了 你的气色也很好
Sorry. Thanks. You look good too.

45
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,490
在这儿任何人都
Well, you know, in here, anyone who

46
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,320
能直立...
stands erect

47
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,620
最近如何?还是...女同志?
 So, what's new? Still a...A lesbian?

48
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,410
呃
Well

49
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,960
想问就问!
You never know.

50
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,210
最近呃家庭生活如何?
How's, um? How's the family?

51
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,790
玛蒂仍然神经兮兮的
Marty's still totally paranoid.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,090
喔, 卡萝      你为何来这儿?
 Oh, and...     Carol, why are you here, Carol?

53
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,220
 我怀孕了       怀孕
 I'm pregnant.         Pregnant.

54
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,230
喔 看那 她似乎不急着离开
Oh. Looks like she didn't leave in such a hurry after all.

55
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,690
人和人 让人讨厌的就是有
I think this is the episode of Three's Company

56
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,190
误会
where's there's some kind of misunderstanding.

57
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,530
我看过这一集
Then I've already seen this one.

58
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,990
喝完没?谢谢
Are you through with that? Thanks.

59
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,620
抱歉 吞下去的时间太慢
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.

60
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,920
这是谁的小纸团?
Whose little ball of paper is this?

61
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,170
我的 
Oh, that would be mine.

62
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,840
我写给自己一张便条 后来觉得自己不需要
See, I wrote a note to myself, then I didn't need it.

63
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,260
于是将它揉成纸团 我现在不想活了!
So I balled it up and now I wish I was dead.

64
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,238
她已经拍松过那个枕头
She already fluffed that pillow.

65
00:04:26,238 --> 00:04:27,720
摩妮卡 你已经拍过了枕头了
Monica, you know, you already fluffed...

66
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,760
但是它很好
But it's fine.

67
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,180
抱歉 各位
Look, I'm sorry.

68
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,850
我只是不想 让他们有藉题发挥的机会
I don't want to give them any more ammunition than they have.

69
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,940
没错 我们都知道 父母对孩子的枕头
Yes, we know how cruel a parent can be

70
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,270
要求有多苛刻
about the flatness of a child's pillow.

71
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,280
摩妮卡?      嗨
Monica?        Hi.

72
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,320
摩妮卡 你吓到我了
Monica,um,you're scaring me.

73
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,240
你慌慌张张的
I mean, you're, like, all chaotic and twirly, you know?

74
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,660
而且显得不是很好
Not in a good way.

75
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,710
冷静
Yeah, calm down.

76
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,210
你没见过每次他们来时 罗斯慌张的样子
You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.

77
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,300
因为在我爸妈心目中 罗斯不可能犯错
That's because, as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong.

78
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,550
他是个王子
You see, he's the prince.

79
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,140
显然 他们在我出生前有个大型仪式
Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.

80
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,560
嘘
Ew, ew, ew.

81
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,430
怎么了?      丑陋裸男有个"美腿器"
 What?        Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

82
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,520
呃
Ew.

83
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,320
有人看见我的订婚戒指吗?      有 它真漂亮
 Has anybody seen my engagement ring?        Yeah, it's beautiful.

84
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,370
糟了 糟了
Oh, God. Oh, God.

85
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,040
 哦 天呐       不要动它们
 Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.         No, don't touch that.

86
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,710
明天就要还他戒指 我似乎还不够担心
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough having to give it back to him.

87
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,710
巴瑞 记得我吗? 我是那个
"Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girl

88
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,090
让你在亲友面前出糗的人
that stomped on your heart in front of your entire family"

89
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,630
天啊 如今我必须还他戒指 戒指却不见了
Oh, God. Now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring

90
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,720
叫我如何面对他!
which makes it so much harder.

91
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,560
别急 我们会找到的 对不?
Easy, Rach, we'll find it. Won't we?

92
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,480
哦 必须滴      好的 想想
Oh,yeah.        Okay,look

93
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,690
你最后记得它是什么时候?
When did you have it on last?

94
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,230
"孩仔" 大概是在遗失之前
Doy. Probably right before she lost it.

95
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,240
这年头说"孩仔"的人不多
You don't get a lot of "doy" these days.

96
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,700
我今天早上还戴它
I know I had it this morning.

97
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,790
我在厨房戴着做...
I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with

98
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,620
面条?
Dinah?

99
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,040
别生气
Oh, don't be mad.

100
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,880
你做的好事?       对不起
 You didn't.         Oh, I'm sorry.

101
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,380
我只给了你一件事干! （你却把它搞砸了!）
I gave you one job.

102
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,680
你看面条现在变得多直
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are.

103
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,520
摩妮卡  在意大利面中找订婚戒指不是那样找的
Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagna.

104
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,600
我办不到
I just can't do it.

105
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,150
伙计们!
Boys

106
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,690
我们上
We're going in.

107
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,410
嗨...
Hi.

108
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,540
这不是个高兴的问候!
Oh,that is not a happy"Hi."

109
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,250
卡萝怀孕了
Carol's pregnant.

110
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,040
我找到了
Oh, I found it.

111
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,300
什,什,什么?
Well, what? What?

112
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,050
耶
Yeah.

113
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,340
你（的表情）再保持这样两小时
Do that for another two hours

114
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,560
就会变成我现在这样
you might be where I am right about now.

115
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,810
这样的话 枕头的事就可先放在一旁?是不是?
Kind of puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?

116
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,150
你打算怎么处理（面对）整件事?
Well, now, how do you fit into this whole thing?

117
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,440
卡萝说她和苏珊想让我加人
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved.

118
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:33,280
但是对这件事我不太感到舒服, 我不想卷进去
But if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.

119
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,490
一切由我做决定
Basically, it's totally up to me.

120
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,910
她人好好 我真想念她
She is so great. I miss her.

121
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,540
她所谓的"加入"代表什么?
What does she mean by "involved"?

122
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,340
我猜,你大部分的工作已经结束了
I mean, presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.

123
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,170
总之 她们要我和她们去做
Anyway, they want me to go down to this

124
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,800
B超检查
sonogram thing with them tomorrow.

125
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,050
罗斯!你打算怎么做?
So, what are you gonna do?

126
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,310
我也不知道
I have no idea.

127
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:02,140
不管我怎么做 我还是孩子的爹
No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.

128
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,900
面已经被搅乱了 不是吗?
Well, this is still ruined, right?

129
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,830
玛莎路金的女儿会打电话给你
Oh. Martha Lugwin's daughter is gonna call you.

130
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,380
怎么会有咖哩味?
Mm. What's that curry taste?

131
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,130
因为有放咖哩
Curry.

132
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,800
嗯
Mm.

133
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,550
这东西很好吃 真的
I think they're great. I really do.

134
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,720
你还记得路金一家人?
You remember the Lugwins?

135
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,810
他们的大女儿喜欢你  对不?
The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?

136
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,770
他们家的女儿都喜欢他
They all had a thing for him.

137
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,730
不要这样,妈妈
Oh, Mom.

138
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,020
抱歉  她为何要打电话给我?
I'm sorry. Why is this girl going to call me?

139
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,730
她刚毕业 想找份烹饪的工作吧
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking or food

140
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,070
可能
or I don't know.

141
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,650
我告诉她你开了一家餐馆
Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant, so...

142
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,530
不 妈 我没开餐馆 我在餐厅工作
No, Mom. I don't have a restaurant. I work in a restaurant.

143
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,410
呃 他们不需要知道
Well, they don't have to know that.

144
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,960
罗斯  能帮我做义大利面吗?
Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti.

145
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,120
好的
Yes.

146
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,590
我们吃意大利面呀 那也太
Oh, we're having spaghetti. That's...

147
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,250
简单了
easy.

148
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,340
我知道这样要求过于自私 
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish on my part

149
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,675
你能不能和他们说一下
but were you planning on bringing up

150
00:09:18,675 --> 00:09:20,760
小孩 女同性恋之类的事?
the whole baby lesbian thing?

151
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,680
因为这样可以让我喘口气
Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.

152
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,650
瑞秋到底怎么了? 我们在俱乐部遇见她父母
What that Rachel did to her life? We ran into her parents at the club.

153
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,820
他们很不开心
They were not playing very well.

154
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,280
我不想讲他们为此婚礼花了些什么
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding

155
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,030
但是4万块不是个小数目?
but $40,000 is a lot of money.

156
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,425
但是至少瑞秋还有机会
Well,at least she had the chance

157
00:09:42,425 --> 00:09:44,660
在举行婚礼之际离开那个男人
to leave a man at the altar.

158
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,580
什么意思?      没什么
 What's that supposed to mean?        Nothing.

159
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,090
随便说说       不 不是的!
 It's an expression.         No, it's not.

160
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,460
别听你妈乱讲话
Don't listen to your mother.

161
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,630
你一直都很独立
You're independent and you always have been.

162
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,300
就连你小时候 胖嘟嘟
Even when you were a kid, and you were chubby

163
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,350
的一个朋友也没有 你还是活得好好的
and you had no friends, you were just fine.

164
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,270
你会待在你房里看书玩拼图
You'd read alone in your room. And your puzzles

165
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,780
而像罗斯这种人则追求卓越
Look, there are people, like Ross, who need to shoot for the stars.

166
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,820
博物馆 发表论文...
With his museum and his papers getting published.

167
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,280
其他人则安于现状
Other people are satisfied with staying where they are.

168
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,160
我告诉你 这种人不会得癌症!
I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.

169
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,210
我还知道 这些女人想拥有一切
And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God

170
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,420
幸好我们家的小摩妮卡 似乎没有这种问题
our little Harmonica doesn't seem to have that problem.

171
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,840
罗斯 你现在过的如何?
So, Ross, what's going on with you?

172
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,863
最近有什么新闻八卦之类
Any stories? No news,

173
00:10:43,863 --> 00:10:45,970
可以和老爸老妈分享的
no little anecdotes to share with the folks?

174
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,270
好吧
Okay, okay.

175
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:54,020
我知道你们想了解
Ahem. Look, I, uh I realize you guys have been wondering

176
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,860
我和卡萝之间倒底怎么了
what exactly happened between Carol and me.

177
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,860
事情是这样的
And so, well, here's the deal.

178
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,370
卡萝是个Les
Carol's a lesbian.

179
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,870
她和一个名字苏珊的女人同居
She's living with a woman named Susan.

180
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,920
她怀了我的孩子
She's pregnant with my child.

181
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,460
并打算和苏珊共同抚养他
And she and Susan are going to raise the baby.

182
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,180
这些你全都知道?
And you knew about this?

183
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,650
你的状况真的很糟糕吗?
Your folks are really that bad, huh?

184
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,320
你要知道这些人十分专业,
Well, you know, these people are pros.

185
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,160
他们会躲在那里
They know what they're doing. They take their time.

186
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,040
再来个突然袭击
They get the job done.

187
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,000
常言道：父母是无法交换的
Boy, I know they say that you can't change your parents.

188
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,340
如果可以 我要你的父母
Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.

189
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,920
我要去尿尿了
Must pee.

190
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,760
如果你是双胞胎 情况会更惨
You know, it's even worse when you're twins.

191
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,140
你是双胞胎?      对 我们不往来
 You're a twin?         Oh, yeah. We don't speak.

192
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,140
她是一心追求事业的人
She's like this highpowered, driven, careertype.

193
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,310
她从事什么工作?      服务生
 What does she do?         She's a waitress.

194
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,520
各位 我得打扫了
All right. You guys, I kind of gotta clean up now.

195
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,610
钱德 你是独子? 你没有这些困扰?
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.

196
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,150
没有 尽管我有个想像中的朋友
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend

197
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,240
而我爸妈比较喜欢他
who my parents actually preferred.

198
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,580
帮我把灯关了
Hit the lights, please.

199
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,920
我在里面多久了?
How long was I in there?

200
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,880
只是我要打扫了
I'm just cleaning up.

201
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,470
需要帮忙吗?
Oh, do you, uh? Do you need any help?

202
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,340
好呀 谢了
Um, okay, sure. Thanks.

203
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,690
不管怎样!
Anyway

204
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,190
明天要见巴瑞 紧张吗?
So you nervous about Barry tomorrow?

205
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,150
有一点
 Oh, a little. Mmhm.

206
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,200
很紧张
 A lot. Mmhm.

207
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,450
有任何建议吗?
So got any advice?

208
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,740
就一个最近刚被甩的人而言
You know, as someone who's recently been dumped.

209
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,460
你应该避免用"甩"这个字眼
Well, you may want to steer clear of the word "dumped."

210
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,090
现在他可能痛不欲生
Chances are he's going to be this broken shell of a man. You know?

211
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,550
因此你不该显得艳光照人
So you should try not to look too terrific.

212
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,987
我知道这一点很难做到
I know it'll be hard.

213
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,220
这样吧 我拿戒指还巴瑞
Or, you know, hey, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring.

214
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,770
你陪卡萝及苏珊去做检查
And you can go with Carol and Susan to the OBGYN.

215
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,480
你明天得见卡萝
You've got Carol tomorrow.

216
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,280
这事怎么就变得这么复杂?
When did it get so complicated?

217
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,780
你可问倒我了
Got me.

218
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,070
还记得我们在高中时代吗?      记得
 Remember when we were in high school?         Yeah.

219
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,790
你没想过自己会遇见心上人
I mean, didn't you think you' were gonna meet someone

220
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,540
谈恋爱 然后厮守终生吗?
fall in love, and that'd be it?

221
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,500
罗斯?      什么事?
 Ross?         Yes, yes.

222
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,800
没想到自己会沦落到这个地步
Oh. Man. I never thought I'd be here.

223
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,390
我也是
Me neither.

224
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,870
抱歉 我迟到了
Hi. Sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.

225
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,540
我忙得无法脱身恐龙之类的事
There was this big dinosaur thing. Anyway

226
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,170
嗨
Hi.

227
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,880
罗斯 记得苏珊吗?      我怎么会忘记
 Ross, you remember Susan.         How could I forget?

228
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,260
罗斯
Ross.

229
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,090
苏珊,你好 她的手好有力
Hello, Susan. Good shake, good shake.

230
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,720
那么我们在等...
So, uh, we're just waiting for?

231
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,230
欧伯曼大夫      欧伯曼大夫他
 Dr. Oberman.         Dr. Oberman. Okay, and is he?

232
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,980
她      当然,"她"
She.        Of course, "she."

233
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:07,190
她了解我们的特殊状况?
She,uh,familiar with our special situation?

234
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,240
了解 而且她非常支持
Yes,and she's very supportive.

235
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,530
这太好了
Great. Okay, that's great. Heh.

236
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,700
不,我只是
No, I'm...

237
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,160
谢了
Thanks.

238
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,880
呱 呱
Quack, quack

239
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,090
呱 呱 呱
quack, quack, quack.

240
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,970
罗斯 
Ross?

241
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,930
那是用来打开我的子宫颈的
That opens my cervix.

242
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,270
巴瑞      进来
 Barry?        Come on in.

243
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,440
没问题?
Are you sure?

244
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,110
没问题, 罗此得待在这儿好几个小时
It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

245
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,490
呃
Huh?

246
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,410
那么!最近好吗?
So how are you doing?

247
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,250
我...
I'm...

248
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,750
我很好
I'm okay.

249
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,790
你的气色好极了
You look great.

250
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,250
耶 那个
Yeah, well

251
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,630
法大夫 杰森快没气了
Dr. Farber,Jason Greenspan's gagging.

252
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,590
马上到 我马上回来
Be right there. I'll be back in a second.

253
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,180
我甩了他
I dumped him.

254
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,810
是的
Okay.

255
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,570
啊
Oh!

256
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:42,120
罗斯      我是说 我们
 Ross.         So, um? So how's this going to work

257
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,910
以后怎么办?
ahem,you know,with us?

258
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,040
比方说某些重大的决定
You know,when,like,important decisions have to be made?

259
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,710
给我举个例子!
Give me a "for instance."

260
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,590
我也不知道!比如?
Well, I don't know. Okay, okay.

261
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,130
比方说孩子的名字      马龙
 How about with the baby's name?         Marlon

262
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:57,180
如果是个男孩 如果是个女孩就叫米妮
 Marlon. if it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girl.

263
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,890
和米奇的女友同名?
As in "Mouse"?

264
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,810
和我奶奶同名
As in my grandmother.

265
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,730
不管怎样,听到这个还是想到米老鼠
Still, you say "Minnie," you hear "Mouse."

266
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,400
那
How about, um...

267
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,480
朱莉亚如何?
How about "Julia"?

268
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,400
朱莉亚?
Julia?

269
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:16,780
我们决定用米妮
We agreed on Minnie.

270
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,740
真幽默我们曾决定共同生活一辈子
It's funny, um, we agreed we'd spend our lives together.

271
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,790
世事难料 兵来将挡
Things change. Roll with the punches.

272
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,250
茱莉亚 就这么决定
I believe Julia's on the table.

273
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,710
抱歉
Oh. Sorry about that.

274
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,340
近来可好?
So, what have you been up to?

275
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,380
还行
Oh. Not much.

276
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,390
我刚找到工作      这太好了
 I got a job.        Hey, that's great.

277
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,930
你为何晒得这么黑?
Why are you so tan?

278
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,180
哦 我 呃
Oh, I, uh...

279
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,640
我到阿鲁巴了
I went to Aruba.

280
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,770
你自己一个去渡蜜月?
Oh, no. You went on our honeymoon alone?

281
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,480
不是
No.

282
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,490
我和...
See, uh, I went with...

283
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,410
也许会很不好受      我?
 Now, this may hurt.         Me?

284
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,870
不是
No.

285
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:06,950
我和明蒂去了
I went with Mindy.

286
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,460
明蒂?
Mindy?

287
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,710
我的伴娘明蒂?
My maid of honor, Mindy?

288
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,590
对 我们是认真的
Yeah, well, we're kind of a thing now.

289
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,010
呃
Well, I'm

290
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,970
你去做植发了?
You got plugs?

291
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,010
小心 还不固定
Careful,careful.They haven't quite taken yet.

292
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,970
你还配了隐形眼镜
And you got lenses.

293
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,890
你不是讨厌将手指放进眼睛吗?
But you hate sticking your finger in your eye.

294
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,810
还不是为了她
Not for her.

295
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,070
哦
Oh.

296
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,070
我真的得感谢你
Listen, I really wanted to thank you.

297
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,150
嗯
Okay.

298
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,990
一个月前我想伤害你
About a month ago, I wanted to hurt you...

299
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,790
我从未如此激动过
...more than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life.

300
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,410
我是个整牙医师
And I'm an orthodontist.

301
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,710
哇
Wow.

302
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,500
你说得没错 我以为我们会过得很快乐
You know, you were right. I mean, I thought we were happy.

303
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,750
我们不快乐
We weren't happy.

304
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,260
但是和明蒂在一起
But with Mindy

305
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,840
现在我很快乐
now I'm happy.

306
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,300
吐掉      什么?
 Spit.         What?

307
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,260
对我说呢
Me.

308
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,480
无论如何 呃
Anyway, um...

309
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,860
总之 这东西属于你的!
I guess, uh I guess this belongs to you.

310
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,480
谢谢你送我
And thank you for giving it to me.

311
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,530
谢谢你送还给我
Well, thank you for giving it back.

312
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,740
喂!
Hello.

313
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,080
拜托 海伦有什么不好?
Oh, please. What's wrong with Helen?

314
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,420
海伦盖勒?
Helen Geller?

315
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:37,210
我不同意!      她不会叫海伦盖勒的
 I don't think so.         Hello, it's not gonna be Helen Geller.

316
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,800
谢谢
Thank you.

317
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,760
不 我是说她不姓盖勒
No. I mean, it's not Geller.

318
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,050
难道她叫海伦威利克
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?

319
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,930
老实说 我们考虑用海伦威利克班奇
No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick Bunch.

320
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,770
等等 为何有她的份?
Well, wait a minute. Why is she in the title?

321
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,350
因为她也是我的宝宝
Because it's my baby too.

322
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,860
是吗? 我不记得女人也会制造精子
That's funny. Really? I don't remember you making any sperm.

323
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,150
我们都知道那是个极大的挑战
And we all know what a challenge that is.

324
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,200
呃 清楚没?      够了 你们两个 别吵了
Uhhuh. See?        All right, you two, stop it.

325
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,740
不 功劳全让她抢了 我也在场
No, no. She gets a credit. Hey, I'm in there too.

326
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,910
罗斯  你该不会想用海伦威利克班奇盖勒吧?
Honestly. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick Bunch Geller.

327
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,710
因为这有虐待儿童之嫌
I think that borders on child abuse.

328
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,710
当然没有 我想用盖勒威利克班奇
Of course not. I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.

329
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,380
绝对不行 你看他 
Oh, no. No, no, no. You see what he's doing?

330
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,420
没人会叫她全名的
He knows no one is gonna say all those names.

331
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,260
他知道别人只会叫她盖勒 这样他就得逞了
He knows they'll wind up calling her Geller. Then he gets his way.

332
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,680
我得逞? 你认为这样算我得逞?
My way? You think this is my way?

333
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,430
相信我  我没想到自己会沦落到这种地步
Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being

334
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,850
这不是我想要的 我是不得已的...
this is not my way. You know what? This is too hard.

335
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,060
有人在吗? 今天如何 想呕吐吗?
Knock, knock. How are we today? Any nausea?

336
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,150
只是一点点      一点点
 A little.         Just a little.

337
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,570
我只是问准妈妈 很感谢你们的分享
Well, I was just wondering about the mothertobe, but, uh, thanks for sharing.

338
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,870
躺好
Uh, lie back.

339
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,280
知道吗?我不加入了
You know what? I'm gonna go.

340
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,500
我认为此时自己无法淌这坛浑水
Um, I don't think I can be involved in this particular family thing.

341
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,340
我的天呀
Oh, my God.

342
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,640
看啊
Look at that.

343
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,300
我知道
I know.

344
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,360
很神奇吧
Well, isn't that amazing?

345
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,490
我们该看到什么?
What are we supposed to be seeing here?

346
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,200
我不知道 我认为它将要攻击企业号
I don't know, but I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.

347
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,170
如果你们把头稍微向左偏 两眼放轻松
You know, if you tilt your head to the left and relax your eyes...

348
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,630
它样子就像是一个颗老马铃薯
it kind of looks like an old potato.

349
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,050
那么就不要那么干
Then don't do that, all right?

350
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,470
摩妮卡
Monica?

351
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,220
你认为呢?
What do you think?

352
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,890
嗯
Mmhm...

353
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,520
你哭了?
Are you welling up?

354
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,980
才没呢!      你在哭
 No.         You are.

355
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,440
你有 眼泪都下来了      我没有
 You are. You're welling up.         No, I'm not.

356
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,770
你就要成为阿姨了      闭嘴!
 You're gonna be an aunt.         Oh, shut up.

357
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,400
你好 明蒂

不 他告诉我了
Oh, yeah, yeah, he told me.

361
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,500
没关系 真的

I hope you two are very happy. I really do.

363
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,750
如果一切顺利
And, Min, you know, if everything works out

364
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,090
 你们结婚生子
and you guys end up getting married and having kids and everything

365
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,680
希望他有他的秃顶和你的鼻子
I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose.

366
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,980
我知道这招很损!但是现在我感觉好多了
Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
