1
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:10,124
帅哥 你好吗?
Hey,gorgeous. How's it going?

2
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,377
在日光灯底下吃着日本泡面
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights.

3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,880
我能有多好?
Does it get better than this?

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,237
问个问题 你没有约会对象 是吧?
Question:You're not dating anybody, are you?

5
00:00:19,237 --> 00:00:21,851
因为我遇见一个 超适合你的完美对象
Because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.

6
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:24,430
完美可能会有点不恰当
You see, perfect might be a problem.

7
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:28,229
你可以说是互相依赖 或自我毁灭
Had you said codependent or selfdestructive...

8
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,194
你星期六想去约会吗?      是的，很想
You want a date Saturday?        Yes, please.

9
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,318
他很可爱
He is cute.

10
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,737
他很好笑 他      他是男的?
He's funny.He's...        He's a he?

11
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,570
是啊 天哪
Well, yeah.

12
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,204
天啊 我只是
Oh. God. I just...

13
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:43,699
你很棒  天啊
You're nice. Oh, God.

14
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,665
很好 雪莉 我实在是没脸见人
Good, Shelly. Okay. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now.

15
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,038
好 再见
Okay. Byebye.

奶奶死了两次
The One Where Nana Dies Twice

21
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,363
经过那件事之后 真的很难继续享受拉面
It's hard to enjoy a cup of noodles after that.

22
00:01:39,363 --> 00:01:41,090
很夸张对吧?
Is that ridiculous?

23
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,933
你们能相信 她真的这样认为吗?
Can you believe she actually thought that?

24
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,809
可以
Yeah.

25
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,800
我刚认识你的时候 我想说或许
Well,I mean, when I first met you, I thought maybe...

26
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,234
有可能 
possibly...

27
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,738
你可能是
you might be.

28
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:56,651
真的?
You did?

29
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,238
但后来你在菲比的生日派对上
Then you spent Phoebe's birthday party

30
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:00,362
对着我的胸部说话…
talking to my breasts...

31
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:02,281
所以我想说应该不是
So then I figured maybe not.

32
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:08,959
你们其他人刚认识我的时候 有那么想过吗?
Huh. Did, uh, any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?

33
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,286
我有      我想有
I did.        I think so.

34
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,044
我没有      不...我也没有
Not me.        No, no, me neither.

35
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:19,215
不过大学时期的苏珊有那想过
Although, uh, back in college, Susan Saladore did.

36
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,929
开什么玩笑
You're kidding.

37
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,507
那你有跟她说我不是吗?      没有
Did you tell her I wasn't?        No.

38
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,352
因为我想跟她交往
It's because I kind of wanted to go out with her too.

39
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:31,800
所以我跟她说 你那时正在和伯尼交往...
So I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Speliman...

40
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,813
也就是另一个喜欢她的家伙
who also liked her.

41
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,691
这真是奇怪了
Well, this is fascinating.

42
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,202
那是什么原因?
So, uh, what is it about me?

43
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:48,157
我不知道 因为你很聪明 风趣
I don't know. Because you're smart, you're funny.

44
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,750
罗斯也是啊 你们有想过他是吗?
Ross is smart and funny. You ever think that about him?

45
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,662
是啊      那到底是什么原因?
Yeah, right.        What is it?

46
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,918
我不知道 你就是 你有种特质
Okay, I don't know. You just...You have a quality.

47
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,212
没错      对，某种特质
Yes, exactly.        Right? Yeah, a quality.

48
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:06,516
"特质" 很好 我还担心你们会说得很模糊
"A quality." Good. I was worried you were gonna be vague about this.

49
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,270
喂?
Hello?

50
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,975
喂?
Hello?

51
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,734
瑞秋 是巴洛从罗马打来的
Oh. Rachel. It's Paolo calling from Rome.

52
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,899
天啊 他从罗马打来
Oh, my God. Calling from Rome.

53
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,991
他从罗马打来 我也做得到啊
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that.

54
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,156
只要去罗马就行了
Just gotta go to Rome.

55
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,710
莫妮卡 你爸刚打进来 你可以讲快一点吗
Monica, your dad just beeped in. Can you make it quick?

56
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,546
我在跟罗马通话
I'm talking to Rome.

57
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,007
跟我通话的人在罗马
I'm talking to Rome.

58
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,718
爸 什么事?
Hey, Dad. What's up?

59
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,884
天哪
Oh, God.

60
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,675
罗斯 是外婆
Ross, it's Nana.

61
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,392
嗨
Hey.

62
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,446
你们好吗?      嘿，爸
How you doing?         Hey, Dad.

63
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,326
她还好吗?
So, uh, how's she doing?

64
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,492
医生说只剩几小时了
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.

65
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,870
你还好吗 妈?      我? 我很好
How are you, Mom?         Me? I'm fine, fine.

66
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,959
我很高兴你来了
I'm glad you're here.

67
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,038
你的头发怎么了?
What's with your hair?

68
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,415
什么?
What?

69
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,003
有什么不同?
What's different?

70
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,379
没有啊
Nothing.

71
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,965
噢 也许吧
Oh, maybe that's it.

72
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,343
她实在是令人难以置信 她母亲...
She's unbelievable. Her mother's...

73
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,844
好了 放轻松点
Okay, relax, relax.

74
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,597
看来我们还要在这里 待一段时问
We are gonna be here a while. It looks like.

75
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,646
免不了还要谈你男友和工作的事
We still have boyfriends and your career to cover.

76
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,223
天啊
Oh. God.

77
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,404
她皮包里有发霉的薄荷糖
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.

78
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,403
对 超恶心的
Yeah, they were gross.

79
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,034
你们知道我最爱什么吗?
Oh, you know what I love?

80
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,081
她的代糖
Her Sweet'n Lows.

81
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,502
她老是从餐厅偷代糖
And she was always stealing them from restaurants.

82
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,793
不只是餐厅 还有我们家
Not just restaurants, from our house.

83
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,378
盖勒太太?
Mrs. Geller?

84
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,722
她看起来好小
She looks so small.

85
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,220
我知道
I know.

86
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:15,812
至少她现在有外公和菲利斯婶婶陪着了
Well, at least she's with PopPop and Aunt Phyllis now.

87
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,147
再见了 外婆
Goodbye, Nana.

88
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,321
别了 外婆
Bye, Nana.

89
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,990
罗斯!
Ross!

90
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,082
护士
Nurse.

91
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,919
怎么了?
What is going on?

92
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,541
护士不是说外婆走了吗?
You know, uh, how the nurse said Nana had passed?

93
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,296
但并不是
Well, she's not quite.

94
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,179
什么?      她还没走
What?        She's not passed.

95
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,761
她还在 她活过来了
She's present. She's back.

96
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,258
怎么了?
What's going on?

97
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,181
她可能死了
She may have died.

98
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,307
她可能死了?
"She may have died"?

99
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:58,851
我们还在观察
We're looking into it.

100
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,355
我进去看看
Uh, I'll go see.

101
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,154
这几乎是从未有过的事
This almost never happens.

102
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,750
现在她去世了
Now she's passed.

103
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,686
我一定得知道
I just have to know, okay?

104
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,514
是我的头发吗?
Is it my hair?

105
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,146
没错 钱德 就是这样 你的头发
Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.

106
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,565
对 你长了一头同性恋式的头发
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.

107
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,610
嗨        嗨
Hey.        Hi.

108
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,781
那她...
So did she...?

109
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,658
两次
Twice.

110
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,496
真是糟透了
Oh, that sucks.

111
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:03,877
你们还好吗?
You guys okay?

112
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,956
我不知道 感觉好怪
I don't know. It's weird.

113
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:09,709
我知道她走了 但我就是没有感觉到...
I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...

114
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,920
或许是因为 她没有真的离开
Maybe that's because she's not really gone.

115
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,630
不 她走了
No, no, she's gone.

116
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,844
我们检查过
We checked.

117
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,346
很多次
A lot.

118
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,597
我是说 或许没有人曾真正离去
No, I mean, maybe no one ever really goes.

119
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,725
自从我妈死后 我偶尔…
Ever since my mom died, every now and then..

120
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,729
还是会感觉到她就在这里 你知道吗
I get this feeling that she's, like, right here, you know?

121
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,323
还有我初中最好的朋友 黛比 
Oh. And Debbie, my best friend from junior high...

122
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,655
在打迷你高尔夫球时 被闪电击中
got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course.

123
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,458
用黄色的铅笔时
I always get this really strong Debbie vibe...

124
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,124
我总是能强烈的感应到黛比
...whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils.

125
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,238
我好想她
I miss her.

126
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,845
菲比 你想要这个吗?
Aw. Here. Pheobe. Want this?

127
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,052
噢 谢了      不客气
Oh, thanks.        Sure.

128
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,517
我今早才把它削尖的
I just sharpened her this morning.

129
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,932
我完全不相信那一套 你死掉后
See I don'tbelieve any of that. I think when you're dead...

130
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,684
就是死了 消失了 成了虫子的食物
...you're dead. You're gone. You're worm food.

131
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,698
钱德看起来很像同志对吧?
So Chandler looks gay, huh?

132
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,789
我不知道这是谁 但绝不是黛比
I don'tknow who this is, but it's not Debbie.

133
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,377
我以为要用密封的棺木
I thought it's gonna be a closed casket.

134
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,551
这不代表她不能穿漂亮点
Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice.

135
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,058
孩子 你觉得自己能钻进去吗
Sweetie, you think you can get in there?

136
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,185
当然可以
I don't see why not.

137
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,535
我的牙齿矫正器在这里
Here's my retainer

138
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,755
我一直在想 
I was just thinking...

139
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,961
轮到我的时候      爸
...when my time comes...       Dad.

140
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,429
听我说
Listen to me.

141
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,889
轮到我的时候 我想海葬
When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.

142
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,518
什么?
You what?

143
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,651
我想葬在海里 看起来很好玩
I wanna be buried at sea. It looks like fun.

144
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,233
解释一下好玩的意思
Define "fun."

145
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,425
别这样 那一天你们会很开心的
Come on. You'll make a day of it.

146
00:09:37,425 --> 00:09:39,568
租艘船 带上午餐…
You'll get a boat, pack a lunch...

147
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:44,205
然后把你的尸体丢到海里 天啊 听起来真好玩
And then we throw your body in the water. Gee, that does sound fun.

148
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,907
大家都以为他们很了解我
Everyone thinks they know me.

149
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:49,252
大家都说 "杰克盖勒循规蹈矩"
Everyone says, "Jack Geller so predictable."

150
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:54,250
或许我走后 他们会说 "海葬?"
Maybe after I'm gone,they'll say, "Buried at sea? Huh."

151
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,721
可能他们会这样说
That's probably what they'll say.

152
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,847
我喜欢那样
I'd like that.

153
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,153
嘿 美女      嗨
Hey, gorgeous.        Hey.

154
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,066
听着 昨天的事 我很抱歉
Look. I'm sorry about yesterday.

155
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:23,616
别担心 相信我 显然其他人 也会犯相同的错误
Don't worry about it. Believe me. Apparently, other people have made the same mistake.

156
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,580
那好
Oh. Okay. Phew.

157
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,082
那你觉得我是哪里像?
So, uh, what do you think it is about me?

158
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,464
我不知道
I don't know what.

159
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,541
你就是有种 
You just have a...

160
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,626
特质      特质，对，太好了
...a quality.        A quality. Right. Great.

161
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,848
太可惜了 因为你和罗威尔 会是很棒的一对
It's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.

162
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:48,175
罗威尔? 金融服务部的罗威尔? 
Lowell? Financial Services Lowell?

163
00:10:48,175 --> 00:10:48,925
你认为我适合跟他在一起?
That's who you saw me with?

164
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:50,187
干嘛? 他很可爱啊
What? He's cute.

165
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,772
是啊
Well, yeah.

166
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,188
他又不是出纳处的布莱恩
He's not Brian in Payroll.

167
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,233
布莱是 ?
Is Brian...?

168
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,983
不 我不知道 重点是 如果你要撮合我跟某人
No. I don't know. The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone...

169
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,070
我比较喜欢 你把我和他那样的人配在一起
...I'd like to think you'd set me up with somebody like him.

170
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,781
我认为你配不上布莱恩
Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.

171
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,835
不好意思 你认为 我追不到布莱恩?
Excuse me. You don'tthink I could get a Brian?

172
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,092
因为我绝对可以追到布莱恩 相信我
Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me.

173
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,265
我真的不是同性恋
I'm really not.

174
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,726
这一件?
This one?

175
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,846
不好
No.

176
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,691
我已经给你们看过所有的衣服了
I've shown you every dress we have.

177
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,858
除非你们想让自己的母亲穿着柠檬黄色套装...
Unless you want you mother to spend eternity in a lemonyellow pantsuit...

178
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,232
不然就选紫红色
...go with the burgundy.

179
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:46,202
不管我们选什么 她都不会满意
Whatever we pick, she would've told us its the wrong one.

180
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,617
没错 那就选酒红色
You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.

181
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,617
选得好 我要出来了
A fine choice. I'm coming out.

182
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,542
等等 我们还需要鞋子
Wait. We need shoes.

183
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,507
好
Okay. Uh...

184
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,090
这些如何?
How about these?

185
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,467
那些是白天穿的鞋
That's really a day shoe.

186
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,808
那她去的地方每个人都穿着考究吗?
And where she's going, everyone else will be dressier?

187
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,307
可以看看有细跟的鞋吗?
Could we see something in a slimmer heel?

188
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:21,651
好了 我找不到紫红色的晚装鞋
Okay. I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy.

189
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,407
不过有双银色的鞋 或许适合
I can show you something in a silver that may work.

190
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,612
不行 一定要紫红色
No, it really should be burgundy.

191
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,159
除非我们挑另一件洋装      对
Unless we go with a different dress.        Yes.

192
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,373
不 不 不 我看看
No, no, no. Watch this.

193
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,836
等等 我可以在后面找找
Wait, I may have something in the back.

194
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,842
天啊
Oh, my God.

195
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,604
没事吧 亲爱的
Is everything all right, dear?

196
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,062
没事
Yeah. Yeah.

197
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,024
只是外婆的东西
Just Nana's stuff.

198
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,540
大家怎么样? 都好了吗?
How we doing? You guys ready?

199
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,539
妈早上已经打过电话提醒我不要把头发绑起来
Mom already called me this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up.

200
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,132
你知道我的耳朵不是我最漂亮的部位吗
Did you know my ears were not my best feature?

201
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,627
有段时间我是这样认为的
Some days it's all I can think about.

202
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,506
抱歉我迟到 我找不到方向了
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. I couldn't find my bearings.

203
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,591
你是说耳环吗?
Heh. You mean your earrings?

204
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,392
我说了什么?
What did I say?

205
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:36,612
就是这双鞋子吗? 
Are these the shoes?

206
00:13:36,612 --> 00:13:38,940
对，巴洛从意大利寄过来的
Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.

207
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:42,235
干嘛? 我们...我们这里没有鞋子 还是...
What? We, uh, don't have shoes here or...?

208
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,235
早上好 准备好出发了吗?
Morning. We ready to go?

209
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,448
穿戴整齐之后 我们看起来都很棒吧
Don't we look nice all dressed up?

210
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,453
就是这种话 是吧
It's stuff like that, isn't it?

211
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,502
真的是很棒的仪式      的确
It was a beautiful service.        It really was.

212
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,301
过来 亲爱的
Come here, sweetheart.

213
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,597
你知道 
You know...

214
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,643
我认为该是你 开始使用晚霜的时候了
I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.

215
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:26,817
干嘛?
What?

216
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:30,571
没什么 只是你的大衣很吵
Nothing. Just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Musburger.

217
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,370
你看看 巨人队对牛仔队
Check it out. Giants/Cowboys.

218
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,574
你在葬礼时看美式足球赛?
You're watching football at a funeral?

219
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:41,544
不 这只是赛前分析 待会在宴会上才要看
No，it's the pregame. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.

220
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,877
你真是个可怕的 可怕的人
You're a frightening, frightening man.

221
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,093
噢 不会吧 巴洛送的新鞋
Oh, no. My new Paolo shoes.

222
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,133
希望鞋没坏
Oh. I hope they're not ruined.

223
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,473
天啊 真是美好的一天
God, what a great day.

224
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,354
干嘛? 我是说天气
What? Weather-wise.

225
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,186
我知道
I know.

226
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,277
空气 还有树木
The air, the trees.

227
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:10,941
虽然外婆走了 但是...生命...
Even though Nana's gone, there's something almost, life...

228
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,906
罗斯 你没事吧      罗斯！
Ross, are you okay?        Ross!

229
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,495
我没事
I'm fine. No. I'm fine.

230
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,286
只是 
Just...

231
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,910
我最大的梦魇终于成真 不过…
having my worst fear realized, but...

232
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,341
不用担心 我只是看看 你是否肌肉痉挛
Don't worry. I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm.

233
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:35,564
怎么 怎么样   
What? What is it?

234
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:37,551
你的皮带环掉了一个
You missed a belt loop.

235
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,930
好了 是肌肉痉孪了
Okay, it's in spasm.

236
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,807
来了 亲爱的 给你
Here. sweetie. Here.

237

239
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,029

255
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,132
我无所谓
It doesn't matter to me.

256

你没说错
You were right.

257
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:07,315

不知道
No.

261
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,120

You.

262
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,242
噢 你没听懂
Oh, you don't get it.

Uh, just a, uh, hearing disability.

265
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:38,383
比分多少?
What's the score?

菲比 你可以拿块饼干给我吗?
Pheobe, could you maybe hand me a cracker?

269
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,323
你外婆一定不会喜欢的
Your grandmother would've hated this.

270
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,331
当然 这是她的葬礼
Well, sure. What with it being her funeral and all.

271
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,914
不 我会一直听到她说 
No,I'd be hearing about...

272
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,834
为什么没有蜜酿火腿?
...why didn't I get the honeyglazed ham?

273
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,676
或是我买的花不够 又或者是...
Or I didn't spend enough on flowers. If I spent more,she'd say...

274
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:20,304
何必浪费那么多钱? 我都死了
"Why waste your money? I don't need flowers,I'm dead."

275
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,931
听起来很像外婆的口气
That sounds like Nana.

276
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,974
你知道从小到大
Do you know what it's like to grow up...

277
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:31,934
和挑剔你每一句话的人生活在一起是什么滋味吗?
...with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?

278
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:35,732
我想像得到
I can imagine.

279
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,816
我告诉你 你妈妈我能变成
I tell you, it's a wonder your mother turned out...

280
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,194
这么乐观 积极向上的人 真是个奇迹
...to be the positive, life-affirming person she is.

281
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,990
是很神奇
That is a wonder.

282
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:54,377
妈 告诉我 如果可以重来
So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again...

283
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,671
如果此时此刻她在这里 
I mean, if she was here right now...

284
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,426
你会告诉她吗?
...would you tell her?

285
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,049
告诉她什么?
Tell her what?

286
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:07,010
她如何使你抓狂 挑剔每一件小事
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail.

287
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,303
譬如说你的头发
Like your hair, for example.

288
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,767
我不太懂你在说什么?
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.

289
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,821
你认为如果告诉她实情 情况会好一点吗?
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?

290
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,072
不会
No.

291
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,076
我认为某些事 还是不说会比较好
I think some things are better left unsaid.

292
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,201
家和万事兴
I think it's nicer when people just get along.

293
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:36,418
再来些酒吗
More wine, dear?

294
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,499
当然
Oh. I think so.

295
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,434
你戴这副耳环真好看
Those earrings look really lovely on you.

296
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,851
谢谢
Thank you.

297
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:54,933
是你的耳环
They're yours.

298
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,939
其实是外婆的
Actually, they were Nana's.

299
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,155
不
No!

300
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,362
真叫人难过
Now, I'm depressed.

301
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,040
比刚才还难过
Even more than I was.

302
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,837
这个裸体的小家伙是谁?
Hey, who's this little naked guy?

303
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,169
那个裸体的小家伙就是我
Uh, that little naked guy would be me.

304
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:28,007
看这小东西      没错
Look at the little thing.      Yes.

305
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,977
没关系 那是我的小弟弟
Yes, fine. That is my penis.

306
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,604
我们能成熟点儿吗?
Can we be grown-ups now?

307
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,808
这些人是谁?      考倒我了
Who are those people?        Got me.

308
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,649
中间那个是外婆
That's Nana right there in the middle.

309
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:42,901
我看看
Yeah, let's see.

310
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,821
我和大伙们摄于爪哇咖啡厅
"Me and the gang at Java Joe's."

311
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,197
莫妮卡 你看起来和你外婆好像
Wow. Monica, you look just like your grandmother.

312
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,616
她那时候几岁?
How old was she there?

313
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,663
看一下 1939年
Let's see. 1939.

314
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,995
24 25岁吧
Uh. Twenty four, twenty five.

315
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,078
看起来这帮人很开心
Huh. It looks like a fun gang.

316
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,133
你们快看 有莫妮卡裸体的照片
Ooh, look, look, look. I got Monica naked.

317
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,838
我看看
Let me see.

318
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,346
不 那个还是我
No, no. That would be me again.

319
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,566
我在尝试新事物
I'm, uh, just trying something.

320
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,780
嘿 罗威尔      嘿 钱德
Hey, Lowell.        Oh, hey, Chandler

321
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,459
金融服务处还好吗?
So how's it going in Financial Services?

322
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:41,001
简直是一团乱
It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads.

323
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,338
你们呢?
How about you?

324
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,507
很好 听着 
Good. Good. Listen, um, heh...

325
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,505
我不知道雪莉怎么跟你说我的事 但是…
I don't know what Shelly told you about me, but, uh...

326
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,008
我并不是
I'm not.

327
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,352
我知道 我也是这样跟她说的
I know. That's what I told her

328
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,972
真的吗?      对
Really?        Yeah.

329
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,099
你看得出来?
So you can tell?

330
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:06,356
八九不离十吧 大多数都可以 我们有种...雷达
Pretty much. Most of the time. We have a kind of radar...

331
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,067
所以你不认为我有... 
So you don't think I have...

332
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,281
那种特质?
quality?

333
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:16,115
代表男同志发言 我得说没有
Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no.

334
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,913
对了 你的朋友 出纳处的布莱恩? 他是同志
By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll? He is.

335
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,543
他是?      对
He is?        Yep.

336
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,670
而且你绝对配不上他
And way out of your league.

337
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,012
配不上他
Out of my league.

338
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:35,385
我可以追到布莱恩的 如果我愿意的话
I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian.

339
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,477
嘿 布莱
Hey, Brian.
