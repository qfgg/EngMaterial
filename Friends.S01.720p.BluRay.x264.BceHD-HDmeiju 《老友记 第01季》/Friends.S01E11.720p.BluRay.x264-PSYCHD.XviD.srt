00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:04,538
你觉得他们有昨天的《每日通讯》吗?
Do you think they have yesterday's Daily News ?

2
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:06,704
干嘛?      只是想看看我的星座命理...
Why?        I just wanna check my horoscope...

3
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:08,497
准不准
...see if it was right.

4
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:13,631
天啊 菲比 现在别回头看 你背后有个
Oh, my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but, behind you there' s a guy...

5
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,888
将会令我们伤心欲绝的帅哥
who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into depression.

6
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,515
在哪里?
Where?

7
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:21,101
到妈妈怀里来
Ooh, come to Mama.

8
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:24,104
他来了 酷一点
Okay, he's coming. Be cool. Be cool. Be cool.

9
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,560
帽子不错      谢谢
Nice hat.        Thanks.

10
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,935
我们应该有所行动 吹口哨      才不要
We should do something. Whistle.        We're not gonna whistle.

11
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,319
来吧 吹...      不
Yeah, come on, do it.        No.

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,481
快点...
Do it. Do it. Do it.

13
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,322
我不敢相信你居然做出这种事
I can't believe you did that.

14

字幕编辑：阿 汨

18
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,292
我为什么会叫 "呜呼"?
Why did I "woohoo"?

19
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,878
难道我期望会发生什么? 期待他回头说
I mean, what was I hoping? He'd turn around and say:

20
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,213
"我喜欢那声音 我现在就要你"?
"Ooh, I love that sound. I must have you now"?

21
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,464
我只希望我们能帮上一点忙
I just wish there was something we could do.

22
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,475
你好 昏迷的帅哥
Hello. Hello, coma guy.

23
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,397
起来 你这个娘娘腔 起来...
Get up, you Girl Scout! Up, up, up!

24
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,149
菲比 你在干什么?      或许没有人试过这一招
Phoebe, what are you doing?        Maybe nobody's tried this.

25
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,362
希望我们至少能知道他的名字
I wish we at least knew his name.

26
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,032
瞧他这张脸
Look at that face.

27
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:03,286
即使在昏迷中 他仍一副聪明样 我猜他是个律师
I mean even sleeping he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.

28
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,425
但是 你有看见他手关节上的凹痕吗? 
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles?

29
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:06,915
那代表他有艺术细胞
That means he's artistic.

30
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:11,579
好 他是个兼职教雕塑的律师
Okay. He's a lawyer who teaches sculpting on the side.

31
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,418
而且他会跳舞
And he can dance.

32
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:18,218
他是那种会静静听你讲话的人
And he's the kind of guy who, when you're talking, he's listening...

33
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,720
不会说 "对 我了解"
you know, and not saying, "Yeah, I understand."

34
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,803
却想着你裸体的样子      别说了
but wondering what you look like naked.        Oh, stop it.

35
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,762
我希望男生都像他这样
I wish all guys could be like him.

36
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:31,974
我知道
I know.

37
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,781
难道纽约没有适合你们的清醒男生?
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?

38
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:44,203
他身旁没人照顾      我们觉得应该负起责任
He doesn't have anyone.        Yeah. We feel kind of responsible.

39
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,493
我不敢相信你会喊 "呜呼"
I can't believe you said "Woohoo".

40
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,575
连我都不说 "呜呼"
I don't even say "Woohoo".

41
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,459
喔 她出现了
Oh. She's coming up. She's coming up.

42
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,665
各位 稍后...
Folks, when we come back...

43
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,921
我们将和风趣的诺拉泰勒宾来聊一聊...
We'II talk about her new book Euphoria Unbound ...

44
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,613
她的新书《无捆绑的快感》
...with always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.

45
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:58,676
你得叫你的孩子上床睡觉了
You may want to put the kids to bed for this one.

46
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,112
我们别看这个
We don't have to watch this.

47
00:03:00,112 --> 00:03:02,463
其他电影台有《老板度假去》等许多好电影
Weekend at Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO and Cinemex.

48
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:05,678
不行      拜托 她是你妈妈耶!
No way.        Come on. She's your mom.

49
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,934
所以才要看《老板度假去》
Exactly. Weekend at Bernie's.

50
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,721
死人的裤档部分被打几十次 很有看头
Dead guy getting hit in the groin 20, 30 times.

51
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,557
不看吗?      钱德 我得告诉你
No?        Chandler, I gotta tell you...

52
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,147
我爱你妈写的书
I love your moms' books. I love her books.

53
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,154
飞机上不能没有她的书的陪伴 她的书太酷了
I cannot get on a plane without one. I mean, this is so cool.

54
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,360
你不会觉得酷的 如果当你11岁的时候
You wouldn't think it's cool if you were 11.

55
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:25,699
你的朋友们争相传阅 《情妇婊子》的第79页
...and all your friends were passing around page 79 of Mistress Bitch.

56
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,867
拜托 钱德 我爱你妈 她是最棒的！
Come on, Chandler. I love your mom. I think she's a blast.

57
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,079
你当然这么说 她又不是你妈      拜托 她是...
You can say that. She's not your mom.        Oh, please. She's the...

58
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,586
亲爱的
Hi, sweetie.

59
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,128
那个意大利通心粉 什么时候从罗马回来的?
When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?

60
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,002
昨晚      真的?
Last night.        Really?

61
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,468
难道他的飞机没在空中炸成火球?
So then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?

62
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,598
只是我做的一个梦
Just a dream I had.

63
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,555
但...
But, phew.

64
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,308
快看 快看 她出现了!
Hey, hey, hey. She's on.

65
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,562
诺拉宾
Ah. Nora Bing.

66
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,069
等会儿再谈你的书吧
Before we get to the book.

67
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,356
听说你在伦敦被逮捕?
What is this about you being arrested in London? What is that about?

68
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:06,952
你妈被逮捕?      嘘 我正感到无比骄傲呢
Your mom was arrested?        Shhh, I'm busy beaming with pride.

69
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,112
说来有点难为情...
This is kind of embarrassing...

70
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:13,500
有时我在和一个男人亲热后...
...but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man.

71
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,954
她怎会说难为情?
Why would she say that's embarrassing?

72
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:20,541
我非常想吃宫保鸡丁
I just get this craving for Kung Pao chicken.

73
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,176
透露太多了!
That's too much information.

74
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,467
现在你正忙着为新书做宣传 进展如何?
So now you're doing this book tour thing. How's that going?

75
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:33,728
还不错 明天我将前往纽约 虽然我不太想去
Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate.

76
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,140
但我的儿子住那儿 我爱他
But I get to see my son, who I love.

77
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,854
我只能从电视上知道      一般的妈妈都会打电话
This is the way that I find out.        Most moms use the phone.

78
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:46,025
别误会 只是我无法把你与母亲这个词联系起来
You know, don't take this wrong, I just don't see you as a mom somehow.

79
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:50,162
我绝对没有恶意      不 我是个很棒的妈妈
I don't mean that bad.        Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom.

80
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,782
我儿子的第一盒保险套 是我买给他的
I bought my son his first condoms.

81
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,172
然后他就欲火焚身
And then he burst into flames.

82
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:14,136
国会正讨论新削减预算赤字法案
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficitreduction bill.

83
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,600
市长想再度提高地铁票价
The mayor wants to raise subway fares again.

84
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,399
今天最高气温是45华氏度
The high today was 45.

85
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,685
还有各球队正在比赛
And, oh. And teams played sports.

86
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,010
叫格伦如何?
What about Glen?

87
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,221
可以叫他格伦      不 还不够特别
He could be a Glen.        Not...not special enough.

88
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,849
亚格曼侬怎么样?
Ooh, how about Agamemnon?

89
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,934
太特别了
Way too special.

90
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,736
我饿死了 我想吃什么呢?
I'm famished. What do I want?

91
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,244
拜托 别又是宫保鸡丁
Please God. Don't let it be Kung Pao chicken.

92
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:16,327
你看了那节目 感觉如何?
Oh, you watched the show. What did you think?

93
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,618
我觉得你应该更放开一些...
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.

94
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,629
怎么是这种地方?
What is this dive?

95
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,792
只有你才会选这种地方
Only you could've picked this place.

96
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,335
闭嘴 这里很有意思
Come on. Shut up. It's fun.

97
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,003
嗨      抱一个
Hi.        Give me a hug.

98
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,925
我想我们现在可以喝点龙舌酒了
Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.

99
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:33,969
我知道我可以
I know I am.

100
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,725
谁要来点儿?      我要
Who's doing shots?        Hit me.

101
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,557
我也来      这是你的 罗斯?
I'm in.        There you go. Ross?

102
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,643
我不太喝烈酒
Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kind of guy.

103
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,523
抱歉 我们迟到了
Hi. Sorry. Sorry we're late.

104
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:46,312
我们有点忘了时间
We. uh, kind of just you know, lost track of time.\

105
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,649
但是人可以改变
But a man can change.

106
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,823
有人要我赞扬任何事物吗?
Anyone want me to appraise anything?

107
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,171
宾太太 我得告诉你 我拜读过你所有的大作
Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written.

108
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,556
我说真的 我读过《午夜快感》后
No, I mean it. When I read Euphoria at Midnight...

109
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,466
就一心想成为作家
...all I wanted to do was become a writer.

110
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,478
别这么说 我能办到大家都能办到
Oh, please, honey. If I can do it, anybody can.

111
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,347
你只需要先描述几个欧洲城市
You just start with half a dozen European cities...

112
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,982
然后以各种委婉的方式形容男性生殖器
...throw in 30 euphemisms for male genitalia..

113
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,860
这样就能写成一本书了
...and bam! You have got yourself a book.

114
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,572
各位 这就是我妈妈
My mother, ladies and gentlemen.

115
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,696
226房有留言吗?
Yeah, any messages for room 226?

116
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,247
你还好吧 猛男?      我还好
You okay, slugger?        Oh, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

117
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,589
你今晚是怎么了?
What is with you tonight?

118
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,726
没什么...
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.

119
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,932
好 谢谢
Okay, thank you.

120
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,521
是因为那个意大利舔手男 对吧?
It's the Italian handlicker. Isn'tit?

121
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,570
不 是因为被他舔的人
No. It's the one he's licking.

122
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,147
她应该和你在一起
She's supposed to be with you.

123
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,366
你真行
You're good.

124
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:20,163
罗斯 听我说 我卖出上亿本的书
Oh Ross. Listen to me. I have sold 100 million copies of my books...

125
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,413
你知道为什么吗?
...and you know why?

126
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,575
因为封面上的辣妹露两点?
The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?

127
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:31,417
不 因为我知道该如何描写 让女人陷入爱河的男人
No, because I know how to write men that women fall in love with.

128
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,585
相信我 巴洛没有卖点
Believe me I cannot sell a Paolo.

129
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,051
没人有兴趣翻325页 去看巴洛的罗曼史
People will not turn 325 pages for a Paolo.

130
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,965
他不过是个二等货
Come on. The guy's a secondary character.

131
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:42,978
不过是最后被你终结的纠葛
He's just a...You know, a complication you eventually kill off.

132
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,515
什么时候?
When?

133
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,360
他不是女人心中的英雄
He's not a hero.

134
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,196
知道我们心中的英雄是谁吗?
You know who our hero is?

135
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,070
封面上露两点的猛男?
The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?

136
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,401
不 是你！
No, it's you.

137
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,195
拜托      不 我是说真的
Please.        No, really.

138
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,580
你既聪明又性感
Come on. You're smart. You're sexy.

139
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,165
真的      是呀
Right.        Oh, come on, kiddo.

140
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,998
你会没事的 相信我
You're gonna be fine. Believe me.

141
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,729
我到街上尿就好了
Uh, I'll just pee in the street.

142
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,281
钱德在吗?
Is Chandler here?

143
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,367
在      等等 过来
Yeah.        Wait. Come here.

144
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,407
昨天晚上的事...
Okay, uh, about last night...

145
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,167
你知道的...
um, you know...

146
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,294
你没有告诉钱德吧?
Chandler. You didn't tell...

147
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,498
因为我想我们不需要告诉钱德
Okay, I'm thinking we don't need to tell Chandler.

148
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,961
只是个吻 没什么大不了的 对吧?
It was just a kiss. One kiss. No big deal, right?

149
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,047
对 没什么大不了的      没错
Right. No big deal.        Okay.

150
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,928
才怪
In Bizarro world.

151
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,558
你违反规定
You broke the code.

152
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,686
什么规定?      不能亲朋友妈妈的规定
What code?        You don't kiss your friend's mom.

153
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,519
姊妹还可以 火辣的姑妈或许也行
Sisters are okay. Maybe a hot-looking aunt.

154
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,684
妈妈不行 绝对不行
But not a mom. Never a mom.

155
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,647
你们在外面干什么?
What are you guys doing out here?

156
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:21,694
乔和我说过要早起去打壁球
Uh, well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game.

157
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,247
显然有人睡过头了
But, um, apparently somebody overslept.

158
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,119
对 你没带球拍?
Yeah, well, you don't have your racquet.

159
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,412
对 我的拍子拿去修理了
No. No, I don't, because it's being restrung.

160
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,377
有人应该帮我准备一支拍子的
Ahem. Somebody was supposed to bring me one.

161
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:39,340
是吗? 你又没说握把的尺寸
Yeah. Well, you didn't call and leave your grip size.

162
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,808
你们俩时间还真多
Okay, you guys are spending way too much time together.

163
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,350
好吧 我是人渣 我是人渣
Okay, I'm scum. I'm scum.

164
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,981
罗斯 你怎能让这种事发生?      我也不知道
Ross, how could you let this happen?        I don't know.

165
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:56,191
她不像是一般的妈妈 她很性感
Well, it's not like she's a regular mom. You know? She's sexy. She's...

166
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,480
你认为我妈不性感?
You don't think my mom's sexy?

167
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,525
不一样的性感
Well, not in the same way.

168
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,615
我得让你知道 葛洛莉雅崔比亚尼...
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani...

169
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,280
当年也是美到不行
...was a handsome woman in her day, all right?

170
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,292
你认为生七个小孩 是件容易的事吗?
You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?

171
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,464
我想我们越谈越离谱了
Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here.

172
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,000
嗨      嗨
Hey.        Hey.

173
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:23,468
你们在这干什么?      不是打壁球
What are you guys doing out here?        Well, ha, ha, not playing racquetball.

174
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,677
他忘了告诉我握把尺寸      他没带眼罩
He forgot to leave his grip size.        He didn't get the goggles.

175
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,686
没错
Oh. Right.

176
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,520
你们似乎有点争执
Well, sounds like you two have issues.

177
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,232
再见 宝贝
Goodbye, baby.

178
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,532
他们是不是故意在我面前 做这件事?
Do they wait for me to do this?

179
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,533
你到底要不要告诉他?      才不要告诉他
So are you gonna tell him?        I'm not gonna tell him.

180
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,202
为何要告诉他?      如果你不说
Why would I tell him?        How about, because if you dont...

181
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,245
他妈或许会...
...his mother might?

182
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,543
你们在这里干什么?
What are you guys doing here?

183
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,839
他没穿护档
Uh, he's not even wearing a jock strap.

184
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,266
我刚问什么?
What did I ask?

185
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,443
嗨      嗨
Hi.        Hi.

186
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,446
你在这里干什么?
What are you doing here?

187
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,453
没事 我只是顺路...
Nothing. I just thought I'd stop by, you know, after the, um...

188
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,330
...你知道的 你来这里干什么?
That I, you know. Um, so, what are you doing here?

189
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,167
我不是专程来此
I'm not really here.

190
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:39,957
只是顺路拿这些过来
I just thought I'd drop these off on the way. My way.

191
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,553
你常...
Do you, um, come here a lot...

192
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,255
一个人来?
...without me?

193
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,220
没有...
No, no, no.

194
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:56,188
你认为他早上有好一点吗?
So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?

195
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,314
我怎么会知道? 我又没来
How would I know? I wasn't here.

196
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,946
真的吗? 也没替他换睡衣?
Really? Not even to, um, change his pajarnas?

197
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:08,822
哦 天啊
Oh, my God.

198
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,864
你是我朋友 我得告诉你
You're my friend. I had to tell you.

199
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,781
我真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

200
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,034
巴洛亲了我妈?
Paolo kissed my mom?

201
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,671
对 我不知道你是否注意到 他喝了很多酒
Yeah, I mean, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink.

202
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,499
他酒醉的模样你也见识过
I mean, you know how he gets when he's drunk.

203
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,261
我办不到...是我
I can't do this. I did it.

204
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,969
抱歉 是我亲了你妈
It was me. I'm sorry. I kissed your mom.

205
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,761
什么?
What?

206
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,474
瑞秋和巴洛的事令我很沮丧 我想我是喝太多酒
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo and I think I had too much tequila.

207
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,765
诺拉 妈妈太太 宾妈...
and Nora, Mrs. Mom, your Bing, was...

208
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,149
只是对我很体贴 但没发生什么事
She was just being nice, you know? But nothing happened.

209
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,939
什么都没有 可以问乔伊 乔伊刚好走进来
Nothing. Ask Joey. Joey came in.

210
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,823
你知道这件事吗?
You knew about this?

211
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,201
知识是很难懂的
You know, knowledge is a tricky thing.

212
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,951
我们一起待了一天 你为何没告诉我?
I spent the entire day with you. Why didn't you tell me?

213
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,116
嘿...他们被我逮到算你幸运
Hey, hey. You're lucky I caught them when I did...

214
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,159
不然后果可不堪设想
...or else who knows what would have happened?

215
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,828
谢了 老兄 帮了大忙
Thanks, man. Big help.

216
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,455
我真不敢相信 你到底在想什么?
I can't believe this. What the hell were you thinking?

217
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,749
我没有...我不知道
I wasn't. I don't know.

218
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:08,260
我和我妈之间的那些事 朋友中属你最清楚了
Of all my friends, no one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.

219
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,763
我知道      我无法相信你会做这种事
I know.        I can't believe you did this.

220
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,219
我也无法相信      我还在气你没告诉我
Me neither.        I'm still mad at you for not telling me.

221
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,761
为什么生我的气啊?      就让我用力关门吧
What are you mad at me?        Let me slam the door.

222
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,143
钱德 我没亲她 是他
Chandler, I didn't kiss her. He did.

223
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,148
违反规定就是这种下场
See what happens when you break the code?

224
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,184
乔伊
Joey.

225
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,704
瑞秋      嗨
Rachel.        Hey.

226
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,037
"《丢脸的女人》 作者 瑞秋凯伦葛林"
"A Woman Undone. By Rachel Karen Green."

227
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,624
对 我想尝试一下 我仍在写第一章
Yeah, I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter.

228
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:46,963
你认为他"粗棉布监牢"中的"爱棒" 能获得解放吗?
Now, do you think his "lovestick" can be "liberatedfrom its denimprison"?

229
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,712
我想可以吧
Yeah, I'd say so.

230
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,132
另外 你拼错这个词了
And there's no "J" in "engorged".

231
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,181
嘿 瑞秋      嗨
Hey, Rachel.        Hey.

232
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,095
你好      你好
Hello.        Hello.

233
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,265
你今晚要去医院吗?      没有 你呢?
You going to the hospital tonight?        No. You?

234
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,103
没有 你呢?
No. You?

235
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,650
你刚问过了
You just asked me.

236
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,907
好吧 或许这是个圈套
Okay, maybe it was a trick question.

237
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,870
瑞秋 我们现在能开始了吗?      好
Um, Rachel. Can we do this now?        Okay.

238
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,245
我好兴奋呀
I am so hot.

239
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,503
这是我爸妈在婚礼上照的
And here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day.

240
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,506
你告诉我 她是不是个美女
Now, you tell me she's not a knockout.

241
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,951
没想到我们会谈论这个
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.

242
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,803
就试着想像她没挺着大肚子
Come on, just try to picture her not pregnant. That's all.

243
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:38,384
中央咖啡厅很荣幸 为各位介绍菲比布非小姐
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.

244
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,763

Thanks.

245
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,689
嗨 好
Hi, um. Okay.

246
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,189
这首歌是关于一个我刚认识的男生
I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met...

247
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,571
但他已成为我生命中重要的男人
who's, um, come to be very important to me.

248
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,192
好
Okay.

249
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:00,657
你无须醒来当我的男人
You don't have to be awake to be my man.

250
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:07,877
只要你一息尚存 我就会在一旁守候
Long as you have brain waves, I'll be there to hold your hand.

251
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,714
虽然我们相遇不久
Though we just met the other day.

252
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:15,176
我想说...
There's something I have got to say...

253
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,304
谢谢各位 我得休息一下
Okay, thank you very much. I'm gonna take a short break.

254
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,227
感谢菲比布非小姐
Okay, that was Phoebe Buflay, everybody. Whoo!

255
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,186
她在搞什么东西?      菲比刚开始...
What the hell was that?        Phoebe just started...

256
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,981
我是和乔伊讲话 亲老妈的人
Believe I was talking to Joey. All right, there, mother-kisser?

257
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,112
"亲老妈的人"
"Mother-kisser."

258
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,744
我闭嘴
I'll shut up.

259
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,581
钱德 我知道你仍在生我的气
Chandler, can I say something? I know you're still mad at me.

260
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,963
我只想说 那一夜有两个人
I just wanna say that there were two people there that night, okay?

261
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,045
两双嘴唇      是 我预料到她会如此
There were two sets of lips.        Yes, well, I expect this from her.

262
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,962
她一直都是个佛洛依德梦魇
Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.

263
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,347
如果她一直这样 你为何不找她谈谈?
Okay, but if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?

264
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,385
因为太复杂了 一团乱
Because it's complicated. It's complex.

265
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,223
喂 你亲了我妈
Hey, you kissed my mom.

266
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,434
我们正在排练希腊剧
We're rehearsing a Greek play.

267
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,566
真幽默 排练完了吗?      没有
That's funny. We done now?        No.

268
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,982
你不找她谈? 不说出你的感受?
Okay, you mean you're not gonna talk to her tell her how you feel?

269
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,448
不 别因为你亲过她...
That would be a no. Look. Just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom...

270
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,830
就自以为了解她 相信我 不能找她谈
...doesn't mean you know her, all right? Trust me, you can't talk to her.

271
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,366
到底是能还是不能?
Okay. "You can't? Or you can't?"

272
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:30,963
好 我的手指 我的膝盖
Okay, that's my finger. Okay, that's my knee.

273
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,919
还在排练
Still doing the play.

274
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,766
你对他做什么了?
All right, what did you do with him?

275
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,935
你醒了      瞧瞧你
You're awake.        Look at you.

276
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,099
感觉如何?
How do you feel?

277
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:53,361
头有点晕 基本上还行
Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.

278
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,567
你的气色好极了
Gosh, you look good.

279
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,527
我感觉好极了
I feel good.

280
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,901
你们是谁?
Who are you?

281
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,740
对不起      我叫菲比布非
Sorry.        I'm Phoebe Buffay.

282
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,496
我叫莫妮卡盖勒 我一直在照顾你
I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.

283
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:05,656
我们一直在照顾你
We both have.

284
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,827
雕刻艺术品是你们送的?      其实只有我一个
So the Etch-A-Sketch is from you guys?         Actually, it's just from me.

285
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,042
我替你做脚底按摩
Yeah, I got you the foot massager.

286
00:18:10,442 --> 00:18:11,916
知道是谁帮你刮胡子的吗? 是我
You know who shaved you? That was me.

287
00:18:12,316 --> 00:18:14,003
我念书给你听      我唱歌给你听
I read to you.        I sang.

288
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:18,050
谢了
Well, thanks.

289
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,675
我的荣幸      不客气
Oh, my pleasure.        You're welcome.

290
00:18:20,675 --> 00:18:23,925
那好 再见了
So I guess I'll see you around.

291
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:25,999
什么? 就这样?
What? That's it?

292
00:18:26,863 --> 00:18:28,300
"再见"?
"See you around"?

293
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:32,213
不然要我说什么?      我不知道
Well, what do you want me to say?        Well, I don't know.

294
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:33,718
或许该说
Maybe...

295
00:18:33,972 --> 00:18:35,257
"你真好"
"That was nice."

296
00:18:35,432 --> 00:18:36,888
"这对我来讲意义重大"
"It meant something to me."

297
00:18:38,143 --> 00:18:40,008
"我会打电话给你"
"I'll call you."

298
00:18:40,729 --> 00:18:44,187
好吧 我会打给你      一点诚意都没有
All right. I'll call you.        I don't think you mean that.

299
00:18:47,444 --> 00:18:49,526
典型的男人
This is so typical.

300
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:50,811
我们付出
You know, we give...

301
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:52,445
付出
...and we give...

302
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:54,152
不断的付出
...and we give.

303
00:18:54,326 --> 00:18:56,612
却得不到任何回报
And then we just get nothing back.

304
00:18:56,787 --> 00:19:00,621
有一天他醒来 却只说"再见"
And then one day, it's just, you know, you wake up and "See you around."

305
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:04,699
走吧 菲比
Let's go, Phoebe.

306
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:09,037
知道吗? 我们以为你与众不同
You know what? We thought you were different.

307
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:11,502
不过我想这只是昏迷的缘故
But I guess it was just the coma.

308
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:17,754
楼下的车已发动
The car's running downstairs.

309
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:20,390
我只想拿几本我的书给你朋友
I wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends.

310
00:19:21,353 --> 00:19:22,675
需要我在里斯本帮你买什么吗? 
Anything you want from Lisbon?

311
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:25,722
不需要 知道你要去就够了
No, just knowing you're there is enough.

312
00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:29,976
好吧 要乖哦 我爱你
All right. Well, be good. I love you.

313
00:19:32,697 --> 00:19:34,278
你亲了我最要好的罗斯
You kissed my best Ross.

314
00:19:37,202 --> 00:19:38,692
好像说错了 反正差不多
Or something to that effect.

315
00:19:39,871 --> 00:19:41,987
好吧
Okay.

316
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:47,792
我做了蠢事
Look, it was stupid.

317
00:19:47,963 --> 00:19:50,329
愚蠢至极      愚蠢至极
Really stupid.        Really stupid.

318
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:54,841
我也不知道是怎么发生的
And I don't even know how it happened.

319
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:58,879
抱歉 孩子 我保证不会再发生这种事
I'm sorry, honey. I promise it will never happen again.

320
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:03,183
我们没事吧?      没事
Are we okay now?        Yeah.

321
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:06,644
不...
No. No.

322
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:13,105
男人与门之间禁忌的爱
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.

323
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:18,611
他说了 不只是亲吻的事 一切都说出来了
He did it. He told her off. And not just about the kiss, about everything.

324
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:19,820
开玩笑吧?      没有
You're kidding?        No.

325
00:20:19,995 --> 00:20:22,657
他说 "你何时才能成熟 开始有个妈的样子?"
He said, "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"

326
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:24,912
等等 她回答说
Wait. Then she came back with:

327
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:29,619
"问题是 你何时才能长大 了解我有大屁股?"
"The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realize I have a bomb?"

328
00:20:31,506 --> 00:20:33,246
等等 你确定她不是说
Okay, wait. Are you sure she didn't say:

329
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:37,259
你何时才能长大了解 我是你妈吗?"
"When are you gonna grow up and realize I am your mom?"

330
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:42,973
这样比较说得通      你也这样认为吗?
That makes more sense.        You think?

331
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:44,679
是啊
Yeah.

332
00:20:45,437 --> 00:20:46,927
现在情况怎么样?
So, what's going on now?

333
00:20:47,105 --> 00:20:50,142
我不知道 我一直在这里说给你听
I don't know. I've been standing here spelling it out for you.

334
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:54,480
我什么都听不到 等等...
I don't hear anything. Wait, wait, wait.

335
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:55,860
你看见什么?
What do you see?

336
00:20:56,031 --> 00:20:58,443
很难说 他们好小而且上下颠倒
It's hard to tell. They're so tiny and upside down.

337
00:20:58,617 --> 00:20:59,948
等等 等等
Wait, wait, wait.

338
00:21:00,118 --> 00:21:03,531
他们走过来 他们走过去
They're walking away. They're walking away.

339
00:21:03,705 --> 00:21:07,118
不 不是 他们走过来了 快逃
No, they're not. They're coming right at us. Run. Run!

340
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:10,951
你还好吧 孩子?
You okay, kiddo?

341
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:14,371
还好      当个乖孩子
Yeah, I'm okay.        All right. You be good.

342
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:16,289
注意安全
Drive safe.

343
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:20,926
你好 宾太太      你好 盖勒先生
Mrs. Bing.        Mr. Geller.

344
00:21:25,977 --> 00:21:27,342
嗨
Hey.

345
00:21:29,272 --> 00:21:30,762
你当真?
You mean that?

346
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:33,606
对 有何不可?
Yeah, why not?

347
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,026
我告诉她了
So I told her.

348
00:21:37,739 --> 00:21:39,730
情况怎么样?      简直太糟了
How did it go?        Awful. Awful.

349
00:21:39,908 --> 00:21:41,819
没有比这更糟糕的
Couldn't have gone worse.

350
00:21:42,577 --> 00:21:45,410
感觉怎样      不错
Well, how do you feel?        Pretty good.

351
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:48,989
我告诉她了
I told her.

352
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:51,158
瞧 看到没有?
Well, see?

353
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:55,500
或许我亲你妈不是个坏主意...
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, you know, me kissing your mom, huh?

354
00:21:55,674 --> 00:21:58,165
不过我们不必继续往下说了吧
But we don't have to go down that road.

355
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:06,805
这只是第一章
Now, this is just the first chapter...

356
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:12,097
我要大家坦白的意见
and I want your absolute honest opinion. Okay?

357
00:22:12,357 --> 00:22:16,976
在第二页中他的手没伸向 她那"尖挺"的双峰
Oh, and on page two, he's not reaching for her "heaving beasts".

358
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:19,109
什么是"乳头"?
What's a "nifile"?

359
00:22:19,364 --> 00:22:22,276
通常你在尖挺的双峰上可以找到
You can usually find them on the heaving beasts.

360
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:26,652
好吧...算我不会打字
All right, all right, so I'm not a great typist.

361
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:30,869
你有看到这句吗 "他这只巨大 跳动的笔"?
Wait, did you get to the part about his "huge, throbbing pens"?

362
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,952
他写作时你可得离远一点
Tell you, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those.

363
00:22:36,172 --> 00:22:38,254
好了 别看了 还给我      不
All right, that's it. Give them back.        No.

364
