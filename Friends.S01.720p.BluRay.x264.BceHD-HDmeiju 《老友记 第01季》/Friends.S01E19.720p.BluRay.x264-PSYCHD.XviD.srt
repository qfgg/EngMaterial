You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you?

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,894

好孩子 好孩子 过来 拿饭给我

谢谢你 真乖
Thank you. Good boy.

31
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,893
我看他总算能弄清 
Well I see, he's mastered the difference between 

32
00:02:15,894 --> 00:02:18,752
"拿来"跟"尿在"的分别了
"bring me the" and "pee in the".

33
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,300
"拿来"和 瑞秋
"Bring me the" and Rach?

34
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,263
什么事      嗨
What?         Hi.

35
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,330
对不起
Oh, I'm sorry. 

36
00:02:28,352 --> 00:02:30,730
我真傻
Oh, this is so stupid.

37
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,187
是我甩掉巴瑞的 不是吗      嗯
I mean, I gave Barry up, right?        Hmm.

38
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,273
我应该为他们感到高兴
I should be happy for them.

39
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,688
我的确为他们感到高兴
I am. I'm happy for them.

40
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,447
真的吗      假的
Really?        No.

41
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:44,408
我想 要是我身边有了别人 感觉就不一样了
Oh, oh, I guess it would be different If I were with somebody.

42
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:50,455
喔 你不是说过 不要再谈恋爱了
Whoa, what, what happened to "Forget relationships".

43
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:54,338
不再和男人在一起 你的禁欲令呢
"I'm done with men"? The whole penis embargo?

44
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,086
我也说不清
Oh, I don't know.

45
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,254
我想应该不是说完全不要男人
I guess it's not about no guys.

46
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,764
而是要找到对的男人 你明白吗      嗯
It's about the right guy, you know?        Hmm.

47
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,001
跟巴瑞在一起 
I mean with Barry 

48
00:03:06,003 --> 00:03:08,973
感觉很安全自在 但是没有激情
it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat.

49
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,809
跟巴洛就只有激情
You know, with Paolo, that's all there was, was heat.

50
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:15,225
就是那种野兽般原始的性爱
And I mean, it was just this raw animal sexual...

51
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,690
好了 好了 我明白了
Right, right. I got it.

52
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,862
我看在眼里
I was there.

53
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,448
你觉得有没有可能两者兼有
I mean, do you think you can ever have both?

54
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,076
就是那种 是知己
You know, someone who's like your best friend

55
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,613
同时又能让你激情荡漾的人
but then also can make your toes curl.

56
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,281
了解 了解
Yes, yes.

57
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,417
真的 我完全了解
Yes. Yes I do. I really do.

58
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,168
其实 好玩的是
In fact, it's funny.

59
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:38,378
通常你认为那个不会让你
Very often, someone who you wouldn't think could.

60
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,875
激情荡漾的人
curl your toes...

61
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,762
可能就是那个      嗨 
might just be the one who...        Hi!

62
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,218
被打断了 嗨
gets interrupted. Hi!

63
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,179
嘿 电影好看吗
Hey guys, how was the movie?

64
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,114
太棒了      非常好看
Oh, so wonderful.         Oh, it was so good.

65
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,100
烂到爆      只有女生才会去看
Suck fest.         Total chick flick.

66
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,317
很抱歉那不是那种
I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies

67
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,819
有枪有炮
with like, you know, like guns and bombs...

68
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,276
或是巴士开超快的电影
and like buses going really fast.

69
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,403
喂 我喜欢的电影 不一定要有暴力
Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie.

70
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,446
只要有一些裸露镜头就够了
Just so long as there's a little nudity.

71
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,866
有裸露镜头啊      我是说女性的裸露镜头
There was nudity.        I meant female nudity.

72
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,794
我可不想看路格兰特的前戏
All right, I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.

73
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,669
休 休・格兰特
Hugh, Hugh Grant.

74
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,676
好了 我该走了
All right, I've got to go.

75
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,428
过来 马塞尔 过来
Come on, Marcel. Come on.

76
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,717
我们要去洗澡 
Yeah, we're gonna go take a bath. 

77
00:04:26,718 --> 00:04:29,433
对不对 对啊 我们要洗澡哦 好不好
Yes, we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.

78
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,427
他们仍然只是朋友 对吧
They're still just friends, right?

79
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,316
我们明天见
And I will see you tomorrow.

80
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,570
没错 明天你要来瑞秋阿姨这边待一天 对不对
That's right. You're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you?

81
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,007
等一下 等一下 摩妮卡阿姨有没有权利说话
Hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?

82
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,659
拜托啦 摩妮卡阿姨 好不好
Please, Aunt Monica, please?

83
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,865
拜托 放轻松 明天你根本就不在
Oh, unclench, you're not even gonna be here.

84
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,287
真不敢相信我们居然在讨论这种事
I can not believe we're even having this discussion.

85
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,629
同意 我也不敢相信
I agree. I'm like in disbelief.

86
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,464
你不觉得 如果你跟瑞秋能在一起 
I mean, don't you think, if things were gonna happen with Rachel, 

87
00:05:05,465 --> 00:05:06,628
你们早就在一起了
they would've happened already?

88
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,469
我告诉你们 她说她想要跟
I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship

89
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,304
像我这样的人谈恋爱
with someone exactly like me.

90
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,184
她真的这么说
She really said that?

91
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,562
"像我这样的" 是我自己加的
Well, I added the "exactly like me" part.

92
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,700
但是她说她在找个好男人 
But she said she's looking for someone. 

93
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:21,086
好男人今晚就会出现
And someone is gonna be there tonight.

94
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,690
今晚 你是说真的
"Tonight" tonight?

95
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,753
我想这一定会很完美 
Well, I think it's perfect, you know? 

96
00:05:24,754 --> 00:05:25,901
只有我们两个
It's just gonna be the two of us.

97
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,443
她整天都在照顾我的猴子
She spent all day taking care of my monkey.

98
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,113
我都不记得上次有女生
I can't remember the last time I got a girl

99
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:35,290
照顾我的猴子是什么时候的事了
to take care of my monkey.

100
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,915
反正 我想下班后 
Anyway, you know, I figured after work 

101
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,837
我去买一瓶酒
I'd go pick up a bottle of wine.

102
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,548
然后过去向她求爱
Go over there and try to woo her.

103
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,638
你知道你应该怎么做吗
Hey, you know what you should do?

104
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,725
你应该带她回到19世纪末 
You should take her back to the 1890s 

105
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:54,347
当时还有人使用那种字眼
when that phrase was last used.

106
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,435
如果你坚持下去
If you keep this up, honey

107
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,272
不到周末 你和那个浑蛋就一起玩完了
I swear you'll be finished with this sucker by the end of the week.

108
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,654
那个围着羽绒围巾的是法兰西斯医生
Now, now the one in the feathered boa, that's Dr. Francis.

109
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,237
她以前是个男人
Now, she used to be a man.

110
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:13,029
你看 那是瑞文 我们讨厌她
Okay, oh look. See now there's Raven. We hate her.

111
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,946
很高兴她快死了
We're glad she's dying.

112
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,745
然后 怎么了 马塞尔
And then What? What? Marcel!

113
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,137
你在玩摩妮卡的鞋子吗 
Are you playing with Monica's shoes? 

114
00:06:20,138 --> 00:06:21,332
你知道你不可以
You know you're not supposed to...

115
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:24,332
哇喔
Whao!

116
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,550
马塞尔 你是不是在鞋子里大便了
Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?

117
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,838
马塞尔 坏猴子 噢
Oh, Marcel. Bad monkey. Oh!

118
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,223
天啊 
Oh, God!

119
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,884
噢
Oh!

120
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,350
抱歉 巴瑞
Sorry, Barry.

121
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,516
一点祝贺你订婚的小礼物
A little engagement gift.

122
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,561
你的礼物清单上肯定没有这个
I'm sure you didn't register for that.

123
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,160
谁死了 谁死了
Who died? Who died?

124
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,287
把他翻过来 快点 把他翻过来 噢
Roll him over. Oh, come on, roll him over！ Oh!

125
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:03,875
我们知道那不是德柯斯特 对不对 马塞尔 因为
Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right? Marcel? Because...

126
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,007
马塞尔 马塞尔 马...
Marcel? Marcel? Marc...

127
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,430
你怎么可能把他弄丢了      
How could you lose him?        

128
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,299
不知道 我也不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

129
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,388
我们在看电视 
We were watching TV. 

130
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:14,089
然后他在摩妮卡的鞋子里大便
And then he pooped in Monica's shoe.

131
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:18,055
等等 他在我的鞋子里大便 哪一只
Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?

132
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,141
不知道 左脚那一只
I don't know. The left one.

133
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,431
哪一双
Which ones?

134
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,727
就是那双你认为百搭的笨重老土的鞋
Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.

135
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,487
嘿      嘿
Hey.        Hey.

136
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,274
为什么空气中充满了负面情绪
Whoa, oh! Why is the air in here so negative?

137
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,704
瑞秋把马塞尔弄丢了      噢 不会吧 怎么弄的
Rachel lost Marcel.         Oh, no. How?

138
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,674
他在我的鞋子里大便      
He pooped in my shoe.         

139
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:40,035
哪一只?
Which one?

140
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,496
就是我常穿的那双可爱的黑鞋
Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.

141
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,662
不是 是哪一只
No, which one?

142
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,962
右脚还是左脚
The right or left?

143
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,091
因为左脚的话代表幸运
Because the left one is lucky.

144
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,876
拜托 我们该怎么办 我们该怎么办
Come on, you guys. What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?

145
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,011
好吧 好吧 假如你是一只猴子
All right, all right, all right. You're a monkey.

146
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,843
在城市里走失了
You're loose in the city.

147
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,803
你会去哪里
Where do you go?

148
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,763
这是他第一次出门
Okay, it's his first time out.

149
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:03,146
所以他可能会去一些观光景点
So he's probably gonna want to do some of the touristy things.

150
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:09,064
我去百老汇那边找 你们去俄国茶坊找
I'll go to Cats. You go to the Russian Tea Room.

151
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,418
去 死 吧 
Oh, my God! 

152
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:12,565
拜托你们
Come on, you guys.

153
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,028
他马上就会回来 他会杀了我的
He's gonna be home any minute. He's gonna kill me.

154
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,534
我们先从这栋房子开始 
Okay, we start with the building. 

155
00:08:16,535 --> 00:08:17,865
你们去1楼和2楼找
You guys take the first and second floor.

156

菲比跟我去3楼跟4楼      
Phoebe and I will take third and fourth. 

157
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:20,997
那我怎么办 我要做什么
Whoa, whoa, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?

158
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,783
好 你留在这里等电话
Okay, you stay here and just wait by the phone.

159
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:27,420
在我的鞋子里喷清洁剂 等罗斯回来杀你
Spray Lysol in my shoe and wait for Ross to kill you.

160
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,002
有人想要跟我换吗
Does anybody want to trade?

161
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,973
你们想干什么
What do you want?

162
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:42,386
黑考斯先生 我们朋友的猴子走丢了 你有没有看到
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?

163
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,397
我放了一个松饼在外头 是不是你们拿走的
I left a Belgian waffle out here. Did you take it?

164
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,556
不是
No.

165
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,272
你为什么会把松饼放在走廊里
Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?

166
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,107
我还不想吃
I wasn't ready for it.

167
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,112
猴子 你有没有看到一只猴子
The monkey, have you seen a monkey?

168
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,198
我见过主持人瑞吉斯一次
I saw Regis Philbin once.

169
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,902
谢谢你 黑考斯先生
Thank you, Mr. Heckles.

170
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,163
你们欠我一个松饼
You owe me a waffle.

171
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:07,244
他是一只白脸的黑色僧帽猴...
Okay, he's a black capuchin monkey with a white face...

172
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:11,586
加俄式调味汁 外加腌黄瓜
with Russian dressing and pickles on the side.

173
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,092
好的 谢谢
Okay, thanks.

174
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,999

噢 好极了 非常顺利      好
Oh, great. It went great. Really great.        Yeah.

176
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,142
嘿 你带酒来了      对啊
Hey, is that wine?         Yeah. Yeah.

177
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,802
要喝一些吗
You, want some?

178
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,766
噢 我很想喝      好的
Oh, I would love some.         Yeah.

179
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,323
这样好了 这样好了 
But you know what? You know what? 

180
00:09:27,324 --> 00:09:28,431
我们不要在这里喝
Let's not drink it here.

181
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,747
我突然想疯一下 你想不想去纽瓦克
I'm feeling kind of crazy. Do you want to go to Newark?

182
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,899
好 好啊
Okay. Yeah.

183
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,178
我们当然可以去
We could do that. 

184
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:40,990
但在去东北部谋杀案的首府之前
But before we head off to the murder capital of the Northeast

185
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,248
我想先跟你谈一件事
I was kinda wanting to run something by you.

186
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,660
你知道我们先前谈过的
You know how we were, you know, talking before.

187
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,124
有关恋爱之类的话题
About relationships and stuff, well...

188
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,551
噢 天啊 罗斯 我不能这么做      
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.         

189
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,292
好吧 迅速而痛苦
Okay, quick and painful.

190
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,594
噢 天啊
Oh God!

191
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,639
好吧 好吧 好吧
Okay, all right. All right, okay.

192
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,143
罗斯 请不要恨我
Ross, please don't hate me.

193
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,229
噢 怎么了 怎么了
Oh what? What? What?

194
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,980
马塞尔他
You know Marcel?

195
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,428
怎么了      
Yeah?         

196
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:23,488
嗯 我好像把他弄丢了
Well, I kind of, I kind of lost him.

197
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,716
我真不敢相信
I can't believe this.

198
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,474
我只是要你看着他 让他待在这间公寓
I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.

199
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,850
我知道 我知道 对不起
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

200
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,136
你知道吗 我想我也有错
You know what? I guess it's partially my fault, you know?

201
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,646
我不应该一开始就让你照顾猴子
I mean, I shouldn't have asked you to start off with a monkey.

202
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,809
应该先让你照看一支铅笔之类的
I should have started you off with like a pen or a pencil.

203
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,840
罗斯 我已经尽力了
Ross, I'm doing everything that I can.

204
00:10:56,842 --> 00:10:59,401
大家都在找他 而且我还
I've got everybody looking for him and I got...

205
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,780
哪一位      动物控制中心
Who is it?        Animal Control.

206
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,016
你看 我还打电话到动物控制中心了    
See, I've even got Animal Control.         

207
00:11:06,017 --> 00:11:07,447
你打电话给动物控制中心了
You called Animal Control?

208
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,453
嗯啊
Uhhuh!

209
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,869
怎么了 你不喜欢他们吗
Why? Do you not like them?

210
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:19,881
马塞尔是非法引进的外来动物
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.

211
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,547
我是非法饲养
I'm not allowed to have him in the city.

212
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,968
万一被他们找到 他们就会把他带走
If they find him, they'll take him away from me.

213
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:32,264
好吧 你看 你从来没有告诉过我们这些
Okay, well now see, you never ever ever told us that.

214
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,805
没错 因为我没想到 
That's right, because I didn't expect 

215
00:11:34,806 --> 00:11:36,919
你会邀请他们来这里
you were gonna invite them to the apartment.

216
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,320
你好 谢谢你赶过来
Hi, thanks for coming.

217
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,904
有人遗失猴子
Somebody called about a monkey?

218
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,183
噢 你知道吗 
Oh,oh, you know what? 

219
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:49,288
那完全是个误会
That was a complete misunderstanding.

220
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,791
对啊 我们以为我们养的只猴子 结果不是
Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we didn't.

221
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,451
那是顶帽子      猫
It turned out it was a hat.         Cat.

222
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,370
猫 我刚说的是什么
Cat. What did I say?

223
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,379
3楼跟4楼 我们都去看过了
Hi, we checked the third and fourth floor.

224
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,514
没有人看到马塞尔      
No one's seen Marcel.         

225
00:11:58,515 --> 00:11:59,256
马塞尔
Marcel?

226
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,420
我叔叔马塞尔
My uncle Marcel.

227
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,132
噢 猴子的名字就是这样来的
Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?

228
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,512
好吧
Okay.

229
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,424
你们知道私自豢养非法引进的外来动物
Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic 

230
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,833
最高可罚两年牢狱 
is punishable by up to two years in prison 

231
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:11,669
而且动物要被没收
and confiscation of the animal.

232
00:12:11,678 --> 00:12:13,104
噢 天啊
Oh my God.

233
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,731
你要把那个可怜的小东西关在监狱里
You'd put that poor little creature in jail?

234
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,489
菲比 记不记得我们说过 
Pheebs, you remember how we talked about 

235
00:12:23,491 --> 00:12:25,905
说话前要先想一下
saying things quietly to yourself first?

236
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,203
记得 但不是总有时间可以这样做
Yes, but there isn't always time.

237
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:36,190
我相信一定有更友善的方式解决 
Look, I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this. 

238
00:12:36,191 --> 00:12:37,129
你先请坐
Have a seat.

239
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,769
我们还没自我介绍 
First of all, we haven't been introduced. 

240
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,914
我是摩妮卡盖勒
I'm Monica Geller.

241
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,008
噢 天啊 是你
Oh my God, you are!

242
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,591
而你是瑞秋葛林      对
And you're Rachel Green.         Yeah.

243
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,048
露伊莎基雅内蒂 林肯中学
Luisa Gianetti. Lincoln High?

244
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,344
每次在教室上课时 我都坐在你们后面
I sat behind you guys in homeroom.

245
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:56,561
露伊莎  噢 我的天啊
Oh! Luisa. Oh, my God.

246
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,941
摩妮卡  是露伊莎耶
Monica, it's Luisa!

247
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,148
同间教室的露伊莎
Luisa from homeroom.

248
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,812
太好了
Yes!

249
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,316
你根本不知道我是谁 对不对      不知道
You have no idea who I am, do you?         No.

250
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,155
完全不知道
Not at all.

251
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:12,572
也许是因为整整四年 你们都没正眼瞧过我
Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me.

252
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,748
说句 早安 露伊莎 或是 
Would it have been so hard to say "Morning, Luisa"

253
00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:18,412
好可爱的吊带裤 有那么难吗
or "Nice overalls"?

254
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,460
噢 真对不起
Oh, I'm so sorry.

255
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,667
我不怪你 
It's not so much you. 

256
00:13:26,668 --> 00:13:29,551
你那时候很胖 问题已经够多了
You were fat. You had your own problems.

257
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,180
但是你 真是个讨人厌的女生
But you, what a bitch!

258
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,309
什么
What?

259
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,895
这样好了 过去就算了
Alright, you know what? Be that as it may.

260
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,379
猴子的事 能不能请你帮个忙 
You think you could you help us out here on that monkey thing. 

261
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,358
就当看在过去的份上
You know, just for old times' sake?

262
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,397
加油 山猫队
Go Bobcats!

263
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,908
我可以 但是我不帮
I could. But I won't.

264
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,408
如果我找到猴子 他就是我的了
If I find that monkey, he's mine.

265
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,032
当 当 当
Dun-dun-duuuur!

266
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,161
很遗憾
Sorry!

267
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,967
马塞尔
Marcel?

268
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,174
马塞尔      马塞尔
Marcel?         Marcel?

269
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,928
嗨 有事吗
Hi, can I help you?

270
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,449
我们有点紧急状况 
We're kind of having an emergency. 

271
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,315
我们在找东西
And we were looking for something.

272
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,198
找猴子      对 你有没有看到一只猴子
A monkey.         Yes! Have you seen any?

273
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,906
没有 我没看到什么猴子
No. No. I haven't seen a monkey.

274
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,945
你们知道怎么样修理散热器吗
Do you know anything about fixing radiators?

275
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,155
当然 当然
Sure, sure. 

276
00:14:35,156 --> 00:14:37,582
你们有没有试着 把开关往相反方向转
Did you try turning the knob back the other way?

277
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:41,377
当然有      那我们就没办法了
Of course.         Oh, then, no.

278
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,292
你尝尝鸡尾酒 莱姆酒是不是放太多了
Taste this Daiquiri. Is there too much rum in here?

279
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,086
等一下 希望你们快点找到猴子
Just a second. Hope you find your monkey.

280
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,255
噢 不 等一下等一下
Oh, no, wait. No, no, no. Wait, wait.

281
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,766
我们可能不太熟悉散热器
We may not know anything about radiators per se.

282
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,098
但是我们对环境的冷暖
But we do have a certain amount of expertise

283
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,763
有一定程度的认知
in the heating and cooling milieu.

284
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,819
我们不是还有事情要做吗
Aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?

285
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,402
对 但是这些女人很热 而且需要我们帮忙
Yes, but these women are very hot and they need our help.

286
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,567
而且还很辣
And very hot.

287
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,704
我们不可以这样 好吗
We can't, all right?

288
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,373
很遗憾
We're sorry.

289
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,550
你们不知道我们有多遗憾 
You have no idea how sorry. 

290
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:23,544
但是我们已经答应了要去找猴子
But we promised we'd find this monkey.

291
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,740
如果你们看到他 他大概这么高 
If you see him, he's about yea high. 

292
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:26,956
叫他马塞尔他会回应
And answers to the name Marcel.

293
00:15:26,956 --> 00:15:29,025
如果能够拥有你们的照片
So if we could get some pictures of you

294
00:15:29,026 --> 00:15:30,673
你们就算是帮了大忙了
you'd really be helping us out.

295
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,514
好吧 从现在开始 你不准跟外人说话
Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.

296
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,107
马塞尔      马塞尔
Marcel?         Marcel!

297
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:48,861
马塞尔      马塞尔
Marcel?        Marcel?

298
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,855
马塞尔
Marcel?

299
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,573
噢 天啊      怎么了
Oh, my God!         What?!

300
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,734
有东西拂过我的右腿
Something just brushed up against my right leg.

301
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,702
那是什么
What is it?     

302
00:15:55,781 --> 00:15:59,243
喔 噢 没什么 那是我的左腿
Ooh! Oh, it's okay. It was just my left leg.

303
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,617
你看 菲比
Look, Phoebe.

304
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,456
噢 太好了 噢 马塞尔 过来
Oh, yeah. Oh, Marcel. Come here.

305
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,791
过来 马塞尔      两位小姐 请让开
Oh, come here, Marcel.         Step aside, ladies!

306
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,564
你要做什么      
What are you gonna do?         

307
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:11,546
只是一点镇静剂
Just a small tranquilizer.

308
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,769
快跑 马塞尔 快跑 跑啊 马塞尔
Run, Marcel! Run! Run, Marcel!

309
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,812
该死      你还好吧
Damn.         Are you okay?

310
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,448
噢 还好 应该没事
Oh, yeah! I think so.

311
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,401
我只是 噢
I just... Oh!

312
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,404
哈 哇喔
Huh. Whoah!

313
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,371
噢 天啊
Oh, gosh.

314
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,711
马塞尔      马塞尔
Marcel.        Marcel.

315
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,380
这太荒谬了 整个社区都找遍了
This is ridiculous. We've been all over the neighborhood.

316
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,139
他不见了 就这么消失了
He's gone. He's just gone.

317
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,681
罗斯 你怎么知道
Ross, you don't know that.

318
00:17:00,682 --> 00:17:02,473
噢 拜托 现在又冷又暗
Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark.

319
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,979
他根本不知道路
He doesn't know the Village.

320
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,481
现在我的脚又受伤了 
And now I have a broken foot. Oh, my...

321
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,109
我的猴子不见了 脚又受伤了
I have no monkey and a broken foot.

322
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,485
真是谢谢你
Thank you very much.

323
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,693
罗斯 我已经跟你道歉过无数次了
Ross you know, I've said I'm sorry like a million times.

324
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,573
你要我怎么做 
What do you want me to do? Huh? 

325
00:17:16,574 --> 00:17:18,280
到底要我怎么样 要我也踢伤脚吗
What do you want? You want me to break my foot too?

326
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,445
好吧 我也来踢伤我的脚 
Okay here, I'm gonna break my foot right now. Ow!

327
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:24,161
我的天呀 好了 这下你高兴了吧
Oh God! My God! There, are you happy now?

328
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,202
对 就在你踢完路标之后
Yeah, yeah. You know, now that you kicked the sign.

329
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,214
嘿 我突然不再想念马塞尔了
Hey, I don't miss Marcel anymore.

330
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,835
我又不是故意的
You know, it's not like I did this on purpose.

331
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,379
不 不 当然不是 这只是典型的瑞秋
No, no, no, no, no. This is just vintage Rachel.

332
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,140
你身边的事都是自动发生
I mean, things just sort of happen around you.

333
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,613
你一直都活在自己的世界里 
I mean, you're off in Rachel Land

334
00:17:43,614 --> 00:17:44,677
做你自己的事
doing your Rachel thing

335
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,746
完全无视别人的猴子 
totally oblivious to people's monkeys

336
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:49,770
或是别人的感受      罗斯
or to people's feelings.        Ross.

337
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,151
我不想听了      罗斯
I don't even want to hear it...         Ross.

338
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,731
算了 可以吗      罗斯
Forget it, okay?         Ross.

339
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,646
怎么了 干嘛 干嘛
What? What? What?

340
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,739
嘿 香蕉男
Hey, banana man.

341
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,664
噢 真是有够强的
Oh, this is so intense.

342
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,015
我一边的屁股完全麻掉 
One side of my butt is totally asleep. 

343
00:18:11,016 --> 00:18:13,707
另一边却完全不知道
And the other side has no idea.

344
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,505
嗨 香蕉是你买的吗
Hi, did you order some bananas?

345
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:23,095
那又怎样      猴子还我
What about it?         Give me my monkey back.

346
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,384
我没有猴子
I don't have a monkey.

347
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,436
那买那么多香蕉干什么       补钾
Then what's with all the bananas?         Potassium.

348
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,774
马塞尔 马塞尔
Marcel? Marcel.

349
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,108
他在哪儿 他在哪儿 马塞尔 马塞尔
Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?

350
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,107
马塞尔
Marcel！

351
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,697
你对他做了什么
What have you done to him?

352
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,409
那是我的猴子 派蒂 猴子派蒂
That's my monkey. That's Patty. Patty the monkey.

353
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,957
你疯了吗
Are you insane?

354
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,370
马塞尔 快点过来      派蒂过来
Come here, Marcel. Come on.         Come here, Patty.

355
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,379
过来这里  马塞尔
Come here, Marcel.

356
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,881
派蒂 过来这里
Come here, Patty.

357
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,044
过来 猴子 过来这里
Here, monkey. Here, monkey. Here, monkey.

358
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,928
抓到了
Gotcha.

359
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,171
猴子还我      
Okay, give me my monkey back.         

360
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:04,386
他是我的猴子
That's my monkey.

361
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,642
你们俩到法官那儿去理论吧
You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.

362
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,053
那不是我的猴子 不过裙子是我的
That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine.

363
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,187
你方便的时候再寄回来给我
You can send it back whenever.

364
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,474
我要我的猴子      不行
All right, I want my monkey.         No.

365
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,369
拜托你 露伊莎      
Oh, come on, Luisa.         

366
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,690
很抱歉 舞会皇后
Sorry, prom queen.

367
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,345
你高中时干嘛那么讨厌 
You had to be a bitch in high school. 

368
00:19:18,346 --> 00:19:20,106
为何不当个胖妹
You couldn't have been fat.

369
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,115
好吧 高中时 我是舞会皇后
Alright look, okay, in high school I was the prom queen.

370
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,793
也是返校日皇后和班长 
And I was the homecoming queen and the class president. 

371
00:19:27,795 --> 00:19:30,745
而你也一直都存在
And you were also there.

372
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,497
如果你带走这只猴子
Look, if you take this monkey...

373
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,664
我会失去生命中一个最重要的人
I will lose one of the most important people in my life.

374
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,544
你可以恨我 
You can hate me if you want. 

375
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:40,050
但是请不要惩罚他
But please do not punish him.

376
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:43,463
拜托你 露伊莎 此时你有机会成为大人物
Come on, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here.

377
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,256
把握机会吧
Take it.

378
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,185
不要
No.

379
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,641
好吧
All right.

380
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,015
那我就要打电话给你的长官 
Well then how about I call your supervisor. 

381
00:19:54,016 --> 00:19:57,561
告诉她你在我朋友的屁股上开了一枪
And I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart.

382
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,925
嘿 终于能把这件衣服脱下来了
Hey, it'll be nice to get this off finally,

383
00:20:06,925 --> 00:20:08,175
感觉一定很好 对吧
won't it? Yes, it will.

384
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:10,949
不然继续让你穿着 也没关系
Or we can leave it on for now. That's fine.

385
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,662
再配上鞋 
You know, with the right pair of pumps 

386
00:20:12,663 --> 00:20:15,120
就是完美的一套小礼服了
that would be a great little outfit.

387
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:22,724
很抱歉先前对你的态度那么差 
Listen, I'm sorry I was so hard on you before.

388
00:20:22,725 --> 00:20:23,586
我只是
You know, I just...

389
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,029
不 罗斯 别这样说 
No, Ross, come on. No, no. 

390
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,927
都是我不好 几乎让你失去...
It was my fault. I almost lost your...

391
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,342
不 不 多亏了你 他才能回来
No no. Yeah, but you were the one who got him back.

392
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,805
你真的很了不起
You know, you were great.

393
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:38,859
嘿 我们的酒还在
Hey, we still have that bottle of wine.

394
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:42,946
你还有没有心情来点 葡萄酒
Are you in the mood for something grape?

395
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,656
好啊 好主意      
Sure, that would be good.         

396
00:20:45,657 --> 00:20:46,652
好
All right!

397
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,543
一定是邻居在吸地板
The neighbors must be vacuuming.

398
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:09,307
只要我们在这里
Well, as long as we're here...

399
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,932
不是在谈那个话题
and not on the subject.

400
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,597

I was thinking about

401
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,811
我们两个都在生对方的气
how mad we got at each other before.

402
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:29,031
我在想 可能也是因为我们都
And I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we...

403
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,453
瑞秋      巴瑞

I can't.I can't do it. I can't marry Mindy.

我想我还爱着你      噢
I think I'm still in love with you.         Oh!

406
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,503
我们得开始锁门了

You see the Von Trapp kids?         No.

409
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,647
那是因为我站在他们前面

中学并不是我喜欢的时光
