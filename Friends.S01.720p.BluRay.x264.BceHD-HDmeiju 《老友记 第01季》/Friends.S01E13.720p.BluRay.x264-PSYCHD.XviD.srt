1
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,558
抱歉      天啊 我受够了
I'm sorry.        Oh, my God. That's it.

2
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,011
你不敲门就闯进来?
You just barge in here and you don't knock?

3
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,100
难道你不尊重别人的隐私权?
You have no respect for anybody's privacy.

4
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:25,897
瑞秋 你等一下      不 你等一下 这太荒谬了
Rachel, wait.        No, you wait. This is ridiculous.

5
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,600
我能说一件事吗?      什么事?
Can I just say one thing?        What? What?

6
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:32,067
这块布编得非常松 因此我仍能看见...
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your...

7
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:33,818
你的两点
...nippular area.

12
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,413
亲爱的 告诉他们你病人的故事
Honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient...

13
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,423
那个人如何把事想成另一件事
...who thinks things are other things.

14
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,209
你知道吗?
You know?

15
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,549
例如 电话响时她就去洗澡
Like when the phone rings and she takes a shower.

16
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,056
差不多就是那样
That's pretty much it.

17
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,848
但你说得很好 亲爱的
But you tell it really well, sweetie.

18
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,230
谢谢
Thanks. Okay.

19
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,936
快走开 这样我们才能谈你
Now go away, so we can talk about you.

20
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,938
好吧 我会想念你的
Okay, I'll miss you.

21
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,275
他很不错吧
Isn't he great?

22
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,657
他好可爱 也好像很喜欢你
He's so cute. And he likes you so much.

23
00:01:58,869 --> 00:01:59,904
我知道
I know. I know.

24
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,995
他人很好 而且很复杂
He's so sweet. And so complicated, you know?

25
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,498
以一位精神科医师来讲 他不算是太神经质
And for a shrink, he's not too "shrinky". You know?

26
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,708
他会在沙发上做吗?
So you think you'll do it on his couch?

27
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,704
我不知道 有点奇怪
Oh. I don't know. That's a little weird.

28
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,330
聚乙稀做的
It's vinyl.

29
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,714
好 大家还想要别的东西吗?
Okay. You guys want anything else?

30
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,088
要 我要...      抱歉 卖完了
Oh, yes. Could I have...?        Sorry, we're all out of those.

31
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,551
其他人呢?      好的
Anybody else?        Okay.

32
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,342
我是否错过了什么事?
Did I, uh, miss something?

33
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,770
她很生气 因为我看见她的乳房
No,she's still upset because I saw her boobies.

34
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,524
你看她胸部干什么?
What were you doing seeing her boobies?

35
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:33,813
那是意外
It was an accident.

36
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,946
这跟拿望远镜和甜甜圈过街的感觉不同
I wasn't across the street with a telescope and a box of doughnuts.

37
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,441
能换个话题吗?
Can we change the subject, please?

38
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:44,820
没错 因为那不是她的乳房 而是她的胸部
Because, hello? These aren't her "boobies". These are her breasts.

39
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,458
菲比 我要的不只是改变字眼
Phoebe, I was hoping for more of a change.

40
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,038
你为什么要难为情呢? 你的乳房还蛮不错的
I don't know why you're embarrassed. They were very nice boobies.

41
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,502
"不错"?
"Nice"?

42
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,007
它们很"不错?
They were "nice"?

43
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,003
就这样? 手套也很不错
That's it? I mean mittens are "nice".

44
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:06,800
好 我真是左右为难
Okay. Rock, hard place, me.

45
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,436
你真搞笑
You're so funny.

46
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,726
他真的很搞笑
He's really funny.

47
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:20,857
他不讲笑话的时候 我可不想待在这里
I wouldn't want to be there when the laughter stops.

48
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,074
等等 退回到刚才那句话
Whoa, whoa. Back up there, sparky.

49
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,612
你说这句话是什么意思?
What did you mean by that?

50
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,749
你似乎有亲密上的问题
It seems that maybe you have intimacy issues...

51
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:34,795
你用你的幽默和人保持距离
You know, that you use your humor as a way to keep people at a distance.

52
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,175
我是说 我才刚认识你 我对你毫无所知
I mean, hey, I just met you. I don't know you from Adam.

53
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,090
独生子 对吧?
Only child, right?

54
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,799
父母在你青春期前离婚?
Parents divorced before you hit puberty.

55
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,388
你怎会知道?      典型的课本范例
How did you know that?        It's textbook.

56
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,645
各位
Hey, you guys.

57
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,439
你们都认识我爸吧?
You all know my dad, right?

58
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,363
打算在纽约待多久?      就几天
How long are you in the city?        Just for a couple of days.

59
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,655
我在市中心工作
I got a job midtown.

60
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,150
我想和我儿子一起住
I figure I'm better off staying with the kid...

61
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,611
比来回坐渡轮好
...than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry.

62
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:08,953
我没见过他
I don't know this one.

63
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,330
他是我朋友罗杰      嗨
Oh. This is my friend, Roger.        Hi.

64
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,158
幸会 罗杰      彼此彼此
Good to meet you, Roger.       You too.

65
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,207
玩布偶的那个怎么了?
What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?

66
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,458
爸
Dad, uh...

67
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:19,922
抱歉
Excuse me.

68
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,217
罗斯 你老婆还好吗?
So, Ross, uh, how's the wife?

69
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,179
哪壶不开提哪壶了?
Oh, for two, huh? Heh.

70
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,091
钱德 快点 说点好笑的
Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny.

71
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,726
我得挂电话了 我也想你
Gotta go. Ha, ha. I miss you too.

72
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,925
我爱你 但现在很晚了
I love you, but it's getting really late now.

73
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:45,190
让我向她打声招呼 嗨 妈
Let me say hi. Hey, Ma.

74
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:49,115
我和包西达大夫约了时间 而且...
Listen, I made the appointment with Dr.Bassida and...

75
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,413
什么?
Excuse me?

76
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,050
你知道这不是妈妈吗?
Did you know this isn't Ma?

77
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,674
她叫罗妮
Her name's Ronni.

78
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,847
她从事宠物殡葬业
She's a pet mortician.

79
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,185
好
Sure.

80
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,310
你和她多久了...
So how long have you been...

81
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,396
记得小时候我常带你 去海军军港...
Remember when you were a kid, I'd take you to the Navy yard..

82
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,983
看大船?
...and show you the big ships?

83
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,946
从那时候就开始了?      没有 才六年
Since then?        No, it's only been six years.

84
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,823
我只想勾起你美好的回忆
I wanted to give you a nice memory in your heads.

85
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,289
让你不会觉得 我一直是个王八蛋
So you'd know I wasn't always such a terrible guy.

86
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,294
乔伊 你爱过吗?
Joey, have you ever been in love?

87
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,126
我不知道
I don't know.

88
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,166
那就是没有
Then you haven't.

89
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,761
你的蕃茄烧焦了      你还好意思说我
You're burning your tomatoes.        You're one to talk.

90
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,303
乔伊 你老爸爱得无法自拔
Joey, your dad's in love, big time.

91
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,306
最糟的是 我爱上两个不同的女人
And the worst part is, it's with two different women.

92
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,601
天啊 拜托你告诉我 其中一个是妈
Oh, man. Please tell me one of them is Ma.

93
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,771
当然其中一个是你妈 你秀逗了?
Of course, one of them is Ma. What's the matter with you?

94
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,070
这就像你某天起床突然发现
It's like if you woke up one day and found out...

95
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,406
你老爸是个双面人
...your dad was leading this double life.

96
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,618
好像是为中央情报局工作的间谍
He's, like, actually some spy working for the CIA.

97
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,540
那到挺酷的
That'd be cool.

98
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,792
这实在是太逊了
This blows.

99
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,923
我知道 为何父母就不能好好当父母?
I know. Why can't parents just stay parents?

100
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,091
为何他们就得成为一般人?
Why do they have to become people?

101
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,260
为何他们要...
Why do they have?

102
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,516
为什么...
Why...

103
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,935
你能不能不要一直盯着我的胸部看
Can't you stop staring at my breasts?

104
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,770
什么?
What?

105
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,315
什么?
What?

106
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,905
那一天你还看得不够吗?
Didn't you get a good enough look the other day?

107
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,696
好了 我们都已是成年人
All right, we're all adults here.

108
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,532
此事只有一个解决方法
There's only one way to resolve this.

109
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,284
既然你看过她的乳房
Since you saw her boobies...

110
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,036
你应该让她看你的小鸡鸡
I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.

111
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,923
想都别想
You know, I don't see that happening.

112
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,472
快点 他说得没错 以眼还眼
Come on. He's right. Tit for tat.

113
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,847
我不会让你看的
Well, I'm not showing you my tat.

114
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,482
谁啊?      是菲比 还有罗杰!
Hello?        It's Phoebe. And Roger.

115
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,939
快上来
Come on up.

116
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,075
这下可好 罗杰来了
Oh, good. Roger is here.

117
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,493
罗杰怎么了?      没什么 小事
What's the matter with Roger?        Nothing. It's a little thing.

118
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,536
我讨厌这家伙
I hate that guy.

119
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,829
因为他太善于分析 这是职业病啊
What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does.

120
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,955
拜托 他没那么糟
Come on. He's not that bad.

121
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,962
你错了! 如果当初我感觉到她是同性恋...
That's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her...

122
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,011
我何必和她结婚呢?
...if I thought on any level that she was a lesbian?

123
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,346
我也不确定
I don't know.

124
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,303
或许你想让你的婚姻失败
Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.

125
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,479
为什么? 我为什么会这么做? 为什么？
Why? Why would I? Why? Why? Why? Why?

126
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:10,608
我也不确定 或许自信心不足
I don't know. Maybe low self-esteem?

127
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,443
或许是弥补你抢兄弟姊妹风头的事情 或许...
Maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling. Maybe you...

128
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,903
等等 回到妹妹的话题
Wait. Go back to that sibling thing.

129
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,785
嗯 我不知道
Well, I don't know.

130
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,164
你让你的婚姻碰壁
It's conceivable that you want to sabotaged your marriage...

131
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:28,039
好显示你妹在父母面前 没那么失败
...so the sibling would be less of a failure in the parents'eyes.

132
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:35,671
这太荒谬了 她不成才我一点都不会感到内疚
That's ridiculous. I don't feel guilty for her failures.

133
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,138
你认为我不成才?      他不错吧
Oh, so you think I'm a failure?        Isn't he good?

134
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,642
不 我不是那个意思
Yeah. No. That's not what I was saying.

135
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,894
多年来我以为你支持我
All these years, I thought you were on my side...

136
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,484
但或许你婚姻失败的目的是 想巴结爸妈
...but maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad...

137
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,811
好让他们更心疼你
So they keep liking you better.

138
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,443
嘿 我娶女同 是想让你看起来更好
Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good.

139
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,573
你说得对
You're right.

140
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,241
我说 你说得对
I mean, you're right.

141
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,246
那不是威伯的问题 而是威伯游乐宫
It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace...

142
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,213
和威伯游轮的问题
...and the Weeble's Cruise Ship...

143
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:14,380
它上面的救生艇让威伯能缓缓驶出
...which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.

144
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,428
那很难受
That's tough, tough stuff.

145
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,049
菲比 我们现在该走了 不然就赶不上电影了
Come on, Phoebe. If we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta go.

146
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,975
希望你好过一点 瑞秋
Okay. Feel better, Rachel, okay?

147
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,011
菲比 我们快来不及了 甜心      好的
Phoebe, we're gonna be late, sweetie.        Okay

148
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,064
谢谢你做的一切 莫妮卡      不客气
Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.        No problem.

149
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,183
各位 很高兴和各位再次见面
Listen, guys. It was great seeing you again.

150
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,773
莫妮卡 饼干别吃太多
Monica, uh, easy on those cookies, okay?

151
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,150
切记 那些东西只是食物
Remember, they're just food...

152
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,776
不是爱
...they're not love.

153
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,873
我讨厌这家伙
I hate that guy.

154
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,829
晚安 各位
Good night, you guys.

155
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,501
看 这是我们订的女人
Oh, look. It's the woman we ordered.

156
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,932
嘿 需要帮忙吗?
Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?

157
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,470
不用 谢谢 我在等乔伊崔比亚尼
Oh. No, thanks. I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.

158
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,351
我就是乔伊崔比亚尼
I'm Joey Tribbiani.

159
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,234
喔 不是你 是老乔伊
Oh. Oh, no, not you. Big Joey.

160
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,439
天啊
Oh, my God.

161
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,318
你比照片上帅多了
You're so much cuter than your pictures.

162
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,489
我是罗妮
I'm Ronni.

163
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,739
奶酪要吗?
Cheese Nip?

164
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,285
乔伊的脑子有点秀逗了
Uh, Joey's having an embolism...

165
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,162
但是我想来点
But I'd go for a Nip.

166
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,929
大部分人在宠物过世后
You see, most people, when their pets pass on...

167
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,845
希望他们像睡觉那样躺着
they want them laid out like they're sleeping.

168
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,224
但有时有些人要他们摆出姿势
But occasionally you get a person who wants them in a pose.

169
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,185
像追自己的尾巴
Like, uh, chasing their tail.

170
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,189
或跳起来接住飞盘
Or, uh, jumping to catch a Frisbee.

171
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,739
乔伊 如果我先走一步 我的姿势要像找钥匙一样
Joey, if I go first, I want to be looking for my keys.

172
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,151
好好笑!      嗨!乔伊
That's a good one.        Hey, Joey.

173
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,910
嗨 爸爸 罗妮来了
Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.

174
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,409
嗨      嘿
Huh?        Hi.

175
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,291
嗨      嘿 亲爱的
Hey. Hey.        Hello, babe.

176
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,747
你来做什么?
What are...what are you doing here?

177
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,748
你的假发留在我的公寓里
Oh, uh, you left your hair at my apartment.

178
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,333
我想你明天开会用得上
I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.

179
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,216
谢谢
Thank you.

180
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,807
谁想玩大老二?
So who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?

181
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,389
听着 我...
Look, I, uh...

182
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,265
我不该来这里
I shouldn't have come.

183
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,939
我该走了 我不想错过最后一班地铁
I gotta go. I'll miss the last train.

184
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,237
不 我不想让你这么晚还搭地铁
No, I don't want you taking that thing this late.

185
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,235
那我要睡哪里? 这里吗?
Where am I gonna stay? Here?

186
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,526
我们去住饭店
WeII, go to a hotel.

187
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,862
我们去住饭店
Well, go to a hotel.

188
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,407
不行      不行
No, you won't.        No, we won't.

189
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,543
你们去饭店就一定会嘿咻
If you go to a hotel, you'll be doing stuff.

190
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,713
我要你们待在这里 这样我就可以盯着你们
I want you right here, where I can keep an eye on you.

191
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,586
你要盯着我们?
You're gonna keep an eye on us?

192
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,916
没错 先生
That's right, mister

193
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,551
不管你年纪多大 只要住在我家屋檐下...
I don't care how old you are, as long as you're in my roof.

194
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,217
一切就得听我的
You're gonna live by my rules.

195
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,728
那就是不准你和你女朋友睡在一起
And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.

196
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,014
哇 他好严格
Wow, he's strict.

197
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,732
爸 你睡我房问
Dad, you'll be in my room.

198
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,978
罗妮 你睡钱德的房问
Ronni, uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.

199
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,613
谢谢 你真是个好孩子
Thanks. You're a good kid.

200
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,861
来 我带你去看我房问
Come on. I'll show you to my room.

201
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:30,450
感觉真奇怪 你没说"不 谢了 时候不早了"
That sounds weird when it's not followed by,"no, thanks, it's late."

202
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:38,084
好 只有今晚而已 明天你就得做出改变
Okay. This is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change.

203
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,832
六年时间可不短      什么改变?
Six years is long enough.        What kind of change?

204
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,050
和罗妮分手      我不能!
Either you break up with Ronni.        I can't.

205
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,920
要不就和我妈离婚 这样是不对的
Then you gotta come clean with Ma. This is not right.

206
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,173
对 但是...      我不想听 快进我房里
Yeah, but this is...        I don't wanna hear it. Now go to my room.

207
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,864
嘿 踢踏舞者
Hey, kickie.

208
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,069
你在干什么?      想让自己舒服一点
What are you doing?        Trying to get comfortable.

209
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,198
穿着内裤我睡不着      你非穿不可
I can't sleep in my underwear.        Well, you're gonna.

210
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,334
我一直在想...
I've been thinking...

211
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,880
我总是看见女人叠在女人上面
...about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls.

212
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:31,137
她们是首尾相接 还是是像煎饼一样叠起来?
Are they end to end, or tall, like pancakes?

213
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,720
你知道我什么意思 这些和我约过会的女人
You know what I mean. How I date all these women.

214
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,814
因为我总是想 当真命天女出现时
I always figured, when the right one comes along...

215
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:41,359
我就会勇往直前 坚持到最后
I'll be able to be a standup guy and go the distance, you know?

216
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,983
但如今看见我爸 我想...
Now, looking at my Dad, thinking...

217
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,610
你不是他 你是你自己
You're not him, you're you.

218
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,361
当他们希望你继承你爸的事业时 你有屈服吗?
When they all wanted you to go into your father's business, did you cave?

219
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,619
没有      没有
No.        No.

220
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,202
你决心当个业余演员
You decided to go into the out-of- work actor business.

221
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,536
这不是一件容易的事 但你办到了
That wasn't easy, but you did it.

222
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,172
我也相信 当真命天女出现时
And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along...

223
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,295
你会有勇气对她说
You'll have the courage and the guts to say:

224
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,921
"抱歉 我结婚了"
"No, thanks. I'm married."

225
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:14,934
你真的这样认为?
You really think so?

226
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,269
真的 我真的这样认为
Yeah. I really do.

227
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,100
谢谢 钱德      滚开
Thanks, Chandler.        Get off.

228
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,156
嗨      嗨
Hi.        Hi.

229
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,662
有事吗?
May I help you?

230
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,450
乔伊说我能用你的浴室 因为钱德正在用我们的
Uh, Joey said I could use your shower since uh, Chandler's in ours.

231
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,210
好 你是谁?
Okay. Who are you?

232
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,797
我叫罗妮 罗妮罗普拉诺
Oh, uh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono.

233
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,965
情妇?
The mistress?

234
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,886
请进      谢谢
Um, come on in.        Thanks.

235
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,013
我叫瑞秋 浴室在那里
Hi, I'm Rachel. Bathroom's up there.

236
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,261
嘿 听好 罗妮
Hey, Ronni.

237
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,642
钱德进浴室多久了?
How long would you say Chandler has been in the shower?

238
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,636
大约五分钟
Oh. Like, uh, five minutes.

239
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,017
太好了
Perfect.

240
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,817
请系好安全带
Fasten your seat belts.

241
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,644
看小鸡鸡的时间到了
It's peepee time.

242
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:13,947
嘿 崔比亚尼先生
Hey, Mr. Trib.

243
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,862
嘿 早安 亲爱的
Hey. Good morning, dear.

244
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,667
钱德宾 该换我看你的小东西了
Chandler Bing, it's time to see your thing.

245
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,846
你是怎么搞的?      我以为你是钱德
What's the matter with you?        I thought it was Chandler.

246
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,763
你应该在浴室 这样我才能看见你的小东西
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing.

247
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,233
抱歉 我的小弟弟和我在那儿
Sorry, my thing was in there with me.

248
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,025
嗨 菲比 
Hey. Hey, Phoebe.

249
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,194
还好吧?      不错
How's it going?        Good.

250
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,786
罗杰想邀大家一起吃晚餐
Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.

251
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,499
怎么了?      没事
So, what's going on?        Nothing.

252
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,381
只是...
It's just that...

253
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,462
是罗杰
It's Roger.

254
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,510
我不知道 有些事…
Um, I don't know. There's something about...

255
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,922
基本上我们认为他…
Basically, we just feel that he's uh...

256
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,219
我们讨厌他
We hate that guy.

257
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,678
我们讨厌他
We hate him.

258
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,019
菲比 我们很抱歉
We're sorry, Phoebe.

259
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,523
是不是他太有洞察力
Don't you think maybe it's just that he's so perceptive..

260
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,391
所以吓到你们了?
that it freaked you out?

261
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,398
不 我们讨厌他.      不 我们讨厌他
No, I hate him.        No, we hate him.

262
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,774
抱歉
I'm sorry.

263
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,747
妈 你来干什么?
Ma. What are you doing here?

264
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,999
我把这个带给你
I came to give you this...

265
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,497
还有这个
...and this.

266
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,207
你的大戒指打到很痛!
Big ring.

267
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,510
你为什么要对你爸讲一大堆
Why did you have to fill your fathers head with that garbage...

268
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,380
关于改邪归正的废话呢?
...about making things right?

269
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,883
一切事情本来都很好
Things were fine the way they were.

270
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,806
里面有鸡肉 放冰箱冰好
There's chicken in there. Put it away.

271
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,938
拜托 乔伊 真的
For God's sake, Joey. Really

272
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,934
等一下 你都知道?
Hold on. You knew?

273
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,520
我当然知道 你认为呢?
Of course, I knew. What do you think?

274
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,148
你爸又不是詹姆士庞德
Your father is no James Bond.

275
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,240
你应该听听他的谎盲
You should have heard his cover stories.

276
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,736
"我在会计这儿睡"
"I'm sleeping over at my accountant's."

277
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,238
那是什么屁话? 拜托
I mean, what is that? Please.

278
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,331
你怎能...
So then, how could you?

279
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,035
记得你爸以前的模样吗?
Do you remember how your father used to be?

280
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:31,505
总是大吼大叫 总是不开心
Always yelling. Nothing made him happy.

281
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,468
连工作室和瓶内的小船也无法让他开心
Not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle.

282
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,211
现在他很开心
Now, he's happy.

283
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,055
这样很好 他好歹有个嗜好
I mean it's nice. He has a hobby.

284
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,978
妈 我无意冒犯 但是...
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but...

285
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,856
你到底在说什么?
What the hell are you talking about?

286
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,561
我是说 那你怎么办?      我很好啊
I mean, what about you?        Me? I'm fine.

287
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,562
听着 亲爱的...
Look, honey...

288
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,031
在理想的世界中
In an ideal world...

289
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,489
没有她 而且你爸是个大帅哥
There'd be no her and your father would look like Sting.

290
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,534
再告诉你别的
And I'll tell you something else.

291
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,117
自从那贵妇犬一样的女人出现后
Ever since that poodlestuffer came along...

292
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:12,668
他感觉很羞耻 变得对我很用心
He's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive.

293
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,748
并且开始对我体贴
He's been more loving.

294
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,502
每天都像我们的结婚纪念日
It's like every day is our anniversary.

295
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,130
我该为你高兴?
I'm happy for you.

296
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,555
不必了
Well, don't be.

297
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,467
因为现在全搞砸了
Because now everything's screwed up.

298
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,223
我只想回到像从前一样
I just want it the way it was.

299
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,351
妈 对不起
Ma, I'm sorry.

300
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:37,071
我以为我做了你想做的事
I just did what I thought you'd want.

301
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:41,238
我知道 亲爱的 我知道
I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did.

302
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,616
告诉我
So tell me...

303
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,116
你见到她了吗?
Did you see her?

304
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,085
见到了
Yeah.

305
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,293
你比她漂亮十倍都不止
You're 10 times prettier than she is.

306
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,839
嘴巴真甜
That's sweet.

307
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,918
我打得过她吗?
Could I take her?

308
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,930
你有这么大的戒指 她没辙
With this ring, no contest.

309
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,345
怎么了? 亲爱的      没事
What's wrong, sweetie?        Nothing.

310
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,098
到底怎么了? 快说嘛
What's wrong? Come on.

311
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,808
好吧
Okay.

312
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,729
好吧 我...没事
It's nothing. I'm fine.

313
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,905
只是我的朋友
It's just, um, it's my friends.

314
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,822
他们对你有意见
They have a liking problem with you...

315
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,286
其实...
in that. um...

316
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,904
他们不喜欢你
...they don't.

317
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,743
他们不喜欢我?
Oh. They don't?

318
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:33,995
不过 你知道…
But you know...

319
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,043
他们看不见 只有我才能看见的好处
...they don't see all of the wonderfulness that I see.

320
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,793
他们看不见你体贴的一面
They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff.

321
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,591
他们认为你有点...
They think you're a little...

322
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:46,090
什么?      执着的恐怖
What?        Intense and creepy.

323
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,604
但我 菲比不这么认为
But I don't. Me. Phoebe.

324
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,060
我对他们的反应 丝毫不感到惊讶
Well, I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.

325
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,691
不惊讶吗? 这就是你棒的地方
You're not? See, that's why you're so great.

326
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,817
当群体动力失调时
Actually, it's quite typical behavior...

327
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:06,657
这是很平常的反应
...when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.

328
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,447
这种相互依赖…
You know, this kind of codependent...

329
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,324
情绪障碍
...emotionally stunted...

330
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:16,747
坐在那家烂咖啡屋 拿着又大又蠢的咖啡杯
...sitting in your stupid coffeehouse, with your stupid big cups.

331
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,340
或许还有乳头在上面
which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them.

332
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:26,264
你们都会说 "噢 定义我的性格 定义我的性格"
And you're all like, "Oh. Define me. Define me."

333
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,262
"爱我 我需要爱"
"Love me. I need love."

334
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,386
你和你爸谈过了?
So you talked to your dad, huh?

335
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,643
对 他要以我妈希望的方式 继续对我妈劈腿
Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my Ma, like she wanted.

336
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,480
我妈要继续假装她一无所知
Ma's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does.

337
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,480
我妹蒂娜不能再见她丈夫了
And my little sister Tina can't see her husband anymore...

338
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,777
因为他接到禁制令
...because he got a restraining order.

339
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:48,236
这两件事没关系 但我今天才听说
Which has nothing to do with it, except that I found out today.

340
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:52,039
沃顿山这里的事全变了
Things sure have changed here on Walton's mountain.

341
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,371
乔伊 你没事吧?
So, Joey, are you okay?

342
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,120
或许吧
Yeah, I guess.

343
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,622
他们是...父母
It's just...You know, they're parents.

344
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,842
你不得不随他们的意思
After a certain point, you gotta let go.

345
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,710
即使你知道这样做不对
Even if you know better...

346
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,421
但你还是得让他们犯自己的错误
you gotta let them make their own mistakes.

347
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,676
我只是想…
And just think...

348
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,009
几年后我们就会和他们一样
...in a couple years, we get to turn into them.

349
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,635
拜托
Oh, please.

350
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,980
如果我像他们一样 我不是变成...
If I turn into my parents, I'11 either be an alcoholic blond...

351
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:18,174
追逐年轻帅哥的金发醉鬼老玻璃
...chasing after 20-year-old boys.

352
00:21:18,386 --> 00:21:20,172
就是变得和我妈一样
or I'll end up like my mom.

353
00:21:24,434 --> 00:21:26,425
嗨      嗨 菲比
Hey.        Hey, Phoebe.

354
00:21:26,603 --> 00:21:27,888
还好吧?
How's it going?

355
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:31,988
还好 只是我和罗杰分手了
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.

356
00:21:33,443 --> 00:21:35,425
得了吧
Yeah, right.

357
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:39,983
怎么了?
What happened?

358
00:21:40,158 --> 00:21:42,274
我说不上来...我是说
Um, I don't know. I mean...

359
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:43,983
他是个好人
He's a good person.

360
00:21:44,245 --> 00:21:46,110
而且还对我很体贴
And he can be really sweet.

361
00:21:46,748 --> 00:21:49,615
他在某些方面很适合我
And in some ways, I think he is so right for me.

362
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:53,175
只是 我讨厌这个人
It's just...I hate that guy.

363
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:03,487
怎么样?
Hey, Joey. What's going on?

364
00:22:03,487 --> 00:22:06,487
一劳永逸 解决乳房风波
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express.

365
00:22:06,487 --> 00:22:08,428
下一站 瑞秋葛林
Next stop, Rachel Green.

366
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:17,141
乔伊 你在搞什么鬼?
Joey, what the hell were you doing?

367
00:22:17,653 --> 00:22:19,939
对不起 看错乳房!
Sorry, wrong boobies.

368
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:34,283
乔伊 你好
Hello, Joey.

369
00:22:35,837 --> 00:22:37,043
你好 亲爱的!
Hello, dear.
