5
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,760
没什么好说的 他不过是我的同事
There's nothing to tell. It's just some guy I work with.

6
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,130
少来了 和你交往的男人
Come on. You're going out with a guy.

7
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,840
一定有问题
There's gotta be something wrong with him.

8
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,930
他有驼背么?有假发的驼子?
So does he have a hump and a hair piece?

9
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,770
慢着 他吃粉笔吗?
Wait. Does he eat chalk?

10
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:08,230
我只是不想你重蹈我和卡尔的覆辙
I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl. Oh.

11
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,230
好吧 各位别急  这都算不上是约会
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date.

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,400
我们不过是出去吃个晚餐 不上床
It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.

13
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,150
听起来好像是说我的约会
Sounds like a date to me.

14
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,870
记得中学时代的梦
I'm back in high school, in the middle of the cafeteria

15
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,410
我站在自助餐厅 突然发现自己全身赤裸
and I realize I'm totally naked.

16
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,160
耶 我也做过那样的梦
Oh, yeah.I've had that dream.

17
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,460
然后我低头一看  看见有一支电话
Then I look down and I realize there is a phone

18
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,000
在那儿
there.

19
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,840
而不是?       没错
Instead of         That's right!

20
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,550
我没做过那样的梦      没
-That one, I've never had.        No.

21
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,850
突然 那个电话响了
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.

22
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,810
竟然是我妈妈打来的
And it turns out it's my mother.

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,850
这十分怪 因为 她从来不打电话给我!
Which is very, very weird because she never calls me.

24
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,780
嗨
Hi.

25
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,950
这家伙说"嗨"的时候 我总想杀了我自己
This guy says "hello," I wanna kill myself.

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,410
你还好吧 老哥?
Are you okay, sweetie?

27
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,488
我就感觉好像某人伸手进我的喉咙
I just feel like someone grabbed my small intestine

28
00:02:05,488 --> 00:02:08,330
抓住我的小肠 从我的嘴里拉出来
pulled it out of my mouth

29
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,380
再在我的脖子上打结       要饼干吗?
and tied it around my neck.         Cookie?

30
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,880
卡箩今天搬走了她的东西
Carol moved her stuff out today.

31
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,130
天呐
Oh.

32
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,090
我给你拿咖啡       谢谢
Let me get you some coffee.         Thanks.

33
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,800
额
Ew.Unh.

34
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,930
不 不要! 不要打掉我的灵气
No. No,don't! Stop cleansing my aura.

35
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,770
别管它了 好吗?
Just leave my aura alone,okay?

36
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,613
我会没事的 好吧?
I'll be fine. All right?

37
00:02:32,613 --> 00:02:34,650
真的 各位 我希望她开心
Really. I hope she'll be very happy.

38
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,150
不 你不会的      没错 
No, you don't.         No, I don't.

39
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,150
去她的 她甩的我
To hell with her. She left me!

40
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,160
而且你一直都不知道她是Les
And you never knew she was a lesbian.

41
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,370
没有行了吧?
No! Okay?

42
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,330
为什么你们总是提起那件事呢?
Why does everyone keep fixating on that?

43
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,750
连她都不知道 我怎么会知道
She didn't know. How should I know?

44
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,260
有时真希望自己也是个Les
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

45
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,890
我刚刚大声说出来了吗?
Did I say that out loud?

46
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,890
别闷闷不乐了 罗斯
All right, Ross. Look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now.

47
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,480
你一肚子火 心如刀割
You're angry. You're hurting.

48
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,940
让我来告诉你解决之道
Can I tell you what the answer is?

49
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,440
你该去(脱衣舞场)找乐子去
Strip joints!

50
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,940
你单身 有性需求
Come on, you're single. Have some hormones.

51
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,450
我说 并不是我想单身的
See, but I don't want to be single, okay?

52
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,820
我只想再结婚
I just wanna be married again.

53
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,080
我只想要一百万
And I just want a million dollars!

54
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,290
瑞秋?
Rachel?

55
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,170
天啊 莫妮卡 谢天谢地
Oh, God, Monica! Hi! Thank God!

56
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,510
我到过你的住处 你不在
I went to your building and this guy with a hammer said

57
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,112
有个拿着一根大榔头的人说你可能会在这儿
that you might be here

58
00:03:43,112 --> 00:03:43,880
结果你真的在这儿
and you are.

59
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,640
想来杯咖啡吗?       无咖啡因的
Can I get you some coffee?         Decaf.

60
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,800
各位 她叫瑞秋
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel.

61
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,180
另一位从林肯高中生存下来的人
Another Lincoln High survivor.

62
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,900
这位叫钱德勒  菲比 乔伊
This is everybody. This is Chandler and Phoebe and Joey.

63
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,360
还记得我哥罗斯吗?
And remember my brother, Ross?

64
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,650
当然       嗨
Sure!         Hey.

65
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,730
嗨       偶买糕的
Hi.         Oh, God.

66
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,925
你是想现在告诉我们
So you wanna tell us now,

67
00:04:09,925 --> 00:04:12,120
还是等你的伴娘来?
or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

68
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,340
呃 好吧 婚礼前半个小时发生了变数
Oh, God! Well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding.

69
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,920
我在堆放礼物的房间里 
I was in this room with all the presents

70
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,920
看着船形卤肉盘 
and I was looking at this gravy boat.

71
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,550
非常漂后的船形卤肉盘 
This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.

72
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,550
突然间 低脂糖?
When all of a sudden Sweet 'N Low?

73
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,850
我意识到
I realized

74
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,940
船形卤肉盘比巴瑞更能引起我的"性趣"
I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry.

75
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,150
当我意识到巴瑞愈看愈像薯头先生时 
Then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me:

76
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,110
我自己都吓了一跳
How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head.

77
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,780
我是说 我一直都认为他很眼熟
You know, I mean, I always knew he looked familiar, but

78
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,290
总之 我必须离开 我开始想 
Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering:

79
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,120
我为何这么做? 我为谁这样做?
Why am I doing this? and Who am I doing this for?

80
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,238
于是我不知该走往何处
Anyway, I just didn't know where to go,

81
00:04:57,238 --> 00:04:59,670
我知道你我日渐疏远
and I know you and I have drifted apart

82
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,710
但是你是我在这个城市 认识的唯一一个人
but you're the only person I know in the city.

83
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,590
也是唯一没受邀参加婚礼的人
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.

84
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,880
这件事就甭提啦
Oh, I was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue.

85
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,570
我猜他送她一台管风琴 
I'm guessing he bought her the big pipe organ

86
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,200
她肯定不喜欢 
and she's really not happy about it.

87
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,490
爸 我不能嫁给他 
Daddy, I just I can't marry him.

88
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,330
对不起 
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,370
我只是不爱他
I just don't love him.

90
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,500
对 是我的问题
Well, it matters to me.

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,380
她不该穿那条裤子
She should not be wearing those pants.

92
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,550
我建议把她推下去
I say push her down the stairs.

93
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,970
推她下楼 推她下楼 推她下楼
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!

94
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,230
爸 你听我说 
Come on, Daddy, listen to me!

95
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,980
大家这样评价我这一辈子 你是一只鞋
It's like all of my life, everyone's always told me, You're a shoe!

96
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,230
你是一只鞋 
You're a shoe! You're a shoe! You're a shoe!

97
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,610
今天我倒想看看如果我不再是鞋会怎样
Then today I stopped and said, What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

98
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,990
我说如果我想当皮包呢?
What if I wanna be a purse? You know?

99
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,950
或是帽子呢?
Or a hat?

100
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,410
不 我不需你帮我买帽子 我说我是一顶帽子
I don't want you to buy me a hat, I am a hat.

101
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,790
爸 这是一种比喻
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

102
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,380
你看他也有些问题
You can see where he'd have trouble.

103
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,510
爸 这是我的人生
Look, Daddy, it's my life.

104
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,300
或许我会和莫妮卡住在这儿
Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.

105
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,810
我想我们已确定好谁要和莫妮卡住在这儿
I guess we've established she's staying with Monica.

106
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,690
或许那是我的决定
Well, maybe that's my decision.

107
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,520
或许我不希罕你的钱
Well, maybe I don't need your money.

108
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,940
等一下 等一下 我说的是或许
Wait! Wait! I said maybe!

109
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,120
深呼吸 就这样
Okay. Just breathe, that's it.

110
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,790
试着想着美好的事物 
Just try to think of nice, calm things.

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,870
玫瑰上的雨滴 猫嘴上的胡须 
Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens

112
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,210
门铃和雪橇之类的
Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens

113
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,340
啦啦啦 还有手套 
Lalala something With string

114
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,390
我现在好多了
I'm all better now.

115
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,180
我的功劳
I helped.

116
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,180
哎 这可能是件好事呢!
Look, this is probably for the best, you know?

117
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,060
要自立 决定自己的事情
Independence. Taking control of your life.

118
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:28,610
嗨 如果你需要什么尽管来找我好了
And, hey, if you need anything, you can always come to Joey.

119
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,425
我和钱德勒就住在对面
Me and Chandler live right across the hall.

120
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:32,200
而且他经常不在家
And he's away a lot.

121
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,620
你别挑逗她了 今天可是她的结婚之日
Joey, stop hitting on her. It's her wedding day.

122
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,790
怎么啦?难道还有什么明文规定不成?
What? Like there's a rule or something?

123
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,880
别再这样 声音很刺耳
Please don't do that again. It's a horrible sound.

124
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,460
我是保罗天啊      让他进来
Uh, it's Paul.         Buzz him in.

125
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,050
保罗是谁?      调酒的那个保罗?
Who's Paul?         Paul, the wine guy, Paul?

126
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,300
或许吧
Maybe.

127
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,155
等等 你今晚该不是真的要和
Wait a minute. Your 'not a real date'

128
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:54,800
调酒的那个保罗约会吧?
 is with Paul, the wine guy?

129
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,800
他终于开口约你了?对
He finally asked you out?         Yes.

130
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,760
终于被你等到了
Ooh. This is a Dear Diary moment.

131
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,810
瑞秋 你看 我可以取消
Rach, wait, I can cancel.

132
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,850
不用了 你去吧 我不会有事的
Please, no. Go, I'll be fine.

133
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,730
罗斯 你没事吧 你要我留下来吗?
Ross, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?

134
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,730
那样最好 
That'd be good.

135
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,612
真的吗?
Really?

136
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:14,860
假的 去吧是保罗 调酒师耶
No, go on! It's Paul, the wine guy.

137
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,120
请进 保罗 这位是 
Hi,come in. Paul, this is

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,540
 各位 各位 他就是保罗
everybody. Everybody, this is Paul.

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,040
保罗 调酒大师
Paul, the wine guy.

140
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,090
调酒大师      抱歉 我没听清楚你名字 保罗 是吗?
Wine guy.         I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?

141
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,050
换衣服请坐 两秒钟
Okay. Sit down. Two seconds.

142
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,310
我刚拔掉四根睫毛 不妙
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.

143
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,730
瑞秋 你打算如何渡过今晚?
So, Rachel, what are you up to tonight?

144
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,110
我应该在前往阿鲁巴渡蜜月的途中 
Well, I was supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon

145
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,320
因此没了
so, nothing.

146
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,950
我懂 你没去渡蜜月
Right. You're not even getting your honeymoon.

147
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,200
虽然阿鲁巴在此时 
God. No, no. Although, Aruba. Heh. This time of year? Eh.

148
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,950
有很多
Talk about your

149
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,160
大蜥蜴
big lizards.

150
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,670
如果你今晚不想独处 
Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight

151
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,710
乔伊和钱德勒要到我那儿帮我组合新家俱 
Joey and Chandler are helping me with my furniture.

152
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,050
对 我们都相当兴奋
Yes, and we're very excited about it.

153
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,550
谢谢 但我今晚想待在这儿 
Actually, thanks, but I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.

154
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,760
我折磨了一天        好吧 当然
It's been a long day.         Oh, sure. Okay. Sure.

155
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,270
菲比 想帮忙吗?
Hey, Pheebs, you wanna help?

156
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,640
我可以去  但我不想去
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.

157
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,280
我应该用蜗杆
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things

158
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,240
将托架装在侧面 
using a bunch of these little worm guys.

159
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:48,160
但我没看见托架和蜗杆
I have no brackety thing, I see no worm guys whatsoever

160
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,420
而且 我的脚好麻
and I cannot feel my legs.

161
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,050
这是什么?
What's this?

162
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,260
我也不知道
I have no idea.

163
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,550
书架做好了        终于做好了
Done with the bookcase.         All finished.

164
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,930
这是卡罗最爱喝的啤酒
This was Carol's favorite beer.

165
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,690
从易拉罐里喝 我早应该看出蛛丝马迹
She always drank it out of the can. I should have known.

166
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,070
罗斯 我问你一个问题
Hey. Ross, let me ask you a question.

167
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,450
她分得家俱 音响和好电视
She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV.

168
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,660
你分得什么?
What did you get?

169
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,030
 你们
You guys.

170
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,280
天啊       你昏头了吧
Oh, God. Oh, my God.         You got screwed.

171
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,790
嗯 天啊      我知道 我是个大白痴
Oh, my God.         I know, I know. I'm such an idiot.

172
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,880
她每周看四五次牙医时我就该了解
I should've caught on when she went to the dentist four and five times a week.

173
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,250
我指牙齿能有多干净?
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

174
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,840
我哥正承受着这种痛苦  一副失魂落魄的样子
My brother's going through that. He's such a mess.

175
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,680
你是怎么熬过来的?
How did you get through it?

176
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,390
你可以不小心砸烂她贵重的东西 比如她的 
He might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers.

177
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,140
她的         腿?
Say her         Leg?

178
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,220
这样也不赖我 
Heh. That's one way of going through it, yeah.

179
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,310
我砸烂了她的表
Me, I went for the watch.

180
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,650
你真的砸烂过她的表?         对啊
You actually broke her watch?         Mm.

181
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,360
巴瑞 真是对不起
Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

182
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,175
你一定认为此事与我那次说的话有关
You probably think it's about

183
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:01,530
关于你做爱时穿着袜子 其实不是
making love with your socks on, but it isn't.

184
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,530
问题出在我身上 我 
It isn't, it's about me. And I

185
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,630
答录机又把我挂断了 不管怎样
Hi. Machine cut me off again. Anyway

186
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,113
你知道最可怕的是什么?
You know what's scary?

187
00:11:18,113 --> 00:11:20,510
要是每个人只能有一个女人?
What if there's only one woman for everybody?

188
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,487
我是说 要是你找到一个女人(做另一半)
I mean, what if you get one woman,

189
00:11:22,487 --> 00:11:24,050
然后就不能在找了?
and that's it?

190
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,112
不幸的是 我这件事里
Unfortunately, in my case,

191
00:11:26,112 --> 00:11:29,100
那个一个女人是给"她"准备的
there was only one woman for her.

192
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,810
你在说什么?一个女人
What are you talking about? One woman.

193
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,020
那就像在说你只能吃一种口味的冰淇淋 
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you.

194
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,940
罗斯 告诉你吧  冰淇淋的口种有千百种
Let me tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there.

195
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,570
有各种点心糖果冰淇淋 
There's rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla.

196
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,700
你可以加上小糖条或是核果  或是奶油 
You can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream.

197
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,620
这是你一生中最美好的事
This is the best thing that ever happened to you.

198
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,670
你八岁时就结婚了吧?
You got married. You were like, what, 8?

199
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,630
欢迎来到世界 抓住勺子
Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon.

200
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,340
我真的不知道自己是饥渴还是欲火焚身?
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.

201
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,180
那么就别碰我家的冰箱
Then stay out of my freezer.

202
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,350
自从她甩掉我之后我 
Ever since she walked out on me, I

203
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,650
什么?  
What? What?

204
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,650
什么 你打算边嚼面条边讲?
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

205
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,440
不 这就像是"第五次约会真情告白"
No, it's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.

206
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,280
有第五次约会?
Oh, so there's gonna be a fifth date?

207
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,490
不需要吗?
Isn't there?

208
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,870
需要 我想需要的
Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

209
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,420
你刚才想说什么?
What were you gonna say?

210
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,170
这个 呃 
Well Er, uh

211
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,550
自从她离开后 
Ever since she left me, um

212
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,970
我就一直无法 没做过 
I haven't been able to perform

213
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,430
爱
sexually.

214
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,810
天啊 天啊 对不起 对不起
Oh, God! Oh, God! I am soI'm so sorry.

215
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,230
没关系 
It's okay.

216
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,850
你现在需要的应该不是让人吐口水吧
Being spit on is probably not what you need right now.

217
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,190
多久了?
How long?

218
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,820
两年了
Two years.

219
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,280
哇
Wow!

220
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,410
真高兴你砸烂了她的表
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

221
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,790
你还想要第五次约会?
So you still think you might want that fifth date?

222
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,330
 当然想
Yeah.

223
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,340
 当然想
Yeah, I do.

224
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,215
我乔安妮愿意嫁给查尔斯
I, Joanie, take you, Charles

225
00:13:23,215 --> 00:13:24,880
为我的终身伴侣
as my lawful husband.

226
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,738
你是否愿意让乔乔安妮      喔 看
Do you take Joanie?         Oh! See.

227
00:13:28,738 --> 00:13:31,237
乔安妮爱的是恰棋
But Joanie loved Chachi.

228
00:13:31,237 --> 00:13:33,487
差别就在这儿
 That's the difference.

229
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,770
抓住勺子
"Grab a spoon."

230
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,600
知道我等着"抓这把勺子"等了多久吗?
Do you know long it's been since I grabbed a spoon?

231
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,738
那"比利 不要成为一个英雄"
Do the words, "Billy, don't be a hero,"

232
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,112
这个故事对你有何启发?
mean anything to you?

233
00:13:43,112 --> 00:13:44,988
(著名反战歌 罗斯把找新女友比喻成上战场)

234
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:49,700
就算我鼓起勇气
You know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough

235
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,410
约女人出去
to ask a woman out

236
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,290
但我要约谁呀?
who am I gonna ask?

237
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,980
神奇吧?我这辈子从没泡过咖啡
Isn't this amazing?

238
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,480
我这辈子从没泡过咖啡
I mean, I have never made coffee before in my life.

239
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,150
真神奇      恭喜了
That is amazing.        Congratulations.

240
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,070
如果你兴致大发想做蛋饼 
While you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make a Western omelet or something

241
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,450
老实说我不太饿 
Although, actually I'm really not that hungry this morning.

242
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,700
早安 早安
Good morning. Good morning.

243
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,500
早安 早安
Morning. Morning.

244
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,580
早安      早安 保罗
Morning.         Morning, Paul.

245
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,960
你好 保罗       嗨 保罗 是吗?
Hello, Paul.         Hi. Paul, is it?

246
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,840
昨晚真是太棒了
I had a really great time last night.

247
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,890
谢谢你太谢谢你了
Thank you.Thank you so much.

248
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,470
晚点打电话      好的
We'll talk later, okay?        Yeah.

249
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,980
谢谢
Thank you.

250
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,610
那还不叫约会?
That wasn't a real date.

251
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,160
那你真正的约会到底干些什么?
What the hell do you do on a real date?

252
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,500
闭嘴 把桌子抬回去      好吧
Shut up and put my table back.        Okay.

253
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,540
孩子们 我要上班去了
All right, kids, I gotta get to work.

254
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:28,250
如果我不输入那些数字 也没什么关系 
If I don't input those numbers, it doesn't make much of a difference.

255
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,430
你们大伙儿都有工作?
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

256
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,890
对 我们都有工作
Yeah, we all have jobs.

257
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,720
这样才有钱买东西
See, that's how we buy stuff.

258
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,640
对 我是个演员
Yeah, I'm an actor.

259
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,060
我见过你吗?
Wow. Would I have seen you in anything?

260
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,300
大概没见过吧
Oh, I doubt it.

261
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,610
我大部份都是在地区性的节目中演出
Mostly regional work.

262
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,400
等等 除非你看过皮诺曹的重播
Unless you happened to catch the Wee One's production of Pinocchio.

263
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,200
瞧 盖佩多 我是个活生生的小男孩
"Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy."

264
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,740
 我不会理睬这种羞辱
I will not take this abuse.

265
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,910
你说得对 抱歉
You're right. I'm sorry.

266
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,040
"我曾是个小木偶 小木偶 "

267
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,460
今天感觉如何? 睡得还好吧?
So how are you doing today? Did you sleep okay?

268
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,010
和巴瑞通过电话吗? 我无法停止笑
Did you talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.

269
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,650
我看得出来
I can see that.

270
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,680
你好像嘴里有一个衣架把嘴撑住了
You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.

271
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,400
我知道 他是那么

272
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,110
还记得你和东尼戴马克?
Remember you and Tony De Marco?

273
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,320
当然！     就像那样那样感觉
Oh,yeah!      Well, it's like that. With feelings.

274
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,860
你惹上麻烦了
Oh, wow, are you in trouble!

275
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:39,330
我要清醒 去工作
Okay, okay. I am just going to get up, go to work

276
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,200
整天都不想他 
and not think about him all day.

277
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,330
或者只是清醒然后去工作
Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.

278
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,130
祝我幸运      为什么?
Oh, wish me luck!        What for?

279
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,630
我要去找工作
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.

280
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,220
嗨 莫妮卡      法兰妮 欢迎回来
Hey, Monica.         Hey, Franny. Welcome back.

281
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,890
佛罗里达如何?
How was Florida?

282
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,390
你们上床了 对不?
You had sex, didn't you?

283
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,310
你怎么看出来的?
How do you do that?

284
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,230
那么和谁呀? 认识保罗吗?
You know Paul.

285
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,360
保罗 那个调酒的?

286
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,110
对 我认识保罗

287
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,160
你认识保罗像我认识他一样?
You mean, you know Paul like I know Paul?

288
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,660
开玩笑 他还得谢我呢
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul.

289
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:27,960
遇到我之前他已有两年没做爱了
Before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.

290
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,760
显然他是骗你的
Of course it was a line.

291
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,840
为什么? 为什么会有人那样做?
Why? Why would anybody do something like that?

292
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:40,300
我想答案比
We're looking for an answer more sophisticated than:

293
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,390
"设法骗你上床"更复杂
"To get you into bed."

294
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,020
问题出在我身上?
Is it me?

295
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,730
难道我有特殊气味
Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs

296
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,520
只有狗和感情有严着问题的男人才闻得到
and men with severe emotional problems can hear?

297
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,650
过来 脚给我
All right, come here. Give me your feet.

298
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,990
我以为他是个好男人
I just thought he was nice, you know?

299
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,330
我无法相信你不懂这是骗局
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line.

300
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,250
猜猜看?
Guess what.

301
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,210
你找到工作了?      开玩笑?
You got a job?         Are you kidding?

302
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,050
我书都白念了
I'm trained for nothing.

303
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,930
今天的十二个面试全泡汤了
I was laughed out of 12 interviews today.

304
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,640
不过你却异常兴奋
Yet you're surprisingly upbeat.

305
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,113
换成是你 你也会一样
Well, you would be too

306
00:18:25,113 --> 00:18:27,350
如果你遇见John and David的皮靴
if you found Joan and David boots on sale

307
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,270
打五折
50 percent off.

308
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,270
你真是太了解我了
Oh, how well you know me.

309
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,360
这是我的新皮靴  我不需要工作 不需要父母 
They're my new "I don't need a job or my parents.

310
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,780
因为我有新皮靴
I've got great boots" boots.

311
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,360
你怎么付钱?      信用卡啊
How'd you pay for them?         Uh, credit card.

312
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,570
卡费谁费?
And who pays for that?

313
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,330
我爸
Um, my father.

314
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,080
成熟点 你不能靠你爸一辈子
You can't live off your parents your whole life.

315
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,960
我知道 所以我选择结婚
I know that. That's why I was getting married.

316
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,340
饶了她吧 第一次独立并不轻松
Give her a break. It's hard being on your own for the first time.

317
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,010
谢谢      不客气
Thank you.         You're welcome.

318
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,112
我记得我第一次来到纽约时的情况
I remember when I first came to this city,

319
00:19:02,112 --> 00:19:02,890
当时我十四岁
I was 14.

320
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,930
我妈刚自杀  我继父再度入狱 
My mom had killed herself and my stepdad was back in prison.

321
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,140
我在这儿人生地不熟
And I got here, and I didn't know anybody.

322
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,487
最后我和患白化症的男人同居
I ended up living with this albino guy

323
00:19:10,487 --> 00:19:13,112
他为港务局的人清洗车窗
who was cleaning windshields outside Port Authority.

324
00:19:13,112 --> 00:19:15,650
后来他自杀了
And then he killed himself.

325
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,112
然后我找到芳香按摩治疗的工作
And then I found aromatherapy.

326
00:19:18,112 --> 00:19:20,240
所以请相信我你的心情我能体会
So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.

327
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,120
你需要的是 
The word you're looking for is:

328
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,950
无论如何
"Anyway"

329
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,250
好的 准备好了吗?
All right. You ready?

330
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,130
不不 不 我没准备好      别磨蹭了
I don't think so.        Oh, come on.

那是保罗的手表
That's Paul's watch.

342
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,670
放回原地就好了

You probably didn't know this, but back in high school I had

And try not to let my vulnerability become any kind of a factor here.
