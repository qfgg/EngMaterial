79
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,028
别以为我没那种念头
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.

80
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,999
快一点
Come on, somebody.

81
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,542
轮到我了
I'll go. I'll go.

82
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,963
大四那年在撞球台上
Okay, um, senior year of college, on a pool table.

83
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,665

Pool table?

84

这就是我妹妹
That's my sister.

85
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,635
我最奇怪的地点是...
Okay, okay. My weirdest place would have to be...

86
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:55,477
纽约市立图书馆二楼的女厕
...the women's room on the second floor of the New York City Public Library.

87
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,605
天啊 你去图书馆做什么?

88
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:04,612
菲比 你呢?      密尔瓦基
Pheebs, what about you?        Oh, um, Milwaukee.

89
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,738
罗斯
Uh. Ross?

90
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,925
一九八九年 迪士尼乐园的小小世界
Disneyland 1989. "It's a small world after all."

91
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,291
不可能
No way.

92
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,877
游乐设施坏了
The, uh, ride broke down...

93
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,207
卡萝跟我躲在那些荷兰机器儿童后面
Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children.

94
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:31,092
他们修好游乐施备后 要我们永远别回魔法王国
Then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.

95
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,849
瑞秋      少来 我已经说过了
Ooh. Rachel?        I already went.

96
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,968
才没有      我说过了
You did not go.        Yes, I did.

97
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,769
快告诉我们
Tell us. Come on.

98
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:43,809
好吧 我最奇怪的地点是...
All right, uh, the weirdest place would have to be...

99
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,195
床脚
...the foot of the bed.

100
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,533
不会吧?      冠军已经出炉
Step back.        We have a winner.

101
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,916
我从没有过那么激情的关系
I've never had a relationship with that kind of passion.

102
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:07,675
一定要在游乐园跟某人做爱
Where you have to have somebody right there in the middle of a theme park.

103
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,760
那是那里唯一不必排队的地方
It was the only thing to do there that didn'thave a line.

104
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,599
巴里连在迷你高尔夫球场 都不愿意吻我
Well, Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature-golf course.

105
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,020
真的假的      真的
Come on.        No.

106
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,603
他说我们会挡到后面的人
He said we were holding up the people behind us.

107
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,643
你没有嫁给他是因为...
And you didn't marry him because...?

108
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:32,115
你觉得有人终其一生
Do you think there are people that go through life...

109
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,735
都没有干过那种事情...
never having that kind of...

110
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,619
或许吧      真的吗?
Probably.        Really?

111
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,161
但我得告诉你一件事 大家都太高估激情了
I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.

112
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,874
对      没错
Yeah, right.        It is.

113
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,828
最终激情会褪去
Eventually, it kind of burns out.

114
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,925
但是好在留下了信任和安全感以及...
But hopefully what you're left with is trust and security and, uh....

115
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,086
以我前妻为例吧 成了女同志
In my exwife's case, lesbianism.

116
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,645
对那些错过激情的人来说
For all those people who miss out on that, uh, passion thing...

117
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,479
还是能得到一些好处的
there's other good stuff.

118
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,892
好吧
Okay.

119
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,810
我不相信那种事会发生在你身上
But, um, I don't think that'll be you.

120
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,941
是吗?
You don't?

121
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:15,701
我看得出来 未来你会有段充满激情的感情
See, I see, uh... big passion in your future.

122
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,493
真的吗?
Really?

123
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,029
你那么认为?      没错
You do?        I do.

124
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,800
罗斯 你真的是太棒了
Ross, you're so great.

125
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,552
那是不可能的
It's never gonna happen.

126
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,520
什么?      你跟瑞秋
What?        You and Rachel.

127
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:53,939
为什么?
Why not?

128
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,489
因为你迟迟不肯展开行动
Because you waited too long to make your move...

129
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,663
现在你们进入"朋友区"
and now you're in the "Friend Zone."

130
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,741
不 我不在那一区
No, no, no. I'm not in the Zone.

131
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,039
罗斯 你甚至是区长呢
No Ross. You're mayor of the Zone.

132
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,464
我只是在慢慢来 好吗?
Look, I'm taking my time, all right?

133
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,541
我在打基础
I'm　laying the groundwork.

134
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,344
对 每天我越来越靠近...
Every day I get a little bit closer to, uh...

135
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:17,713
成为神父的日子
Priesthood.

136
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:23,351
罗斯 我得告诉你 她根本不知道你在想什么
Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking.

137
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,806
如果你不赶快约她出去 你们会永远只能做朋友
If you don't ask her out soon，you'll end up stuck in the Zone forever.

138
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,524
我会的 我只是...
I will, I will.

139
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,110
在等时机成熟
I'm waiting for the, uh, right moment.

140
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,064
什么?
What?

141
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,197
现在?      对
What, now        Yeah.

142
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,033
你觉得哪里不对劲?美酒?
What's messing you up? The wine?

143
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,032
蜡烛?月光?
The candles? The moonlight? Huh?

144
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,789
你只需要走过去跟她说 "瑞秋 我…"
You gotta go up to her and say, "Look, Rachel, I think"

145
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,622
什么?      我们会嘘个不停
What are we shushing?        We're shushing...

146
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,384
是因为我们想听一些东西
because were trying to hear something.

147
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,550
什么声音?      你没听到吗?
What?        Uh, dont you hear that?

148
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,678
听到了?
See?

149
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:14,488
你要吃口香糖吗?      是无糖的吗?
Would you like some gum?        Oh. Is it sugarless?

150
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,865
抱歉 不是      不用了 谢谢
Uh, sorry, it's not.        Then, no, thanks.

151
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,484
那是怎么一回事?
What the hell was that?

152
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,995
别忘了 如果吉儿古德克请你吃口香糖 一定要接受
Mental Note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it.

153
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:31,336
就算她要你吃动物尸体 你也得接受
If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.

154
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,883
纽约市停电了
New York City has no power

155
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,755
牛奶发臭了
And the milk is getting sour

156
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,341
但我一点都不怕
But to me it is not scary

157
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:48,679
因为我不吃奶
'Cause I stay away from dairy

158
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,272
来吧      你要开口了?
Here goes.        You'll do it?

159
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,948
没错      需要我帮忙吗?
I'll do it.        Want help?

160
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,443
你敢出来就死定了
You come out there, you're a dead man.

161
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,036
罗斯
Ross, Ross.

162
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,117
祝你好运
Good luck, man.

163
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,282
谢谢
Thanks.

164
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,287
好吧      好吧
Okay.        Okay.

165
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,168
你要去哪里?      外面
Where you going?        Outside.

166
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,113
你不能出去      
You can't go out there.

167
00:11:22,113 --> 00:11:25,738
为什么?      那是有原因的
Why not?        Because of, uh, the reason.

168
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,863
什么原因?
And that would be?

169
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,187
我不能告诉你      乔伊 发生了什么事?
I, uh I can't tell you.        What's going on?

170
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:37,936
听着 你得发誓 你不会告诉罗斯是我说的
Okay, listen. You gotta promise you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.

171
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,023
什么事?      他在筹划你的生日派对
About what?        He's planning your birthday party.

172
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,575
天啊 我爱他
Oh, my God. I love him.

173
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,285
你最好表现出讶异的样子
You better act surprised.

174
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,825
为什么?      我的惊喜派对
About what?        My surprise party.

175
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:53,081
什么惊喜派对?      别装了 乔伊都跟我说了
What surprise party?        Oh, stop it. Joey already told me.

176
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,203
他没有告诉我
Well, he didn'ttell me.

177
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,749
别看我 那是罗斯的事
Don't look at me. This is Ross'thing.

178
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,294
这太老套了 每次我都是最后知道的人
This is so typical. I'm always the last to know everything.

179
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,553
才怪 我们告诉你很多事
You are not. We tell you stuff.

180
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:10,055
钱德在动物园被孔雀咬伤 我是最后一个知道的人
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bit by the peacock at the zoo.

181
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:11,612
我是最后一个知道
I was the last to know

182
00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:13,935
当乔伊刚搬进来时你对他有意思
you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.

183
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,393
什么?
What?

184
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,914
看起来我是倒数第二个
Oh. Looks like I was second to last.

185
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,192
真的好漂亮
It's so nice.

186
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,706
我有个问题
Hey, I have a question.

187
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,916
事实上它算不上是个问题
Uh, actually, it's not so much a question...

188
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,789
那只是好奇...
it's more of a general wondering...

189
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,087
而已
...ment.

190
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,048
好吧      好吧
Okay.        Okay.

191
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,887
我要说了
Here goes.

192
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:53,353
我一直都想要...
Um, well for a while now, I've been wanting to, um...

193
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,188
噢      没错
Oh.        Yes, that's right.

194
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,733
看看那只小猫味
Look at that little kitty.

195
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,022
什么?
What?

196
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:06,942
我攀上世界顶端 俯瞰众生
I'm on the top of the world Looking down on creation

197
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:12,323
我能找到的唯一解释
And the only explanation I can find

198
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:17,703
就是自从你出现我才找到的真爱
Is the love that I found Ever since you ye been around

199
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,294
好吧 这是急救喷雾剂 不会痛的
All right, this is just Bactine. It won't hurt.

200
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,970
抱歉 那是蜡
Sorry, that was wax.

201
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:33,300
可怜的小托蒂吓得半死 我们得找到他的主人
Poor little Tootie's scared. We should find his owner.

202
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,175
我们何不将可怜小托蒂放在走廊上?
Why not put "poor little Tootie" in the hall?

203
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,767
在停电的时候? 它会绊倒的
During a blackout? She'll get trampled.

204
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,476
是吗?
Yeah?

205
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,773
我想了一下 口香糖很完美
You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection.

206
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,859
口香糖很完美?
Gum would be perfection?

207
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,241
口香糖很完美
Gum would be perfection.

208
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:57,042
我应该说"口香糖很棒" 或"我要来一块" 但是不
Could've said, "Gum would be nice." "I'll have a stick." But, no.

209
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:00,503
对我来说口香糖很完美
For me, gum is perfection.

210
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,458
我恨自己
I loathe myself.

211
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:10,551
不 她们是修女 她们憎恨所有生物
Oh, no, the Mellons. They hate all living things, right?

212
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:20,561
嗨 我们刚刚发现这只猫 我们在找他的主人
Hi. We just found this cat...and we're looking for the owner

213
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,143

214
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,154

He seems to hate you. Are you sure?

215
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,148
对 他是我的猫 快还我

You are a very bad man.

221
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,632
你们欠我一只猫
You owe me a cat.

222
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,885

Ha, ha. He doesn't speak much English.

234
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,147
大富翁
Monopoly.

235
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,442
快看
Look at that.

236
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,070
那么...
So, uh...

237
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,148
巴洛是哪来的?
Where did, uh, Paolo come from?

238
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,696
我想是意大利
Italy, I think. Heh.

239
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:58,864
不 我是说今晚他是从哪里 突然进入我们的生活里
No, I mean tonight, in the building? Suddenly into our lives？

240
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,612
那只猫是巴洛的猫 真的很有趣吧?
The cat turned out to be Paclo's cat. Isn't that funny?

241
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:09,416
那真的很有趣 瑞秋一直摸他
That is funny. And Rachel keeps touching him.

242
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:16,298
我到处找过了 但就是找不到那只猫
I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.

243
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,971
我找到他了 他是巴洛的猫
Oh, I found him. It was Paolo's cat.

244
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,599
又来了 我又是最后一个知道的人
Ah. Well, there you go. Last to know again.

245
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,937
既然没有人告诉我 我想他是巴洛吧?
And I'm guessing, since nobody told me, this is Paolo?

246
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,944
巴洛 她是菲比
Oh. Paolo, this is Phoebe.

247
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,776
说得对
You betcha.

248
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,533
好吧 接下来是什么?
All right. Okay. What next?

249
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,238
吹泡泡 好主意
Blow a bubble. A bubble's good.

250
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:49,922
那是种稚气的魅力 看起来很顽皮
It's got a, uh, boyish charm. It's impish.

251
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,544
来吧
Here we go.

252
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,686
做得好 小顽皮
Nice going, imp.

253
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,895
没事 我只需要...
Okay. It's okay. All I need to do is...

254
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:13,113
伸手将它塞回嘴里
...reach over and put it back in my mouth.

255
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,068
救得好 回到正轨 我...
Good save. We're back on track and I'm...

256
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,446
在吃别人的口香糖
...chewing someone else's gum.

257
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,409
这不是我的口香糖 天啊
This is not my gum. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

258
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,291
你现在噎住了
And now you're choking.

259
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,335
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

260
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,381
天啊 你噎住了
Oh, my God. You're choking.

261
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,846
好一点了吗?
Better?

262
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,395
对 谢谢 那是...
Yes. Thank you. That was...

263
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:47,892
那是...
That was...

264
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,561
完美?
Perfection?

265
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,127
他说了什么事那么好笑?
What'd he say that was so funny?

266
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,047
我真的不知道
I have absolutely no idea.

267
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,344
那太老套了
That's classic.

268
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,925
天啊 大伙们 我在做什么?
My God, you guys. What am I doing?

269
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:23,765
这太不像我了
This is so un-me.

如果你答应 我可以帮你上

I know it's totally superficial, and we have nothing in common...

279

连说的语言都不一样
...and we don'teven speak the same language...

280

不 我不是那个意思
Ha. No, not where I was going.

295
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:56,651
