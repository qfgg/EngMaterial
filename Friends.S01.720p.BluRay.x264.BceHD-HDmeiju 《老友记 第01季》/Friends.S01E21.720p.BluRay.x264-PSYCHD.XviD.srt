1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,043
怎么会有人知道你的信用卡号码?
How'd someone get a hold of your credit card number?

2
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:07,671
我也不知道 你看他们花了多少钱
I have no idea. But look how much they spent!

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,362
摩妮卡 冷静点
Monica, would you calm down?

4
00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:11,584
信用卡的人说你只要付你所买的东西
The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,507
但这真的是挥霍无度
Still, it's just such reckless spending.

6
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,588
我想他们偷你的信用卡时
I think when somebody steals your credit card

7
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,804
早就将王法抛诸脑后了
they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.

8
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:28,059
哇 真是怪人 花了69.95元买"神奇拖把"
Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,145
那是我买的
That's me.

10
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,612
噢 它又来了
Oh! Oh, the yuck.

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,780
他又来了
Ross, he's doing it again!

12
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,300
马赛尔 别再侵犯那盏灯了
Marcel, stop humping the lamp!

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,781
不要这样 马赛尔 回来!
Stop humping! Now, Marcel, come back!

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,120
过来这里 马赛尔
Come here, Marcel!

15
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,501
不要!别去我房间!我去抓他
Oh, no, no! Not in my room! I'll get him.

16
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:49,664
罗斯 你得想想办法
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.

17
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,082
怎么了?这只是阶段性的而已
What? It's just a phase.

18
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:55,094
我们也是那样说乔伊的
Well, that's what we said about Joey.

19
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:00,679
放轻松点好吗? 没什么大不了的
Hey, would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.

20
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,226
马赛尔 停! 马赛尔! 坏猴子!
Marcel, stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!

21
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,682
怎么了?
What? Ugh!

22
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:09,175
我只能说 我的好奇乔治娃娃已经不再好奇
Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.

摩妮卡 你不会还在看那个东西吧
Ugh, Monica, you are not still going over that thing.

28
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,707
这个女人在过着我的生活      什么?
This woman's living my life.        What?

29
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:10,832
她过着我的生活 而且过得比我好
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me.

30
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,250
你看这个 看
Look at this. Look.

31
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,487
她买的票是我一直想看的戏剧
She buys tickets to plays I want to see.

32
00:02:16,487 --> 00:02:20,050
她买的衣服是我早就想买的
She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people.

33
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,347
她花三百刀买艺术用品
She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.

34
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,882
你又不是艺术家
You're not an artist.

35
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,053
如果有艺术用品 我或许就已是艺术家了
Yeah, well, I might be if I had the supplies.

36
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,523
这些我都可以做 只是我都没做
I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.

37
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,110
摩妮卡 别这样 你有做很酷的事情啊
Oh, Monica, come on. You do cool things.

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,238
是吗? 来比较一下吧
Oh, really? Ok, let's compare, shall we?

39
00:02:38,238 --> 00:02:41,108
现在说"好吗"是不是太晚了
Oh, it's so late for "shall we?"

40
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,111
我去过公园骑马吗?
Do I go horseback riding in the park, hmm?

41
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,322
我在新学院上过课吗?
Do I take classes at The New School?

42
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,550
不会      不会
No.        No.

43
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,367
太不公平了
This is so unfair

44
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:54,363
她拥有我想要的一切 而且不用应付我妈
She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.

45
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,552
乔伊帕帕尼如何?
How about Joey Paponi?

46
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,112
不行 太有种族意味了
No, still too ethnic.

47
00:03:07,112 --> 00:03:09,363
我的经纪人认为我要取中立一点的名字
My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.

48
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:11,488
乔伊瑞士?
Joey Switzerland?

49
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:20,190
而且我想叫乔 乔伊听起来好像我只有
Plus you know, I think it should be Joe. You know Joey makes me sound like I'm

50
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,607
这么大而已
this big.

51
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:22,991
但我并不是!
Which I'm not!

52
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,872
乔 乔 乔 斯大林?
Joe. Joe. Joe...Stalin?

53
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,284
斯大林
Stalin.

54
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,238
斯大林 我听过那个名字吗? 好耳熟
Stalin, do I know that name? That sounds familiar.

55
00:03:36,238 --> 00:03:39,420
我没印象
Well, it does not ring a bell with me.

56
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,802
乔 斯大林
Joe Stalin.

57
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,847
还挺不错的
You know, that's pretty good.

58
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,555
还可以试试乔瑟夫
You might want to try Joseph.

59
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,523
乔瑟夫 斯大林!
Joseph Stalin!

60
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,316
大家一定会记得!      当然!
I think you'd remember that!        Oh, yes!

61
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,692
"别了 鸟儿" 由乔瑟夫斯大林主演
Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin.

62
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,575
乔瑟夫斯大林是"屋顶上的提琴手"
Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.

63
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,089
嗨      嗨
Hey.        Hey.

64
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,590
嗨
Hi.

65
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,386
我是摩妮卡盖勒
Hi. Uh, yes, this is Monica Geller.

66
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,925
我想我有在你们那儿上课 我想知道是哪些课
Urn, I believe I'm taking some classes with you, and I was wondering what they were.

67
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,144
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

68
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,646
好 太好了
All right, great.

69
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,814
好 谢谢了
Great. Thanks a lot.

70
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,816
我要去上踢踏舞课了
I'm going to tap class.

71
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,229
这样你就可以和偷了你信用的人一起跳舞吗?
What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?

72
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,819
这个女人偷了我的人生 我应该知道她是谁
This woman's got my life. I should get to see who she is.

73
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,675
那就去邮局啊! 我确定她的照片会公布的
Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up!

74
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,675
摩妮卡 你有点失控了
Ok, Monica, you know you're kind of losing it here.

75
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:54,249
这已经变成怪异的执迷
I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.

76
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,675
这太疯狂了
This is madness. It's madness, I tell you.

77
00:04:56,675 --> 00:04:59,050
上帝保佑 摩妮卡别这么做
For the love of God, Monica, don't do it!

78
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,133
谢谢
Thank you.

79
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,097
你们怎么想?
What do you think?

80
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,262
想很多事情
Lots of things.

81
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,098
你觉得她是哪一个?
Which one do you think she is?

82
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,362
有什么需要我帮忙的么?      不用了 谢谢
May I help you?        Oh. no, thanks.

83
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,851
我们只是来参观的
We're just here to observe.

84
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,906
舞蹈课不是用来参观的 舞蹈课是来跳舞的
You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class!

85
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,925
那儿有鞋
Spare shoes are over there.

86
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,029
她什么意思?
What does she mean?

87
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,080
我想她是说"舞蹈课..."
I think she means, "You dance..."

88
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,912
是用来跳的!
a dance class!"

89
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,913
来吧!
Come on, come on, come on!

90
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,665
真的吗?
Really?

91
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,797
嘿 你有看到我的分身吗?
Hey, do you see anybody you think could be me?

92
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:47,587
各位 上次下课后有人留下空的优格瓶
People, last time there were empty yogurt containers lying around after class.

93
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,595
不要再发生这种事了!
Let's not have that happen again!

94
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,136
她可以当你的分身
She could be you.

95
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,058
开始吧
Let's get started.

96
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,689
五 六 五六七八
Five six. Five, six, seven, eight.

97
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,240
我完全不会!
Okay, I'm not getting this!

98
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,535
我完全融入!
I'm totally getting it!

99
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,987
你不会觉得自己有时毫无协调感么?
Do you ever just feel like sometimes you're just so unbelievably uncoordinated?

100
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,424
怎么了? 他们踢的时候你跟着踢就是了
What? You just click when they click.

101
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,800
好了 现在每个人找个舞伴
All right, people. Now everyone grab a partner

102
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:41,863
好吧 我死去的妈妈说就是你 我和瑞秋
All right. And my dead mother said you are it! I'm with Rachel.

103
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:45,112
太好了 体育课的旧事又重演了
Great. It's gym class all over again.

104
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,778
没关系 你可以来前面和我跳舞
That's all right. You can come up to the front and dance with me.

105
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,991
我还不如脱掉衣服做个恶梦算了?
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare?

106
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:04,963
没关系 我来了! 很抱歉我迟到了
It's okay, it's okay! I'm here, I'm here. I'm so sorry I'm late.

107
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,373
好 我到了
Okay, here I am.

108
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,363
这位紧张的新人是谁?
So who's the new tense girl?

109
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,760
她是你的舞伴
She's your partner

110
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,925
嗨 我是摩妮卡

114
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,564
摩娜娜?      是的
Mon Nana?        Yeah.

115
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,601
是荷兰语
It's Dutch.

116
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:29,317
开玩笑吧 我在阿姆斯特丹待了三年
You're kidding. I spent three years in Amsterdam.

117
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,156
我是宾州的荷兰人
Urn, Pennsylvania Dutch.

118
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,612
要跳舞了!
And we're dancing!

119
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,533
五 六 七 八
Five, six, seven, eight.

120
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,919
嗨
Hi.

121
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,343
嗨      嗨
Hey.        Hey.

122
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,756
你去哪了?      我刚从兽医那儿回来
Where have you been?        I just got back from the vet.

123
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:59,594
她不会叫你戴那些塑胶套吧?
She's not gonna make you wear a big plastic cone, is she?

124
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,641
她说马赛尔乱性不是暂时的
She says Marcel's humping thing is not a phase.

125
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,061
显然他已经性成熟了
Apparently, he's reached sexual maturity.

126
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,147
嘿 他比你还快诶!
Hey, he beat you!

127
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:20,906
她说他会越来越暴力 侵略性越来越强
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting aggressive and violent.

128
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,582
什么意思?
So what does this mean?

129
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,987
我得放弃他
I'm gonna have to give him up.

130
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,640
我不相信 罗斯 这太扯了!
I can't believe it. Ross, this sucks!

131
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:50,310
我不懂 你才刚养它 它怎么可能已经成年了?
I don't get it. I mean, you just got him. How could he be an adult already?

132
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,776
我知道 前一天它还是这么小的东西
I know I know. I mean, one day he's this little thing

133
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,441
不知不觉中就变成
and before you know it, he's this little thing

134
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,235
紧抓我的腿不放的小东西
I can't get off my leg.

135
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,451
没有办法能留下他吗?
Isn't there any way you can keep him?

136
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,660
没有
No. No.

137
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:07,669
兽医说除非有个地方能让他通过正常途径
The vet said that unless he's in a place where he has regular access

138
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,082
获得猴爱
to some monkey loving

139
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,134
否则他会越来越残暴
he's just gonna get vicious.

140
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,172
我得把他送到动物园
I just gotta get him into a zoo.

141
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,847
要怎么把猴子送到动物园?      我知道!
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?        I know that one!

142
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,270
不 那是教皇进入福斯汽车
No, that's popes into a Volkswagen.

143
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:36,800
我们申请了很多动物园 首选是州立动物园
We're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos.

144
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,025
像是圣地亚哥
You know, like. uh, San Diego.

145
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,361
对吧?
Right?

146
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:45,873
但那可能是遥不可及的梦想 因为他来自州外
But that may just be a pipe dream, because, you know, he's out of state.

147
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:52,505
我的兽医在迈阿密有认识人 所以那儿有可能
My vet knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.

148
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:56,675
但那里离海滩只有两条街 肯定是个派对动物园
But that's two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.

149
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,014
嗨
Hey.

150
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,550
嗨      我们找到那个女生了!
Hi.        We found the girl!

151
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,760
什么?      你们报警了吗?
What?        Did you call the cops?

152
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,520
没 我们请她吃午餐
Nope. We took her to lunch.

153
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,800
你们自己的"自治正义"
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.

154
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,300
你疯了吗?这个女人偷了你的东西!
Are you insane? This woman stole from you!

155
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,800
她偷东西 是小偷啊!
She stole! She's a stealer!

156
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:22,175
跟她相处十分钟 之后你就会把这些全忘了
You know what? After you're with this woman for like, 10 minutes, you forget all that.

157
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,300
她真的是个奇女子
I mean, she's this astounding person

158
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,550
振奋人心!
with this amazing spirit!

159
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,800
可能是从啦啦队员那里偷来的!
Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader!

160
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,925
把帽子脱掉      福斯车里的教皇!
Take off their hats.        Popes in a Volkswagen!

161
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,679
我喜欢那个笑话
I love that joke.

162
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:50,181
不可能! 你不可能这么做!      摩娜娜很勇敢
No way! No way did you do this!        Monana was very brave.

163
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,939
这太疯狂了
It was so wild.

164
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,068
我们跟他们说 我们是615号房的冈氏姐妹
We told them we were the Gunnersons in room 615...

165
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:59,106
结果波士顿的塞尔蒂克队已经包下整个六楼!
only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!

166
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:02,776
当他们发现我们很矮而且有胸部后
So when they caught on to the fact that we're, you know, short and have breasts

167
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:07,737
他们把我们轰出去 我被饭店赶出去 我!
They threw us out. I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!

168
00:11:07,737 --> 00:11:09,158
好样的 摩娜娜!
Go, Monana!

169
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:14,959
不是只有你们活在梦中
Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream.

170
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:20,002
我得去为我不认识的人倒咖啡了 不用等我
I get to go pour coffee for people I don'tknow. Don't wait up.

171
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,342
噢 还有一件事
Oh, by the way

172
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,804
我们明天要去参加百老汇的试镜
Tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.

173
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,306
什么?
Excuse me?

174
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,186
"猫"有一个缺额
There's an open call for Cats.

175
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,675
我想我们可以去 演唱"回忆"
I'm thinking we go down there, sing "Memories"

176
00:11:34,675 --> 00:11:37,988
完全把自己当成傻子 你觉得怎样?
and make complete fools of ourselves. What do you say?

177
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,484
不 不 不
No no, no.

178
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,320
记得你身边的人是谁
Remember who you're dealing with here. Ha.

179
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,657
我不像你 我甚至不能站在踢踏舞教室前面
I mean, I'm not like you. I can't even stand in front of a tap class.

180
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,488
那可能是因为你有阿米许的背景
That's just probably because of your Amish background.

181
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,914
什么?      你是宾州的荷兰人 对吧?
What?        Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?

182
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,168
对的
Right.

183
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,832
直到我买了吹风机 就被逐出村里
Till I bought a blow dryer Then I was shunned.

184
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,488
我以前就跟你一样
I used to be just like you.

185
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:06,222
然后有一天 我看了一部改变我一生的电影
And then one day, I saw a movie that changed my life.

186
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,308
你看过"死亡诗社"吗?
Did you ever see Dead Poets Society?

187
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:13,142
我觉得那部电影超级
I thought that movie was so incredibly

188
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,113
无聊!
boring!

189
00:12:15,113 --> 00:12:17,062
最后那个孩子
I mean, that thing at the end where the kid

190
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,487
自杀只是因为不能参加话剧演出?
kills himself because he can't be in the play?

191
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,988
那是在干什么?
What was that?

192
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:27,378
孩子 等一年 离开家 去社区话剧团
It's like, "Kid, wait a year. Leave home, do some community theater!"

193
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,788
我走出戏院后 心想
I walked out of there, and I thought

194
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,373
"我浪费了永远拿不回来的两小时人生"
"Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back!"

195
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,612
那个想法震撼了我 从此我及时行乐
And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.

196
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,083
哇奥
Wow.

197
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,674
那我绝对不推荐你看"窈窕奶爸"
Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.

198
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,512
天啊
Oh. God.

199
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,186
我们进不了斯克兰顿
We didn't get into Scranton.

200
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,944
那是我们的保底动物园
That was our safety zoo.

201
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,815
他们连狗和牛都收
They take, like, dogs and cows.

202
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,236
看吧
See?

203
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,872
我不知道是我还是他比较难受
I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.

204
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,618
我想是那张椅子最难受
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt of it.

205
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,584
马赛尔 马赛尔
Marcel. Marcel.

206
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,043
马赛尔 不要弄了
Marcel. No.

207
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,251
好孩子!
Good boy!

208
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,512
看到了吗?怎么可能没人要他?
See? How can nobody want him?

209
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,593
会有人要的
Somebody will.

210
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,800
你们知道 已经有个乔瑟夫斯大林了吗?
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?

211
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,362
你在开玩笑吧!
You're kidding!

212
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:47,800
显然他是个俄国独裁者 屠杀过很多人
Apparently, he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people!

213
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:52,987
你怎么会不知道!      你想我该知道的
You'd think you would've known that!        You know you'd think I would've.

214
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:59,207
菲比 你觉得什么艺名适合我?
Phoebe, what do you think a good stage name for me would be?

215
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,862
火焰男孩!
Flame Boy!

216
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,889
你的动物园在哪里?
Where exactly is your zoo?

217
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,802
就技术上而言 它不能算是动物园
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se.

218
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:18,175
它比较像是互动的野生体验
It's, uh, more of an interactive wildlife experience.

219
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,550
让我问问你几个问题 他叫马赛尔 对吧?
Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?

220
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,067
对      对
Yes.        Yes. Uh...

221
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,925
他会和其他动物打架吗?
Does he, uh, fight with other animals?

222
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,322
不 他非常温顺
No, no. He's very docile.

223
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,739
即使被逼到角落去呢?
Hmm. Even if he were cornered?

224
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,248
嗯 我不太清楚 为什么问这个?
Well, I don't know. Why?

225
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,456
他掌控小东西的能力为何?
Urn, how is he at handling small objects?

226
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,330
他可以握住香蕉 如果你是这个意思的话
He can hold a banana, if that's what you mean.

227
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:49,112
铁槌或小刀呢?
What about a hammer or a small blade?

228
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,924
他为什么会需要小刀?
Why, why, why would he need a blade?

229
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,186
如果他得面对猎豹或有角的动物
If he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns

230
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,438
总得给他点东西自我防卫吧
you've got to give the little guy something.

231
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,894
否则就太残忍了!
Otherwise it's just cruel!

232
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,067
他能去圣地亚哥了!
He got into San Diego!

233
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,401
什么?      对
What?        Yeah.

234
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,817
我们散步回来后 电话响了
We were coming back from our walking, and the phone was ringing

235
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,610
他进了!      他进了?
He's in!        He's in? Ah!

236
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,620
你听到了吗 马赛尔?
Did you hear that, Marcel?

237
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,578
是圣地亚哥! 圣地亚哥! 太棒了!
San Diego! San Diego! Yeah!

238
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,869
你正在犯下大错 圣地亚哥是不错
You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's well and good...

239
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,380
但如果你把他交给我 我会训练他对抗瞎眼的兔子
but if you give him to me, I'll start him against a blind rabbit

240
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,542
还给你百分之二十的门票收入
and give you 20 percent of the gate.

241
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,565
哟吼
Yoho!

242
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,106
你去哪儿了?
Where the hell've you been?

243
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,241
摩妮卡和我刚跑去参加大使馆派对
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.

244
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,611
你喝醉了吗?
Are you drunk?

245
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,246
才没有!
No!

246
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,369
我在说谎
I'm lying.

247
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,754
我非常醉了!
I am so drunk!

248
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,488
天啊!
Oh, God!

249
00:16:08,737 --> 00:16:11,550
太好了 摩妮卡 你该打个电话回来的
Ugh. Great. Monica, you know what? You could have called.

250
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,173
我一直在家里担心你
I've been up here.I've been worried...

251
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,712
摩妮卡
Monica

252
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,756
摩妮卡?
Monica?

253
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,512
水太棒了!
Water rules!

254
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,100
是的 没错
Yes. Yes it does.

255
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,925
餐厅今天又打电话来了
Ok, look. The restaurant called again today.

256
00:16:29,925 --> 00:16:31,521
他们想知道你还去不去上班
They want to know if you're gonna be showing up for work.

257
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,235
不!
Nope!

258
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,775
我今天要去看大苹果马戏团
I'm going to the Big Apple Circus today.

259
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,992
摩妮卡 你在干嘛? 你会失去工作 你不是这样的
Ok, Monica. What are you doing? You're gonna lose your job. This is not you!

260
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,906
不 这就是我!
No, it is me!

261
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,292
我不只是那种需要拍松枕头
I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows

262
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,753
帐单一来就立刻缴钱的人
and pay the bills as soon as they come in!

263
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:52,675
我跟她在一起时 我就超越了那种人!
You know, when I'm with her, I'm so much more than that!

264
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,506
我是
I'm

265
