I'm going to China.        Jeez, you say one thing and, eh...

你要去中国?      为了博物馆的事 有人发现化石
You're going to China?        It's,uh, for the museum. Someone found a bone.

52
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,035
我们想要化石 可是他们不想给我们化石
We want the bone. They don't want us to have the bone.

53
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:12,662
所以我要去那边说服他们 都是化石惹的祸
So I'm going to try to persuade them. It's a whole big "bone" thing.

54
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,290
总之我要去一个礼拜

Could you take it to Carol's now and then and show it to Ben

58
00:04:28,363 --> 00:04:29,867
这样他才不会忘了我

59
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,978
嗨 小班 我是你爸爸

62
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:50,621
瑞秋在吗? 我想在离开前祝她生日快乐
Is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.

63
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:55,951
她跟卡尔出去喝点东西了      卡尔是谁?
Oh, no, she's out having drinks with Carl.         Oh. Heh. Hey, who's Carl?

64
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,831
就是在咖啡厅碰到的一个男的      不清楚
The guy she met at the coffeehouse?        No.

65
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,594
碰到的一个男的...      在咖啡厅? 对
See, there's this guy she met...        at The coffeehouse? Right.

66
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,842
你知道那个人是谁
So you do know who he is.

67
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,135
好 我要去跟男生们道别
I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.

68
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:17,689
跟他们说化石的事情
Hey, you know what? Tell them that bone story.

69
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,394
嗨      嗨
Hi.        Hey.

70
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:28,032
我得去中国一趟      你是说那个国家吗?
I have to go to China.        The country?

71
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,534
错 是我妈橱柜上的那堆碗盘
No, this big pile of dishes n my Mom's breakfront.

72
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,290
你知道卡尔是谁吗?
Do you guys know who Carl is?

73
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:40,963
我想想 艾尔文 赛门 席尔多...不认识
Let's see. Alvin, Simon, Theodore...No.

74
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,757
瑞秋今晚跟他去喝酒      不是吧！
Well, Rachel's having drinks with him.         Oh. no!

75
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,588
她怎么可以这样? 而且对你一点兴趣也没有
How can she when she's never shown interest in you?

76
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,923
忘了她吧      他说得对
Forget about her.        He's right, man.

77
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:55,140
你要忘了她 快点去中国吧 去吃些好吃的中国菜
Please move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.

78
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,642
当然中国人不会说 自己吃的是"中国菜"
Of course, there they just call it food.

79
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:02,477
大概吧 我不知道
Yeah? I guess. I don't know.

80
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,313
好吧 那就帮我 把这个交给她 好吗?
All right, just give her this for me, okay?

81
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:10,151

And I may only have a couple beers in me. But I love you, man.

83
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,749
我还在喝第一瓶
I'm still on my first.

84
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,959
我觉得你是个好人
I just think you're nice.

85
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,474
我们是那时候开始 经营水果篮生意的
Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this fruit basket business.

86
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:39,305
我们称自己为 "篮子三剑客"
We call ourselves "The Three Basketeers".

87
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,937
就是"三剑客"加上水果
Like "The Three Musketeers" only with fruit.

88
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,271
好
Okay.

89
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,613

How do you like your burgers?

90
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:52,697
不...先拆礼物!吃的等等
No. Presents first, food later!

91
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:58,456
等一下 小老虎 你还好吧? 还撑得下去吗?
Hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?

92
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:03,238
不太好 她以为我们今晚会进展到全垒打的地步...
Well, not so good. She thinks tonight's the night we're gonna complete the transaction...

93
00:07:03,238 --> 00:07:06,465
如果你知道...你知道的嘛
...if you know what I...And you do.

94
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,590
你有想过 就陪在她身边吗?
So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?

95
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,921
什么意思?
What do you mean?

96
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:19,804
你知道 就是单纯的陪伴在她身边
You know, just be there for her.

97
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,644
我听不懂耶
Not following you.

98
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,816
好好想想吧
Think about it.

99
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:38,872
我想这个是来自...
Okay, I'm guessing this is from...

100
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:45,962
梅兰妮 谢谢你      这个是我送的
Well, thank you, Melanie.        Okay, this one right here is from me.

101
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,917
好 很轻 有沙沙声
Hmm. Ah, it's light.

102
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,588
是...
It rattles. It's...

103
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,133

It feels like a book. I think it's a book. Feels like a book. And it's a book!

107
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,234
是 苏西博士
It's Dr. Seuss!

108
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,244
那本书伴我度过 许多艰困的日子
That book got me through some tough times.

109
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,451
这男人心中住着一个小孩
There is a little child inside this man.

110
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,334
医生说如果把孩子从他身体里拿走 他会死的
The doctors say if they remove it, hell die.

111
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,622
这是谁送的?      是罗斯送的
Who's this from?        That's, uh, Ross.

112

天啊 他还记得
Oh, my God. He remembered.

113
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,226
记得什么?      是几个月前的事了
Remembered what?        It was, like, months ago.

114
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,771
我们经过一家古董店 我看到这枚胸针
We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window.

115
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,690
我跟他说这枚胸针 跟我小时候奶奶的胸针很像
I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was little girl.

116
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,484
真不敢相信 他竟然还记得!
Aw! I can't believe he remembered!

117
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,276
可是你能在飞机上玩那个吗?
Well sure. But can you play it on a plane?

118
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:06,160
好美喔! 一定花了他很多钱
Oh, It's so pretty. This must've cost him a fortune.

119
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,425
真是不敢相信
I can't believe he did this.

120
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:09,999
你们记得上大学时 罗斯爱上卡萝...
Ross? Remember back to college, when he fell in love with Carol...

121
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:13,588
买给她一个超贵的水晶鸭吗?
and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?

122
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,132
你刚说什么?
What did you just say?

123
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,604
水晶鸭
Crystal duck.

124
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:39,985
不是 不是 爱上卡萝的那段
No, no, no. The um...The "love" part?

125
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:52,797
我的天啊!      不 不 不
Oh, my God.        Oh, no, no, no, no.

126
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:58,049
很好 继续抓头啊 这样就可以收回你说的话
That's good. Just keep rubbing your head. That'd turn back time.

127
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,890
这真是太难以置信了
This is unbelievable. I mean. This is unbelievable.

128
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,647
是啊 这真是超级大条的事情
I know. This is really, really huge.

129
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:14,319
不 这是小事 微不足道的超级小事
No, it's not. It's small, it's tiny, it's petite, it's wee.

130
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:19,525
我们的生活从此面临巨大转变
I don't think any of our lives will ever be the same ever again.

131
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,494
想办法让这女人闭嘴好吗?
Is there a mute button on this woman?

132
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:27,324
我觉得这样很棒 你跟罗斯在一起很棒!
I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross!

133
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,502
你之前知道吗?      不知道!
Did you have any idea?        No. none.

134
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:34,081
我到纽约的第一个晚上 他说过要约我出去
My first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out.

135
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,792
可是一直都没有发生 所以我以为...
but nothing ever happened, so I just..

136
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,133
他还说了什么? 他有说想跟我约会吗?
What else did he say? Does he want to go out with me?

137
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,805
他既然那么爱你...
Given that he's desperately in love with you...

138
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:46,389
应该不介意跟你喝杯咖啡吧
he wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.

139
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:51,731
罗斯? 他一直都喜欢我? 我得去找他谈谈
Ross? All this time...I've gotta talk to him.

140
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,901
他人在中国啊!      他指的是国家喔
He's in China!        The country.

141
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,529
等等 他的班机四十五分钟后才起飞
Wait, his flight doesn't leave for 45 minutes.

142
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,941
那时差呢? 从这儿到机场的时差?
What about the time difference? From here to the airport?

143
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,654
没错
Yes!

144
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,575
你赶不及的!      我总得试试
You're never gonna make it!        I've got to try.

145
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,782
瑞秋 你要对他说什么?
Rachael. What are you gonna say to him?

146
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,834
我不知道      那你就不该去
I don't know.        Maybe you shouldn't go.

147
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,168
对 如果你是去伤他的心 那就不用急于一时
He's right, because if you're gonna break his heart, that can wait.

148
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,832
对 但如果是好消息 那就马上去告诉他
Yeah, but if it's good news, tell him now.

149
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,862
搞不好等我看到他就会知道
Maybe I'll know when I see him.

150
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:22,887
好吧 这样有帮助吗?
Here, look. All right, does this help?

151
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:32,238
没有 我只知道我等不了一个礼拜
No. All I know is...I cannot wait a week.

152
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:34,191
这件事太让人震撼了
This is just too big.

153
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:38,550
我得跟他谈谈 待会儿见了
I've just got to talk to him. I've got...See you later.

154
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,361
瑞秋 我爱你! 先跟我谈啊!
Rachael, I love you. Deal with me first!

155
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,166
好
All right.

156
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,626
你笑什么?

157
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,709
罗斯
Ross! Ross.

158
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:05,055
罗斯! 不好意思 借过      您的登机证呢?
Excuse me, pardon me.        Hi. Your boarding pass?

159
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,177
我没有登机证 我只是有事得跟我朋友谈谈
No, I need to talk to my friend.

160
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,806
抱歉 没有登机证就无法进去
Sorry, you're not allowed on the jet way unless you have a boarding pass.

161
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,675
我知道 他刚进去 就在那里
He just went on. He's right there,

162
00:12:12,675 --> 00:12:14,768
穿蓝色外套的那个!我可以...
in the blue jacket! Can I just...

163
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,940
抱歉 这是联邦法律规定!
I'm sorry. Federal regulations!

164
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:21,112
好 那你可以帮我传话吗?
All right, um, then could you please just give him a message for me?

165
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,925
拜托 我有重要的事跟他说
Please. This is very important.

166
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:25,366
好吧 你想说什么?
All right. What's the message?

167
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,861
我不知道
Uh, I don't know.

168
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:34,362
不好意思 先生 先生? 有人请我传话给你
Excuse me! Sir! Excuse me! Sir? I have a message for you.

169
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:39,085
瑞秋说她很喜欢你送的礼物 她会等你回来
It's from Rachel. She loved the present. She'll see you when you get back.

170
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,915
什么?
What?

171
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,053
托碧 我不知道她在说什么
Toby, for God sake, I don't know what she's talking about.

172
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:49,682
没有瑞秋这个女人 不要跟我冷战
There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze!

173
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:02,988
噢 乔伊 乔伊 乔伊!
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!

174
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,817
我想我刚失去了知觉
I think I blacked out there for a minute.

175
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,865
这不算什么啦
It was nothing.

176
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:14,074
现在换你享受啦
Well, now we gotta find something fun for you!

177
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,003
等等
Ahh, you know what?

178
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,925
别管我了 你再来一次吧
Forget about me. Let's,uh...Let's give you another turn.

179
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:31,015
我再一次?      有何不可?
Me, again?        Sure. Why not?

180
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:39,600
哇 有人明天 会拿到一个超大的水果篮!
Boy! Somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow!

181
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:47,487
我得说 乔伊 你跟我想像中的完全不一样
I gotta tell you, Joey, you are nothing like I thought you would be.

182
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:49,943
什么意思?
How do you mean?

183
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:54,577
我以为你是 凡事只想到自己的男人
I just had you pegged as one of those guys who are always,"Me,me.me!"

184
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,246
可是你竟然这么替别人着想
But you...you're a giver.

185
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,417
你是我见过最大方体贴的男人
You're like, the most generous man I ever met.

186
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,625
你根本就是个女人
I mean, you're practically a woman.

187
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,343
瑞秋 你要把包装纸留起来吗?
So Rachel, do you want to save this wrapping paper?

188
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,863
只有点破 你想跟罗斯在一起吗? 
It's only a little torn. Are you gonna go for it with Ross,

189
00:14:17,863 --> 00:14:20,356
还是我该把这东西给丢了?
or should I throw it out?

190
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:26,730
我不知道 我不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

191
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,399
我去的时候一直在想...
Thought about it all of the way there...

192
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:34,534
回来的时候也一直想... 竟然是罗斯!
and I thought about it all the way back and, uh... You know, it's Ross!

193
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,115
你们知道我的意思吗? 我跟罗斯耶
You know what I mean? It's Ross.

194
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,075
是啊!      是啊
Sure!        Sure.

195
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:44,464
我不知道 我的直觉告诉我...
I don't know. This is just my initial gut feeling...

196
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:49,048
我想 这样应该会很棒
But I'm thinking...be really great.

197
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,847
天啊 我也这样觉得耶! 我们会变成朋友兼亲家!
Oh, my God, me too! Oh, we'd be like friends in law!

198
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,265
最棒的是 你对他已经很了解
The best part is you already know everything about him.

199
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,596
感觉就像第十五次约会
It's like starting on the 15th date.

200
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:03,229
对啊 一开始就像 已经约会十五次了一样
But it would be like starting on the 15th date.

201
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,023
说的好
Another good point.

202
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:12,530
我的意思是通常约会到第十五次 双方就应该...
No. I mean...At the 15th date, you're already in a relationship place.

203
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,951
确定要在一起了
You're committed.

204
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,783
如果事情不成怎么办?
What happens if it doesn't work out?

205
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,050
为什么会不成?      不知道 有时候就是会这样
Why isn't it working out?       I don't know. Sometimes it doesn't.

206
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,957
他不够帅吗? 还是赚的钱不够多?
Is he not cute enough for you? Does he not make enough money?

207
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,127
不是啦 我只是...      也许她有别的对象
No, I'm just...        Maybe there's someone else.

208
00:15:30,654 --> 00:15:35,238
是吗? 你还有别的对象吗?      没有啊 没有别人
Is there? Is there someone else?        No, there is no one else.

209
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:38,176
那你干嘛甩掉我哥?
Then why the hell...are you dumping my brother?

210
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,905
嘿 大...慈善家
Hey, big...Spender.

211
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,656
她还在睡觉
She's still asleep.

212
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,454
结果怎样?      太神奇了
So how'd it go?        It was amazing.

213
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,702
你知道那种自认很行的感觉吗?
You know how you think you're great in bed?

214
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:04,586
你会问我那种问题 就代表你根本不了解我
The fact you'd even ask shows how little you know me.

215
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:10,003
昨晚我没办法表现 拿手的技巧
Well, it's like last night I couldn't do the thing...that usually makes me great.

216
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,506
所以我只好想别的办法
So I had to do all this other stuff.

217
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,509
结果我得到的回应超赞的 老兄 不是我想自夸
And the response I got! Man, oh, man.

218
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,803
好像去参加碎纸花游行一样开心
It was like a tickertape parade!

219
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:24,769
我知道 我房间 离游行路线非常非常近
Yes I know. As it happens, my room is very close to the parade route.

220
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,864
那种感觉真的很棒 不只是她 我也觉得超赞的
It was amazing, and not just for her...Um, for me too.

221
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,325
那种感觉就像是 我突然间看不见了...
It's like, all of a sudden. I'm blind...

222
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,324
可是其他的感官却都变敏锐
but all my other senses are heightened.

223
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,533
我好像可以体会到...
You know? It's like, I was able to appreciate it...

224
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,666
另一种层次的喜悦
...on another level.

225
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:50,175
我不知道你还有层次可言
I didn't know you had another level.

226
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,363
对啊 我之前也不知道!
I know. Neither did I!

227
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,266
哇 这件裙子真漂亮 是你的生日礼物吗?
Hey, great skirts! Birthday present?

228
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,600
谁送的?      你送的
From who?        From you.

229
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,523
我把你送的衬衫拿去换了
I exchanged the blouse you got me.

230
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,360
心意最重要
Well, it's the thought.

231
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:16,737
罗斯的班机不是快到了吗? 我记得是在登机门27B
Doesn't Ross'flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27B?

232
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,538
对 莫妮卡 我想了很久
Uh, yeah. Monica, you know, I've been thinking about it.

233
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,950
我觉得我不该跟罗斯在一起
I've decided this Ross thing is not a good idea.

234
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,330
为什么?
Why?

235
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,963
因为我会觉得 我不只是在跟他交往
Because I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him.

236
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:35,011
你们大家都会变成我约会的对象 我会有压力...
I would be going out with all of you. Um, there'd be all this pressure and...

237
00:17:35,144 --> 00:17:37,007
没有压力 没有压力的!
No pressure, no pressure!

238
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,641
莫妮卡 我们八字都还没一撇 你就已经这么...
Monica. Nothing has even happened yet and you're already so...

239
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:45,804
我哪有! 好吧 开始我是觉得有点怪...
I'm not so. I was a teensy bit weird at first...

240
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:49,145
可是我发誓不会给你们压力
but I'll be good. I promise.

241
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,697
是谁?      是我 卡尔
Who is it?        It's me, Carl.

242
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,942
上来吧      你背着我哥偷吃?
Come on up.        Behind my brother's back?

243
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:06,704
像这种话 我绝不可能会对你说的
Is the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.

244
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:22,048
七百块!      太棒了!你办到了!
Seven hundred bucks.        All right, you did it.

245
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,558
家里有水果吗?
Do we have any fruit?

246
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,725
真是可怕的两个礼拜
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh?

247
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,895
你知道吗? 我觉得我从中学到很多
You know what, though? I really feel I learned something.

248
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,727
你还要继续 "凡事以她为主"吗?
So you'll stick with this "it's all for her" thing?

249
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,562
你疯了吗?
What, are you crazy?

250
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:42,068
一个盲人恢复视觉之后 还会这样走路吗?
When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?

251
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,501
我只是说 如果再让我看到艾德贝格利...
I'm just saying, if I see one more picture of Ed Begley Junior...

252
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:55,249
在电动车里的照片 我就会自杀!
...in that stupid electric car...I'm gonna shoot myself!

253
00:18:56,344 --> 00:19:00,212
我并不是反对环保...
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against environmental issues, per say...

254
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,092
我只是讨厌那个家伙!
It's just that guy!

255
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:06,509
没想到你竟然宁愿跟他出去 而不是我
I can't believe youd rather go out with him than me.

256
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,929
抱歉 我正在约会耶
Excuse me, please. I'm trying to have a date here.

257
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,524
好 那就停止想我啊
Fine, just stop thinking about me.

258
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,274
做不到是吧?
Can't do it, can you?

259
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,365
我是在想你 那又怎样?
So I'm thinking about you. So what?

260
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,782
我不懂 这个男人到底哪里好?
I don't get it. What do you see in this guy anyway?

261
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,531
他似乎是一个好人
Well, he seems to be a very nice guy.

262
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:32,050
拜托! 你好歹也买部真正的车吧!
I mean, come on, buddy! Get a real car!

263
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:38,800
瑞秋 给我们彼此一个机会吧
Rachel. come on. Give us a chance.

264
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,093
罗斯 这对我来说太难了      不 为什么?
Ross, it's too hard.        No, no.

265
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,613
因为大家会觉得很怪吗?
Because it'11 get weird for everyone else?

266
00:19:43,613 --> 00:19:46,015
谁在乎啊? 这是我们两人的事
Who cares about them? This is about us.

267
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,643
我从高一就开始喜欢你了
I've been in love with you since the ninth grade.

268
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,550
罗斯 你算是我最好的朋友      我知道
You're,like, my best friend.         I know.

269
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,649
如果我们分手 而我失去你的话...
If we broke up, and I lost you...

270
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,646
你为什么会这么想?
Why do you think we'll break up?

271
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:01,196
你有谈过没分手的恋爱吗?
Have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?

272
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,738
没有
No.

273
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,700
可是这种事只需要发生一次
But it only has to happen once.

274
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:13,709
我们都知道我们是天生一对 对不对?
You and I know we are perfect for each other. Right?

275
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:18,290
所以唯一的问题是 你喜欢我吗?
So the only question is: Are you attracted to me?

276
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,376
我不知道
I don't know.

277
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,846
我从来没把你看成恋爱对象
I mean I've never looked at you that way before.

278
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,215
那就从现在开始吧
Well start looking.

279
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,107
哇      没错!
Wow.        Exactly!

280
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,276
这个白痴会害我...
And you just know I'm gonna be the guy...

281
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,784
塞在车阵中的!
Caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!

282
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,077
对! 你说的对
Right. Heh. You're right.

283
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,578
你知道吗?       什么?
You know what?        What?

284
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:57,127
我刚想到我得去机场接朋友
I forgot I'm supposed to pick up a friend at the airport.

285
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,417
我很抱歉!
I am so sorry.I'm so...

286
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,841
如果你想 留在这里把这喝完 请自便
If you want to stay and finish your drinks, please do.

287
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:07,512
抱歉 我得走了 抱歉      可是...
I'm sorry. I gotta go. I'm sorry.        But...

288
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:20,768
抱歉!借过! 抱歉
Excuse me! Pardon me! Excuse me. I'm sorry.

289
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:24,105
托碧 拜托 你别这样好吗?
Toby, for God's sake, will you let it go?

290
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,864
根本没有瑞秋这个女人!
There's no Rachel!

291
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,748
嘿!你掉了这个
Oh, hey. I got that.

292
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,454
谢谢 甜心      不客气
Thanks sweetie.        No problem.

293
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,046
我等不及要把你介绍给朋友们
I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.

294
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,969
是吗? 你觉得 他们不会批判 挖苦我吗?
Really? You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?

295
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,010
他们会 可是我...就是等不及!
No. they will. I just, uh...Can't wait. Heh.

296
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,634
得了 他们一定会喜欢你的
