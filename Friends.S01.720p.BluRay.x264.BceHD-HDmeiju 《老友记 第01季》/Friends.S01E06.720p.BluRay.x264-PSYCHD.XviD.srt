00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,880
你们看 是乔伊的照片

00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,423
好兴奋喔
This is so exciting!

3
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:13,548
你总是能知道谁从没看过他的表演
You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before.

4
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,296
他们无畏无惧 不知末日将至
Notice. No fear. No sense of impending doom.

5
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,724
标题上的惊叹号让我害怕
The exclamation point in the title scares me.

6
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,218
这不只是弗洛依德 是弗洛依德!
You know. It's not just Freud. It's Freud!

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,354
嘘 魔法即将出现
Shh. Magic is about to happen!

我们的进展很不错
we've done some excellent work here

10
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,863
我得说
And I would have to say

11
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,152
你的问题相当清楚
your problem is quite clear

12
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:43,206
你只想要个小小弟
All you want is a dinkle

13
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,452
你羡慕他人的小弟
What you envy is a schwang

14
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:50,005
一个让你叮叮当的小东西
A thing through which you can tinkle

15
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,879
可以玩弄或晃在那
To play with or simply let hang

屁股秀
The One With the Butt

21
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,394
我觉得受到冒犯
God, I feel violated.

22
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:57,314
有其他人感觉到 只想剥了自己的皮
Did anybody else feel like they just wanted to peel their skin off their body

23
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,740
好做点其他事情吗?
to have something else to do?

24

罗斯 十点钟
Ross, 10:00.

25
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,199
是吗?感觉像凌晨两点了
Is it? It feels like two.

26
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,925
不是啦 是十点钟      什么?
No! 10:00!        What?

27
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:11,458
有个漂亮的女人 在八 九 十点钟方向
There's a beautiful woman at 8, 9, 10:00!

28
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,503
哈罗
Hello!

29
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:16,796
她太棒了
She's amazing!

30
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,588
让我梦想中的女性都变成又矮又胖的秃头男
She makes the women I dream about look like short, fat, bald men.

31
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,514
过去跟她说话啊 她又没有伴
Go over to her. She's not with anyone.

32
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,558
我要用什么开场白?
And what would my opening line be?

33
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,177
不好意思
Excuse me, blarrlarlar

34
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,107
别这样 她也是人 你办得到的
Come on, she's a person. You can do it.

35
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,311
我根本配不上她 罗斯 你说对不对?
Could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.

36
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,425
他这辈子永远都别想要追到那种美女
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.

37
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:39,300
谢了 老兄
Thank you, buddy.

38
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,362
但是我们常看到很漂亮的女生
But you know you always see these really beautiful women

39
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:44,425
跟不怎么样的男人在一起
with these really nothing guys

40
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:46,572
你可以做那种男人啊
You could be one of those guys

41
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,415
可以啊      真的吗?
You could do that.        You think?

42
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,705
绝对可以
Absolutely

43
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,370
真不敢相信我竟然还有这种念头
Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this.

44
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,214
我一向谨言慎行      快去
I'm very very aware of my tongue.        Come on.

45
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:57,674
来了
Here goes

46
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,384

47
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,594

Okay, next word would be...

48
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:09,849
钱德
...uh, Chandler.

49
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,686
我叫钱德 嗯...
Chandler is my name and, uh...

50
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,062
你好
Hi!

51
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,732
你已经说过了
Yes, you said that.

52
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,948
没错 但我没说的是...
Yes! Yes, I did. But what I didn't say was...

53
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,242
我将要想说的是 我想要说的是...
What I about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh...

54
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,662
你愿意和我一起出去约会吗? 谢谢 晚安
would you like to go out with me sometime? Thank you. Good night.

55
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,539
钱德?
Chandler?

56
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,164
嘿
Hey!

57
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,704
你居然会跳舞!      你演戏了!
I didn't know you could dance!        You were in a play!

58
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,089
你们觉得怎样?
What'd you think?

59
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,127
你居然会跳舞!      你演戏了!
I didn't know you could dance!        You were in a play!

60
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,613
别这样 没那么糟吧 我至少是主角
Come on, you guys, it wasn't that bad. I was the lead.

61
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:48,467
比轮唱好吧 至少可以看到我的头
It was better than that thing I did with the trolls. At least you got to see my head.

62
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,811
没错      我们有看到你的头
You're right.        We saw your head.

63
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,559
她答应了!她答应了!
She said yes! She said yes!

64
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,764
哇奥!
Wow!

65
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,641
这部剧烂透了
Awful play, man! Whoa!

66
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:03,565
她叫做欧若拉 是意大利人 说我的名字时超好听的
Her name's Aurora. She's Italian and she pronounces my name "Chandler".

67
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,779
我喜欢那样的叫法 噢 引座员叫我把这个给你
I think I like it better that way. Oh listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.

68
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:12,082
什么东西?      伊斯特李奥纳德经纪公司
What is it?        The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.

69
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,127
哇 有经纪公司给我名片 或许他们想跟我签约
An agency left me its card. Maybe they wanna sign me!

70
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,498
在看完今天的表演后?
Based on this play?

71
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,125
在看完今天的表演后!
Based on this play!

72
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,435
各位      嗨 钱德
Hey, kids!        Hey, Chandler.

73
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:36,019
不 这条线是热情 这一条只是线而已
No, because this line is passion, and this is...just a line.

74
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,550
我不敢相信我已经来七秒钟了
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds

75
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,068
却没有人问我约会的情况
and you haven't asked me how my date went.

76
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,730
你的约会怎么样 钱德?
How was your date, Chandler?

77
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,190
无法置信
It was unbelievable!

78
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,153
我没见过像她这样的人 她的一生超精彩的
I I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life!

79
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,703
她参加过以色列军队
She was in the Israeli army

80
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,198
幸好没有子弹打到引擎
Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block

81
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,826
我们才能逃到边境
So we made it to the border

82
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,957
但也只是侥幸逃出 我...
But just barely and I...

83
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,962
我整晚都在讲我的事 真的很抱歉
I I've been talking about myself all night long. I'm sorry.

84
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,260
那你呢? 告诉我你的故事
What about you? Tell me one of your stories.

85
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,345
好 有一次
All right, once

86
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,306
有一次我去搭地铁
once I got on the subway, right?

87
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,175
那时很晚了
And it was at night

88
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,053
我一直坐到布鲁克林站
and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn

89
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,768
只为了好玩
just for the hell of it

90
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,192
我们聊到两点 实在是完美的夜晚
We talked till like two. It was this perfect evening.

91
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,357
差不多啦
More or less

92
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,939
突然 我们发现自己身处也门
All of sudden, we realized we were in Yemen.

93
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,949
抱歉 谁是"我们"?
I'm sorry, so "we" is?

94
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,114
就是我和瑞克
We would be me and Rick

95
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,745
谁是瑞克?      谁是瑞克?
Who's Rick?        Who's Rick?

96
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,994
我丈夫
My husband

97
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,828
噢 所以你离婚了?      没有
Oh, so you're divorced?        No.

98
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:44,041
抱歉 所以你在守寡吗? 希望如此
I'm sorry. So you're widowed? Hopefully?

99
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,713
不 我还是有夫之妇
No, I'm still married.

100
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,804
那你先生对于你和我在这里怎么想
So tell me how would your husband feel about you sitting here with me

101
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,472
还把脚滑到我的腿上面
sliding your foot so far up my pant leg

102
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,226
连口袋里有多少零钱 都数得出来
you can count the change in my pocket?

103
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,183
别担心
Don't worry

104
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:04,395
我想说他应该不会介意 因为他也没有太介意伊森
I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.

105
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,361
伊森?伊森是谁?
Ethan? There's an Ethan?

106
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,443
伊森是我的...
Ethan is my...

107
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:12,907
男朋友
boyfriend

108
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,328
什么?!
What?!

109
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,112
跟我解释一下 你希望我们是什么关系
So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of relationship do you imagine us having

110
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:22,128
如果你已经有丈夫跟男友了
if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?

111
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,540
我想 主要是性关系吧
I suppose, mainly sexual.

112
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,795
很遗憾 没有成功
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

113
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,299
什么没有成功? 我星期四还会再跟她见面
What not work out? I'm seeing her again on Thursday.

114
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,176
你没有听到我说的故事吗?
Didn't you listen to the story?

115
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,354
你没有听到自己说的故事吗?
Didn't you listen to the story?

116
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,274
太诡异了 你怎么可以跟这样的女人交往?
This is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?

117
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,941
我一开始也很难接受 但是想想其实百益无一害
Wll you kow, I had trouble with it at first, but the way look at it is, I get all the good stuff.

118
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,570
只要谈天说笑 还有性
All the fun, all the talking, all the sex,

119
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,446
完全不用负责任
and none of the responsibility

120
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,866
这可是每个男人的梦想
I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!

121
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,619
才不是 罗斯 这是你的梦想吗?
That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?

122
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,583
当然不是
No, of course not.

123
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,712
是 没错
Yeah, yeah, it is.

124
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:09,130
所以你们不介意 跟有其他伴侣的女性交往?
What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?

125
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,720
我做不到      很好 乔伊
I couldn't do it.        Good for you, Joey.

126
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,176
我和女性交往时 我必须知道
When I'm with a woman, I need to know,

127
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,259
我交往的人 比她还多
that I'm going out with more people than she is

128
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:22,063
一夫一妻 确实值得商榷
You know...Monogamy can be a tricky concept.

129
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,766
就人类学上的角度来说
I mean, anthropologically.

130
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,520
好吧 你们永远都不会知道了
Fine, fine, alright, now you'll never know.

131
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,363
我们只是开玩笑啦 说吧
We're kidding. Come on. Tell us.

132
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,111
我们都想知道      说啦
We wanna know.        Come on!

133
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:36,203
好吧 理查德李基有一个理论...
All right. There's a theory put forth by Richard Leakey.

134
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,336
当当当当!
Tada!

135
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,800
我们以后都要用这样的方式打招呼吗?
Are we greeting each other this way now?

136
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,504
我还挺喜欢的
Because I like that.

137
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,841
你们看! 我打扫了
Look! I cleaned!

138
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,298
我擦了窗户 地板
I did the windows. I did the floors.

139
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,851
我还用了吸尘器所有的接头 除了圆的那个
I even used all the attachments on the vacuum except that little round one with the bristles

140
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,473
我不知道那是用来做什么的
I don't know what it's for.

141
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,892
没有人知道 我们也不该问
Nobody knows, and we're not supposed to ask.

142
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,316
你们觉得怎么样?
What do you think?

143
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,276
很干净      真的 很棒
It's very clean.        Really, it looks great!

144
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:16,360
我看到你移动了绿色的垫椅
Oh. Heh. I see you moved the green ottoman.

145
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,781
怎么回事?
How did that happen?

146
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,710
不知道啊 我觉得放那边比较好看
I don't know. I thought it looked better there.

147
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:29,252
而且茶几旁边也多一个座位
And I and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.

148
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,795
对 很有趣
Yeah, it's interesting.

149
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,462
你知道吗 只是好玩
But you know what? Just for fun.

150
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:39,432
看看放在原本的位置会如何
Let's see what it looked like in the old spot.

151
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,931
只是比较一下
Just to compare

152
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,432
看一下 哈
Let's see. Ha!

153
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,722
嗯 放在这里 也很棒
Well, it looks good there too.

154
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,312
先摆在这里吧
Let's just leave it there for a while.

155
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,153
真不敢相信你搬了那个绿色的垫椅
I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.

156
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,490
幸好你没摊开杂志
Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines.

157
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,567
不然她会把你的眼睛挖出来
I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.

158
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,660
我没有那么糟糕吧?
You guys, I am not that bad!

159
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,113
你有 摩妮卡
Yeah, you are, Monica.

160
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,032
还记得我跟你住在一起过吗?
Remember I lived with you?

161
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,125
你就是一副
You were a little, you know.

162
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,418
这样说不公平
That is so unfair!

163
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,468
拜托 我们小时候 你的破娃娃是唯一不破的
Come on. When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.

164
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,924
好吧 我比较有责任心 有组织性
Okay, so I'm responsible. I'm organized.

165
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,975
但我也能很懒散
But, hey, I can be a kook!

166
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,438
好吧 懒女人
All right, you madcap gal!

167
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,354
想像这个情况
Try to imagine this

168
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,279
电话帐单寄来了 但是你没有立刻付费
The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.

169
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,114
为什么没有?      因为你很懒散
Why not?        Because you're a kook!

170
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,987
所以你等到他们再寄一张通知给你
Instead, you wait until they send you a notice.

171
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,122
我做得到
I could do that

172
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:48,293
好 你让我去买
Okay, then you let me go grocery shopping

173
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,291
我买了洗衣剂
and I buy laundry detergent.

174
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,965
但不是容易挤出来的那种
But it's not the one with the easypour spout.

175
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,792
怎么会有人这么做?
Why would someone do that?

176
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,134
有些人会这样想
One might wonder

177
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,095
有人把杯子放在茶几上 没有杯垫
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster.

178
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,139
是一杯冷饮 天很热
It's a cold drink. It's a hot day.

179
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:10,144
小水珠逐渐逼近桌面
Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer to the surface of the wood

180
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,436
停!
Stop it!

181
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,441
天哪
Oh, my God!

182
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,819
是真的 我是谁?
It's true. Who am I?

183
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,363
摩妮卡 你是妈妈
Monica, you're Mom.

184
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,793
我的天啊
Uhhuh? Oh, my God!

185
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,172
好 我会去的
Okay, I'll be there.

186
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,135
刚刚是我经纪人
That was my agent

187
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:45,843
我的经纪人帮我安排 在艾尔帕西诺的新片中演出
My agent has just gotten me a job in the new Al Pacino movie!

188
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,644
太棒了
Whoa! That's great!

189
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,017
什么角色?
What's the part?

190
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,269
你们能相信吗? 是艾尔帕西诺!
Can you believe this? Al Pacino!

191
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,358
他是我成为演员的原因
This guy's the reason why I became an actor.

192
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,903
"我失控? 你才失控"
"I'm out of order? You're out of order!"

193
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,990
"整个法庭都失控了"
"This whole courtrooms out of order!"

194
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,696
说真的 是什么角色?
Seriously, what's the part?

195
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:06,617
"当我以为已经出局时 他们又把我拉回"
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"

196
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,995
快说 乔伊 是什么角色?
Come on. Seriously, Joey, what's the part?

197
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,544
你是 你是 什么?
You're, you're... What?

198
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,500
我是他屁股的替身 好吗?
I'm his butt double, okay?

199
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,469
我演艾尔帕西诺的屁股
I play AlPacino's butt.

200
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,971
好吧?他开始冲澡
All right? He goes into the shower and then.

201
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,722
我就演他的屁股
I'm his butt

202
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,816
天啊
Oh, my God!

203
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,271
你们别这样
Come on, you guys.

204
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,817
这是部艾尔帕西诺主演的大制作的电影
This is a real movie, and AlPacino's in it and that's big!

205
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,484
不 真的太棒了
Oh. no. It's terrific.

206
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,908
你努力了这么多年
You deserve this, after all your years of struggling...

207
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,328
终于有机会挤进娱乐圈了
you've finally been able to crack your way into show business

208
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,867
好吧 你们尽量开玩笑 我不在乎
Okay, fine. Make jokes, I don't care.

209
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,539
这是我的一大突破
This is a big break for me!

210
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,412
你说得没错 是的
You're right. It is.

211
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,467
那你要请我们去看屁股首映会吗?
So are you gonna invite us all to the big opening?

212
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,022
我需要借点润肤霜      干嘛用的?
I need to borrow some moisturizer.        For what?

213
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,226
你说呢?今天是大日子
What do you think? Today's the big day!

214
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,612
好 去厕所 想用什么都可以
Okay, go into the bathroom. Use whatever you want.

215
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,530
只要别跟我说你在里面做了什么
Just don't ever tell me what you did in there.

216
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,028
谢谢
Thank you

217
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,200
乔伊的妈妈打来      他在厕所
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.        He's in the bathroom.

218
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,742
你不想进去的      拜托 我们是室友
You don't think you wanna go in there!        Come on, we're roommates.

219
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,954
我的眼睛!我的眼睛!
My eyes! My eyes!

220
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,000
我警告过你了
I warned you

221
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,048
是谁这么吵?
Who is being loud?

222
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,255
噢 是摩妮卡
Oh, that would be Monica.

223
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,595
嘿 我可以借点东西吗? 我想给欧若拉做早餐
Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a couple of things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make Aurora breakfast.

224
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,592
噢 你有整夜的时间能陪她?
You got the whole night, huh?

225
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,142
对 我只有二十分钟 直到伊森...所以...
Well I only have 20 minutes until Ethan, so...

226
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,311
有人有点哀怨哦?
Do I sense a bit of resentment?

227
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,651
不...没有哀怨 相信我
No, no, no. No resentment. Believe me.

228
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,987
真的很值得
it's worth it, okay?

229
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,406
在感情关系中 总是有些特别难忘的时刻
You know in a relationship, you have these key moments...

230
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,362
让你一辈子都会记得
you'll remember for the rest of your life.

231
00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:11,537
跟欧若拉在一起的 每分每秒都像那样
Well, every single second is like that with Aurora.

232
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,282
而我刚浪费了三十五秒的时间跟你们说话
And I've just wasted 35 of them talking to you people.

233
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,744
摩妮卡 你可以 帮我开门吗?
So, uh, Monica, can you help me with the door?

234
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,505
钱德 以前的摩妮卡会提醒你
Urn, Chandler, you know, the old Monica would remind you.

235
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:25,464
用塑料刷刷洗锅子
to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush

236
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,800
但是我不会那么做
But I'm not gonna do that

237
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,930
该死 就聘请她
Damn it! Hire the girl.

238
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,273
大家准备好了吗?

00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:43,691
听着 我只想谢谢你 给我这么好的机会
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.

240
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:45,984
脱掉浴袍
Lose the robe

241
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,111
我?
Me?

242
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,609
那样才拍得成
That would work

243
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,988
好  解开浴袍中
Right. Okay. Losing the robe!

244
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,456
好  浴袍脱完了
Okay, and the robe is lost.

245
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,040
各位 我想要一次就拍好
Everybody, I would like to get this in one take, please.

246
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,587
来吧
Let's roll it

247
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,209
开水
Water's working

248
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,796
开拍
And action!

249
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,299
卡
And cut!

250
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,597
屁股男 你在干什么?
Butt guy, what the hell are you doing?

251
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,308
我在冲澡
I'm showering

252
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,310
不 你在挤屁股
No, that was clenching.

253
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:20,936
我的想法是这个家伙很难过 你知道么
Well the way I see it, the guy's upset here, you know?

254
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,435
他老婆死了 哥哥又失踪
I mean his wife's dead, his brother's missing.

255
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,361
他的屁股这时候 应该会很生气
I think his butt would be angry here

256
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,025
我认为他的屁股 会想在午餐前拍好
I think his butt would like to get the shot before lunch

257
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,862
再来一次 开水
Once again, rolling. Water working.

258
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,785
开拍
And action!

259
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,584
卡 又怎么了?
And cut! What was that?

260
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,247
我想表现出沉静的绝望
I was going for quiet desperation

261
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,468
但如果你想问
But if you have to ask

262
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,017
天啊 我好爱这些手指
God, I love these fingers.

263
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,431
谢谢
Thank you

264
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,185
我其实是指我的手指
No, actually, I meant my fingers.

265
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,733
看看它们有多开心
Look at them. Look at how happy they are.

266
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,773
天啊 我迟到了      不 不
Oh, my God, I'm late!        Oh, no, no, no.

267
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,946
不要走      好吧
Don't go, don'tgo.        Okay, okay.

268
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,869
我真的得走      她要走了
I have to.        Look, she's leaving.

269
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,161
对不起 他在等我
I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.

270
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:20,992
我以为你跟瑞克说过了
I thought you talked to Rick

271
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,119
不是瑞克
It's not Rick

272
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,455
伊森?他有一整天的时间!
Ethan? He gets the whole day with you!

273
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,373
不 是安德鲁
No, it's Andrew.

274
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,965
我知道会有好几年的时间
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come

275
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,517
我将后悔问你以下的问题 但是
when I'll regret asking the following question, but

276
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,765
安德鲁是谁?
And Andrew is?

277
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,098
他是...新欢
He's...new.

278
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:48,607
你是说瑞克 伊森和我 无法满足你?
So what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?

279
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,280
我并不是
No, that's not exactly what I was.

280
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,323
不知道有多少女人
Most women would kill

281
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,614
会被我们三个人迷倒
for three guys like us

282
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,366
那你想要什么?
So, what do you want?

283
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,160
你
You

284
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,160
你已经有我了      不 只是你
You have me.        No no. Just you.

285
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,581
什么意思?
What do you mean?

286
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,670
甩掉其他人
Lose the other guys

287
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:10,424
他们所有人吗?
Like, all of them?

288
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,095
别这样 我们在一起很开心 为什么不
Come on. We're great together. Why not?

289
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,468
我们为什么不能保持这样就好?
Why can't we just have what we have now?

290
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,425
为什么不能只是谈天说笑 跟性
Why can't we just talk, and laugh and make love.

291
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:21,362
彼此没有任何负担?
Without feeling obligated to one another?

292
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:26,066
今晚之前 我以为 这也是你想要的
Up until tonight, I thought that's what you wanted too.

293
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,189
部分的我想要那样
Well, part of me wants that.

294
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,612
但我就像个双面人
But it's like I'm two guys.

295
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,824
其中一个说 "闭嘴 这样很棒"
I mean, one guy's saying, "Shut up! This is great!"

296
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,693
但还有另一个人
But there's this other guy.

297
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,906
他每次都会挺身而出
Actually it's the guy who wells up every time the Grinch's heart,

298
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,000
仗义直言
grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device

299
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,788
他会说"这太难了 快点脱身"
He's saying, you know, "This is too hard. Get out, get out!"

300
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,504
那你会听哪个人的话?
So which one of the two guys will you listen to?

301
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,297
两个人的话我都听 他们一直插嘴
I have to listen to both of them. They don't let each other finish.

302
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,011
哪个人?
Which one?

303
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,975
第二个
The second guy

304
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,852
我懂了
I see

305
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,856
如果你改变心意就给我打电话
Call me if you change your mind

306
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,743
抱歉 第一个人主管嘴唇
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.

307
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,467
这样想 是你甩了她
Look at it this way. You dumped her!

308
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,099
对吧?这个女人
Right? I mean, this woman was,

309
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,930
无比性感
unbelievably sexy

310
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,525
美丽 聪明 非常难追
and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable.

311
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,730
再说一次你为什么这么做
Tell me why you did this again?

312
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,947
嘿!嘿!
Hey! Hey!

313
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,570
电影明星来了
Movie star!

314
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:03,450
你不是那个在艾尔帕西诺的新片中演屁股的人吗?
Aren't you the guy who plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?

315
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,661
不是
Nope

316
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,498
不是?怎么了 大家伙?
No? What happened, big guy?

317
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,165
大家伙?
Big guy?

318
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,549
我就是突然想这么说
It felt like a "big guy" moment.

319
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,552
我被炒鱿鱼了
I got fired!

320
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,717
他们说我太投入了
They said I acted too much with it

321
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,392
我到处宣扬
I told everybody about this

322
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,561
现在大家都会到戏院期待看我
Everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...

323
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,352
乔伊 没有人看得出来的
You know what? No one will be able to tell.

324
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,232
我妈会
My mom will

325
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,237
这听起来很贴心
There's something so sweet,

326
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,697
却又很恶心
and disturbing about that

327
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,906
六年来 我一直在演烂戏
I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years.

328
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,156
终于有机会了 却被我搞砸
And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!

329
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,115
或许这不是你的机会
Maybe this wasn't your shot.

330
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:52,875
我觉得当机会真的来临 你就会知道
I think when it's your shot, you know it's your shot.

331
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,006
感觉像是你的机会吗?
Did it feel like your shot?

332
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,010
很难说 我当时光着身体
Hard to tell. I was naked.

333
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,845
我认为这不是你的机会
I don't think this was your shot.

334
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,344
我甚至认为 你不会只有一个机会
I don't even think you just get one shot.

335
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,927
我真的相信你会有一番作为 真的
I really believe big things are gonna happen for you. I do.

336
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:12,057
你要想 有一天有个小孩跑到朋友那儿去说
You've gotta keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonnal run up to his friends and go

337
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,939
"我拿到角色了 我要演乔伊崔比亚尼的屁股"
"I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!"

338
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,857
真的吗?你真贴心
You think? That's so nice.

339
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,697
噢 过来
Oh. Come here.

340
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,791
抱歉 乔伊 我要去睡觉了 各位
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.

341
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,080
晚安      晚安 摩妮卡
Good night.        Good night, Monica.

342
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,670
你要把你的鞋子留在这儿吗?
You're gonna leave your shoes out here?

343
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,133
真的吗?就这样乱丢
Really? Just casually strewn about.

344
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,635
完全都不整齐?
in that reckless haphazard manner?

345
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,270
无所谓 我明天再收 或者不收!
It doesn't matter. I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!

346
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,189
随便啦
Whatever

347
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,604
她真的很懒
She is a kook

348
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:17,755
如果你这么心烦 就去把鞋子收了
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes.

349
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,591
不 不要去
No, don't do this!

350
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,256
太蠢了
This is stupid!

351
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:26,597
我不需要证明任何事 我要去收
I don't have to prove anything. I'm gonna go get them.

352
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,133
但是这样大家都会知道
But then everyone will know

353
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:34,935
除非收好后早上早点起来再放回去
Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back.

354
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,898
谁来帮帮我啊!
I need help!

355
00:20:37,158 --> 00:20:48,149
