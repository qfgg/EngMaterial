Any contact?        She lent me an egg once.

4
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,467

对 你上前去跟她说 我来给你还鸡蛋
Yeah. You're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back. I'm returning your egg."

13
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,159
我们会赢的
I think it's winning.

14
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,249
我觉得这很不靠谱      她会喜欢的
I think it's insane.        She'll love it.

15
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,423
谢谢      谢谢 拿去

00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:04,863
你觉得会成功吗?
Think it'll work?

19
00:01:04,863 --> 00:01:07,556
不可能 这是自杀 有一个蛋的男人
No way. It's suicide. The man's got an egg.

No. Pheebs. Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?

27
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,324
因为他很惹人厌又怪异
Because he was creepy.

28
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,248
还刻薄 还让人有点害怕
And mean. And a little frightening.

29

但情人节有伴总比没有好

35
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,050
实际上 明晚的安排取决于今晚的表现
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.

36
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,488
关于今晚      不 不 你不能背叛我
Oh. Uh, listen, about tonight        No, no, don't you dare bail on me.

37
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:33,862
她答应跟我约会的唯一原因
The only reason she's going out with me

38
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,810
就是我答应帮她朋友找伴
because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.

39
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,979
我知道 但她朋友听来似乎是个
Yes, I know. But her friend sounds like such a

可怜虫 我知道 但是
pathetic mess. I know, but

41

好啦 老兄 她如此渴望 如此脆弱
Come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable.

42
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,491

I'm thinking

00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,801
我要逃走 从窗户逃出去
Okay, I'm making a break for it. I'm going out the window.

70
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:31,639
不不不 拜托了 我一直想约洛莲很久很久了
No,no, no, don't, please. I've been waiting for like, forever to go out with Lorraine.

Just calm down.        Calm down? Calm down?

你居然帮我和一个五个月内
You set me up with a woman

73
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:37,479
被我甩过两次的女人牵红线
I've dumped twice in the last five months.

74
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,812

And I can't go when I'm nervous.

77
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,447
抱歉 你说的没错
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right.

78
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,537
快点! 快! 快! 尿啊!
Come on! Do it, do it, do it! Come on!

79
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,967
好啦 罗杰是很怪 但跟皮特卡尼比起来不算什么
Okay, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.

80
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,086
皮特卡尼谁?      爱哭鬼皮特?
Which one was Pete Carney?        Pete the Weeper?

81
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:10,011
还记得每次做爱都会哭的家伙吗?
Remember the guy who used to cry every time we had sex?

82
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,010
"你舒服吗?"
"Oh was it good for you?"

83
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:19,391
好吧 我每天都想替霍华德哭 那个"我赢了"家伙
Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard, the "I win" guy.

84
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,693
"我赢了 我赢了"
"I win. I win."

85
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:26,481
和他约会两个月 我一次都没赢过
I went out with him for two months. I didn't get to win once.

86
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,485
我们这些良家妇女 怎会跟这些混蛋在一起呢?
How did we end up with these jerks?  We're good people.

87
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,580
不知道 可能是我们有某种吸引力吧
I don't know. Maybe we're some kind of magnets.

88
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:37,326
我知道我有 所以我才不能戴电子表
I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.

89
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,205
还有啤酒 对吧?
There's more beer, right?

90
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:48,341
记得我那剃光头的朋友艾比吗?
Oh. You know my friend Abby who shaves her head?

91
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,764
她说如果想要打破与恶男交往的恶性循环
She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle

92
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,304
可以举行一个清理仪式
you can do like a cleansing ritual.

93
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,641
菲比 这女人自愿变成秃头啊
Pheebs, this woman is voluntarily bald.

94
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,518
是啊
Yeah.

95
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,730
我们可以明天晚上试试
So we can do it tomorrow night, you guys.

96
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,823
情人节 非常合适
It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.

97
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,443
仪式具体是怎样的呢?
Okay, well, what kind of ritual?

98
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:15,744
嗯 我们可以烧掉他们送的东西
Okay, we can, urn, we can burn the stuff they gave us.

99
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,291
或?
Or?

100
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:23,335
或者可以念经 裸体跳舞 拿着木棍
Or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.

101
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,709
还是烧东西比较好      烧东西比较好
Burning's good.        Burning's good.

102
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,559
你知道
You know

103
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:44,193
自从我小时候 我就有办法用脚趾捡硬币
ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.

104
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,062
是吗? 真厉害
Yeah? Good for you.

105
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:53,118
几枚硬币 还是整捆硬币?
Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?

106
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:02,415
对了 钱德 我把照片上的你都剪掉了
By the way, Chandler, I cut you out of all my pictures.

107
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,130
如果你想要的话 我有一整袋你的头
So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.

108
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,171
不用了
That's okay.

109
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,589
确定? 真的? 你可以拿来做成小玩偶
Are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them.

110
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,342
然后放在你的"残酷剧院"里
And you could use them in your Theater of Cruelty.

111
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,604
不能这样
We can't do that.

112
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,850
哈? 不能怎样?
What? What can't you do?

113
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,321
能和你谈谈么? 到那边?
Uh, can I talk to you for a second? Over there?

114
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,577
我们估计得先走了
Uh, we might be leaving now.

115
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,367
告诉我这是你和我的我们
Tell me it's "you and me" we.

116
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,873
她说她想在我全身涂满东西 然后舔掉
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off.

117
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,796
我甚至不确定涂是什么意思
I'm not even sure what slathering is.

118
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,925
但我绝对不想错过
But I definitely want to be a part of it.

119
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,008
你不能这样对我
Okay, you can not do this to me.

120
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,723
你说的对 对不起 你是对的
You're right. I'm sorry. You're right.

121
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,229
三个巧克力慕斯外带好吗?
Uh. Can we have three chocolate mousses to go, please?

122
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,393
我要走了
I'm out of here.

123
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,528
这是我的信用卡 这顿算我的 对不起钱德
Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.

124
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,360
希望她吐在你身上
I hope she throws up on you.

125
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:19,867
谢了
Thanks.

126
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,955
那么      就我们俩了
So        Just us.

127
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,621
多么糟糕的一晚
Ugh, what a crappy night.

128
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:32,084
但我还挺乐意欣赏 额 你的衬衫出来了
Although I have enjoyed the fact that, uh, your shirt's been sticking out

129
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,178
从你的拉链里 自从你从洗手间回来后
of your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.

130
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,472
不好意思
Excuse me.

131
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,268
你们好
How you doing?

132
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,115
他们是我们最好的朋友?
So do we have the best friends, or what?

133
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,700
乔伊算不上朋友 他是...
Joey's not a friend. He's...

134
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,952
把信用卡留给我们的笨蛋

情人节快乐
Happy Valentine's Day.

143
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,845
我已经开始想你了
Oh I miss you already.

144
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,931
你能相信会发生这种事吗?
Can you believe this happened?

145
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,641

This is so much fun.

161
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,770
就像在走廊大团圆
This is like a reunion in the hall.

162
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,991
罗斯 跟某人打个招呼吧

Hello Ross. Yes, that's right. It's me. How did you know?

165
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:20,260
我只是说如果狗有时差
I'm just saying if dogs do experience jet lag, then

166
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,802
那么人的一岁是狗的七岁
because of the whole, uh, seven dog years to one human year thing

167
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,347
当狗从纽约飞到洛杉矶时
then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles

168
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:32,727
他不是损失了三小时 而是一个半星期
he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses, like, a week and a half.

169
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,694
真有趣      对
That's funny.        Yeah.

额 金发的是我前妻
The, uh, blond woman is my exwife.

173
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,005
摸她的是她
And the woman touching her is her...

174
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,421
密友
close personal friend.

175
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,724
你是指她们是情侣吗?
You mean they're lovers?

176
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,060
如果你非得这么说的话
If you want to put a label on it.

177
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,393
哇哦

Anything else I should know?        Nope. That's it.

哦 还有她怀了我的孩子
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.

180

我总是忘了这部分
I always forget that part.

181

Okay, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.

188
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,175
可以开始丢东西了吗?      额 可以了
Can we just start throwing things in?        Urn, yeah, okay.

我怎么可以在情人节甩了她

209
00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:48,425
我以为他们可以
I thought they could.

210
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,884
和孩子们一起工作 真的很充实

Would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?

217
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,007
因为 因为她现在一个人
Because she's, she's alone now.

218

又怀孕了 心情又不好

240
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,455
这件事说来好笑
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.

241
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,449
没关系 你们不用解释
It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain.

242
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,786
这不是我们第一次营救失控的男友营火晚会
This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.

00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,961
至少没有新的办法来跟你说
At least, there's no new way for me to tell you this.

255
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,884
我觉得我们不会有结果
I just don't think things are gonna work out.

256
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:42,808
没关系
That's fine.

257
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,313
真的吗?      嗯哼
It is?        Mmhm.

258
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:52,152
因为我知道我们没结束
Because I know that this isn't the end.

259
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,697
不 事实上 结束了
Oh, no. You see, actually, it is.

260
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,784
不 没有 因为你不会让它发生
No, it isn't. Because you won't let that happen.

261
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,493
你到现在还不明白吗?
Don't you know it yet?

262
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,910
你爱我 钱德宾
You love me, Chandler Bing.

263

不 我不爱
Oh, no, I don't.

264
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,612
那你问问你自己 我们为什么总是会在一起
Well then ask yourself this. why do you think we keep ending up together?

265
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:16,299
新年 谁邀请谁?
New Year's, who invited who?

266
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:19,421
情人节 谁邀请谁上床?
Valentine's, who asked who into whose bed?

267
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,094
都是我 但是...      你找的我
I did, but        You seek me out.

268
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:27,471
你内心深处呼唤我 就像雾中的号角
Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn.

269
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,603
珍妮丝 珍妮丝
Janice. Janice.

270
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,188
你想要我 你需要我
You want me. You need me.

271
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,651
没有我你活不下去
You can't live without me.

272
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,528
而且你知道
And you know it.

273
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,778
只是你自己不知道你知道
You just don't know you know it.

274
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,290
再见
See you.

275
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,466
打电话给我
Call me.

276
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:10,055
这不是真的 我从没说你妈是狼人
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.

277
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,811
你有 我发誓 真的有
You did so. I swear I swear to.

278
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,105
她去洗手间多久了?
How long has she been in the bathroom?

279
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:23,235
我想她不在洗手间 她外套不见了
Uh I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.

280
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,528
可能是因为里面冷
Well, maybe it's cold in there.

281
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,121
或者是我毁了九年来第一次约会
Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in nine years.

282
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,870
可能就是这样      天啊
That could be it.        Oh, God.

283
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,586
这里还是很烫
You know, this is still pretty hot.

284

Mushroom.

笑一个
Smile.

286
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,932
她们不会都这样的 有些女人会吃完晚餐的
They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner.

287
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,436
抱歉 不好笑      不 只是
I'm sorry. That's not funny.        No, it's just

288
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,686
你知道 人们总说"继续你的人生"
Well, you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing?

289
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,984
我一定要这样吗?
Well, do I have to?

290
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:06,285
我和这位美女坐在一起
I mean, well, I'm sitting here with this cute woman

291
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,575
她人很好
and she's perfectly nice, you know?

292
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,698
但是
But that there's

293
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,117

That's it.

294
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:19,086
但和你聊天 轻松 有趣
And, uh, then I'm here talking to you, and it's easy and it's fun.

295
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,800
我不 不需要
And I don't, I don'thave to...

296
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,802
我懂      你懂?
I know.        You know?

297
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,926
我有个疯狂的想法 额
Here's a wacky thought. Urn, ahem.

298
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:35,106

What's say you and I give it another shot.        Ross.

299
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,517
不 不 我知道你想说什么 你是女同
No, no, I know what you're gonna say. You're a lesbian.

300
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:44,529
我们暂时把那搁下怎样?
But what do you say we just put that aside for now, you know?

301
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,276
把它先放在一边 好吗?
Let's just stick a pin in it, okay?

302
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:50,405
因为我们在一起很好
Because we're great together, you know?

303
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,702
你不能否认
You can't deny it.

304
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,119
而且 你还怀着我的宝宝
And besides, you're carrying my baby.

305
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,122
这不是很完美吗?      罗斯
I mean, how perfect is that?        Ross

306
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,295
你一直这样说 但有件事却没变
You keep saying that, but there's something right here.

307
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,505

But        No but. No but.

310
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:22,066
你知道这件我们暂时放在一边的事会怎样么?
You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it?

311
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,574
迟早会出现的
It's time to take the pin out.

312

You'll find someone. I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.

你说的简单 你已经找到那个人了
That's easy for you to say. You found one already.

315
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,488
所有你需要的是一个喜欢男人的女人
All you need is a woman who likes men

316
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:46,419

看 这不就有了吗?
See, there you go.

326
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,752
清理仪式奏效了      真的
The cleansing works.        You're right.

You guys tell them you were married?        No way.

330
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,475
