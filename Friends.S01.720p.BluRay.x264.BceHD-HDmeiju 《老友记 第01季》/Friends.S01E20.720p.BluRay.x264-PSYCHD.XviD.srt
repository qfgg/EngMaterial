1
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:06,329
真不敢相信你会这么说
I can't believe you would actually say that.

2
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:09,840
我宁可当花生先生 也不当盐先生
I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,047
不会吧 盐先生是个水手哦
No way. Mr. Salty is a sailor, all right?

4
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:15,838
他一定是最强悍的零食
He's gotta be, like, the toughest snack there is.

5
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:20,759
难说 不要惹到玉米坚果
I don't know. You don't wanna mess with corn nuts.

6
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,011
他们是疯子
They're crazy.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,562
我的天 我的天 你们快过来看
Oh my God. Oh my God. You guys, you gotta come see this.

8
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,769
那边有个变态拿着一个望远镜
There's some creep out there with a telescope.

9
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,990
真不敢相信 他居然在看我们
I can't believe it. He's looking right at us.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,446
真是有病
Oh, that is so sick.

11
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,361
我感觉被侵犯了
I feel violated.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,280
感觉很不好
And not in a good way.

13
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,073
怎么有人会这么做
How can people do that?

14
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,499
你们看 丑陋裸男买了一双倒立鞋
Oh, you guys, look. Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots.

我告诉你们 多年后 
I'm telling you, years from now

20
00:01:43,888 --> 00:01:45,515
学生们都会把这个
school children will study it

21
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,681
当作史上最棒的第一次约会来学习
as one of the greatest first dates of all time.

22
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,732
顺利到不可思议
It was unbelievable.

23
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,211
我们非常的自在 
We could totally be ourselves. 

24
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,894
不需要耍心机
We didn't have to play any games.

25
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,334
你打电话给她了吗      
So have you called her yet?         

26
00:01:55,335 --> 00:01:57,630
让她知道我喜欢她 你疯了吗
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?

27
00:01:58,327 --> 00:01:59,899
你们      男生真差劲
Guys!         It's gross.

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,452
才过一天而已 你要我看起来很饥渴吗
It's the next day. How needy do I wanna seem?

29
00:02:02,452 --> 00:02:04,380
我说的对 对吧     
I'm right. Right?  

30
00:02:04,387 --> 00:02:07,407
吊她胃口      没错
Let her dangle.        Yeah, definitely.

31
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,744
真不敢相信我爸妈一直强迫我
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me

32
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,832
要我找你们这种人
to find one of you people.

33
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,706
拜托 只管去做
God! Come on. Just do it.

34
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:18,377
打给她 别摆出一付臭男人的样子
Call her. Stop being so testosteroney.

35
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,301
那是旧金山的特产
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.

36
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,226
是机器      她的答录机
I got her machine.         Her answering machine?

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,966
不是 是她的扫叶机接的
No, interestingly enough, her leaf blower picked up.

38
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,735
那你怎么不说话
So, why didn't you say anything?

39
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,821
不 不 不 不 上次我毫无准备就留言
Oh, no no no no. Last time I left a spontaneous message.

40
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,577
结果讲出"木有温题"这种蠢话
I ended up using the phrase "Yes. indeedio."

41
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,546
你们看 是瑞秋和巴瑞 
Look, it's Rachel and Barry. 

42
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:50,459
大家不要一起回头看
No, no, don't everybody look at once.

43
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,677
好 好 现在怎么样      
Okay, okay. What's going on?         

44
00:02:52,678 --> 00:02:53,712
他们只是在交谈
Okay, they're just talking.

45
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,543
他看起来有没有很生气
Yeah well, does he look upset?

46
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,254
他是不是一副像被告之去死的样子
Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?

47
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,630
没有 他在微笑
No, no, actually he's smiling.

48
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,094
天啊 不要那样
Oh my God. Don't do that.

49
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,257
怎么了怎么了怎么了
What? What? What?

50
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,803
对面有个男人踢了鸽子一脚
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon.

51
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:16,360
基本上 提案就是这样成为法案的
And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.

52
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,445
知道了吗 嘿 瑞秋      嘿
See? Hey, Rach.         Hey.

53
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,276
你们还好吧
How'd it go?

54
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:28,322
说真的 感觉还真好
You know, it was, it was actually really great.

55
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,411
他带我去俄国茶坊吃午餐
He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room.

56
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,950
我吃的鸡肉 就是那种
And I had that chicken, you know. 

57
00:03:31,951 --> 00:03:33,998
一刺奶油就全流出来了
where you poke it and all the butter squirts out.

58
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,254
今天不是鸟类的好日子
Not a good day for birds.

59
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,165
然后我们去逛百货公司
And then we took a walk down to Bendels.

60
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,548
我跟他说不要 
And I told him not to. 

61
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:42,131
但他还是给我买了一小瓶香奈儿香水
But he got me a little bottle of Chanel.

62
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,095
很好 
That's nice. 

63
00:03:44,096 --> 00:03:46,716
那是在你跟他说之前还是之后
Now was that before or after you told him

64
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,751
让他别再打电话 别再给你送花 
to stop calling, stop sending you flowers 

65
00:03:48,752 --> 00:03:51,307
不要再烦你 
and to generally leave you alone, huh?

66
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:55,649
那个我们一直没提到
Right. Well, we never actually got to that.

67
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,936
能再见到他的感觉真好
Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, you know? 

68
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:02,481
很舒服很熟悉
It was, it was comfortable and it was familiar.

69
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,195
感觉真好
It was just nice.

70
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,985
感觉真好 你讲两次了
That's, that's "nice" twice.

71
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,321
瑞秋 这到底是怎么回事
Rachel, what's going on?

72
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,956
他不是那个在圣坛前被你甩掉的巴瑞吗
Isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?

73
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,825
你上哪儿去了
Where have you been?

74
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,708
是啊 可是今天和他在一起感觉不一样
Yeah, but it was different with him today.

75
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:20,750
他今天不像个矫正牙医
I mean, he wasn't like Orthodontist Guy, you know?

76
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,670
我们玩得很开心 这有什么不对吗
I mean, we had fun. Is there anything wrong with that?

77
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,260
有
Yes!

78
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,976
为什么      我有我的理由
Why?         I have my reasons.

79
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,064
事实是 他已经订婚了 而未婚妻刚好是
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman

80
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,316
你以前最好的朋友 这没关系吗
who just happens to be your ex-best friend?

81
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,336
好啦 好啦 好啦 好啦 
All right. All right, all right, all right, all right. 

82
00:04:40,337 --> 00:04:41,570
我知道这样做很蠢
I know it's stupid.

83
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,539
我今天下午去找他 
I'll go see him this afternoon. 

84
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,073
结束这整件事
And I will just put an end to it.

85
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:52,030
哇 哇      对啊
Wow! Wow!        Yeah.

86
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:55,542
我没疯吧 以前都不是这样的
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.

87
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,420
你没疯 以前不是这样的
No, it wasn't.

88
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,672
这里有个小水槽真好
Oh. It was so nice having this little sink here.

89
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,392
丹妮儿 我没想到是答录机接的
Oh Danielle, I wasn't expecting the machine.

90
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,268
有空的话 打电话给我
Give me a call when you get a chance.

91
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,310
再见
Bye bye!

92
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,361
天啊
Oh God!

93
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,529
你这两个小时就在忙这个
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?

94
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,868
喂 我是在演练
Hey, l've been honing.

95
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:32,992
和盘子有什么关系
What was with the dishes?

96
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,158
我要她以为我在餐厅里
Oh, I wanted her to think I might be in a restaurant.

97
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,453
我也有自己的娱乐生活
You know, I might have some kind of life.

98
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,964
总不能让她觉得 我是在这儿演练了两个小时吧
Like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the last two hours?

99
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,507
快看 又来了 
Look look, he's doing it again. 

100
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:45,542
那个拿望远镜的家伙
The guy with the telescope.

101
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,426
我的天啊
Oh my God!

102
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:52,933
走开 不要再往这边看了
Oh. Go away! Stop looking in here!

103
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,719
好极了 现在他也在跟我们挥手
Great. Now he's waving back.

104
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,809
我们要想个办法对付那个家伙
We gotta do something about that guy.

105
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,316
今天早上 我抓到他在偷窥我们家 
This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment.

106
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,102
我吓一跳 感觉像是什么都不能做了
It creeps me out. I feel like I can't do stuff.

107
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,238
你都做些什么
What kind of stuff?

108
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,861
成熟一点好不好 我说的不是那些色情的事
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff.

109
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,654
我只不过是煮饭时全裸而已
but like, when I'm cooking naked.

110
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,374
你煮饭时全裸
You cook naked?

111
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,708
对啊 吐司 麦片粥 不会溅出来的食物
Yeah, toast, oatmeal. Nothing that spatters.

112
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,713
你们看我干嘛 我又不知道
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.

113
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,630
怎么了
What's the matter?

114
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,050
我只是 巴瑞 这样不好
Oh, I just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.

115
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,186
不 那感觉非常非常好
No, it was. It was very, very good.

116
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,940
那敏蒂呢      比跟敏蒂好太多了
What about Mindy?         Oh, way better than Mindy.

117
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,941
不是指那个 我是说 你跟敏蒂怎么办
No, not that. I mean, what about you and Mindy?

118
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,486
如果你愿意 我去跟她退婚
Oh. If you want, I'll just break it off with her.

119
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,991
不 不 不 不 不
No no no no no.

120
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,619
不要那样 不要因为我退婚
I mean, don't do that. I mean not for me.

121
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,373
法柏医生 巴比拉什来做调整
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.

122
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,124
谢谢你 柏妮丝
Thanks, Bernice.

123
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,877
我们这个周末去远一点的地方吧
Let's go away this weekend.

124
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,334
巴瑞 拜托 这太...
Oh, Barry. Come on. This is all way too...

125
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,123
不 不 我们可以去阿鲁巴岛
No,no, we can, we can go to Aruba.

126
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,086
我在本来应该是我们蜜月的时候去过了
When I went there on what would've been our honeymoon

127
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,256
那里真的很美 你会很喜欢的
It was, it was really nice. You would've liked it.

128
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,639
我本来有穿胸罩
I had a bra.

129
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,980
嘿 法柏医生
Hey, Dr. Farber.

130
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,401
好 葛林小姐  一切看起来都很好
All right, Miss Green, everything looks fine.

131
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,946
我想我们已经看到一点进展了
Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.

132
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,870
怎么      我12岁 不代表我很笨
What?         I'm 12, I'm not stupid.

133
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,094
我能不能借用你们的电话      可以
Can I use your phone?         Yeah.

134
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,652
不过 供日后参考 
But for future reference.

135
00:07:58,653 --> 00:08:02,179
你手里的那个东西 也可以用来当电话使
That thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.

136
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,567
对呀 线路没问题呀
Yes, it's working.

137
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,271
她为什么不回我电话
Why isn't she calling me back?

138
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,356
她也许根本没听到你的留言
Maybe she never got your message.

139
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,537
你也可以打她的答录机 
You know, if you want, you could call her machine.

140
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:17,161
如果听到很多哔哔声
And if she has a lot of beeps

141
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,996
表示她很有可能还没听留言
that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.

142
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,017
你们不觉得这样会让我看起来有点      
You don't think that makes me seem a little...        

143
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:23,954
绝望 饥渴 可悲
Desperate? Needy? Pathetic?

144
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,412
哈 你一定看过我的征友启事
Uha, you obviously saw my personal ad.

145
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,005
哔了几声      她接起来了
How many beeps?         She answered.

146
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,177
这个时候你就可以用 我们讨论过的 "喂"这个字  
You see, this is where you'd use that "hello" word we talked about.

147
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,721
我才不要 
I'm not gonna talk to her. 

148
00:08:39,722 --> 00:08:42,901
很明显她已听到我的留言 选择不回我电话 
She obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me.

149
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:45,222
现在我不但饥渴 还被冷落
Now I'm needy and snubbed.

150
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,979
天呀 我真想念纯饥渴的滋味
God, I miss just being needy.

151
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,395
嘿      嘿
Hey.       Hey.

152
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,188
他的反应如何
So how'd he take it?

153
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,778
其实还蛮不错的
Pretty well, actually.

154
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:01,826
瑞秋 你的头发上怎么会有牙线
Rach, how come you have dental floss in your hair?

155
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,158
是吗
Oh, do I?

156
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:05,658
啊哈
Uhhah!

157
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,541
我们在牙医椅上做爱
We ended up having sex in his chair.

158
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,040
你们在牙医椅上做爱
You had sex in his chair?

159
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,552
我说得有点大声 对不对
I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?

160
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,934
你们怎么了?
You, you had what?

161
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,804
在牙医椅上做爱
Sex in his chair.

162
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,188
怎么 你在想什么
What... What were you thinking?

163
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,479
我也不知道 我们都还对对方有感觉
I don't know. I mean we still care about each other.

164
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,737
我们有一段过去 就跟你和卡萝一样
There's a history there. It's like you and Carol.

165
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,943
不 不 不
No. No. no.

166
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,704
跟我和卡萝完全不同
It's nothing like me and Carol.

167
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,999
拜托 如果她跟你说 
Please. If she said to you 

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,461
罗斯 我现在就要你 就在这沙发上 
"Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now." 

169
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,373
你会怎么说
What would you say?

170
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,965
我闪开 可能会有所帮助
If it helps, I could slide over.

171
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,966
那完全是两回事
It's a totally different situation.

172
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,553
这是苹果跟橙子 矫正牙医和女同性恋
It's apples and oranges. It's orthodontists and lesbians.

173
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,263
我要走了
I gotta go.

174
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,362
你要去哪儿    
Where are you going?         

175
00:10:06,363 --> 00:10:07,812
我就是得走 可以吗
I just have to go, all right?

176
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,497
我走还需要理由吗 
Do I need a reason, huh? 

177
00:10:09,498 --> 00:10:11,349
我的人生还有别的事要做
I mean, I have things to do with my life.

178
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,689
我的行程排得非常紧
I have a jam packed schedule.

179
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,947
我已经赶得喘不过气来了 可以吗
And I am late for keeping up with it, okay?

180
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,910
喂 喂
Hello? Hello?

181
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,792
喂
Hello?

182
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,000
敏蒂
Huh. Mindy！

183
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,424
嗨 你好
Hi. Hey, how are you?

184
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:40,587
对 我听说了 恭喜 这真是太好了
Yes, yes, I heard. Congratulations. That is so great.

185
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,131
真的 噢 天啊
Really. Oh God! 

186
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,008
好
Okay!

187
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,642
好 我明天要上班
Okay. Well, I'm working tomorrow.

188
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,146
但是如果你愿意 可以过来看看
But if you want, you can come by if you'd like.

189
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,852
好
Okay!

190
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:55,484
太好了
Great.

191
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,861
好吧
All right!

192
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,568
明天见
So I'll see you tomorrow.

193
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,949
好 再见 
Okay. Bye.

194
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,703
天啊 噢 天啊 噢 天啊 噢
Oh God. Oh God. Oh God...

195
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,282
敏蒂还好吗
So how's Mindy?

196
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,751
她明天想见我
Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow.

197
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,789
她的语气听起来很怪 我得打电话给巴端
Oh, she sounded really weird. I gotta call Barry.

198
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,424
喂 是我 我 哈 敏蒂
Hi, it's me. I just... Ha! Mindy.

199
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,598
敏蒂 嗨
Mindy. Hi.

200
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,349
不 我想你应该在那里
No, I figured that's where you'd be.

201
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,362
地狱里充满了你这种人
Hell is filled with people like you.

202
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,203
又来了 偷窥狂又来了
He's back. The peeper's back.

203
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,118
蹲下      蹲下
Get down.         Get down?

204
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,870
然后跳舞
And boogie.

205
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,247
谢谢 我得去上班 
Thanks, but I gotta go to work.

206
00:11:59,248 --> 00:12:01,338
顺便让敏蒂把我的眼睛挖出来
And get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.

207
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,218
放心 她也许根本不知道
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.

208
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,529
拜托 我七个月没跟她联络
Please I haven't heard from her in seven months.

209
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,847
她突然打电话给我
And now she calls me.

210
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,100
还能因为什么事
I mean, what else is it about?

211
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,306
她曾经是我最好的朋友
She was my best friend, you guys.

212
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,221
我们一起去夏令营
We went to camp together.

213
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,641
她教我如何接吻      是吗
She taught me how to kiss.         Yeah?

214
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:21,188
现在 我成了第三者
Now, you know, I'm like, I'm like the other woman.

215
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,278
我觉得好      有情趣
I feel so...        Naughty.

216
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,908
晚点见      
All right, I'll see you guys later.         

217
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:28,786
我送你出去
Oh, hold up. I'll walk out with you.

218
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,448
她教你接吻的时候 你们在夏令营
Now Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp.

219
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,743
穿的是紧身制服 还是
And were you wearing any kind of little uniform or...

220
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,713
算了
That's fine, yeah.

221
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,338
好 我要去上厕所 你能不能帮我看着电话
Okay, I'm gonna go the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?

222
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,359
你为什么不把电话拿进去      
Why don't you just take it with you?         

223
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,522
嘿 我们还没进展到第二次约会 
Hey, we haven't been on a second date. 

224
00:12:46,523 --> 00:12:47,676
她需要听我嘘嘘吗
She needs to hear me pee?

225
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,511
你为什么不干脆打给她
Why don't you just call her?

226
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,894
我不能打给她 我已经留言了 我也是有尊严的
I can't call her. I left a message. I have some pride.

227
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,895
有吗     没有
Do you?         No.

228
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,937
丹妮儿 你好
Danielle, hi!

229
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,152
我是钱德
Hi, it's Chandler.

230
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,612
我很好
I'm fine.

231
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,086
是这样的 不知道你有没有打电话给我 
Listen, I don't know if you tried to call me.

232
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:13,251
因为我很白痴 
Because idiot that I am. 

233
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:16,034
不小心把电话关掉了
I accidentally shut off my phone.

234
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:22,420
哦 好 没问题 好极了 好
Oh, okay. That's fine. That's great. Okay.

235
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,756
她在另一线上讲电话 她再打回来
She's on the other line. She's gonna call me back.

236
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,719
她在另一线上讲电话 她再打回来
She's on the other line. She's gonna call me back.

237
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,221
你不是想去嘘嘘吗      所以我才在跳呀
Don't you have to pee?         That's why I'm dancing.

238
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,809
敏蒂      嘿 你好
Mindy.         Hey, you.

239
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,985
嘿 你好
Hey, you.

240
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,157
最近还好吗
So, what's up?

241
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,570
我们应该坐下来说
We should really be sitting for this.

242
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,114
我们当然要坐下
Sure we should.

243
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,765
那么      
So...         

244
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:07,294
我知道 最近事情感觉怪怪的
Now, I know things have been weird lately.

245
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,317
但是你是我认识最久的朋友 
But you're my oldest friend in the world. 

246
00:14:09,318 --> 00:14:12,340
除了萝莉莎菲 我现在不跟她说话了
Except for, maybe Laurie Schaefer who I don't talk to anymore.

247
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,100
自从减肥后 她就一副全世界都欠她的样子
Because she's all bitter now that she lost the weight.

248
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,762
原因是她根本没有一张漂亮的脸
And it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face.

249
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,499
好了 我只问一次 
Okay, I'm just gonna ask this once. 

250
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,230
而且我要很诚实的答案
And I want a straight answer.

251
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,936
好
Okay.

252
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,822
你愿不愿意当我的伴娘
Will you be my maid of honor?

253
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,870
当然罗      那就太好了
Of course!         Oh, that's so great!

254
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,865
太好了 太好了
It is! It is!

255
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,835
你就只想问这件事吗      对啊
Is that all you wanted to ask me?         That's all.

256
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,540
怎么了 怎么了
What? What?

257
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,209
不只是这件事
That's not all.

258
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:52,555
一定只有这件事      不 不只
Oh sure, it is.         Oh no, it isn't. No.

259
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,217
我觉得巴瑞在跟别人约会
I think Barry's seeing someone in the city.

260
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,763
你怎么会有这种想法
What would make you think that?

261
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,965
自从我们宣布订婚后
Well, ever since we announced the engagement

262
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:02,978
他就怪怪的
he's been acting really weird.

263
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,815
昨晚他回家的时候 身上有香奈儿的香水味
And then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.

264
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,698
真的吗
Really?

265
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,611
敏蒂 如果这样讲 你会好过一点
Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better.

266
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,558
巴瑞跟我订婚后 
When Barry and I first got engaged

267
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,327
他的行为也很诡异
he went through a whole weird thing too.

268
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,833
噢 天啊 我就是怕这一点
Oh God. You see, that's what I was afraid of.

269
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,484
怎么了 你是怕哪一点      
What? What's were you afraid of?         

270
00:15:23,485 --> 00:15:24,916
好吧 好吧
Okay, okay.

271
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,026
巴瑞跟你订婚后 
When Barry was engaged to you 

272
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:33,884
他跟我也发展出一点什么
He and I kind of had a little thing on the side.

273
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,049
什么      我知道 我知道
What?         I know. I know.

274
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,941
他跟我求婚时 大家都告诉我
When he proposed to me, everyone said, 

275
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:40,050
不要接受 他以前怎么对瑞秋
"Don't do it. He's gonna do to you

276
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,097
现在也会那么对你
what he did to Rachel."

277
00:15:42,098 --> 00:15:43,518
现在我自己觉得好傻
And now I feel so stupid.

278
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,437
嗯哈
Hmmhuh!

279
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,819
噢 敏蒂
Hmm. Oh, Mindy.

280
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,480
噢 你真的好傻
Oh, you are so stupid.

281
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,110
噢 我们都好傻 
Oh, we are both so stupid.

282
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,653
什么意思
What do you mean?

283
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,704
很熟悉的味道吧      噢 不会吧
Smell familiar?        Oh, no.

284
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,373
我很抱歉
Oh, I'm so sorry.

285
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,331
噢 不 是我很抱歉
Oh, no, me. I am so sorry.

286
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,841
不 是我很抱歉 对不起
No, I am sorry. I'm sorry.

287
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,395
老天
Oh my!

288
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,986
一个字 发出声音
Four letters, circle or hoop.

289
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,522
响啊 该死 响
Ring, damn it, ring.

290
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,236
谢谢
Thanks.

291
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,782
嘿 你知道我们的电话坏掉了吗
Hey, you know our phone's not working?

292
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,446
什么
What?

293
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,340
我从咖啡厅打电话给你 
I tried to call you from the coffee shop. 

294
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:44,412
一直没有人接
There was no answer.

295
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,202
我把电话关掉了
I turned it off.

296
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,962
我的天啊 我把电话关掉了
Mother of God, I turned it off.

297
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,631
就像你跟她讲的那样
Just like you told her you did.

298
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,218
我只是指出反讽之处
Just pointing out the irony.

299
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,423
我去跟对面的门房谈过了
So listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman.

300
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,391
知道了偷窥狂的名字 电话可以用了吧
I got the peeper's name. Can I use the phone?

301
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,475
能不能借用你的电话
Can I use your phone?

302

对 对 那又怎样
Yeah, yeah, so what?

我住在你对面
Look, I live across the street.

312
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,800
我知道你喜欢用望远镜偷窥
And I know all about you and your little telescope.

313
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,923
我很不高兴 知道吗
And I don't appreciate it, okay?

314

对 我现在就可以看到你 喂
Yeah! I can see you right now. Hello?

315
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,180
如果我只穿着内裤 在我家走来走去
Look, if I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear

316
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,270
我没有必要觉得 谢谢
I shouldn't have to feel like... Thank you.

317
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,066
那不是重点
That's not really the point.

318
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:58,550
重点是 主要是重量训练 但是偶尔      
The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally... 

319
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,612

She said you looked pretty the other day in the green dress.

322

绿裙子 真的吗
The green dress? Really?

323
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:15,337
她说那天你很像英格丽保曼
She said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.

What're'you... What're'you guys doing here?         

331
00:18:34,227 --> 00:18:36,404
我们俩来甩了你
We are here to break up with you.

332
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,906
你们俩
Both of you?

333
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,485
我们觉得你是个大烂人 
Basically, we think you're a horrible human being. 

334
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:43,327
你该遭到天打雷劈
And bad things should happen to you.

335
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,116
对不起 对不起 天啊 真对不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. God, I am so sorry.

336
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,743
我是大白痴 我很软弱 无法控制自己
I'm an idiot. I was weak. I couldn't help myself.

337
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,004
不管我做了什么 我这所以做都是因为我太爱你了
Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much.

338
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,751
你是在跟哪一个讲 巴瑞
Which one of us are you talking to there, Bar?

339
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,929
敏蒂
Mindy.

340
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,804
敏蒂 当然是敏蒂  一直都是敏蒂
Mindy, of course, Mindy. It was always Mindy.

341
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,473
甚至包括我们在那张椅子上做爱的时候吗
Even when we were having sex in that chair?

342
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,082
我发誓 不管我在做什么 
I swear, look, whatever I was doing

343
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,356
心里想的都是你
I was always thinking of you.

344
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,391
拜托哦
Oh, please.

345
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,363
第二次的时候
During that second time,

346
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,937
你根本没法把她从一行人里面挑出来
you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup.

347
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,195
你们还做了两次
You did it twice?

348
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,411
第一次不能算数 
Well, the first time didn't really count. 

349
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:22,821
你了解巴瑞的
You know, it was Barry.

350
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,694
噢 对哦
Oh, right.

甜心 宝贝 亲爱的 
Honey, baby, sweetheart, look... 

352
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:28,910
再给我一次机会 好不好
Just give me another chance, okay?

353
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,122
我们重新来过 我们再去阿鲁巴岛
We'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.

354
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,288
你怎么说
What do you say?

355
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,424
法柏医生 有点紧急状况需要你处理
Dr. Farber, we've got an emergency here.

356
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,210
杰森卡斯达拉诺 被自己的牙套噎到了
Jason Castalano's choking on his retainer.

357
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:44,256
天啊 我 马上过去 柏妮丝
Oh, God. I'll be right there, Bernice.

358
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,719
真的 请不要离开 好吗
Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay?

359
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:50,057
我马上回来      好
I'll be right back.         Okay.

360
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:53,223
好 我们会留在这儿 继续恨你
Okay, and we'll be here, hating you.

361
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,150
有没有看到 他走出去的时候 满身大汗
Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of here?

362
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,842
如果我控制住了他 
Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much

363
00:19:58,843 --> 00:20:01,219
你也别客气 过来揍他两拳  
you just jump right in there and take a couple of punches.

364
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,574
那感觉肯定超爽
Because I'm telling you, this feels great.

365
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:07,612
没错 我很确定我还是会嫁给他
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.

366
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,910
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

367
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,872
敏蒂 那家伙是个恶魔
Mindy, the guy is the devil.

368
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,207
他是披着人皮的撒旦
He is Satan in a smock.

369
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,872
我知道他不完美
Look, I know he's not perfect.

370
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,967
但是 到头来 
But the truth is, at the end of the day

371
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:33,680
我还是想当 牙科博士 巴瑞法柏医生的太太
I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.

372
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,848
噢 天啊
Oh, God.

373
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,727
我希望你还是能够为我高兴
I hope you can find some way to be happy for me.

374
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,362
也希望你仍然愿意当我的伴娘
And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor.

375
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,700
我希望巴瑞不会在阿鲁巴岛 把你生吞活剥吃掉
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.

376
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,493
你还好吗
You okay?

377
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,294
还好
Yeah.

378
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,580
真的
Really?

379
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,586
真的
Yeah.

380
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,506
你知道吗 自从我在婚礼上甩了巴瑞跑掉后
You know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding

381
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,638
我一直想知道 我的决定是否正确
I have wondered whether I made the right choice.

382
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,057
现在我知道了
Oh, and now I know.

383
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,851
很为你高兴
I'm so glad.

384
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,773
大日子唷
Big day.

385
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,671
好 我可以赞成 
All right, I'll give you this.

386
00:21:28,672 --> 00:21:30,611
花生先生比较会穿衣服
Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.

387
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,827
他戴着单片眼镜 加上礼帽
I mean, he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat.

388
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,866
你们知道他是同性恋吗
Did you know he's gay?

389
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:43,082
只是想搞清楚 你是在公布花生先生出柜的消息吗
I just wanna clarify this. Are you outing Mr. Peanut?

390
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,045
钱德      丹妮儿 你好
Chandler?         Danielle! Hi!

391
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,760
各位 这位是丹妮儿 丹妮儿 这都是我朋友
Everybody, this is Danielle. Danielle, everybody.

392
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,140
你好      你好
Hi.        Hi.

393
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,757
你怎么会在这里     
What are you doing here?         

394
00:21:52,758 --> 00:21:53,722
我一直打电话给你
Well, I've been calling you.

395
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,932
后来才知道电话号码错了
But it turns out I had your number wrong.

396
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,254
我从查号台拿到正确号码后
And when I finally got the right one from Information

397
00:21:58,255 --> 00:21:59,439
却没人接
there was no answer.

398
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,221
我就想来这里 
So, I thought I'd just come down here.

399
00:22:01,222 --> 00:22:02,602
看看你好不好
And make sure you were okay.

400
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,396
噢 我很好
Oh, I'm okay.

401
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,111
改天我们出去逛逛好吗
Listen, maybe we could get together later?

402
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:09,150
