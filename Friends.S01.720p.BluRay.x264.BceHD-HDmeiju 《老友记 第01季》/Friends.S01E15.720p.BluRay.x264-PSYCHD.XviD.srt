37
00:02:27,362 --> 00:02:30,188
那就表示我就是要干这个
it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.

38
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:31,644
那不是赚更多钱么
So was it a lot more money?

Here you go. Maybe this will cheer you up.

130
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,285
5个小时前 我才吃了一颗葡萄
Ooh, you know, urn, I had a grape about five hours ago,

131
00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:21,869
所以我最好和你分着吃
so I'd better split this with you.

132
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,113
本来就应该那么小 那是前开胃菜
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre appetizer.

133
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:28,705
法国人叫它"阿姆兹布许"
The French call it an amuse bouche.

134
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,427
这太神奇了
Well, it is amusing.

135
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:45,187
嗨 温蒂 是的 8点
Hello? Oh, hi, Wendy. Yeah. 8:00.

136
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,315
我们不是说好了一小时10块?
What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?

137
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,146
太好了 到时见了 拜!
Okay, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.

138
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,925
什么一小时10块?
Ten dollars an hour for what?

139
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:56,612
我请一起工作的女服务员帮忙
I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.

140
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,864
服务员?
Waitressing?

141
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:06,329
当然我考虑过你 但是
Well, of course I thought of you. But...

142
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,454
但是      但是什么?
But        But but?

143
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:14,880
但是 这个晚上必须完美
But, you see, it's just, this night has to go just perfect, you know?

144
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:19,305
温蒂是专业的服务员
and, well, Wendy's more of a professional waitress.

145
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,550
我明白了 我应该保持业余状态
I see. Yes. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status

146
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,682
好在奥运会上当服务员
so that I can waitress in the Olympics.

147
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:35,276
我不想吹牛 但我在76年的因斯布鲁克当过服务员
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76.

148
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,195
阿姆兹布许?
Amuse bouche?

149
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,214
跟我说话
Talk to me.

150
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,216
好吧 额
Okay, uh, ahem,

151
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,050
早上我坐火车时发生了一件诡异的事情
a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning.

152
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,561
不 不 说猥亵的话
No, no. Talk dirty.

153
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,856
在这儿?      快点
Wow. Here?        Come on.

154
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:21,660
说些火辣的
Say something...hot.

155
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:27,081
什么?      额      什么
What?        Uh...        What?

156
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,664
什么?
What?

157
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:30,675
什么
What?

158
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,880
什么?      外阴
What?        Vulva.

159
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,092
"外阴"?
"Vulva"?

160
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:47,719
好啦 我害怕了 她吓我一跳
All right, I panicked, all right? She took me by surprise.

161
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,765
但那也不算完全失败 我们最后以爱抚收场
You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, uh, we ended up cuddling.

162
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,523
爱抚?几次?
Whoa, you cuddled? How many times?

163
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,442
闭嘴 那种感觉很好 我知道
Shut up. It was nice. I just...

164
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,741
我不认为我是那种会说猥亵的话的人
I just don't think I'm the dirty talking kind of guy, you know?

165
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,675
那有什么 你就说你想对她怎样
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her.

166
00:11:04,675 --> 00:11:06,742
或你想她怎样对你
Or what you want her to do to you.

167
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,242
或其他人想怎么对彼此
Or what you think other people might be doing to each other

168
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,669
这样吧 在我身上试试
Look, I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.

169
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,795
开什么玩笑
Please be kidding.

170
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,465
为什么不?来吧
Why not? Come on.

171
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:27,100
只要闭上你的眼睛 告诉我你现在想怎么做
Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.

172
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,889
好吧 我
Okay, I'm, uh,

173
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,433
我在我的公寓
I'm in my apartment

174
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,863
然后呢?      就这样 我在我的公寓 你不在那儿
Yeah, what else?        That's it. I'm in my apartment. You're not there.

175
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:39,855
我们不要继续这段对话
We're not having this conversation.

176
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,490
好吧 我来开头好了      拜托 乔伊
All right. Look, I'll start, okay?        Joey, please.

177
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,821
来吧 准备好了么 听着
Come on. Come on. All right, ready? Look.

178
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,446
哦 罗斯
Oh Ross.

179
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,744
你让我欲火焚身 我要你舔我
You get me so hot, I want your lips on me now.

180
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,415
看吧?
See?

181
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,551
该你说点什么了      我真的不想
All right, now you say something.        I, uh, I really don't think so.

182
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,261
来吧
Come on.

183
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,594
你喜欢她吧 想再见到她 对吧?      当然
You like this woman, right? You wanna see her again, right?        Sure.

184
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:10,261
如果在我面前你都说不了 你要怎么对她说?
Well, if you can't talk dirty to me, how are you gonna talk dirty to her?

185
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,726
现在你告诉我 你想抚模我的屁股!
Now tell me you want to caress my butt.

186
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,857
好吧 转过去
Okay, turn around.

187
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,777
我只是不想我说的时候你盯着我看
I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.

188
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,696
好吧 我不看 说吧
All right, all right. I'm around. Go ahead.

189
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,573

200
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,595
然后?
With?

201
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,482
真好笑      你绝不会相信的
Funny story.        You're not gonna believe this.

202
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,017
没关系 没关系
It's okay. It's okay.

203
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:45,401
我一直都赞成你们在一起
I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.

204
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,925
钱德 你睡觉时 你的前老板又打电话来
Hey, Chandler, while you were sleeping, that guy from your old job called again.

205
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:50,987
又来? 
Oh. Again?

206
00:13:50,987 --> 00:13:53,800
不停不停的打来      又来了
And again and again and again.        And again.

207
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:58,997

又来了
Heh. And again.

209
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:05,838
嘿 卡斯力克先生 15楼还好吗?
Hey, Mr. Costilick. How's life on the 15th floor?

210
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,923
是啊 我也想你
Yeah, I miss you too.

211
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:12,508
偷自己家的笔就没那么好玩了
Yeah. It's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know?

212
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,229
你太慷慨了 但这并不是钱的问题
Well, that's very generous. Uh, but look, this isn't about the money.

213
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,363
我想要的不仅仅是一份工作
You know? I need something that's more than a job.

214
00:14:20,363 --> 00:14:23,105
我需要我真正在乎的一些东西
I need something I really care about.

215
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,275
外加之前你提过的年终奖金?
And that's on top of the yearend bonus structure you mentioned earlier?

216
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,817
你的梦想!      你的梦想!
Your dream.        Your dream.

00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,484
听着 艾尔 我不是故意为难你 好么?
Look, Al. Al,I'm not playing hardball here, okay?

218
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:36,830
这不是谈判 这是拒绝! 不 不 不 不
This is not a negotiation. This is a rejection. No. No, no. No, no.

219
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,449
不要再跟我说数字!
No, stop saying numbers!

220
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:42,082
我告诉你 你找错人了!
I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy!

Wow. It's huge. It's so much bigger than the cubicle.

223
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,689
这是大大的正方体!
Oh, this is a cube.

224

Look at this.

我来为你倒杯酒

Give them to me.        This is not worth it.

295
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:07,991
小熊落水了!他们要淹死了!
Oh, oh! Bear overboard. I think he's drowning.

Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this,

302
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:30,010
而你却不能再等4分半钟的洋葱馅饼
and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?

303

00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,198
你不会想为那种人工作的
You don't want to work for a guy like that.

306

我是猥亵话的教主
I was the James Michener of dirty talk.

312
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,764
那是有史以来最具巧思的猥亵话
It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard.

313

然后呢?
Oh, and, uh

316
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:32,075

Well, urn, you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk.

317
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,824
已经很晚了 而且我们都精疲力尽了 所以
it was kind of late, and we were both kind of exhausted, so

318

你们爱抚了      没错 那样很好
You cuddled.        Yeah, which was nice.

319

你们想去看晚场电影吗?
You guys want to try and catch a late movie or something?

320
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:45,675
或许吧 不等钱德吗?      他跑哪去了?
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?        Yeah. Where the hell is he?

321
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,961

You will care about it, because I care about it. You got it? Good!

325
