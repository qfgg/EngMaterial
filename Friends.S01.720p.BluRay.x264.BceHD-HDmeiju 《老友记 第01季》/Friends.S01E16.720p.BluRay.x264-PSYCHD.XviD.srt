But, you know, we've grown apart, so, urn

133
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,736

Okay,I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.

151
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:27,689
我搞不懂为什么就因为我是女人 就不能当教练
I don't see why I have to miss out on the coaching training because I'm a woman.

152
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,687

打从70年代以来没看过 这么难看的年度使用数据
We haven't seen an ANUS this bad since the 70s.

165
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:23,202
这代表何意?      不得不栽员了
So, what does this mean?         We're gonna be laying off people in every department.

Look, you're cold, I have to pee, and there's a cup of coffee on the window.

187
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,110
能坏到哪去呢?
How bad could it be?

188
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,363
有答案了
I think we have an answer

189
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,286
她来干嘛?
What's she doing here?

190
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,915
这是上帝的旨意 要我们在家用餐别乱跑
This could be God's way of telling us to eat at home.

191
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:59,382
她被瑞夫餐馆开除了吗?      昨晚我们去时
 Think she got fired at Riff'         No. we were there last night.

192
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,259
她一直送箭鱼来 你不去厕所？
She kept bringing sword fish. Are you gonna go?

193
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,679
等我们点餐再去 毕竟是跟她点 对吧?
I'll wait until we order. It's her, right?

194
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,382
很像是她
It looks like her

195
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:09,425
抱歉      怎样?
 Urn, excuse rne?         Yeah?

00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,944
跟你们一样啊
As much as you are.

200
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,442
该你了
Your turn.

201
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,112
我们想点餐了      很好
 We know what we want.         Oh,that's good.

202
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,828
两杯拿铁      一些饼干
All we want is two caffe lattes.         And some biscotti cookies.

204
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,461
绝对是她没错      对
 It's definitely her.         Yeah.

205
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,551
真难以置信
I can't believe you.

206
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,937
结果你还是无法开除她?
You still haven't told that girl she doesn't have a job yet?

207
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,642
你也没拆圣诞灯啊
Well, you still haven't taken down the Christmas lights.

208
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:03,362
恭喜喔 你刚找到个 最难吵起来的话题
Congratulations. I think you found the worlds thinnest argument.

209
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,983
我只是想等到适当时机
I'm just trying to find the right moment.

210
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:09,281
应该不难 因为你们现在交往
Oh. well, that shouldn't be so hard, now that you're dating.

211
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,487
"亲爱的 你被开除了
"Sweet heart,you're fired.

212
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:15,425
不过上班前我们快快来一下如何"
But how about a quickie before I go to work?"

213
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,292
好      好
 Hey.         Hey.

214
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:26,044
既然人都进来了 就不用再敲门了
Once you're inside, you don't have to knock anymore.

215
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,638
我来开
I'll get it.

216
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,885
黑考斯先生
Oh. Hi. Mr. Heckles.

217
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,515
你们又在弄它了
You're doing it again.

218
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,222
我们什么都没弄啊
We're not doing anything.

219
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,559
我们只是坐着静静聊天而已
We're just sitting around talking quietly.

220
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,978
我的天花板很吵
I can hear you through the ceiling.

221
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,940
我的猫睡不着
My cats can't sleep.

222
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,242
你根本没养猫啊
You don't even have cats.

223
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,366
我本来可能养的
I could have cats.

224
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,122
再见 黑考斯先生
Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.

225
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,872
我们会小声点
We'll try to keep it down.

226
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,749
菲比 可以帮个忙吗?
Phoebe, can you do me a favor?

227
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:07,001
试穿下看合不合身
Try this on to make sure it fits.

228
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:11,134
我的第一件生日礼物 真的很

Oh, no, no.It's for Ursula. I just figured, you know, sizewise.

230
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,896
没问题 好
Oh. Sure. Yeah.

231
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,473
好 很合适
Okay, it fits.

232
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,068
你又要约她吗?
 Are you seeing her again tonight?         

233
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,487

你们玩真的
Wow, this is serious.

235
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,447
我从没见过你肯为女朋友花钱
I'v enever known you to pay money for any kind of capade.

236
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,446
不知道 我就是喜欢她啊
Idon't know. I like her

237
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,041
她跟别人不同 她有某种特质
She's different. There's,uh, something about her

That you like. We get it. You like her. Great.

239
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,090
菲比 我事先问过你 你说没意见的啊
Hey, Phoebe I asked you, and you said it was okay.

240
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,213
但现在有意见了
Well, maybe now its not okay.

241
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,135
好吧
Okay.

242
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,089
但现在我对你有意见这事 很有意见了
Well, maybe now l'm not okay with it not being okay.

243
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,552
好吧
Okay.

244
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,310
快织 好女人 快织
Knit, good woman. Knit. Knit.

245
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,531
这边是克莱斯勒大楼
And that's the Chrysler Building right there.

246
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,874
妮娜      道格拉斯先生
 Nina.         Mr. Douglas.

247
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,414
领带很正
Cool tie.

248
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:26,918
她还在
She's still here.

249
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,800
是 她还在
Yes. Yes. she is.

250
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,889
我不是有用纸条给你报告过
Didn't I memo you on this?

251
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:36,758
我开除她后 她的心理医师 法兰医师
See, after I let her go, uh, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen.

252
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,555
法兰医师
Dr. Flanan, Dr. Flan.

253
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:44,023
告知我 她对开除这事 适应不良
And. uh he informed me that she took the news rather badly

254
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,977
还用了非常激动这样的字眼
In fact. he uh mentioned the word"frenzy."

255
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,270
少开玩笑了 她明明就很
You're kidding. She seems so

256
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,321
没有 妮娜吗?她
no. no. Nina?She's

257
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,485
要是你去问她
In fact, if you asked her now

258
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,617
她对被开除一事 完全没有印象了
she'd have no recollection of being fired at all.

259
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,077
太不可置信了
That's unbelievable.

260
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,955
却又很可信
And yet believable.

261
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,707
所以我决定 在确定她不会伤害自己
So I decided not to fire her again

262
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,290
或其他人之前 不会再开除她一次
until I'm sure she will be of no threat to herself or others.

263
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:14,467
好吧 人对事情的反应 真的很难预料
I see. Hmm. I guess you never really know whats going on inside a person's head.

264
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,641
所以才有心理学吧 老板
Well, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir.

265
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:24,476
这声音是爸妈都终生难忘的
The sound Mom and Dad will never forget.

266
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,934
毕竟 这是生产的奇迹
For this, after all, is the miracle of birth.

267
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,519
请开灯
Lights, please.

268
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,195
这就是生产的过程
And that's having a baby.

269
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,656
下周就是最后一堂课了
Next week is our final class.

270
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,784
苏珊 往前跑
Susan, go deep.

271
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,083
太了不起了 真是太了不起了
It's impossible.It's just impossible.

272
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,375
什么东西了不起?
What is, honey?

273
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,461
刚才那女人
What that woman

274
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,708
的表现
did.

275
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,459
我才不要经历那种事
I am not doing that. Heh.

276
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,761
只要宝宝不生出来就好了 那就一切依旧
It'll have to stay in,that's all. Everything will be the same.

277
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:59,049
只要不生出来      卡萝 亲爱的
 It'll just stay in. Ha. ha.         Carol, honey. Shh.

278
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,930
会一切顺利的      你懂个屁
 Everything will be all right.         What do you know?

279
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,979
又不会有人跟你说 那是你的鼻孔吗?
No one's going up to you and saying, "Hi,is that your nostril?

280
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,724
可以把这肉块 从这推出去吗?
Mind if we push this pot roast through it?"

281
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,567
卡萝 亲爱的
Carol, sweetie.

282
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,231
深呼吸吐气
Cleansing breath.

283
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,657
我知道这很吓人 往远想点
I know it's frightening. But big picture:

284
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,281
生产不过是那短短一天
The birth part is just one day

285
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,869
等一生完后 我们这辈子 就成了人家的父母了
and when it's over,we'll all be parents for the rest of our lives.

286
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,039
这么辛苦不就是为了这点吗?
I mean that's what this is all about, right?

287
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,331
对吧 罗斯?
Ross?

288
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,500
罗斯
Ross.

289
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,340
我要当爸爸了
I'm gonna be a father.

290
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,712
你现在才想到吗?      我是知道会有个孩子
 This is just occurring to you?         I always knew I was having a baby.

291
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,303
只是一直没想到 孩子也会有我
I just never realized the baby was having me.

292
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,600
你可以办到的
Oh, you're gonna be great.

293
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,261
你怎么知道
How could you say that?

294
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,556
我连叫马塞尔别吃浴室踏垫 都没办法了
I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bathmat.

295
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,600
要怎么养育小孩
How will I raise a kid?

296
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,353
科学家说…
You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying 

297
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,651
猴子和小孩是不一样的
that monkeys and babies are actually different.

298
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,243
去哪?      出去
 Where are you going?         Out.

299
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:02,870
跟谁?
With?

300
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,576
是的
Yes.

301
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,790
问你件事
All right, can I just ask you one question?

302
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:11,254
你们有那个了吗?
Have you two, you know like, you know?

303
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:13,922
就那个
You know?

304
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:15,920
有没
Yet?

305
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,795
虽然这不关你事
Well, not that it's any of your business

306
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,762
但还没 可以吗?
but no, we havent, okay?

307
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,562
你是指做爱对吧
You meant sex, right?

308
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,861
有空吧      有 妮娜 怎么了?
 Do you have a sec?         Uh sure Nina.What'sup?

309
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,657
不知道 过去几天 大家都躲着我
I don't know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me

310
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,829
看到我表情都怪怪的
and giving me these really strange looks.

311
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,238
喔 可能是因为
Oh, well, uh, maybe that's because

312
00:18:49,238 --> 00:18:52,249
大家都嫉妒我们吧
they're, uh, jealous of us.

313
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,963
可能
Maybe.

314
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:57,338
但他们收走剪刀 就说不通了吧
But that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors.

315
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:02,096
或许是因为要给你加薪了
Uh well, maybe that's,uh because you're getting a big raise.

316
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,558
有吗?      当然 为什么不呢?
 I am?         Sure. Why not?

317
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,811
天啊 你好棒
Oh, my God.You're amazing.

318
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,309
可不是嘛
Oh, you dont know.

319
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:15,606
海伦 请记得布克邦德小姐 加薪的事文件要弄好
Helen, make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise.

320
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,943
那还要把她精神病历 送到人事处吗?
Still want her psychological profile sent to personnel?

321
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,984
什么      海伦有酗酒问题
 What?         Helen drinks.

322
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,490
愿意嫁给我吗?
Will you marry me?

323
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,921
最后我全盘托出      她反应如何?
 Well, I ended up telling her everything.         Ooh. How'd she take it?

324
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,208
很好 除了钉书针
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing.

325
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,715
小提示 要是遇到同样状况
Little tip. If you're ever in a similar situation

326
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:44,673
手千万别放在桌上
never ever leave your hand on the desk.

327
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,851
我应该知道怎么操作了
Okay, I think I get how to do this.

328
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,767
可以关掉吗? 可以弄走吗?
Can we turn this off? Can we make them go away?

329
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,852
因为我看不下去
Because I can't watch.

330
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,938
好了 菲比 关掉了      好
 Okay, Pheebs, they're gone.         Okay.

331
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,407
你还好吗?      好着呢
 Are you all right?         Yeah.

332
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,532
对 就乌苏拉那事
It's just, you know, this whole stupid Ursula thing.

333
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,405
菲比 问你一句
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask?

334
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,833
他跟她约会就 真的有这么糟吗?
So he's going out with her. Is it really so terrible?

335
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,077
有
Urn, yeah.

336
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,423
不是说她很坏什么的
I mean,I'm not saying she's evil or anything.

337
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,422
但她老是坏了我的好事
She's just, you know, always breaking my stuff.

338
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:26,673
我八岁时不肯借她我的保温瓶
When I was 8 ,I wouldn't let her have my Judy Jetson Thermos

339
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,887
她就把保温瓶扔到车底
she threw it under the bus.

340
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,598
还有兰迪布朗
And then there's Randy Brown

341
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,270
他就
who was like

342
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,645
你们有过青梅竹马般的男友吗?
Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?

343
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,310
没有      没
 No.         No.

344
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,897
他就是我青梅竹马的男友
Well, but that's what he was for me.

345
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,657
她却抢走他
And she, you know, kind of stole him away

346
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,737
却让他心碎
and then broke his heart.

347
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,114
之后他再也不理我了
And then he wouldn't even talk to me anymore.

348
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:56,661
因为他说不想再看到 跟我们一样的人
He said he didn't want to be around anything that looked like either one of us.

349
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,122
菲比
Oh, Pheebs.

350
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:04,798
我清楚乔伊不是我男友或保温瓶
I mean, I know Joey's not my boyfriend or my Thermos

351
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,258
或其他东西 但是
or anything, but

352
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,258
你不会失去他的      你要跟他谈开来
 You won't kind of lose him.         You gotta talk to Joey.

353
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,805
对 好
Yeah, okay.

354
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:15,138
他不知道你的想法 如果他知道你这么想
Come on. He doesn't know this stuff. If he knew how you felt

355
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,972
他爱上她了啊
He's falling in love with her

356
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,184
拜托 才不过交往一周
Oh, please. They've been going out a week.

357
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:23,734
连床都没上过 根本不算什么
They haven't even slept together yet. I mean,that's not serious.

358
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,568
好吧
Okay.

359
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,700
好
Oh. Okay. Oh.

360
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,762
有什么事吗?
Yeah, urn, may we help you?

361
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,563
(待续)

362
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,784
瑞秋 你干嘛啦? 好冷喔 你到屋里来好吗?
Rachel, what are you doing? It's freezing. Would you come inside?

363
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,827
不要
No, no, no.

364
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,747
是你叫我拆掉的
You wanted me to take them down

365
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,542
那我就来拆啊
I'm taking them down, okay?

366
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:21,871
瑞秋
Rachel!

367
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,541
瑞秋      没事
Rachel!        I'm okay.I'm okay.

368
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:27,919
黑考斯先生
Mr. Heckles?

369
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,590
黑考斯先生 帮帮我
Mr. Heckles could you help me, please?

370
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,976
看吧 这就是我一直说的
See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
