133
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,649
我在特餐公告栏写特餐消息
I write the specials on the specials board.

134
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:13,987
将枯掉的花从花瓶拿出来
And I take the dead flowers out of the vase.

135
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:19,071
有时候阿杜洛会让我 将小巧克力块放在饼干上
Urn, oh, and sometirnes Arturo lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.

136
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,082
你妈妈没跟我们提小巧克力块的事
Well, your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.

137
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,213
瑞秋 你跟你的朋友聊得还好吧?
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?

138
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:43,015
好啊 你要喝点鸡尾酒吗?
Okay, how would you like some Tiki Death Punch?

139
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,224
那是什么?
What's that?

140
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,357
我加了兰姆酒跟...      好吧
Wellit'srum and...        Okay.

141
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:53,196
我们想既然菲比要留下来过夜 我们要办睡衣派对
We thought since Phoebe's staying over we'd have a slumber party.

142
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:57,530
我们买了八卦杂志 还有饼干跟扭扭乐
We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister.

143
00:08:57,863 --> 00:08:59,866
我带了手术游戏来
Ooh, ooh. And I brought Operation.

144
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,999
但镊子不见了 没办法动手术
But I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate.

145
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,997
但我们能帮病人做准备
But we can prep the guy.

146
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,256
瑞秋 是信用卡公司打来的
Rach.it's the Visa-card people.

147
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,712
天啊 问他们想干什么
Oh, God. Ask them what they want.

148
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,220
请问有何贵事吗?
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to?

149
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,134
好的 请稍等
Yes, hold on.

150
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,891
他们说你的帐户有异常活动
Urn, they say there's been unusual activity on your account.

151
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:26,305
但我好几个星期没刷卡了      那就是异常活动
But I haven't used my card in weeks.         That is the unusual activity.

152
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,642
他们只想知道你是否没事
They just wanna see if you're okay.

153
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,776
他们想知道我是否没事?
They wanna know if I'mokay?

154
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,279
好吧 他们想知道我是否没事 让我想一想
Okay, they wanna know if I'm okay. Okay,let's see.

155
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,863
让我想一想 社会安全税拿走我所有的钱
Well let's see. The FICA guys took all my money.

156
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,905
我认识的人不是结婚 怀孕就是升官了
Everyone I know is either getting married or getting pregnant or getting promoted...

157
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,573
我在端咖啡
...and I'm getting coffee.

158
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,867
那不是我要喝的咖啡
And it's not even for me.

159
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,629
如果那听起来像是我很好 跟他们说我很好 好吗?
So if that sounds like Im okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay. Okay?

160
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,835
瑞秋不在
Uh, Rachel has left the building.

161
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:01,507
你能再打来吗?      好了 来吧
Can you call back?         All right. Come on.

162
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,597
我们来玩扭扭乐
Let's play Twister.

163
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,571
抱歉      对不起
Sorry.         Sorry, sorry, sorry.

164
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,568
什么? 你那晚跟卡萝也看到冰了吗?
What? There was ice there that night with Carol?

165
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:24,829
塑胶椅? 四千名愤怒的匹兹堡球迷?
Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?

166
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,208
不 我是说看起来 我们没办法坐在一起
No, actually, I was just saying it looks likewe'renot sitting together.

167
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:33,122
既然你都提起了 那晚的确跟冰有关系
But now that you mention it, there was ice there that night.

168
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,254
那晚是初霜

你在独立过生活
You're doing this amazing independent thing.

172
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,425
摩妮卡 那有什么好的?
Monica, what is so amazing?

173
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:50,063
我放弃了一切 为什么?
I gave up like everything. And for what?

174
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,769
你跟杰克一样?
You are just like Jack.

175
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,728
楼下的杰克?
Jack from downstairs?

See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans.

179
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,539
他醒过来 看到一大探植物
And then he woke up and there was this big plant...

180
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,168
在他家窗户外面 充满了无限的可能性
...outside of his window, full of possibilities and stuff.

181
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:16,001
他住在小村子里 你住在村区
And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village.

182
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:20,005
好了 菲比 杰克放弃一头牛
Okay but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow.

183
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,466
我放弃一位牙齿矫正师
I gave up an orthodontist.

184
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,006

But, see, it was a plan, you know? It was clear.

00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,690
一切都已经安排好了 现在是...
Everything was figured out, and now everything's just kind of like...

188
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,897
混乱?      对
Flupie?         Yeah.

189
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:41,148
不只是你 我们也不知道自己要做什么
You're not the only one. We don't know where we're going.

190
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,068
终有一天你会知道 情况会变得清楚
You gotta figure, at some point, it's gonna come together...

191
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,078
不再混乱

193
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,503
好吧 摩妮卡 如果情况不会好转呢?
Okay, but, Monica, what if it doesn't come together?

194
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,290
菲比
Pheebs?

195
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,678
因为你...我不喜欢这个问题
Well, because you just...I don't like this question.

196
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:08,429
看吧 如果我们找不到魔豆呢?
Okay, see? See, you guys? What if we dont get magic beans?

197
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,265
我是说如果我们只有

Thats all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.

202

And people less sick than my friend have gone in.

257
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,934
我是指脚趾有问题的家伙 他跟谁上床?
I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with?

258
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:26,016
少来了 朵拉 别生气
Oh, come on, Dora.Don't be mad.

259
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,731
我知道我们都说了一些
I know we both said some things...

260
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,396
无心之语
we didn't mean...

261
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,862
那不代表我们不爱彼此
...but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other

262
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,985
我觉得我失去她了
You know I feel like I've lost her

263
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,912
还没开灯?      对
Lights still out?         Yeah.

264
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,828
或许他们在睡觉
Well, maybe they're napping.

265
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,962
拜托 他们在上床
Heh. Please.They're having sex.

266
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,623
闭嘴
Shut up.

267
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:59,265
你们觉得乔治是什么样的人?
So, what do you think George is like?

268
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,801
我想他应该很害羞      是吗?
I think he's shy.         Oh, yeah?

269
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,595
对 我想你得鼓励他
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out.

270
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:08,733
当你那么做时 他会变成做好准备的野兽
And then when you do, he's a preppy animal.

271
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,362
少来了
Come on.

272
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,858
我记得月光从打开的窗户洒了进来
I remember the moonlight coming in through the open window

273
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,528
她的脸闪闪发光美极了
...and her face had the most incredible glow.

274
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,914
对 月光 发光 神奇感觉
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling.

275
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,120
这部份你说过了
You did this part.

276
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,331
拜托送点止痛药过来
Could I get some painkillers over here, please?

277
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:32,749
他说的对 够了 今天有什么大不了的?
He's right, enough already. What is the big deal about today?

278
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,589
你第一次跟她上床 那有什么大不了的?
So you slept with her for the first time. So what?

279
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,175
之后你跟她睡了七年
You slept with her for seven years after that.

280
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,800
情况比你说的复杂
It's just a little more complicated than that.

281
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,765
什么?怎么了? 她离开你?她喜欢女人?
What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women?

282
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,100
她为了喜欢女人的女人离开你?
That she left you for a woman that likes women?

283
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,310
你可以再大声一点
A little louder

284
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,647
12楼陷入昏迷的病人 没听到你在说什么
There's a man on the 12th floor in a coma who didn't quite hear you.

285
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,363
那又怎么样?
Then what?

你一辈子只跟一个女人在一起过?
So in your whole life, you've only been with one...?

293
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:30,807
天啊 看曲棍球赛是个天大的错误
Oh, boy. Hockey was a big mistake.

294
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,440
今晚我们可以做的事太多了
There's a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight.

Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.

300
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:01,383

What? You slept with Jason?         You had already broken up.

301
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,048
分手多久?      只有几小时
How long?         Just a couple hours.

302
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,217
