1
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,420
各位      菲比
Hi, guys.        Hey, Phoebe.

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:08,920
你的约会怎么样?
Hey, oh, how did it go?

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,170
呃 不是很好
Um, not so good.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,170
他送我到地铁然后跟我说 "我们应该再来一次"
He walked me to the subway and said, "We should do this again. "

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,050
什么?      他说：再来一次?!
What?        He said, "We should do it again. "

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,300
那不是很好吗?
That's good, right?

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,600
不 通俗点说"我们应该再来一次"意思是
Uh, no. Loosely translated, "We should do this again," means:

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,850
"你将无法再见到裸体的我"
"You will never see me naked. "

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,270
什么时候这样子的?
Since when?

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,810
一直都是这样的啊. 就像是约会用语
Since always. It's, like, dating language.

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,230
比如,"问题不是出在你"代表"就是你"
You know, like, "It's not you," means, "It is you. "

12
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,990
"你真好"意思是说
"You're such a nice guy," means:

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,160
我要和皮革族的酒徒约会
"I'm gonna be dating leatherwearing alcoholics

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,780
然后向你抱怨
and complaining about them to you. "

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,290
还有 "我们该试试别人"代表
Or, you know, um, "I think we should see other people," means:

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,000
"我已和别人约会了"
"Ha, ha, I already am. "

17
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,880
大家都懂?
And everybody knows this?

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,040
对 善意的谎言
Oh, yeah. Cushions the blow.

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,800
没错 就像父母给小孩的狗安乐死时
Yes,like when you're a kid and your parents put your dog to sleep

20
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,420
他们会说它跑到别人家农场去住了
and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.

21
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,680
真有意思,不过我爸妈是真的
That's funny. No, because, uh, our parents actually did

22
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,390
	把我们的狗送给别人养了
uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,310
呃 罗斯?
Uh, Ross?

24
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,560
米纳他们在康乃迪克州的农场
Ha, ha. Hello. The Milner's farm in Connecticut?

25
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,190
米纳他们家的农场好棒
The Milners, they had this unbelievable farm.

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,940
有马还有可供追逐的兔子
They had horses and rabbits that he could chase.

27
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,990
而且
And it was...

28
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,950
噢,琪琪
Oh, my God. ChiChi.

33
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,090
知道自己不久人世有何感受?
"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"

34
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,640
典狱长 我的痛苦将在五分钟内消除
Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over.

35
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,720
但你得承受埋葬一个老实人的痛苦
But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.

36
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,640
表演得真好      是吗?
Hey, that was really good.        Yeah?

37
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,190
谢了      咱们继续吧
Yeah.         Thanks.Let's keep going.

38
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,230
好 你要我怎么做 迪默?嗯?
Okay. "So, what do you want from me, Dimon? Huh?"

39
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,660
我只想回到我的牢房内 因为这样我才可以抽烟
I just wanna go back to my cell, because in my cell, I can smoke.

40
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,620
你就在这里抽吧
"Smoke away. "

41
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,510
我想这就是迪默自己一个在牢房里抽烟的原因
I think this is probably why Dimon smokes in his cell alone.

42
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,390
什么      手放轻松
What?        Relax your hand.

43
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,350
手腕自然点
Let your wrist go.

44
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,600
别太过火!      哇
Not so much.        Whoa.

45
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,060
喂
Hey.

46
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,100
好的 现在吐口烟
All right. Now try taking a puff.

47
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,980
就是这样
Right.

48
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,230
给我来      不 我不能给你烟
Okay, no, give it to me.        No, no, no. I'm not giving you a cigarette.

49
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,780
无所谓的 你到底想不想演这个角色?来
No, it's fine. It's fine. Look, do you want to get this part or not? Here.

50
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,620
看着 别把它当成香烟
All right. Now, don't think of it as a cigarette.

51
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,830
把它当成是你想念多时的东西
Think of it as the thing that has been missing from your hand.

52
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,960
夹着它你感到自在
When you're holding it, you feel right.

53
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,500
让你感到满足      你很想它?
You feel complete.        You miss it?

54
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,340
没那么严重
No, not so much.

55
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,340
好吧 抽烟
All right. Now we smoke.

56
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,600
噢,真爽呀!
Oh, my God.

57
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,690
哦 不!
No, no, no.

58
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,070
不 是和拇指尖到食指尖
They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb

59
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,900
的距离相同的
to the tip of his index finger.

60
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,290
这太荒谬了
That's ridiculous.

61
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,160
随便哪个姆指都行?
Can I use either thumb?

62
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,580
不不不 我自己来
All right. Don't tell me, don't tell me.

63
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,260
无咖啡因卡布其诺 是乔伊的
Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

64
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,970
纯咖啡
Coffee, black.

65
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,300
拿铁
Latte.

66
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,600
和冰红茶
And an iced tea.

67
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,230
我进步神速      不错
I'm getting pretty good at this.        Excellent. That's very good.

68
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,850
我真行
Good for me.

69
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,450
菲比 你没事吧      我还好
You okay, Phoebe?        Yeah, no, it's not even worth

70
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,000
我的银行
It's my bank.

71
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,460
他们对你怎么了?
What did they do to you?

72
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,500
没怎么 只是... 呃
It's nothing, it's just...Okay.

73
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,340
我看我的信件时 看见他们的每月通知
I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly "statement. "

74
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,000
别激动
Easy.

75
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,680
我的户头多了五百元
And there's 500 extra dollars in my account.

76
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,140
撤旦的奴隶又开始活跃了
Oh, Satan's minions at work again.

77
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,310
没错 因为我得到银行找他们处理掉
Yes, because now I have to go down there and deal with them

78
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,730
别傻了 留着自己用吧      这些钱不是我的
What are you talking about? Keep it.        It's not mine.

79
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,560
不是我赚的 我留下来 这感觉就像偷来的
I didn't earn it. If I kept it, it would be like stealing.

80
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,360
如果你拿来花就如同购物
Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping.

81
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,690
好吧 好吧
Okay. Okay.

82
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,990
就比方说我买了一双很棒的鞋
Let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes.

83
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,490
你们知道我每走一步会听到什么吗?
Do you know what I'd hear with every step I took?

84
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,120
"不是我的 不是我的..."
"Not mine. Not mine. Not mine. "

85
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,160
即使我再快乐再雀跃都会听到
And even if I was happy, okay, and skipping

86
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,540
"不是我的不是我的"
I'd hear, "No-not mine. No-not mine. "

87
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,380
知道你的意思了
We're with you. We got it.

88
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:46,630
我无法享受非份之财的乐趣 会有报应的
Okay, I'd never be able to enjoy it. It'd be like this giant karmic debt.

89
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,220
钱德 你在干什么?喂
Chandler, what are you doing? Hey.

90
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,260
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

91
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,350
噢,真恶劣!
Oh, gross.

92
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,390
这是什么      我在抽烟
What is this?        I'm smoking. I'm smoking. I'm smoking.

93
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,190
真不敢相信! 你这三年来一直表现良好
I can't believe you. You've been so good for three years.

94
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,980
这是我的奖励
And this is my reward.

95
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,650
等等 想想你戒烟后是怎么活过来的
Hold on a second. Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.

96
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,740
所以这一次我不再戒了
Okay, so this time I won't quit.

97
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,450
熄掉      好吧 我熄掉就是
Put it out.        All right. I'm putting it out.

98
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,370
噢,不!
Oh, no.

99
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,540
我现在喝不了它了
I can't drink this now.

100
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,670
我要去换衣服了,我有个约会
All right, I'm gonna go change. I've got a date.

101
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,340
又是亚伦?进展得如何?
Is this Alan again? How's it going?

102
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,680
进展的还不错.我们在一起很开心
It's going pretty good, you know? It's nice and we're having fun.

103
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,850
我们何时能见到他?      就是。
So when do we get to meet the guy?        Yeah.

104
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,810
既然今天是星期一
Let's see, today's Monday

105
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,890
永远别想      不要这样嘛
Never.        Come on.

106
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,100
不,不要再来像史提夫那次的事       说什么呢?
No,not after what happened with Steve.        What are you talking about?

107
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,770
我们都"嗨"(爱)屎(史)提夫 屎(史)夫很黑(性)感
We love Steve. Steve was sexy.

108
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,740
对不起
Sorry.

109
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,070
我对他有何感觉都不知道 给我一点时间想清楚
Look, I don't know how I feel about him yet. Give me a chance to figure it out.

110
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,910
这么说我们可以见他?
Well, then can we meet him?

111
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,450
不行!
No.

112
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,250
腿(对)不齐(起)!
Sorry.

113
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,170
我为何要让他们见他?
Why should I let them meet him?

114
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,290
我带他回去后 他们都挖苦他
I bring a guy home and within five minutes they're all over him.

115
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,340
就像郊狼一样找畜群中的弱者下手
I mean, they're like coyotes picking off the weak members of the herd.

116
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,390
听着 作为一个见了过多坏牛排的人
Listen, as someone who's seen more than her share of bad beef...

117
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,390
	我告诉你这并不是一件坏事
I'll tell you, that is not such a terrible thing.

118
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,100
你的朋友他们只是关心你
Come on, they're your friends. They're looking out after you.

119
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,237
我知道  我只是...
I know, I know.

120
00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:25,650
希望带一个他们真正喜欢的男人回家
I wish that once I'd bring a guy home they actually liked.

121
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,570
你知道的 他的机会会更渺茫的
Well, you do realize that the odds of that happening are a little slimmer

122
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,610
如果他们根本就没见过这小伙
If they never get to meet the guy.

123
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,120
罗斯,别管了
Let it go, Ross.

124
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,080
你又不了解琪琪
Yeah? Well, you didn't know ChiChi.

125
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,410
你们都保证?
Do you all promise?

126
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,330
我们保证会很友善的      对 我们保证
Yeah, we promise. We'll be good.         We promise.

127
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,460
钱德 你保证会很友善?
Chandler, do you promise to be good?

128
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,270
你可以进来了,但是你的烟屁股朋友得待在外面
You can come in, but your filter tip little buddy has to stay outside.

129
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,190
嗨 菲比!
Hey, Pheebs.

130

135
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,380

Now I have $1000 and a football phone.

136
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,340
这是哪家银行?
What bank is this?

137
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,380
他来了
Okay, it's him.

138
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,100

记得你们有多么爱我
I mean, remember how much you like me.

142
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,490
亚伦 这是大家 各位 他是亚伦
Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.

143
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,370
嗨    嗨!
Hi.      Hey.

144
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,450
小莫肿(总)跟我提起你闷(们)
I've heard so much about all you guys.

145
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,170
谢谢 我明天再打电话给你
Thanks, I'll call you tomorrow.

146
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,670
好的
Okay.

147
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,300
开始攻击亚伦吧
Okay, let's let the Alanbashing begin.

148
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,350
谁先开始?
Who's gonna take the first shot?

149
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,720
嗯
Hmm?

150
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,520
来吧!
Come on.

151
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,890
我先来!
I'll go.

152
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,980
我们就从他不停剔牙开始
Let's start with the way he kept picking at

153
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,650
抱歉,我办不到.
You know, I'm sorry, I can't do this.

154
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,320
我们爱他
Can't do it. We loved him.

155
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,110
我们爱他.       等一下.
We loved him.        Wait a minute.

156
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,410
我们谈的是我约会的对象吗?
We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?

157
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,410
你们都有注意到?
Yes. And did you notice?

158
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,950
耶!
Yeah.

159
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,460
知道他什么最棒吗? 他的微笑有点邪邪的
Know what was great? The way his smile was kind of crooked.

160
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,670
对 就像是鞋里的男人
Yes, yes. Like the man in the shoe.

161
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,670
什么鞋?
What shoe?

162
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,430
诗里的
From the nursery rhyme.

163
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,890
有个驼背的人有着扭曲的微笑...
"There was a crooked man who had a crooked smile

164
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,720
他住在鞋子里 有一阵子
who lived in a shoe for a while"

165
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,020
我认为亚伦
So I think Alan

166
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,440
将成为
will become the yardstick

167
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,400
日后男友被丈量的标准
against which all future boyfriends will be measured.

168
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,770
什么日后男友?
What future boyfriends?

169
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,530
不 我想他就是了
No, no. I think this could be, you know, "it. "

170
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,820
真的呀?      当然
Really?        Oh, yeah.

171
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,490
他学大卫・哈塞尔霍夫(《海滩游侠》主演)
I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhoff impression alone.

172
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,330
你知道嘛 我也要在派对上这么做
You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?

173
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,630
知道我最喜欢他哪一点?      哪一点?
You know what I like most about him?       What?

174
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,670
他改变我看待自己的方式
The way he makes me feel about myself.

175
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,050
耶!
Yeah.

176
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,860
嗨
Hi.

177
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,360
比赛怎么样?
How was the game?

178
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,110
怎么说呢
Well

179
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,870
我们赢啦! 耶!
We won! We won! Thank you! Yeah.

180
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,620
太意外了!问题是 这怎么可能呢?
Fantastic. I have one question: How is that possible?

181
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,000
亚伦 他真是太不可思议了
Alan. He was unbelievable.

182
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,750
他就像兔宝宝一样守每个位置
He was like that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions.

183
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,420
但我们有一垒手亚伦、二垒手亚伦
But instead of Bugs, it was first base, Alan. Second base, Alan

184
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,470
他使我们形成一个团队
I mean, it was like he made us into a team.

185
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
对 我们让对手见识到什么
Yep. We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers

186
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,520
叫做垒球!      很好嘛!
...a thing or two about softball.        Nice.

187
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,440
能问你们一个问题吗?
Can I ask you guys a question?

188
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,110
你是否曾感觉亚伦有时
Do you ever think that Alan is maybe sometimes

189
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,280
有时怎样?      我说不上来 太亚伦了
What?        I don't know. A little too Alan?

190
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,910
不 不可能 你不可能太过于"亚伦"
Oh, no. That's not possible. You can never be too Alan.

191
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,830
没错我们欣赏的是亚伦的内在
Yeah, it's his innate Alanness that we adore.

192
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,370
我一个人可以喝下一加仑的亚伦 噢!
I, personally, could have a gallon of Alan. Oh!

193
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,210
嘿,莉兹      嘿,古怪女孩
Hey, Lizzy.        Hey, Weird Girl.

194
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,130
我带字母汤来给你       你挑出有元音的了吗?
I brought you alphabet soup.        Did you pick out the vowels?

195
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,340
但我把"Y"留下来了 因为Y是半元音
Yes, but I left in the Y's. Because, you know, "Sometimes Y."

196
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,760
我还带了其他东西给你
Um, I also have something else for you.

197
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,060
咸饼干吗?
Saltines?

198
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,640
不是 你喜欢一千元和足球电话吗?
No, but would you like $1000 and a football phone?

199
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,600
啥?
What?

200
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,310
偶 天哪
Oh, my God.

201
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,190
偶 天哪 这里真的有钱      是的
Oh, my God. There's really money in here.        I know.

202
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,110
古怪女孩, 你在干什么?
Weird Girl, what are you doing?

203
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,240
我要给你 我不想要
Oh, I want you to have it. I don't want it.

204
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,410
 不 我得拿东西给你
No, no. I have to give you something.

205
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,240
不用 不用
No, it's fine. You don't

206
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,370
你要我的锡箔纸帽吗?
Do you want my tinfoil hat?

207
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,460
要 因为你需要 算了 谢谢
No, because you need that. No, it's okay. Thanks.

208
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,790
求你,让我表示我的谢意
Please. Let me do something.

209
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,840
这样吧.
Okay, all right. I'll tell you what.

210
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,550
你请我喝汽水就扯平了
You buy me a soda and then we're even. Okay?

211
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,800
好吧      好吧
Okay.        Okay.

212
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,280
不用找了
Keep the change.

213
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,070
谢谢你 莉兹
Thanks, Lizzy.

214
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,450
你真的不要椒盐卷饼?
Sure you don't want a pretzel?

215
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,660
不,不用了      再见
No, I'm fine. Thanks.        See you.

216
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,920
	一个拇指?
A thumb?

217
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,670
恶
Ew.

218
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,220
	我知道.我打开时它就浮在里面
I know, I know. I opened it up and there it was

219
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,840
像个搭便车的
just floating in there, like this tiny little hitchhiker.

220
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,390
或者这是一场竞赛,比如集满五个有奖?
Maybe it's a contest, you know? Like "Collect all five. "

221
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,140
你们想看看吗?
Does, um, anyone wanna see?

222
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,770
不用了 谢谢
No, thanks.

223
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,230
别那样 拜托 掐掉它
Oh, hey, don't do that. Come on. Cut that out.

224
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,940
这比姆指还糟糕
It's worse than the thumb.

225
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,530
这不公平
Hey, this is so unfair.

226
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,030
为何不公平?       我有缺点不行吗?多大点事啊?
Why is it unfair?        So I have a flaw. Big deal.

227
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,950
乔伊常扳指关节就不惹人厌?
Like Joey's constant knucklecracking isn't annoying?

228
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,330
罗斯把每个音发得太清楚
And Ross, with his overpronouncing every single word.

229
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,670
莫妮卡大笑时的鼻音
And Monica, with that snort when she laughs.

230
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,210
 搞什么嘛
I mean, what the hell is that thing?

231
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,613
我接受大家所有的缺点
I accept all those flaws.

232
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:49,470
为何大家就不肯接受我的呢?
Why can't you accept me for this?

233
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,890
扳指关节会惹人厌吗?还是只是他比较烦
Does the knucklecracking bother everybody, or just him?

234
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,350
呃...
Well

235
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,520
没有它我也能活的下去
I could live without it.

236
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,730
嗯
Huh.

237
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,237
觉得有点烦吗? 
Well, is it, like, a little annoying?

238
00:15:10,237 --> 00:15:13,110
感觉就和看到菲比咬她的头发时一样?
Or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?

239
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,080
菲比 别介意 我觉得那样很可爱
Now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, all right? I think it's endearing.

240
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,540
真的?是吗?
Oh, you do, do you?

241
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,840
咬字清晰又不犯法!
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.

242
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,840
的!确!没!错!
Indeed there isn't.

243
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,760
我该回去工作了
I should really get back to work.

244
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,060
那么有人就会拿错他们点的东西了
Yeah, otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.

245
00:15:43,737 --> 00:15:46,690
头发冒了出来 手套滑落下来 (全都发泄出来了)
The hair comes out and the gloves come off.

246
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,830
你曾和一个你朋友都喜欢的男人约会吗?
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?

247
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,460
没有
No.

248
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,880
我在和一个我朋友都喜欢的男人约会
Okay. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.

249
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,720
我们在谈郊狼吗?
We talking about the coyotes here?

250
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:20,390
一头牛居然逃脱了
Heh. All right. A cow got through.

251
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,770
你能相信吗?
Can you believe it?

252
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,560
就像是 你知道吗
It's just, you know what?

253
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,730
我毫无感觉
I just don't feel the thing.

254
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,530
而他们却有感觉.我毫无感觉
I mean, they feel the thing. I don't feel the thing.

255
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,360
亲爱的 你应该要...
Honey, you should always

256
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,530
有感觉的
feel the thing.

257
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,910
如果对他没感觉,就把他甩了
Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him.

258
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,040
我知道 但很难
I know, it's just gonna be really hard.

259
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,120
没错 但他是大人了,他会熬过去的
Yeah, he's a big boy. He'll get over it.

260
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:50,000
不 他没事.我担心的是其他五人
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.

261
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,340
难道你不尊重你的身体吗?
Do you have any respect for your body?

262
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,630
 你难道不明白自己在做什么吗?
Don't you realize what you're doing to yourself?

263
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,090
还有你们的癌症...
Hey, you know, I've had it with you and your cancer

264
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,100
肺气肿和心脏病...
and your emphysema and your heart disease.

265
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,930
至少抽烟很酷,这点你们也很清楚
The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.

266
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,810
咳 钱德
Ahem. Chandler?

267
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,770
亚伦找你
It's Alan. He wants to speak to you.

268
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,820
真的,他找我?
Really? He does?

269
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,400
老兄 什么事?
Hey, buddy. What's up?

270
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,360
她告诉你了?
Oh, she told you about that, huh?

271
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,160
对 我偶尔会犯烟瘾  对 现在
Well, yeah. I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now.

272
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,870
呃 也没那么糟
Well, it's not that bad

273
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,670
这倒是真的
Well, that's true.

274
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,170
天啊 没人这么说过
Gee, you know, no one's ever put it like that before.

275
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,720
好的 谢谢
Well, okay. Thanks.

276
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,150
天啊 他真棒
God, he's good.

277
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,400
如果他是个女人,那该有多好
If only he were a woman.

278
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,400
恩恩!
Yeah.

279
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,120
小羊排!
Oh, Lamb Chop.

280
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,950
那袜子到底有多旧了?
How old is that sock?

281
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,920
如果我手上戴着袜子三十年 它也会开始说话
If I had a sock on my hand for 30 years, it'd be talking too.

282
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,050
有人该换尼古丁贴片了
Okay, I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.

283
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,840
嗨
Hey.

284
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,800
乔伊在哪儿?
Where's Joey?

285
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,140
乔伊吃了我的最后一片口香糖 所以我就把他杀了
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him.

286
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,680
你认为这样不对吗?
Do you think that was wrong?

287
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,150
我想他在对面      谢谢
I think he's across the hall.        Thanks.

288
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,190
好啦
There you go.

289
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,240
我又重拾快乐的生活
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.

290
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,070
菲比 你还想吃那个小松饼吗?
Hey, Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop Tart?

291
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,910
谁想吃剩下的?
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop Tart?

292
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,910
我要
Hey, I might.

293
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,330
抱歉
I'm sorry.

294
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,300
知道吗?汽水公司那些笨蛋
You know, those stupid soda people

295
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,380
给我七千元当姆指的补偿金
gave me $7000 for the thumb.

296
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,630
天啊 七千元别闹了
Oh, my God. Seven thousand dollars?

297
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,220
 我回家路上又踩到口香糖
And on my way over here, I stepped in gum.

298
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,850
这世界到底怎么了?
What is up with the universe?

299
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,140
怎么啦?
What's going on?

300
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,180
是觉得大伙儿在一起很温馨
Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.

301
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,520
如果大家都有穿内裤会更好
It's even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.

302
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,150
呃 乔伊...   哦！      
Uh, Joey        Oh.

303
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,950
好吧       啊 别关电视
Okay.        Oh,come on.

304
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,120
各位 我有话要说
Please, guys, we have to talk.

305
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,120
等等 我有似曾相识的感觉
Wait, wait. I'm getting adeja of u.

306
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,620
不,好像没有
No, I'm not.

307
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,620
好吧,我们需要谈谈      瞧,来了
All right, we have to talk.        There it is.

308
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,880
是有关亚伦的事
Okay, it's about Alan.

309
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,840
有些事你应该了解
There's something you should know.

310
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,390
真的很难启齿 呃...
Oh, man, there's really no easy way to say this. Uh...

311
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,810
我决定和亚伦分手
I've decided to break up with Alan.

312
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,360
有第三者?
Is there somebody else?

313
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,740
没有 只是...
No, no, no. It's just...

314
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,950
只是世事难料 人都会变
you know, things change. People change.

315
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,200
我们没变
We didn't change.

316
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,700
就这样?结束了?
So that's it? It's over?

317
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,710
	就这样结束了
Just like that?

318
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,540
放下防御
You know, you let your guard down.

319
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,840
真心对待一个人
You know, you start to really care about someone, and I just...

320
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,930
我可以继续伪装      可以啊
Look, I could go on pretending.         Okay.

321
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,390
这样对我不公平
No. No, that wouldn't be fair to me...

322
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,390
...对亚伦也是 对你们大家也是
...it wouldn't be fair to Alan, it wouldn't fair to you.

323
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,680
是吗?谁要公平?
Yeah, well, who wants fair?

324
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,770
我只想要回失去的 回到往日
I mean, I just want things back, you know, the way they were.

325
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,900
我很抱歉      她说抱歉 我舒坦多了
I'm sorry.        Oh, she's sorry. I feel better.

326
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,070
	我真是不敢相信
I just can't believe this.

327
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,950
假期就要来临了 我要带他去见我的家人
I mean, with the holidays coming up. I wanted him to meet my family.

328
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,170
我会找到新欢的 另一个亚伦
I'll meet someone else. There'll be other Alans.

329
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,540
是呀,另一个
Yeah, right.

330
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,970
你们不会有事吧?      嘿  嘿 我们会好的
Are you guys gonna be okay?        Hey, hey. We'll be fine.

331
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,800
我们只是需要一点时间
We're just gonna need a little time.

332
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,310
我了解
I understand.

333
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,850
哇
Wow.

334
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,980
我真的很抱歉      我也很抱歉
I'm really sorry.        Yeah. I mean,I'm sorry too.

335
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,780
但是我有点松了一口气
But I gotta tell you, I'm a little relieved.

336
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,860
松了一口气?      是的 呃
Relieved?         Yeah, well

337
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,410
...对 我是说我和你在一起很开心
I mean, I had a great time with you.

338
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,830
	只是我受不了你朋友
I just can't stand your friends.

339
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,380
记得我们到中央公园划船吗?
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?

340
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,170
那很有趣
That was fun.

341
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,260
嗯 他划得就像维京人一样
Yeah. He could row like a Viking.

342
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,100
嗨      嗨
Hi.        Hi.

343
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,940

So how'd it go?

344
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,940
你知道的 他有提到我们吗?
You know. Did he mention us?

345
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,950
他说他会想念你们的
He says he's really gonna miss you guys.

346
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,830
 悲惨的一天?
You had a rough day, huh?

347
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,840
你无法体会      过来宝贝
Oh, you have no idea.        Come here.

348
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,760
我受够了 我要抽烟      不行
That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.        No, no, no.

349
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,220
我管不了那么多了
I don't care. I don't care.

350
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,560
我投降,我是懦夫,	我要抽烟
Game's over. I'm weak. I've gotta smoke. I've gotta have the smoke.

351
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,350
如果你不再抽烟我就给你七千块
If you never smoke again, I'll give you $7000.

352
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,020
