00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,923
瑞秋 我们这边履历表快用完了
Rach, we're running low on resumes over here.

2
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,433
你真的想去《大众机械师》杂志社做事吗
Do you really want a job with <Popular Mechanics>?

3
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,892
要是想为机械师做点事 那儿倒是不错的选择
Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.

4
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,474
说真的 我什么都要试试
Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, okay?

5
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,689
我不想再当服务生了 真的
I can not be a waitress anymore. I mean it.

6
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,475
我已经厌倦了那点微薄的小费 
I'm sick of the lousy tips. 

7
00:00:31,476 --> 00:00:33,572
厌倦了总是被叫"劳驾"
I'm sick of being called "Excuse Me".

8
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,568
瑞秋 你写完后 有检查过吗
Rach, did you proofread these?

9
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,746
有啊 怎么了
Uh, yeah. Why?

10
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,363
没什么 你优秀的电"恼"能力 
Uh, nothing. I'm sure they'll be impressed

11
00:00:42,363 --> 00:00:45,414
我相信大家都会印象深刻
 with your excellent "compuper" skills.

12
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,999
我的天
Oh, my God!

13
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,710
每一份上面都是这样吗
Oh, do you think it's on all of them?

14
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:57,838
不会啦 我相信影印机一定帮你抓住一些了
Oh, no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few.

25
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:07,833
亲爱的葛林小姐 谢谢您的申请 不过…
"Dear Miss Green: Thank you for your inquiry, however..."

26
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,080
我们有苹果肉桂

亲爱的葛林小姐
Okay, "Dear Miss Green"

28
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,419
好 好 好 不行
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No.

29
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,256
哇喔        什么啊      
Wow!        What?         

30
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:21,001
你的卡债还真多
Your Visa bill is huge.

31
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:22,064
拿来
Give me that.

32
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,675
我真不敢相信 
You know, I can't believe you. 

33
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,970
琳达那么好 你为什么不再约她出去了
Linda is so great. Why won't you go out with her again?

34
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:26,643
我也说不清
I don't know.

35
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,553
难道还是因为
Is this still about her whole

36
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,223
她认为"摩登原始人"真可能发生
"The Flintstones could have really happened" thing?

37
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,687
不只是那样
It's not just that.

38
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,695
我只是想要一个能让我有感觉
It's just, I want someone who does something for me...

39
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,776
让我心跳加速
you know, who gets my heart pounding,

40
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,859
让我
who makes me, uh...

41
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,730
成为拜倒在石榴裙下的玩物
Little play things with yarn?

42
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:48,999
什么啊
What?

43
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,702
还有谁比她更让你心动
Could you want her more?

44
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,328
谁
Who?

45
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:57,045
蒂 肥皂剧《发生何事》里的那个尖酸刻薄的女生
Dee, the sarcastic sister from <What's Happening>!

46
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,183
我对她已经完全没有感觉了 行吗
Look, I am totally totally over her, okay?

47
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,935
我只是 嗨      嗨 还要咖啡吗
I just... Hi!        Hi! Coffee?

48
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,472
不了 这样就好      好
No, we're fine.         Okay.

49
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:16,841
哈哈哈
Hah hah hah!

50
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,898
闭嘴
Shut up!

51
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,938
我们什么都没说哦
We're not saying anything.

52
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:20,666
什么啊      
What?         

53
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:22,699
乔伊昨晚哭了
Uh, Joey cried last night.

54
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,652
谢谢
Thank you.

55
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,408
我们不是在玩牌吗
We were playing poker, right?

56
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:31,370
3上面沾了点巧克力 看起来像是个8
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, all right?

57
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:35,545
可惜你们没看到他说 "开牌 你们准备哭吧"
Oh, God, you should've seen him. "Read them and weep".

58
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,627
结果哭的是他
And then he did.

59
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,548
为什么你们从没和我们玩过牌
Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us

60
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,839
对啊 为什么 就好像这是男生的专利
Yeah, what is that? Like some kind of guy thing?

61
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,881
是有性别歧视的男生的专利
Like some kind of sexist guy thing?

62
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,388
这是扑克牌 所以只有男生能玩
Like, it's poker, so only guys can play?

63
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,227
不啊 我们也很欢迎女生玩
No. Women are welcome to play.

64
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,729
那么到底是为什么
Oh, okay, so then what is it?

65
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,187
就好像... 就好像...
Some kind of, you know, like, some kind of, you know, like...

66
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,192
算了 到底是怎样
All right, what is it?

67
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,026
只是刚好我们玩牌时没有女生加入而已
There just don't happen to be any women in our game.

68
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,068
对啊 我们只是不认识会玩扑克牌的女生
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.

69
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,239
拜托 这个借口真烂 典型的男生答案
Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse. I mean, it's a typical guy response.

70
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,373
对不起 你们当中有人会玩吗
Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?

71
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,034
不会
No.

72
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,753
但是你们可以教我们
But you could teach us.

73
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,413
不要
No.

74
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:27,548
好 现在我们抽牌
Okay, so now we draw cards.

75
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,011
我不需要再抽了吧  我有个顺子
So I wouldn't need any, right? Because I have a straight.

76
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,476
太好了      恭喜你
Oh, good for you!        Congratulations!

77
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,443
好吧 菲比 你要几张
Okay, Pheebs, how many do you want?

78
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,617
我要两张 
Okay, I just need two. 

79
00:04:42,618 --> 00:04:45,691
黑桃10跟梅花6
The ten of spades and the six of clubs.

80
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,069
不行 菲比 不可以这样
No, uh, Pheebs, you can't do that.

81
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,112
噢 我有黑桃10 你要不要
Ooh! I have the ten of spades. Here, you want it?

82
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,656
谢谢
Thanks.

83
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,372
不行 不可以这样子
Uh, no, see, uh, you can't do that.

84
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,123
没关系 我不需要那些
No, no, no. That's okay. That's okay. I don't need them. 

85
00:04:58,124 --> 00:04:58,912
我需要的是4
I'm going for fours.

86
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,455
啊 你在
Oh, you're...

87
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,254
好 吃的来啦
All right, here we go.

88
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,674
这是鲑鱼拼盘和什锦水果
We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.

89
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,638
摩妮卡 你在干什么 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Monica, what are you doing?

90
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,207
我们在玩扑克牌 
This is a poker game. 

91
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,647
所有食物的名字不能超过一个词
You can't serve food with more than one syllable.

92
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:20,275
像薯片 蘸汁 脆饼
It's got to be like chips or dip or pretz.

93
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,320
好 现在庄家
Okay, so at this point, the dealer...

94
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,753
好了 我们会了 我们会了 
You know what? We got it. We got it. 

95
00:05:25,754 --> 00:05:28,683
开始玩真的吧 高风险 玩真钱
Let's play for real, right? High stakes. Big bucks.

96
00:05:28,684 --> 00:05:30,913
你确定吗 菲比刚丢出两张杰克
All right, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks...

97
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,575
因为它们看起来很不快乐
because they didn't look happy.

98
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,958
但是我准备好了 发牌吧
But I'm ready. So just deal.

99
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,065
好 最后一课 最后一课 
Okay, all right, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. 

100
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:44,753

Joey. Three

101
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,418

Eight

102
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,587
8  3 好了 可以开始了
Eight, three. All right. Here we go.

103
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,769
该死 该死 该死
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

104
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,555
我知道了 原来你是在说谎
I see. So then, urn, you were lying.

105
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,077
说什么谎了    
About what?         

106
00:06:00,078 --> 00:06:01,019
说你的牌有多好
About how good your cards were.

107
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:02,938
那叫做唬人
I was bluffing.

108
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,188
啊哈 那唬人是什么
Aha. And what is "bluffing"?

109
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:11,159
不就是说谎吗
Is it not another word for lying?

110
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,570
好了 不能再玩了
Okay, sorry to break up this party...

111
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,034
我得在明天上班前把履历表发出去
but I've go resumes to fax before work tomorrow.

112
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,499
瑞秋 瑞秋 我们得定局
Rach, Rach, we've got to settle.

113
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,410
定什么局 
Settle what?

114
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,580
维吉尼亚州詹姆士镇的殖民地
The Jamestown colony of Virginia.

115
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,551
乔治国王给我们那块地 所以...
You see, King George is giving us the land, so...

116
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,500
瑞秋 是赌局 
The game, Rachel, the game. 

117
00:06:33,502 --> 00:06:34,544
赌局里你欠我们钱
You owe us money for the game.

118
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,724
对哦
Oh, right.

119
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,096
这样吧 这是她们第一次玩牌 
You know what, guys? It's their first time. 

120
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,522
我们就算了好不好
Why don't we just forget about the money?

121
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,140
才不要 我们会付的
Hell, no, we'll pay.

122
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,561
摩妮卡 我本来已经准备好了另一个答案
Okay, Monica, I had another answer all ready.

123
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,192
这样好了
And you know what?

124
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,362
我们再来一场      
We want a rematch.         

125
00:06:50,363 --> 00:06:51,028
我没问题
Well, that's fine with me.

126
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,238
我可以用赢的这些钱
Could use the money.

127
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:58,948
这么说基本上 你们通过赢朋友的钱来过瘾的
So, basically, you get your yayas by taking money from all of your friends.

128
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,790
没错      对 我靠上宜家过瘾
Yeah.        Yes, and I get my yayas from Ikea.

129
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:08,501
你得自己组装那些家具 但是会便宜一点
You have to put them together yourself but they cost a little less.

130
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,591
瑞秋 我玩扑克牌的目的 就是想赢 好吗 
Look Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, all right?

131
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,098
我要赢 别人就得输
In order for me to win, other people have to lose.

132
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,060
你要跟我玩扑克牌 
So if you're gonna play poker with me, 

133
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,852
就别指望我手下留情
don't expect me to be a nice guy.

134
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:22,014
因为只要一发牌
Okay, because once those cards are dealt..

135
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,615
怎样 
Yeah?

136
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,072
我就六亲不认
I'm not a nice guy.

137
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,496
好了 有东西吃了
All right, boys. Let's eat.

138
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:50,293
你是在"我爱瑞秋"披萨店买的吗 
Ah, did you get that from the "I Love Rachel" pizzeria?

139
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,303
你还在想那个       
You still on that?         

140
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:54,842
拜托 那个学黑社会讲话是怎么回事 
Come on. What was with that whole Black Bad speech?

141
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,429
一玩扑克牌 我就六亲不认
"When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy"

142
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,594
老兄 你大错特错了
You're way off, pal.

143
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:04,435
我可不这么认为 罗斯 因为我认为你爱她
No I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.

144
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,311
没有
Uh, no.

145
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,890
我或许曾经对她有过好感 
See, I might have had feelings for her at one time. 

146
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:09,819
但那都过去了
Not anymore.

147
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,536
我只是 
I just... 

148
00:08:11,537 --> 00:08:14,892
马塞尔 你拿那张光碟干什么  
Marcel, where are you going with that disk? 

149
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:16,234
不可以再放了
You are not putting that on again.

150
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,982
马塞尔 敢按下那个键 
Marcel, okay. If you press that button, 

151
00:08:18,984 --> 00:08:21,533
你就完蛋了
you are in very very big trouble.

152
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,424
你能相信罗斯居然那么浑蛋吗
You believe what a jerk Ross was being?

153
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,013
我知道 他还真是很好胜
Yeah I know. He can get really competitive.

154
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:42,204
啊 哈哈
Ah hah hah!

155
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,806
干嘛啊 
What?

156
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:49,693
摩妮卡 你是五十步笑百步吧
"Hello,Kettle, this is Monica. You're black."

157
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,652
拜托
Please!

158
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,653
我没有像罗斯那么糟
I am not as bad as Ross.

159
00:08:56,828 --> 00:09:00,286
抱歉 我看不出差别 记得画图猜谜事件吗 
Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?

160
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,489
那不是什么事件
That was not an incident.

161
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:07,252
我正在比划 盘子就从我手里溜出去了
I was gesturing and the plate slipped out of my hand.

162
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,934
我有面试了      真的吗 
Oh! I got an interview.        You're kidding. 

163
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:14,736
我有面试了      哪里
I got an interview.        Where?

164
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:19,389
萨克斯百货公司 第五大街      哇 瑞秋
Saks Fifth Avenue.        Oh Rachel!

165
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:23,055
这就好像母舰在召你归队
Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.

166
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,104
是什么样的职位      采购助理
Well, what's the job?        Assistant buyer.

167
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,816
我可以靠血拼
Oh! I would be shopping...

168
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,905
来谋生了
for a living.

169
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,318
好 爱瑞丝阿姨来了
Okay, look, that's Aunt Iris.

170
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,829
她5岁就开始玩扑克牌了
This woman has been playing poker since she was five.

171
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,331
她说的每一个字都要注意听
You've gotta listen to every word she says.

172
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,709
你好      喜剧泰斗东尼蓝道死了吗 
Hi!        Is Tony Randall dead?

173
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,289
怎么会      我没听说
Oh, why?        I don't think so.

174
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,342
他现在可能已经死了 
Well, he may be now. 

175
00:09:50,343 --> 00:09:52,601
因为我好像开车撞到他了
because I think I hit him with my car.

176
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,196
我的天 真的吗      
My God! Really?        

177
00:09:53,198 --> 00:09:55,754
假的 第一课 这就是唬人
No, that's bluffing. Lesson number one.

178
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,629
告诉你们吧
Let me tell you something.

179
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:03,392
在牌桌上听到的 通通不可以当真
Everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap.

180
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,928
好漂亮的耳环      谢…
Nice earrings.        Thank you.

181
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,564
各位小姐 坐下
Girls, sit down.

182
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,568
爱瑞丝阿姨 这是菲比 瑞秋      好了 好了 好了
Urn, Aunt Iris, this is Phoebe, and Rachel...        Yeah, yeah, yeah.

183
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,775
我们赶紧开始吧 这里停车要计时收费
Listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it.

184
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,580
罗斯 拜托 我们能不能听点别的 
Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?

185
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,210
好吧
All right.

186
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,771
今晚我完蛋了
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.

187
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:55,935
嗨      你好
Hi.         Hey.

188
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,650
你们猜 你们猜 你们猜
Guys, guess what, guess what, guess what.

189
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,574
嗯 第五个牙医也屈服了 
Uh, okay. The fifth dentist caved.

190
00:11:00,575 --> 00:11:02,739
现在他们都开始推荐薄荷口香糖了
And now they're all recommending Trident?

191
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,117
不是 是我的面试
No, the interview.

192
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,207
她好喜欢我 超级喜欢我
She loved me. She absolutely loved me.

193
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,333
我们谈了两个半小时 
We talked for, like, two and a half hours. 

194
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:17,090
我们的衣着品味相同
We have the same taste in clothes.

195
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,341
我跟她表妹还去过同一个夏令营
Oh, I went to camp with her cousin.

196
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,927
这工作太完美了 
And, oh, the job is perfect. 

197
00:11:20,928 --> 00:11:23,050
我可以做得很好  一定可以
I can do this. I can do this well.

198
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,589
太好了
That's great.

199
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,553
而且她的故事超好笑的
God! And she told the funniest story.

200
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,684
好极了 你说出来 我们一定会笑的
Okay, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh.

201
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,766
开始玩牌吧
Let's play poker.

202
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,228
好 我们谈过了
All right, listen you guys, we talked about it.

203
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,939
如果你们不想玩 我们完全理解
And if you don't want to play, we completely understand.

204
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,196
对 我们可以玩别的 像是
Yes, yes. We can play some other game. Like, I don't know...

205
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,981
画图猜谜 
Pictionary?

206
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,950
很好笑 很好笑
Very funny. Very funny.

207
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,783
我们再给扑克牌一次机会吧 好吗 两位小姐 
But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?

208
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,868
好啊      好啊 没问题
Yes!        I think we should.

209
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,581
瑞秋 要我洗牌吗       
Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?

210
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,789
不用了 没关系 
No. no, that's okay. 

211
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,211
我想自己试试
You know what? I'm gonna give it a go.

212
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,462
好吧      好吧
All right.        All right.

213
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,559
菲比欠7块5 摩妮卡 你欠10块
So Pheebs owes $7.50. Monica, you owe $10.

214
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,721
瑞秋 你欠15块
And, Rachel, you owe 15 big ones.

215
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,773
谢谢你们教我们斜眼玛丽 
Thanks for teaching us "Crossed eyed Mary."

216
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,185
我们自己玩的时候也可以用
You guys, we gotta play that other way.

217
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,652
7块5拿去 你们要知道 这钱被诅咒了
All right, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.

218
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,283
什么      哦 诅咒是我下的
What?        Oh, I cursed it.

219
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,704
谁花掉这些钱 谁就会倒霉的
So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.

220
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,576
没关系 给我吧 反正我一直都很倒霉
Thats all right, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway.

221
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,209
这样我就可以用电影解除咒语
This way, I can break them up with a movie.

222
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:43,753
现在只剩下葛林扑克牌机了 她欠我们15块
So that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes $15.

223
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,133
简直就是典型的…
Hmm, oh, it's so typical:

224
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,764
我是个男人 我是带把的
"Ooh, I'm a man. Ooh, I have a penis.

225
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:52,803
我就是要通过赢钱来显示出驾驭女性的能力
Ooh, I have to win money to exert my power over women."

226
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,849
你们知道吗 我们还没玩完
You know what? This is not over.

227
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,735
我们会再来找你们 
We will play you again. 

228
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:01,277
我们将会赢 你们将会输
And we will win and you will lose.

229
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,187
你们将会求饶 我们则会讥笑你们
And you will beg and we will laugh.

230
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,197
我们会赢走你们身上的每一分钱
And we will take every last dime you have.

231
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:08,235
你们会永远恨死自己
And you will hate yourselves forever!

232
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:13,323
我们想法一致 摩妮卡
Hmm, kind of stepped on my point there, Mon.

233
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,501
你们要现在就付钱吗 
So you gals wanna hand over your money now?

234
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,839
这样我们就可以直接跳过玩牌的仪式
That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.

235
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:29,965
不 我们倒要看看 到底谁能笑到最后 猴子男
No, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.

236
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,058
聊完了没有  可以开始认真打牌了吗
Okay, are we done with the chit chat? Are we ready to play serious poker?

237
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,941
你们看 单眼杰克的眼睛一直跟着我
Hey, you guys, look, the one eyed jack follows me wherever I go.

238
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,482
好吧 认真打牌
Right, okay. Serious poker！

239
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,906
不好意思 你要去哪里 
Excuse me, where are you going?

240
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,236
上厕所
Uh, to the bathroom.

241
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,948
你是来上厕所 还是来玩扑克牌的 
Do you wanna go to the bathroom or do you wanna play poker?

242
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,783
我想上厕所
I wanna go to the bathroom.

243
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,936
我打电话叫披萨外卖      
All right, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.         

244
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:59,452
不行 不行 不行 我在等那工作的面试结果
Oh, no, no, no. I'm still waiting to hear from that job.

245
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,121
百货公司9点关门 你那时候再吃吧
And the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.

246
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:06,960
那好吧 我先吃点薄荷糖垫垫肚子
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic Tac to hold me over.

247
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,299
好 辛辛那提扑克规则 不下盲注 大家先下注
All right. Cincinnati. No blinds. Everybody ante.

248
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,308
很好
Yes!

249
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,515
或是不好
Or no.

250
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,724
好了 你的钱就是我的 葛林
Alright! Your money's mine, Green.

251
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,609
你的拉链开着 盖勒
Your fly's open, Geller.

252
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,280
你们知道我刚想到什么吗 
You guys, you know what I just realized?

253
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,455
杰克跟扑克只差一个字
"Joker" is "poker" with a "J".

254
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,416
很巧吧 
Coincidence?

255
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,581
所以我们也可以叫它"杰"克牌
Hey, that's "joincidence" with a "C".

256
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,603
菲比 菲比      我不跟了
Uh, Phoebe, Phoebe?         Yeah,  I'm out.

257
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,642
我跟
I'm in.

258
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,023
我也跟
Me too.

259
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,979
我也跟 好 你是什么牌 
Me too. All right. What do you got?

260
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:09,398
你最好离莲蓬头远一点 因为我的牌是同花
Well, you better hop out of the shower, because I got a flush.

261
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,068
呵 呵 呵
Well, well, well.

262
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:18,911
小子 别想逃 我有4张6
Hop back in, bucko, because I got four sixes.

263

Oh, my God! You know what? I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile.

265
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:33,005
这是罗斯的 这也是罗斯的
I think that one was Ross'. And I think, oh, that one was Ross'.

266
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:38,309
你的钱是我的了 你再也看不到它了
Well, I have got your money. And you'll never see it.

267
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,720
你裤子的拉链还是开着

摩妮卡  摩妮卡 你跟不跟

272

我讨厌扑克牌
I hate this game.

273
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,037
好 乔伊 换你下注了
Okay, Joey, your bet.

274
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,455
我不来了 就像一个廉价妓女
I fold, like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach

275
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,499
被一个脸上流脓的胖子揍到肚子一样
by a fat guy with sores on his face.

276
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,466

不了 这次不会
No, not this time.

283
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,488
你是什么牌       不告诉你
So, what did you have?         I'm not telling.

284
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,822

我有过这样的约会经验

你整个脸都涨红了
Your whole face is getting red.

289

太阳穴的青筋也爆出来了
Little veins popping out of your temple.

290
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:57,259
而且上衣跟裤子也不搭
Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.

291
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,347

308
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,747
瑞秋 我们不用再玩下去了

315
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,187
我以为我们5角钱是上限
I thought, uh, it was a 50 cent limit.

316
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,444
我刚刚失去一份工作 我想加注5块钱
Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet 5 bucks.

What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on, what is this?

322
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:02,630
我还以为"一发牌 我就六亲不认"呢
I thought that, "Once the cards are dealt, I'm not a nice guy."

323
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,914
