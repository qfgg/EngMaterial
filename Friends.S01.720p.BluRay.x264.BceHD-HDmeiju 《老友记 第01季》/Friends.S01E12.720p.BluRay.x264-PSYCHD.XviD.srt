00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:51,847
斯娃婶婶 别喊了!
Aunt Silv,stop yelling!

7
00:01:52,057 --> 00:01:53,987
如果你告诉过我你要素面条
If you'd told me vegetarian lasagna...

8
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:56,657
我就会给你做素的了
... I would've made vegetarian lasagna.

9
00:01:59,363 --> 00:02:03,063
好吧 肉都在第三层 也许你能把它们刮下来
The meat's only every third layer. Maybe you could scrape.

10
00:02:04,003 --> 00:02:06,300
罗斯 你真的把所有婴儿书都读了?
Ross,did you really read all these baby books?

You could plunk me down in any woman's uterus,

12
00:02:09,613 --> 00:02:11,303
用不着指南针
no compass...

13
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,733
我都能从里面爬出来 就像~~!
...and I could find my way out like that!

14
00:02:15,713 --> 00:02:16,803
噢 太棒了…
This is cool.

15
00:02:17,043 --> 00:02:21,383
书上说在有些地方 人们真的吃胎盘
It says in some parts of the world people eat the placenta.

16
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,383
呃..这酸奶算是吃不下去了
And we're done with the yogurt.

17
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:27,738
对不起
Sorry.

18
00:02:27,823 --> 00:02:31,488
我是为了帮你 我可不是承包宴席的
I did this as a favor. I am not a caterer.

19
00:02:31,488 --> 00:02:34,928
那你让我拿这一打面怎么办?
What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas?

20
00:02:35,628 --> 00:02:37,888
说的好听 斯娃婶婶
Nice talk,Aunt Silv.

21
00:02:38,468 --> 00:02:41,128
你用这张嘴亲弗莱蒂叔叔吗?
You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?

22
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:47,028
嗨 罗斯 你知道你的宝贝现在就这么大吗?
Ross,listen. Do you know that right now your baby is only this big?

23
00:02:47,238 --> 00:02:50,113
这是你孩子.你好 爸爸!
This is your baby. " Hi,Daddy. "

24
00:02:50,113 --> 00:02:51,425
你好
Hello.

25
00:02:52,113 --> 00:02:54,487
为什么你不和妈咪一起住?
" How come you don't live with Mommy? "

26
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,420
为什么妈咪和另一个女人一起住?
" How come Mommy lives with that other lady? "

27
00:03:03,987 --> 00:03:05,612
什么是女同性恋?
"What's a lesbian? "

28
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,440
亲爱的 你能说的 波克诺山（宾夕法尼亚州东部）
Honey,you can say it. Poconos.

29
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,170
波克诺 就像 波克诺 (音同戳一下鼻子)
Poconos. It's like " poke a nose. "

30
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,488
啊 戳一下鼻子
Poke a nose.

31
00:03:31,362 --> 00:03:34,613
      那么 我听见波克诺山了吗?       是的
        So did I hear Poconos?         Yes.

32
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:36,862
我妹妹让我们去她那渡周末
My sister's giving us her place for the weekend.

33
00:03:36,987 --> 00:03:39,613
哇 第一次周末结伴出游!
First weekend together.

34
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:41,550
      是啊 进展了一大步       我知道…
        It's a big step.         I know.

35
00:03:42,863 --> 00:03:45,050
啊 就是个周末 没什么!
It's just a weekend. Big deal.

36
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,353
不是说就玩玩的吗？
Wasn't this supposed to be a fling?

37
00:03:47,663 --> 00:03:49,183
这…该
Shouldn't it be...

38
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,293
玩完了吧现在?
...flung by now?

39
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:54,193
我想 我们已远远超出玩的范围了
We are way past a "fling. "

40
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:55,362
我现在的感觉只有
I' m feeling things

41
00:03:55,362 --> 00:03:58,433
在丹尼尔・斯蒂尔的书里才找得到
I've read about in Danielle Steel books.

42
00:03:58,643 --> 00:04:01,738
我是说 当我和他在一起的时候 我完全 完全地…
When l' m with him,l' m just totally....

43
00:04:01,738 --> 00:04:04,113
…恶心 我本能的恶心
Nauseous. I' m physically nauseous.

44
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,237
我该怎么办? 打电话给移民局?
What am I supposed to do? Call lmmigration?

45
00:04:09,612 --> 00:04:11,738
我可以打电话给移民局!
I could call lmmigration.

46
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,640
我喜欢孩子 他们的小鞋
I love babies with their little baby shoes...

47
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,840
小脚指头 小手…
...and their little baby toes and their little hands....

48
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,650
好了 你别再这样了 永远不要!
Okay,you' re gonna have to stop that. Forever.

49
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,200
需要新桌子了

50
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,060
你这么想?
You think?

51
00:04:50,425 --> 00:04:52,362
      嗨 嗨 进来!       你好
        Come on in.         Hello.

52
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:54,615
我把书都拿回来了
I brought the books...

53
00:04:55,115 --> 00:04:58,485
莫妮卡送爱心 送你这些面条
...and Monica sends her love along with this lasagna.

54
00:04:58,685 --> 00:05:02,845
哦 太好了!是素的吗 苏珊不吃肉
Great! Is it vegetarian? Because Susan doesn't eat meat.

55
00:05:04,855 --> 00:05:07,125
我肯定是素的…
I' m pretty sure that it is.

56
00:05:09,315 --> 00:05:11,612
我拿到超声波结果了
I got the results of the amnio.

57
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:13,005
告诉我 告诉我 都还….?

        T otally and completely healthy.         That is great!

59
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:26,238
你们什么时候认识的休・刘易斯（黑人歌手）?
When did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?

60
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:27,425
那是我们的朋友塔尼亚
That's our friend T anya.

61
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,100
当然是你们的朋友塔尼亚
Of course,it's your friend T anya.

62
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,200
      你不想知道性别（性）吗?       性?
        Don't you wanna know about the sex?         The sex?

63
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,010
光想你和苏珊一起的样子我就够呛了
I' m having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together.

64
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,863
你要再把塔尼亚加进来 呃…
But when you throw in T anya....

65
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,690

        Want to know?         No.

68
00:06:07,488 --> 00:06:09,550
我不想 绝对不想
I don't want to. Absolutely not.

69
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,550
我想你知道 你应该到时候低头一看
You shouldn't know until you look down there...

70
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,760
然后说 哦 带那个的!
...and see," Oh,there it is. "

71
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,820
或不带的…
Or isn't.

72
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,060
      你好 罗斯       苏珊
        Hello,Ross.         Susan.

00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,300
你知道了吗?
So did you hear?

75
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,362
是的 我们知道了 一切都很好
Yes,we did. Everything's A        Okay.

76
00:06:27,362 --> 00:06:30,300

77
00:06:31,688 --> 00:06:32,613
真的是…
It really is.

78
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:34,737
我们知道那个…?
Do we know?

79
00:06:34,737 --> 00:06:37,050
是的 当然知道了 它是个…
We certainly do. It's going to be a

80
00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:41,550
这有人不想知道 就站在这呢!
A guy who doesn't wanna know is standing here.

81
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,425
噢 那么 我们猜的对吗?
Well,is it what we thought it would be?

82
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,420
什么?
What?

83
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:57,237
我们以为是男是女?
What did we think it'd be?

84
00:06:57,237 --> 00:07:01,112
我不想知道 不想
I don't wanna know. Don't wanna know.

85
00:07:01,112 --> 00:07:03,550
我想我大概该走了
I should probably just go.

86
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,175
      好的 谢谢你的书.       没问题 好的
        Well,thanks for the books.         No problem. Okay.

苏珊

88
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,112

Who should we call first? Your folks or Deb and Rhona?

89
00:07:25,063 --> 00:07:26,050

没事 我不想知道

91
00:07:32,062 --> 00:07:35,425
那么就因为这是我的桌子 就得让我买新的?
Because it was my table,I have to buy a new one?

92
00:07:35,425 --> 00:07:40,113
规则上讲是的.       什么规则?没有什么规则
That's the rule.         What rule? There's no rule.

93
00:07:40,113 --> 00:07:42,175
如果有 就是你欠我个桌子!
If any thing You owe me a table.

94
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:42,862
你从哪得的这个结论?
How did you get there?

95
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,238
这个桌子一直很结实
I believe there's be the furniture It was fine

96
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:48,550
直到你跟安吉拉在上面玩早餐游戏

97
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:49,863
你知道这事?
You knew about that?

00:07:49,863 --> 00:07:53,675
这么说吧 看到那罐奶油的惨相 根本连想象都省了
The impressions in the butter left little to the imagination.

99
00:07:55,405 --> 00:07:57,375
那我们合钱买怎么样?
How about if we split it?

101
00:08:01,987 --> 00:08:06,050
你认为我们到了做这事的程度?       为什么不?
Do you think we' re ready for that?         Why not?

102
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,425
这可是个很大的承诺 我是说要是有人想搬出去呢?
It's a big commitment. What if one of us wants to move out?

103
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,863
      为什么 你要搬吗?       我不搬呐
        You' re moving out?         l' m not.

104
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,613
      你要是搬的话得告诉我好吗       好的
        You'd tell me if you were,right?         Yes.

105
00:08:14,613 --> 00:08:16,237
好 好 只是我上个室友

108
00:08:22,675 --> 00:08:24,612
结果事情搞得很糟
Things got ugly.

109
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:29,487
好吧 我问你点事 作为室友提普比我好吗?
Let me ask you something. Was Kip a better roommate than me?

110
00:08:30,062 --> 00:08:31,612

Carol called to thank me for the lasagna. She told me.

132
00:09:51,313 --> 00:09:53,073
那么孩子是?
So what's it gonna be?

133
00:09:55,283 --> 00:09:57,987
哦 太好了 现在他都知道了 我自己都不知道
Oh,great! Now he knows.I don't know.

134
00:09:57,987 --> 00:10:00,112
对不起 当了姑姑我太兴奋了!
l' m just excited about being an aunt.

135
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:02,300
还有叔叔…
Or an uncle.

136
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,680
      嗨 菲比       嗨 菲比
        Hey,Phoebe.         Hey,Pheebs.

137
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:10,910
很好!
Fine!

138
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,760
怎么了?       没什么 就是 我有点心烦
What's the matter?         Nothing. I' m just out of sorts.

139
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,590
我们能要点卡布奇诺咖啡吗?
Can we get some cappuccino over here?

140
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,800
噢 对了 是叫我!
Oh,right! That's me!

141
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,430
那个卖桌子的地方7点就关了 走吧
That table place closes at 7. Come on.

142
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,870
好吧
Fine.

143
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,737
怎么了?
What is it?

144
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,675
好吧 你们知道保罗?       我太知道他了 是的…
All right. You know Paolo?         l' m familiar with his work.

145
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:40,800
他调戏我
He made a move on me.

146
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,112
      商店明天还会开!       再来点咖啡
        The store will be open tomorrow.         More coffee,please.

147
00:10:51,238 --> 00:10:52,488
到底怎么回事?
Well,what happened?

148
00:10:52,488 --> 00:10:56,548
他来按摩 本来挺好的直到.
He came in for a massage,and everything was fine until....

149
00:11:00,758 --> 00:11:02,658
      天哪.       你确定?
        Oh,my God.         Are you sure?

150
00:11:04,258 --> 00:11:06,428
噢 是的 我确定
Oh,yeah. I' m sure.

151
00:11:10,138 --> 00:11:14,268
然后突然间 他的手就不算什么问题了
And all of a sudden,his hands weren't the problem anymore.

152
00:11:18,548 --> 00:11:19,528
他那儿…?
Was it...?

153
00:11:19,748 --> 00:11:21,738
童子军都能在那扎营了
Boy Scouts could've camped under there.

154
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:25,007
“唔” 什么?
" Ooh," what?

155
00:11:25,247 --> 00:11:26,925
玛・瑟曼
ma Thurman.

156
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:29,300
      那个女演员!       乌玛.瑟曼
        The actress!         Uma Thurman!

157
00:11:31,175 --> 00:11:32,165
谢了 瑞秋
Thanks,Rach.

158
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:37,545
      那么你打算怎么办?       你必须告诉她!
        What'll you do?         You have to tell her.

159
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:40,425
这是道德上的义务 作为朋友 女人
It's your moral obligation as a friend,as a woman.

160
00:11:40,425 --> 00:11:41,550
我认为这涉及到女权问题!
It's a feminist issue.

161
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,645
伙计们?
Guys?

162
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:47,285
你必须告诉她       女权问题. 这是我的观点!
You have to.         Feminist issue? That's where I went.

163
00:11:48,395 --> 00:11:51,295
      她会恨我的       是的
        She is gonna hate me!         Yeah,well....

164
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:01,685
你挑一个 挑一个!
Will you pick one? Just pick one.

165
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:05,845
      那个怎么样?       那是放在院子里用的!
        Here,how about that one?         That's patio furniture.

166
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,487
那有什么 难道人们进屋后会想
So what? Like people will come in and think,

167
00:12:08,487 --> 00:12:10,835
“哦 我还在外面”
" Oh,l' m outside again. "

168
00:12:11,035 --> 00:12:12,125
当然!
Fine.

169
00:12:12,705 --> 00:12:14,165
那张鸟桌怎么样?
What about the birds?

170
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:17,488
不知道 鸟桌不会对你说
I don't know. They don't say,

171
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:20,375
“你好 坐这 吃点什么.”
" Hello,sit here. Eat something. "

172
00:12:21,237 --> 00:12:24,738
那你选吧       好吧 那瓢虫桌怎么样?
You pick one.         Okay. How about the ladybugs?

173
00:12:24,738 --> 00:12:28,868
忘了鸟和红昆虫吧 建议点有品位的餐桌!
Forget about the birds,but big red insects suggest fine dining.

174
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:31,237
好 你想要鸟 就要鸟吧! 
Fine! Want the birds? Get the birds!

175
00:12:31,237 --> 00:12:33,498
不是这样 我不要!
Not like that,I won't.

176
00:12:36,648 --> 00:12:38,978
提普会喜欢鸟桌的!
Kip would have liked the birds.

177
00:12:49,612 --> 00:12:50,925
      嗨 菲比 
        Hi,Pheebs.

178
00:12:50,925 --> 00:12:52,112
      你要搬出去吗?
        Are you moving out?

179
00:12:52,112 --> 00:12:54,363
不 这不全是我的行李
No These aren't all my suitcases.

180
00:12:54,363 --> 00:12:56,112
这个是保罗的
This one's Paolo's.

181
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:03,637
      瑞秋 我们能谈谈吗?       好的 当然…
        Rachel,can we talk for a sec?         Well,sure.

182
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:06,247
就一会儿 保罗正在来的路上
Just for a sec,Paolo's on his way.

183
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:21,300
我们认识还不长
We haven't known each other that long.

184
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:24,050
我有三件事你应该知道
There are three things you should know:

185
00:13:24,675 --> 00:13:29,135
一.朋友是我生命中最重要的
One,my friends are the most important thing in my life.

186
00:13:29,385 --> 00:13:31,215
二.我从不说谎
Two,I never lie.

187
00:13:32,015 --> 00:13:36,355
三.我做的提子燕麦饼干是最好的
And three,I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.

188
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:41,425
好的 谢谢 菲比
Okay. Thanks,Pheebs.

189
00:13:45,595 --> 00:13:49,300
      哦 上帝啊!       我知道
        Oh,my God!         I know.

190
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,175
为什么我从来没吃过这些?
Why have I never tasted these before ?

191
00:13:51,175 --> 00:13:56,005
我不经常做因为我想 这对别的饼干来说不太公平
I don't make them a lot,because it's not fair to the other cookies.

192
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:05,800
你是对的 这是我吃过的最好吃的提子燕麦饼干
These are the best oatmeal raisin cookies.

193
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,685
      这也证明了我不说谎       我想是的
        Which proves that I never lie.         I guess you don't.

194
00:14:09,235 --> 00:14:11,665
保罗调戏我
Paolo made a pass at me.

195
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:15,935
你们看怎么样?
What do you think?

196
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:19,005
我想这是我见过的最漂亮的桌子
It's the most beautiful table I've seen.

197
00:14:19,205 --> 00:14:20,405
我知道!
I know.

198
00:14:20,615 --> 00:14:23,405
你得把盘子平衡在这些小人头上吗?
Will you balance plates on these heads?

199
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:26,275
管他呢 我们在水槽边吃饭!来吧!
Who cares? We'll eat at the sink. Come on!

200
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,550
闪开你的小人罗斯!
Heads up,Ross.

201
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,175
得分! 你们真逊!
Score! You suck!

202
00:14:35,862 --> 00:14:37,192
你没事吧?
Are you okay?

203
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:41,592
我需要牛奶
I need some mik.

204
00:14:43,402 --> 00:14:45,372
没问题 我有牛奶
Okay. I've got milk.

205
00:14:50,412 --> 00:14:51,772
给你…
Here you go.

206
00:15:00,425 --> 00:15:01,550
好点了吗?
Better?

207
00:15:03,425 --> 00:15:04,362
没有
No.

208
00:15:07,175 --> 00:15:12,445
我真太蠢了!我想起来那天
I feel so stupid! I think about the other day with you guys.

209
00:15:12,715 --> 00:15:16,275
我还是“哦 保罗 他真好 ”
And I was all," Oh,Paolo! He's so great!

210
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,215
他让我觉得真…
He makes me feel so"

211
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,175
天哪!
God!

212
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:22,265
我真觉得尴尬!
I' m so embarrassed!

213
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,035
我才觉得尴尬!
I' m so embarrassed.

214
00:15:24,245 --> 00:15:27,685
      我是他调戏的那个!       如果我没遇见他
        l' m the one he hit on.         I unleashed him on you.

215
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,715
事情就不会发生!
If I had never met him

216
00:15:29,955 --> 00:15:32,005
      真对不起!       不 我对不起你!
        l' m so sorry.         No,l' m sorry.

217
00:15:32,285 --> 00:15:34,545
      是我对不起       应该是我.等等
        l' m sorry.         l' m sorry. Wait.

218
00:15:34,855 --> 00:15:37,345
      我们道什么歉?       不知道…
        What are we sorry about?         I don't know.

219
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,615
对 他才是猪!
Right. He's the pig.

220
00:15:39,825 --> 00:15:42,555
      真是猪!       哦 天哪 他真是头猪
        Such a pig!         Oh,God,he's such a pig!

221
00:15:42,795 --> 00:15:46,235
他就像一个…恶心猪
He's like a big disgusting pig....

222
00:15:46,535 --> 00:15:48,795
      猪人!       是的 不错!
        Pig man!         Yes,good!

223
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,135
但他是我的猪人…
But he was my pig man!

224
00:15:57,345 --> 00:15:59,505
为什么我看不出来?
How did I not see this?

225
00:16:01,113 --> 00:16:02,175
噢! 我知道!
Oh,I know!

226
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:06,632
是因为…
Because...

227
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:08,872
他太帅了
... he's gorgeous.

228
00:16:09,172 --> 00:16:10,692
他太迷人
And he's charming.

229
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:13,672
      当他看你的时候..       好了 菲比
        And when he looks         Okay,Pheebs.

230
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,402
结束
The end.

231
00:16:17,782 --> 00:16:18,772
天啊
God.

232
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,872
我应该瞒着你吗?
Should I not have told you?

233
00:16:23,652 --> 00:16:26,982
相信我 让我知道是对的
T rust me,it's much better that I know.

234
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:34,212
只是我更喜欢以前那样不知道的时候更好过一些
But I just liked it better before. It was better.

235
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:52,237
她只是把事情想的太好了… 
She took it pretty well.

236
00:16:52,237 --> 00:16:54,949
保罗现在就在那边 所以…
Paolo's over there now,so....

237
00:16:55,329 --> 00:16:59,629
我们应该过去 看看她有没有事. 稍等片刻
We should go and see if she's okay. Just one second.

238
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:03,369
      得分!       不错的比赛!
        Score!         Game! Nice!

239
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,869
来吧 菲比
Come on,Pheebs.

240
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:11,479
看起来 我们打得你们屁滚尿流
Well,it looks like we kicked your butts.

241
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,800
不 她打得我们屁滚尿流
She did kicked our butts.

242
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,809
你可以参加奥林匹克的“站一边看”之队
 You could be on the Olympic "Standing There" team.

243
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:17,113
得了吧 二对一
Come on. Two on one.

244
00:17:17,113 --> 00:17:20,175
你还在这干什么? 她刚和那男的分手
Why are you here? She just broke up with him.

245
00:17:20,175 --> 00:17:22,465
该你趁虚而入啦!
It's time for you to swoop in.

246
00:17:23,105 --> 00:17:26,550
      什么 现在?       是的 现在正是时候!
        What,now?         Yes. Now is when you swoop.

247
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,362
你得确保保罗走出屋子后
When Paolo walks out,

248
00:17:28,362 --> 00:17:30,420
你是瑞秋见到的第一个男人
you gotta be the first guy she sees.

249
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,050
得让她知道你是那么好 而他一无是处!
She's gotta know you' re everything he's not.

250
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,925
你就像 像“反保罗”!
You' re the anti-Paolo.

251
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,980
我这天主教朋友说的对
My Catholic friend is right.

252
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,780
她现在很烦恼.你就在那陪伴她
She's distraught. You' re there for her.

253
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:47,790
你帮她承担所有烦恼 然后你就走向了罗斯时代!
You pick up the pieces and then you usher in "The Age of Ross. "

254
00:17:54,362 --> 00:17:56,982
      看这个?看?       停住!
        See this? See?         Hold it! Ascolta!

255
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:02,262
      怎么样了?       别盯着看
        How's it going?         Don't stare.

256
00:18:02,462 --> 00:18:05,050
现在她刚把他的衣服从阳台上扔下去
She threw his clothes off the balcony.

257
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,422
现在是他们比比画画的
Now there's gesturing and arm-waving.

258
00:18:07,642 --> 00:18:11,232
要么是 “你怎么能?”或 “大胸脯!”
That is," How could you? " or " Enormous breasts! "

259
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:14,972
他过来了!
Here he comes.

260
00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:26,682
我
I am...

261
00:18:27,392 --> 00:18:28,882
说再见
...to say goodbye.

262
00:18:29,362 --> 00:18:30,852
好的 再见
Okay,bye        bye.

263
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:38,050
保罗 我非常憎恨你对瑞秋做的事
Paolo,I really hate you for what you did,

264
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,577
但我还有五个面条没处理掉
but I still have five of these...

265
00:18:39,777 --> 00:18:42,707
在烤箱里用375度烤到奶酪冒泡就行了
...so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.

266
00:18:48,175 --> 00:18:53,235
我只想告诉你我要代大家说 当我说…
I just wanna tell you,and I think I'd speak for everyone when I say....

267
00:18:58,488 --> 00:19:01,175
哦 看看她呀…
Oh,just look at her.

268
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:03,695
伙计们 我认为最好我们只去一个
Guys,I think only one of us should go...

269
00:19:03,905 --> 00:19:06,235
      这样她就不会感到太大压力…       对
        ...so she's not overwhelmed.         Right.

270
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,915
而且那个人应该是我
And I really think it should be me.

271
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:27,043
你没事吧?
You all right?

272
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:29,913
我好点了…
I've been better.

273
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:35,453
过来
Come here.

274
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,540
听着
Listen...

275
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,810
他远远配不上你…
...you deserve so much better than him.

276
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,010
我意思是 你
I mean,you...

277
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,460
你应该找一个能 明白拥有你是多么幸福的人
...should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.

278
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,260
什么?
What?

279
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,900
我讨厌死男人了
I' m so sick of guys!

280
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:08,270
我都不想看见男的 我也不想考虑别的男人
I don't want to look at or think about another guy.

281
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,610
我甚至不想靠近任何一个男人
I don't even want to be near another guy.

282
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,250
罗斯 你真太好了!
Ross,you' re so great.

283
00:20:32,863 --> 00:20:35,050
      你怎么样?       你没事吧?
        Are you all right?         Are you okay?

284
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,820
      一般吧.还有饼干吗?       有!
        Medium. Any cookies left?         Yeah.

285
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,260
看 瑞秋
See,Rach...

286
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,860
我不认为发誓再不要男人是个好答案
... I don't think swearing off guys altogether is the answer.

287
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:52,590
我认为你需要建立一个先进的筛选程序
What you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.

288
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,862
我只想先单身一阵
I just need to be by myself for a while.

289
00:20:56,862 --> 00:21:00,352
      我得先弄明白我想要什么样的       不 不
        I just gotta figure out what I want.         No,no.

290
00:21:01,262 --> 00:21:05,738
因为不是所有人都像保罗
See,because not all guys out there are gonna be a Paolo.

291
00:21:05,738 --> 00:21:07,678
不 我知道 我知道
No,I know. I know.

292
00:21:07,878 --> 00:21:12,008
而且我肯定 你的小儿子不会长成他那样
And l' m sure your little boy's not gonna grow up to be one.

293
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:14,675
      什么?       什么?
        What?         What?

294
00:21:16,749 --> 00:21:19,175

305
