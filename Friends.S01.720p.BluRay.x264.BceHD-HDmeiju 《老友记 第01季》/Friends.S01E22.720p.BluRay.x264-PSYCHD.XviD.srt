1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,913
跟他讲 跟他讲      跟他讲啦
Tell him. Please tell him.        Tell him.

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:06,373
闭嘴      跟我讲什么?
Shut up.        Tell me what?

3
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,880
你连看他都不敢      跟我说啦 拜托
You won't even look at him.        Oh come on tell me.

4
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:12,088
多一个理由解释为何女人都不看我也不错
I could use another reason why women won't look at me.

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,752

昨晚 我梦到...
Last night, I had a dream...

7
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:19,466
你跟我...
that, urn, you and I were, uh...

8
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,510
在这张桌子上做
Doing it on this table.

9
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:26,607
漂亮的梦中上垒
Wow. Excellent dream score.

10
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,104
为什么? 你为什么会做那种梦?
Why? Why would you dream that?

11
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,529
更重要的是 我厉害吗?
More importantly, was I any good?

12
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,662
嗯 真的很不错
Well, you were pretty damned good. Ha ha.

13
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:44,863
有意思 因为在我的梦中 我笨拙到让人吃惊
Interesting, because in my dreams, I'm surprisingly inadequate.

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,043
昨晚你在这张桌子上非常熟练
Well, last night, you seemed to know your way around the table.

15
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,844
能够这样分享真好
I love it when we share.

16
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,928
你还好吧?
You okay there?

17
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,613
真不敢相信你们在她的梦里做爱
I can't believe you two had sex in her dream.

18
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,847
对不起 就那么一次而已
I'm sorry. It was a onetime thing.

19
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:11,238
我非常醉 而且那是别人的潜意识
I was very drunk, and it was someone else's subconscious.

我只是个白痴
I'm just such a dummy.

34

我在一个"在家自我按摩"讲座教他们

133
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,114
模仿我?      对啊
They do me?        Yeah.

134
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,574
就像这样...
You know, like, urn, okay.

135
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,582
"那份报告可以再拖久一点"
"Could that report be any later?"

136
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:28,914
我说话才不是那样
I don't sound like that.

137
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,258
钱德      就是那样
Oh. oh. Chandler.         Oh. Yeah, you do.

138
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,546
这山谷回荡着...
The hills are alive with the sound...

139
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,589
音乐
of music."

140
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:46,766
我的司康松糕! "我"的司康松糕!
My scone! My scone!

141
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,862
少来 我说话不是那样子 那"不"是真的
Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.

142
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:56,484
那不是...那不是...那...
That is so not...That is so not...That...

143
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,117
你们闭嘴
Oh, shut up.

144
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,451
不会吧
Ha, ha. You did not.

145
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,581
真的 一直到我9岁...
I am telling you, up until I was 9...

146
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:08,291
我都认为枪下就是人犯罪的地方
I thought gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happened.

147
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,423
怎么可能?      你想想看 新闻不是一直在播
Ha, ha. How is that possible?        Think about it.It's always on the news.

148
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,255
"一名男子被架在枪下"
"A man is being held up at Gunpoint."

149
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,795
"观光客枪下惊魂"
"Tourists are being terrorized at Gunpoint."

150
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:20,925
我一直很疑惑 "为什么大家还是继续去那里?
And I just kept thinking, "Why do people continue to go there?"

151
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,775
我得走了      好吧
I should go.        Okay.

152
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,898
好
Okay.

153
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,283
除非...      什么?
Unless...        What?

154
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,537
你想在这里过夜
Uh, unless you wanna stay over

155
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,738
我得在这里过夜 所以...
I mean, I'm going to. So...

156
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,800
好啊 我很愿意
Yeah, I'd really like that.

157
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:01,014
在真正开始过夜之前...
Uh, before we get into any staying over stuff

158
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,470
有些事要先让你知道
there's something you should know.

159
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,136
好 是类似"我明天早上有一堂很早的课"这种事...
Okay. Is this like "I have an early class tomorrow"

160
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,898
还是"我已经跟一头山羊秘婚了"?
or "I'm secretly married to a goat"?

161
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,853
介于两者之间
Well, it's somewhere in between.

162
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:18,315
严格来说 我不算是...
You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not, uh...

163
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,451
我是说 我从来没有...
Well I mean I haven't ever, urn...

164
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,407
伊森?      什么事?
Ethan?        Yeah?

165
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,866
你是处男吗?
Are you a virgin?

166
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,826
如果你们这些孩子 现在这么称呼的话...
Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days...

167
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,862
对 我是个处男
then yes, I am.

168
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,738
我一直在等待对的人出现
I uh...I've kind of been waiting for the right person.

169
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,220
真的吗?      真的
Really?        Yeah.

170
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,550
你知道我是指你吧?
You do know I was talking about you, right?

171
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,300
你一直哇个不停
You keep saying that.

172
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,949
这在书上看过 电影上也有
You know, you read about it. You see it in the movies.

173
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,954
就算在家里自己练习过 但是 天啊...
Even when you practice it at home, man, oh, man...

174
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:09,207
感觉完全不同
it is nothing like that.

175
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,037
等一下 听着
Listen. listen.

176
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:19,551
你告诉我了一件 对你来说很难启齿的事
Urn, you told me something that was really difficult for you.

177
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:23,988
我想 既然你可以对我说实话 我也可以对你说实话
And, urn, well, I figure if you can be honest, then I can too.

178
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,764
天啊 不要告诉我我做错了      不是
Oh, God, don't tell me I did it wrong.        No.

179
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,473
不是 不是 不是
No, no, no.

180
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,229
那件事你没做错
Nothing wrong about that.

181
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:37,064
好 是这样的
Urn, okay. Here goes.

182
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,397
我不是22岁
I'm not 22.

183
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,237
我25
I'm 25.

184
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,655
又13个月
And 13 months.

185
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,116
但是我想 这不应该有什么影响吧
But I figure, you know, that shouldn't change anything.

186
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,786
我们的年龄 不是什么问题吧 对不对?
I mean. what the hell does it matter how old we are?

187
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,128
嗯...
Listen, urn...

188
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,425
既然我们开始说实话了...
as long as we're telling stuff, uh...

189
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,964
我还有一件事要告诉你
I have another one for you.

190
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,238
我比当初说的要小一点
I'm a little younger than I said.

191
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,603
你不是大学四年级吗?
You're not a senior?

192
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,015
我是四年级
Oh,I'm a senior.

193
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,363
高中四年级
In high school.

194
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,821
好吧
Okay.

195
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,041
我们做的事大错特错
What we did was wrong.

196
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,050
天啊 刚刚跟我上床的人
Oh God. I just had sex with someone

197
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,956
美国两百周年国庆时还不存在
who wasn't alive during the bicentennial.

198
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,084
我刚破处
I just had sex.

199
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,514
伊森 专心一点 你怎么不早点说?
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?

200
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,347
你也没告诉我你多大      那不一样
You never told me how old you were.        That's different.

201
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,854
我的谎话不会让我们在48州都成为通缉犯
My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states.

202
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,550
你有没有在用大脑?
What were you thinking?

203
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,525
我没在用大脑 我忙着...
I wasn't thinking. I was busy falling... Don't

204
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,175
不要说出来      爱上你
say it.        ...in love with you.

205
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,776
真的吗?
Really?

206
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,942
对不起
Sorry.

207
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,155
不要再爱我了
Well, fall out of it.

208
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,743
你根本不该在这里 明天还要上学
You know, you shouldn't even be here. It's a school night.

209
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,663
天啊 天啊
Oh, God. Oh, God.

210
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:22,083
我和那些专找乳臭未干的小子的女人没两样
I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad.

211
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,053
我是琼考琳斯
Im Joan Collins.

212
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,515
谁啊?
Who?

213
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,320
好吧 安德烈45分钟后就会回来
Okay, Andre should be there in about 45 minutes.

214
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,697
好的 再见
All righty. Byebye.

215
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,617
这样比较干脆
Ahem. It's just easier that way.

216
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,788
好啦 上次做的梦 你就肯说
Oh come on. You told me about the last dream.

217
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,745
不要 不告诉你
No. Forget it.

218
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:01,488
为什么 我是不是做了 什么特别销魂蚀骨的事?
Well, why not? Was I doing something particularly saucy?

219
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,878
好啦 好啦
All right, fine. Urn...

220
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,613
当时不只有你
Well, you were not the only one there.

221
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,888
乔伊也在
Joey was there too.

222
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,926
好
All right.

223
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,054
还有...
Was there, uh, heh...

224
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,901
别人吗?
anybody else there?

225
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,154
没有      你确定?
No.        You sure?

226
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:30,613
没有人在发薄荷糖之类的吗?
Nobody, uh, handing out mints or anything?

227
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,800
没有 就我们三个
No, it was just the three of us.

228
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,830
那么 是你先跟钱德 然后再你和我...
So tell me, was it like you and Chandler and then you and me...

229
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,862
还是我们三个都在一起?
or you and me and Chandler?

230
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,457
你知道吗?      什么?
You know what?         What?

231
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,627
有几次...
There were times...

232
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,046
根本没有我
when it wasn't even me.

233
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,476
好甜蜜哦 你们两个
That is so sweet, you guys.

234
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,697
嘿 摩妮卡      
Hey, Mon.

235
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,323
摩妮卡 伊森又打电话来了
Mon, Ethan called again.

236
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,112
摩妮卡?
Mon?

237
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,030
摩妮卡!
Mon!

238
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,329
干嘛?      伊森又打电话来了
What?        Ethan called again.

239
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,922
你不跟他交往啦?      不了
You're not seeing him anymore?         No.

240
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,458
有时候 两个人就是没办法在一起
You know, sometimes just things don't work out.

241
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,613
这个跟他连络簿上要有家长签名
And this has nothing to do with the fact

242
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:32,845
才能不去上体育课有关吗?
that he needs a note to get out of gym?

243
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:40,095
我没说...我什么都没说 我发誓
I didn't say any. I did not say anything, I swear.

244
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,604
他跑来看你
He stopped by.

245
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,184
改天你跟他说话的时候...
Next time you talk to him...

246
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,352
能不能问他哪个金刚战士威力最强大?
could you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?

247
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:53,320
哈哈 我的人生真是好笑 大家可以闭嘴了吗?
Oh, my life is just so amusing. Heh, heh. Can we drop it now?

248
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,734
抱歉 抱歉
Sorry. Sorry.

249
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,861
金刚合体!
It's morphing time.

250
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,575
剑龙      暴龙
Stegosaurus!        Tyrannosaurus!

251
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,787
我要走了
Oh, I gotta go.

252
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,705
头晕
Whoa. Ooh, head rush. Oh.

253
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,168
再来一次 我就得出发了
One more and then I have to go.

254
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,552
酷
Cool. Ha ha.

255
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,012
你要去哪儿?
Where you going?

256
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,724
有同事要开生日派对
Oh, I got a birthday party with some work people.

257
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,604
同事?
Work people?

258
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,925
都没人告诉我      对啊 我知道
Nobody told me.        No, I know.

259
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:30,695
这跟他们不希望你大驾光临有关
That's part of the whole, you know, them not liking you extravaganza.

260
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,113
我不懂 这些人一个月前都还是我的朋友
Know what? I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends.

261
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:39,245
现在我换了位置 不表示我的脑袋也换了
Just because I'm in charge, doesn't mean I'm a different person.

262
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,248
那你应该一起来 跟大家聊聊
Well, then you should come tonight, just hang out with them.

263
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,409
让他们看看 你还是跟以前一样好玩好相处
Let them see what a great guy you still are.

264
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,669
你觉得我应该去吗?      对啊 真的
You think I should?        I really do, yeah.

265
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,712
好      好吧      好
Okay.        Okay.        Okay.

266
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,425
但是我们能不能不要一起出现?
Oh, but, urn, could we not go together?

267
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:55,591
我不想当那个邀上司一起来的怪胎
I don't wanna be the geek who invited the boss, you know?

268
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,386
昨晚真是好玩
I think last night was great.

269
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:04,349
还唱了卡啦OK 翠西跟我合唱了"乌木和象牙"
You know, the karaoke thing? Tracy and I doing "Ebony and Ivory"?

270
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,737
你很受欢迎 但是他们私底下还是会笑你
You were great. But they still made fun of you.

271
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,852
什么?      现在你更像"关心下属"老板
What?        Now you're more like Mr."Caring"Boss.

272
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,520
"我们可以同乐"老板
Mr."l'm One of You"Boss.

273
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,531
我想跟你们一起混的宾老板
Mr."I Wanna Be Your Buddy"Bossman Bing.

274
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,700
这我就搞不清楚了
Then I don't get it.

275
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:23,201
你知道吗 钱德 我想你得面对现实
Well, you know what, Chandler? I think you just gotta face it.

276
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,833
你现在是那个有大办公室的人了
You're, like, the guy in the big office, you know?

277
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,957
你是那个操纵他们生死大权的的人了
You're the one that hires them and fires them.

278
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,838
他们还是觉得你是个好上司      真的吗?
They still say you're a great boss.        They do?

279
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,502
但是他们已经不是你的朋友了
But they're not your friends anymore.

280
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,175
但是我只想要...      但是你不行
But I just want to...        No, but you can't.

281
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:39,881
但是我只想要...
But I just want...

282
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,771
你不是要...?
Aren't you gonna...?

283
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,527
卡萝跟我约好了
Oh, Carol and I have a new system.

284
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:57,441
如果她打来"911" 就表示她要生了
If she punches in"911", it means she's having a baby.

285
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,860
其他的我都不管了      那安德烈怎么办?
Otherwise, I just ignore it.        What about Andre?

286
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,237
今天早上他接到 
This morning he got a call

287
00:18:02,237 --> 00:18:04,121
我觉得好像是我们表哥纳森的电话
from what I think was our cousin Nathan.

288
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,034
说真的 我不想知道那么多
And frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.

289
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,124
嘿
Hey.

290
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,675
那本来是我的开场白
That was gonna be my opener.

291
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:22,465
嘿 你们看过厕所里面新的干手机吗?
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand dryers in the bathroom?

292
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,385
我以为那只是传闻      真的有
I thought that was just a rumor.        True story.

293
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,349
有件事我得告诉你
All right, look, I gotta tell you something.

294
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,607
我不是17岁
I'm not 17.

295
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,440
我说我17岁 这样才会让你觉得我可爱又脆弱
I only said that so you'd think I was cute and vulnerable.

296
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,855
我已经30了
I'm actually 30.

297
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,446
我有老婆 有工作 是你选区的国会议员
I have a wife. I have a job. I'm your congressman.

298
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:44,028
摩妮卡 这太离谱了 我们在一起很快乐
Monica, this is ridiculous. We are great together.

299
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,790
我们很有话聊 能逗对方笑 性生活 天啊 太美满了
We can talk, we make each other laugh. And the sex. Oh. man.

300
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,293
好 我是没得比较 但是我觉得很棒
Okay, I have no frame of reference, but I thought that was great.

301
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,334
是很棒      那么问题在哪里?
It was.        Then what's the problem?

302
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,002
伊森 这让人...
Ethan,it's,urn...

303
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,053
太肉麻了
It's icky.

304
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,715
肉麻?
Icky?

305
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:08,478
就因为你觉得肉麻 就要放弃这段感情?
You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?

306
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,810
真的 我也很难受
Look, this isn't easy for me either.

307
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,565
我也希望情况不是这样
I wish things were different.

308
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,569
要是你大几岁 或者我小几岁...
If you were a few years older or I was a few years younger...

309
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,321
或是我们活在圣经时代...
...or we lived in biblical times...

310
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,863
我就可以...      不要说出来
I could really...        No. don't say it.

311
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,243
爱你
love you.

312
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,954
你们的手干了吗?      还是湿湿的
Are your hands still wet?        They're moist.

313
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,244
对啊      我们再去烘一下
Yeah, right? Ahem.        Let's dry them again.

314
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:42,882
还有"这玛格莉特调酒可以再烈一点
Or, like, "Could these margaritas be anystronger?"

315
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,637
嘿 钱德      你好 宾先生
Hey, Chandler.        Hello, Mr.Bing.

316
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,269
我爱你昨晚模仿的史蒂夫汪德
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.

当然      没问题
Sure.        No problem.

320
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,404
让他们忙一点是有必要的 你知道吧?
You have to give them something, you know?

321
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,820
好 那是葛斯顿 山多斯 那个有小胡子的是谁?
Okay, that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the mustache?

322
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,989
彼崔      彼崔 对 对 好
Petrie.        Petrie. Right, right, okay.

你在干什么? 我们是要去医院
What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.

What, so I can't look nice? There might be doctors there.

342
00:21:56,732 --> 00:22:00,099
