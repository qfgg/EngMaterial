Okay, will that be all?

她们是双胞胎
They're twins.

6
00:00:08,806 --> 00:00:11,260
菲比是菲比 乌苏拉却很辣
Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's hot.

7
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:11,972
这是送给乌苏拉的
It's for Ursula.        

8

当然 好 合适

马塞尔 把遥控器还给罗斯
Marcel, give Rossy the remote.

10
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,892
他怎么办到的
How did he do this?

11
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,436
还不全是因为乌苏拉
It's this whole stupid Ursula thing.

12
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,275
他是在跟她约会  
So he's going out with her.

13
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:26,986
我是说 真有这么糟糕吗
I mean,is it really so terrible?

14
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:28,770
你不了解我姐姐               
You don't know my sister.      

15
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,530
你得找乔伊谈谈
You've gotta talk to Joey.

16
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,350
他爱上了她了                     
He's falling in love with her.        

17
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,574
你不会失去他的
You aren't gonna lose him.

18
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,026
他们连床都没上 
They haven't even slept together yet. 

19
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:37,032
这不算什么
I mean, that's not serious.

20
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,662
有事吗
Yeah, may we help you?

我的室友拆圣诞灯的时候
Hi, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights

26
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,110
跌下了阳台 
and she fell off the balcony 

27
00:00:59,112 --> 00:01:01,444
可能伤到脚或是脚踝或是哪儿了
and may have broken her foot or ankle or something.

28
00:01:01,444 --> 00:01:04,026
天啊 你们家的圣诞灯到现在还亮着
My God, you still have your Christmas lights up?

29
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:07,856
填好后交给我
Fill this out, bring it back to me

30
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,228
来吧
Okay. Here you go.       

31
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,736
好了
All right.

32
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,990
名字
Name...

33
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,485
地址
Address...

34
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,863
紧急联络人
Okay. In case of emergency, call...?

35
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,407
你
You.

36
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,745
真的
Really?

37
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,788
对
Yeah.

38
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,578
你真好     
Oh, that is so sweet.      

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,578
当然啦
Sure!

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,048
我爱你
Oh, gosh. I love you.

41
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,634
保险
Okay, insurance?

42
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,804
打勾 当然需要保险
Oh, yeah. check it. Definitely, I want some of that.

43
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,468
你没有保险
You don't have insurance?

44
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,308
为什么要有 这要花多少钱啊
Why? How much is this gonna cost?

45
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:44,418
我不知道 
I have no idea. 

46
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:46,304
单照X光就可能要几百块
But Xrays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.

47
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,754
那要怎么办     
 What are we gonna do?         

48
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:48,754
没有太多办法可想
There's not much we can do.

49
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,735
除非我用你的
Unless, unless I use yours.

50
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,647
不不不不不
No, no, no, no, no.

51
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,073
等等
Well, now, wait a second.

52
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,493
我刚才紧急联络人填的是谁
Who did I just put as my "incase of emergency" person?

53
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,494
这是保险欺诈
That's insurance fraud.

54
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,500
好吧 那就算了 
Well, all right, then. Forget it. 

55
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,496
那回家好了
Might as well just go home.

56
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,793
好吧 过来 讨厌      
Okay, okay, come here. I hate this.        

57
00:02:13,794 --> 00:02:15,794
谢啦 谢啦 我爱你
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.

58
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:20,380
给我一份新表格
Hi, heh. Urn, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms.

59
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,680
为什么
Why?

60
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,426
我简直就是个笨蛋
I'm really an idiot

61
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,016
我帮我朋友填表格
You see I was filling out my friend's form

62
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,393
填的不是她的资料
and instead of putting her information

63
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,892
填成我自己的
I put mine.

64
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,022
你的确是个笨蛋
You are an idiot.

65
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:39,322
没错 这就是我 我就是这么笨
Yep, that's me. I am that stupid.

66
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,550
昨天晚上我做了一个梦
I had a dream last night 

67
00:02:42,552 --> 00:02:44,236
我梦到跟儿子打橄榄球
where I was playing football with my kid.

68
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,000
很温馨
That's nice!

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,322
很好
Nice!

70
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,369
不 是把他当成球
No,no, with him.

71
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,713
我人在球场上 他们把小孩丢给我
I'm on this field, and they hike me the baby.

72
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,000
我必须得做点什么
I know l've gotta do something 

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,613
因为坦帕湾队的防守球员逐渐向我逼近
because the Tampa Bay defense is coming right at me.

74
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,555
坦帕湾队很差
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.

75
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,807
是没错 但
Right, but...

76
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,100
只有我和我儿子
it is just me and the baby,

77
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,104
所以我想我们死定了
so I'm thinking they can take us.

78
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,604
所以我就只好
And so I, uh, heh...

79
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,727
把小孩传到前场
I just heave it downfield.

80
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,853
你疯了不成 那是个婴儿耶
What are you, crazy? That's a baby.

81
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,315
难不成他应该上垒
He should take the sack?

82
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,330
总之突然间我来到前场
Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield.

83
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,404
我发现
And I realize that 

84
00:03:29,405 --> 00:03:32,417
该接住孩子的是我 对吧
I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right?

85
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,121
但我知道我绝对不可能
Only I know theres no way 

86
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:35,546
及时赶到
I'm not gonna get there in time.

87
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,421
所以我就一直跑一直跑
So I am running and I'm running...

88
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,295
然后我就醒来了
and that is when I woke up.

89
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,920
看 我绝对还没准备好去当一个父亲
See I am so not ready to be a father.

90
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,051
你没问题的
Hey,you're gonna be fine.

91
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,180
你是整个北美最细心 
You're one of the most caring, 

92
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:49,634
最有责任感的男人
the most responsible men in North America.

93
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,012
你会是好爸爸的
You're gonna make a great dad.

94
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:55,892
没错 罗斯 你和你儿子只需要更好的阻挡
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.

95
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,698
对了 你们有谁去过彩虹屋吗? 
Oh,have either of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? 

96
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,031
真有那么贵吗?
Is it real expensive?

97
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,946
除非你要点些什么东西
Only if you order stuff.

98
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,000
我今晚要带乌苏拉去 今天她生日
I'm taking Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.

99
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:11,276
那菲比生日怎么办     
Whoa, what about Phoebe's birthday?         

100
00:04:11,277 --> 00:04:12,624
她什么时候生日
When's that?

101
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,207
今晚啊
Tonight.

102
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:19,088
怎么这么巧
Ugh, man, what are the odds of that happening?

103
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,967
你慢慢想
You take your time.

104
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:29,637
终于懂了
There it is.

105
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,263
你怎么打算怎么办
So, what are you gonna do?

106
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,295
能怎么办
What can I do? 

107
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:39,355
我不想搞砸和乌苏拉这边的事
Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.

108
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,644
那你的朋友菲比就可以吗
And your friend Phoebe?

109
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,100
如果她是朋友希望她能谅解 
If she is my friend, hopefully she'll understand.

110
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:44,735
你们不会这样吗
I mean, wouldn't you guys?

111
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,074
老兄 如果是我生日 你给我搞这套
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday

112
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,571
你就等着看我发飚吧
you'd be staring at the business end of a hissy fit.

113
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,205
加一小撮藏红花 效果会大不同
You add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.

114
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:03,354
摩妮卡      
Okay,uh, Monica?

And I'm his friend Dr. Rosen.

121
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,013
作为一个大夫 你会不会太帅了点
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?

122
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,473
抱歉
Excuse me?

123
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,599
天呀 年轻 我是说年轻
God, young, young. I meant young.

124
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,692
当大夫年轻了点
Young to be a doctor.

125
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:22,675
说得好 瑞秋      
Oh good, Rach.         

126
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:24,362
谢谢      很好 
Thank you.        Right.

127
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,708
医生说只是扭到 没什么了
So he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.

128
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,119
你忘了说我们做的蠢事
You left out the stupid part.

129
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,875
才不蠢呢
It's not stupid.

130
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,242
那两个非常非常帅的医生
The very cute cute cute doctors 

131

我答应了
and I said yes.

133
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,289
太疯狂了 
I think it's totally insane. 

134
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,050
他们可是在那家医院上班
I mean, they work for the hospital.

135
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,178
这简直就像重回犯罪现场一样
It's like returning to the scene of the crime.

136
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,725
我们还是取消约会好了     
Y'know, l say we blow off the dates.         

137
00:05:54,726 --> 00:05:56,424

00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,643
到目前为止我们了解些什么
All right, what have we learned so far?

141
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,775

Surprise!

143
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,673
你们搞什么啦 吓死我了
What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap out of me.

144
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,500
那是蛋糕吗      
Was that the cake?         

145
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:30,968
对 我买了个柠檬烂糕
Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon shmush.

147
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,725
但愿没砸烂
I hope it's okay.

148
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,973
生日快乐 菲
Happy Birthday, Peehee.

149
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,444
或许可以用玫瑰写个比字
Maybe we can make a B out of one of those roses.

150
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,113
没错 就用特制蛋糕工具
Yeah,we'll just use our special cake tools.

151
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,117
怎么了      
Hey,what's going on? 

152
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:51,650
我们只是
Oh. we just...

惊喜
Surprise!

154
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,999
好棒喔 天啊
This is so great. Oh, my God.

155
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,081
一点也不吓人
This was not at all scary.

156
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,003
各位 蓓蒂
Hi, everybody. Hi, Betty.

157
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,455
蓓蒂
Betty, hi.

158
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,963
你们找来蓓蒂 天啊 好棒
You found Betty. Oh, my gosh. This is so great.

159
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,587
我喜欢的人欢聚一堂
Everybody I love is in the same room.

160
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,547
乔伊呢
Where's Joey?

161
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,718
看到蓓蒂吗
Did you see Betty?

162
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,210
跟你说吧  我不介意
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind 

163
00:07:31,211 --> 00:07:32,983
投资日晒蕃茄干产业
having a piece of this sundried tomato business.

164
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,751
五年前 要是有人跟我说
Five years ago, if somebody had said to me 

165
00:07:35,752 --> 00:07:38,159
我们可以让蕃茄变成西梅干
"Here's a tomato that looks like a prune"

166
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,741
我会说“给我滚出去”
l'd say "Get out of my office."

167
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,963
老爸 我出生前你紧张吗
Dad, before I was born did you freak out at all?

168
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,006
我没紧张 我只是说
I'm not freaking out. I'm just saying..

169
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,168
要是有人来跟我说
if someone had come to me with the idea...

170
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:55,680
老爸 我是在说关于孩子的事
Dad, Dad, Dad. I'm talking about the whole, baby thing.

171
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,406
你有过那种 
Did you, uh, ever get this sort of panicky,

172
00:07:59,407 --> 00:08:03,556
为人父恐慌症吗
"Oh,my God,I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?

173
00:08:03,652 --> 00:08:07,474
没有 你妈很尽责 
No,your mother really did the work. 

174
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:08,689
我全心冲事业
I was busy with the business.

175
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,778
我不常在家
I wasn't around that much.

176
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,988
你找我来就是为了这个吗
Is that what this is about?

177
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,941
不是啦老爸 我只是在想
No, no, Dad. I was just wondering...

178
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,673
还来得及弥补 
There's time to make up for that. 

179
00:08:16,674 --> 00:08:18,619
我们可以一起做些事情
We can do stuff together.

180
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,876
你一直说想去威廉斯堡 
You always wanted to go to colonial Williamsburg.

181
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,242
要不我们去吧
How about we do that?

182
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,702
谢了 老爸
Thanks, Dad. Really, heh.

183
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,629
我只是
You know, I just, I just...

184
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,591
我只是想弄清楚
I just needed to know, urn...

185
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,798
你是何时才觉得自己已经当了父亲
when did you start to feel like a father?

186
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:39,241
我想应该是
Oh. Well, I guess it must have been 

187
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:41,184
你出生那天
the day after you were born.

188
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,805
我们在病房里 你妈在睡觉
We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep

189
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,859
他们把你抱进来交给我
and they brought you in and gave you to me.

190
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,237
你那时还又红又丑又小
You were this ugly little red thing.

191
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:53,633
突然间
And all of a sudden, 

192
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:56,905
你用拳头抓住了我的手指
you grabbed my finger with your whole fist

193
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,695
紧紧地捏住它
and you squeezed it so tight.

194
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,331
那时候我才感觉到
And that's when I knew.

195
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,331
那你不想去威廉斯堡吗
So you don't want to go to Williamsburg?

196
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,714
可以啊
We can go to Williamsburg.

197
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,676
吃鱼吧
Eat your fish.

198
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,140
瑞秋 帅医生来了
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.

199
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,846
来了
Okay, coming.

200
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,488
请进 麦可 杰夫瑞

201
00:09:29,488 --> 00:09:31,020
嗨      嗨
Hi.         Hi.

202
00:09:31,022 --> 00:09:32,499
我们带了酒来
Uh, here, we brought wine.

203
00:09:32,734 --> 00:09:36,071
看看这个 这是波格奈酒庄的名酒
Look at this. It's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine.

204
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:37,974
怎么能不喝      
So how could we resist?         

205
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:39,401
太棒了 你看看
Oh,that's great. Look at that.

206
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,947
摩妮卡 你的脚踝怎么样了      
So, Monica, how's the ankle?  

207
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:42,196
它呀
lt's,uh...

208
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,620
你自己讲吧
Why don't you tell them?

209
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,747
毕竟脚踝长在你身上
After all, it is your ankle.

210
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:52,047
感觉好多了 谢谢
You know it's feeling a lot better. Thank you.

211
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,262
你们快请坐 
Listen, why don't you guys sit down,

212
00:09:53,263 --> 00:09:55,004
我们去拿杯子
and we'll get you some glasses.

213
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,959
好      
Okay         

214
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,214
好
Okay

215
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,882
快坐好
STAT

216
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:04,763
听着 我在想 
Okay, listen, I'm thinking 

217
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:06,340
我们为什么不干脆把身份说清楚呢
why don't we just tell them who we really are?

218
00:10:06,341 --> 00:10:08,468
不会有事的 绝对不会有事的      
l mean it'll be fine. I really think it will be fine.        

219
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:10,140
不可能 我们会惹上麻烦的
It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.

220
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,271
摩妮卡 别这么没用好吗
Monica, would you stop being such a wuss?

221
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,321
没用 抱歉 我生活在真实世界中
A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?

222
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:17,943
怎么样      
So?         

223
00:10:17,944 --> 00:10:18,944
她们看起来很正常
So they still seem normal.

224
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,408
因为她们本来就很正常
That's because they are.

225
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,346
你必须得承认 
You have to admit, 

226
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:23,111
我们每次跟在医院认识的人约会都
when we go out with women we meet at the hospital, turns...

227
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,659
放松点 你看看身边
Would you relax? Take a look around.

228
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,125
没有异教徒的圣坛
There are no pagan altars.

229
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:33,080
角落里没有骨头堆
no piles of bones in the corners.

230
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,460
她们没问题 跟我这样做
They're fine. Go like this:

231
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,848
我们绝不能这样做
I said we are not going to do it, okay? 

232
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,986
你有时候真的太天真
Sometimes you can be such a big baby.

233
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,216
我才不天真      认真点
 I am not a baby.         Be serious.

234
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,597
是你穷紧张      你有公主病
You get uptight.        You act like a princess.

235
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,226
你知道吗        什么
You know what?      What?

236
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:54,354
你越来越像你妈
Every day you are becoming more and more like your mother

237
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,483
借过 来了
Excuse me. Hello, here we go.

238
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,566
这地方真不错 你们在这儿住多久了
This is a great place. How long have you lived here?

239
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,744
谢谢 差不多六年
Thanks, I've been here about six years.

240
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:08,119
瑞秋几个月前才搬来的
And Rachel moved in a few months ago.

241
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,709
我本来要嫁人了
See, I was supposed to get married

242
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,957
但临到圣坛才甩了人家
but, urn, I left the guy at the altar

243
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,300
真的吗      真的
 Really?         Yeah.

244
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,177
这是有点自私 不过
Yeah I know its pretty selfish, but

245
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,798
我就是这种人
hey, that's me.

246
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,853
尝尝鹰嘴豆泥吧
Why don't you try the hummus? 

247
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,392
摩妮卡 你从事什么工作
So, Monica, what do you do?

248
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,900
我是上流餐厅的大厨
I am a chef at a restaurant uptown.

249
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,569
好厉害      没错
Oh, good for you.         Yeah, it is.

250
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,979
多数是因为我可以到处指使别人 
Mostly because I get to boss people around, 

251
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,823
而这正好是我的嗜好
which I just love to do.

252
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,951
鹰嘴豆泥很好吃
Well, this hummus is great.

253
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,873
天佑鹰嘴豆
God bless the chickpea.

254
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,958
天啊
Oh, God!

255
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,632
我真是被宠坏了
I am so spoiled.

256
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,925
没了
That's it.

257
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,217
我刚有提过高中时
And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school

258
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,802
我胖得像猪吗
I was a cow?

259
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,265
我以前会尿床
I used to wet my bed.

260
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,985
我用胸部吸引人的注意
I use my breasts to get other people's attention.

261
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,108
我们都这样
We both do that.

262
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,205
摩妮卡和瑞秋住处
Monica and Rachel's apartment.

263
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:42,422
等等 瑞秋 是你爸爸
UhUh, yeah, just one second. Uh Rachel, it's your dad.

264
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,630
嗨 老爸
Hi, Dad.

265
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,840
不 是我
No. no. It's me.

266
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,601
爸 现在不方便
Listen, Dad, I can't talk right now. Urn...

267
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,891
有件事
But there's something, urn...

268
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,941
我一直想跟你说
There's something that I've been meaning to tell you.

269
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,479
失陪一下下
Just excuse me for a second.

270
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,940
记得大一时
Remember back in freshman year?

271
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,114
比利德端斯金和我在你们床上做爱
Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.

272
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:19,000
爸 爸 爸 
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, 

273
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:20,674
怎么可能 我怎么可能会跟比利德瑞斯金上床
Why, why would I sleep with Billy Dreskin?

274
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:23,041
他爸可是你工作上的死对头
His father tried to put you out of business.

275
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,626
你死定了
You are dead.

276
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,094
罗斯 他又拿到遥控器
Ross, he's got the remote again.

277

00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:35,057
或许他能把台转回来
Maybe he can switch it back.

279
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,312
或许不会
Maybe not.

280
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,561

284
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,137
是医院入院处的护士 
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. 

285
00:13:53,138 --> 00:13:54,988
她说表格有问题
There's a problem with the form.

286
00:13:54,988 --> 00:13:57,200
天啊 怎么办
Oh, God, what do we do?

287
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,518
我不知道 先问清什么事 
I don't know. Just find out what they want.  

288
00:13:58,519 --> 00:13:59,251
搞清楚他们要什么
Find out what they want

289
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,295
好 不 你来问
Okay. No, you do it.

Yes, we'll be right down. Thank you.

293
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:11,930
怎么了

294
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,710
有一张入院单忘了签名
We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.

295
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:16,611
噢 你说的对 你说的对 
Oh! Okay, you were right,you were right, 

296
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:17,820
不值得这样
This was just not worth it.

297
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:18,131
谢谢
Thank you.

298
00:14:18,572 --> 00:14:20,122

Trouble?

302
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,575
你姐姐那晚放我鸽子了
Your sister stood me up the other night.

303
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:31,981
不是吧 
Oh, no. 

304
00:14:31,982 --> 00:14:34,454
被人放鸽子的感觉不好受吧
Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?

305
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,321
有打电话给她吗    
Did you try calling her?         

306
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:39,409
我这两天一直在打
I've been trying for two days.

307
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,112
打电话到餐厅 
When I called the restaurant 

308
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,420
他们说她很忙
they said she was too busy to talk.

309
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,297
我简直不敢相信她想甩了我
I can't believe she's blowing me off.

310
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,569
你好
Hey

311

对 对了 我也有东西送给你
Right. Oh, I got something for you too.

320
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,610
你怎么知道我要来
How'd you know I was coming?

321
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,777
我们是双胞胎嘛
Urn, yeah, urn,twin thing.

322
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,366
不敢相信你会这样
I can't believe you did this.

323
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,409
不敢相信你会
I can't believe you

324
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,327
这样
did this.

325
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,663
你和乔伊怎么了
So, what's the deal with, urn, you and Joey?

326
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,790
这个嘛
Oh, right.

327
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,790
他人很好 但我们结束了
He is so great. But that's over.

328
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,591
他知道吗      谁
Does he know?         Who?

329
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:17,091
乔伊 他对你很着迷
Joey. You know, urn, he's really nutsy about you.

330
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,050
是吗 为什么
He is? Why?

331
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,250
你可把我问倒了      
You got me.         

332
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:25,389
没错 劳驾 这不是应该有配沙拉的吗?
Right. Excuse me, doesn't this come with a side salad?

333
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,814
你会打电话给他吗
So, urn, are you gonna call him?

334
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,954
你认为他喜欢我吗   
What, you think he likes me?         

335
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:31,946
不是他 是乔伊
No. Joey.

336
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:37,076
不会 他很聪明 他自己会想明白的
Oh, no, no. He is so smart. He'll figure it out.

337
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,866
要吃鸡肉吗
Do you want some chicken?

338
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,073
不了 有脸的东西不吃 记得吗
No, no, no food with a face, remember?

339
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,118
你一点儿没变
You have not changed.

340
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,836
是 你也一样
Yeah, you too.

341
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,920
你好 记得我们吗
 Hi! Remember us?     

342
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,530
你之前打电话来
Urn, yeah, you just called a little while ago 

343
00:16:55,531 --> 00:16:57,551
说入院表格要签名
about needing a signature on the admissions form?

344
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,265
看来我们需要一张全新的表格
Well, it turns out we need a whole new one.

345
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,556
因为呢
Because, urn, you see...

346
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,221
名字又写错了
I put the wrong name again.

347
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,775
因为      你就是这么笨
Because...        You're that stupid.

348
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,736
没错 我就是这么笨
I am. I'm that stupid.

349
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,815
我用支票支付吧
Yeah, and I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.

350
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,075
你知道你的保险是可以付的吧
You know, your insurance will cover that.

351
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,869
知道 只是我也不怎么聪明
Yeah I know. I'm just not that bright either.

352
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,582
好吧 最差的状况是
Okay, worst case scenario:

353
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,016
如果说你从来不觉得自己像个父亲      
Say you never feel like a father.         

354
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:28,350
嗯
Uhhuh.

355
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:32,340
你的儿子从没觉得你是他父亲
Say your son never feels connected to you as one.

356
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:36,461
他所有的人际关系全部受此影响
Say all of his relationships are affected by this.

357
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,387
你讲的话有重点吗
Do you have a point?

358
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,556
应该有的
You know,you'd think I would.

359
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,558
猴子是怎么了
What's up with the simian?

360
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,644
只是个毛球
It's just a fur ball.

361
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,148
好吧 该谁了
Okay, whose turn is it?

362
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,403
该你了 我拼出了"KIDNEY" 得43分
Yours. I just got 43 points for "KIENEY".

363
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,074
不 你没得分 你拼的是"IDNEY"
No, you got zero points for "IDNEY".

364
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,611
我有个"K"的 "K"呢
I had a "K". Where's my "K"?

365
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:11,625
快帮帮我 我的猴子吞了一颗K
You've got to help me. My monkey swallowed a "K".

366
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:12,987
那把东西给我抱出去
You had to get that animal out of here.

367
00:18:12,989 --> 00:18:14,100
不 你不了解 
No, you don't understand. 

368
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:15,830
动物医院在城的另一边
The animal hospital is way across town.

369
00:18:15,831 --> 00:18:17,298
他噎到了 我不知如何是好
He's choking. I don't know what else to do.

370
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:18,240
发生什么事了      
What's going on?         

371
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:19,522
马塞尔把一个拼字牌吞下去了
Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.

372
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,300
对不起 这个医院是医人的
Excuse me. This hospital is for people.

373
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,613
护士 他是人 他有名字
Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay?

374
00:18:28,613 --> 00:18:30,056
他还会看电视
He watches Jeopardy...

375
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,018
没人注意时还会摸自己
he touches himself when nobody's watching.

376
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,603
求求你发发善心
Please, please, have a heart.

377
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:36,638
我来看看吧      
I'll take a look at him.         

378
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:38,320
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

379
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,361

嘿
Hey.

383
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,251
乌苏拉
Urs.

384
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,675
你怎么会来这儿 我一直打电话找你
What are you doing here? I've been trying to call you.

385
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:02,926
听我说
Listen, urn...

386
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,446
别 别 别让我听
No, no, don't say "listen". 

387
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:06,972
我认得这个听 我也用过
I know that "listen". I've said that "listen".

388
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,307
抱歉
I'm sorry.

389
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,349
我实在是不懂  到底怎么了
I don't get it. What happened?

390
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,022
你在桥下说的那些话呢
What about everything you said under the bridge?

391
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:16,876
对 
Yeah, urn, ahem.

392
00:19:16,877 --> 00:19:21,732
你还是忘了我在桥下说的话吧
You know,you should just forget about what I said under the bridge.

393
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,160
那晚我太醉了全是胡说 
I was talking crazy that night. I was so drunk.

394
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,867
你不喝酒的
You don't drink.

395
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,620
没错 我不喝酒
That's right, I don't.

396
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,035
但是我是因你而醉
But I was drunk on you.

397
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,732
乌苏拉      
Oh Urs.         

398
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:37,002
但我们不可能有进展的
Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.

399
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,422
为什么 是因为我是菲比的朋友
Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?

400
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,468
如果是这个原因 你会愿意跟她绝交吗
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?

401
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,636
不行 我办不到
No, no, I couldn't do that.

402
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:53,105
那没错 就是因为菲比
Urn, then, yeah, it's 'cause of Phoebe.

403
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,269
我跟她只能选一个
So, you know, it's either her or me.

404
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,864
那么我只能说抱歉了
Then, uh... Then I'm sorry.

405
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,619
忘掉你是件很难的事
You know, you're gonna be really, really hard to get over.

406
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,499
我知道
I know.

407
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:23,093
不知道是因为要分手还是
I don't know whether it's just because were breaking up or what...

408
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,380
但你从没这么美过
but you have never looked so beautiful.

409
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,093
真的吗
Really?

410
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:58,866
菲比      
Pheebs?         

411
00:20:58,867 --> 00:20:59,205
什么事
Yeah.

412
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,387
他看起来好小
