1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,872
得了 那没什么大不了的
Would you let it go? It's not a big deal.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,870
没什么?简直是太神奇了
Not a big deal? It's amazing.

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,999
只要把手伸进去弄一弄
You just reach in,there's one little maneuver, and barn!

4
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:12,426
就把胸罩解开 从袖子里抽出来
A bra. Right out the sleeve.

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,177
据我所知 这种事
As far as I'm concerned...

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,673
男人根本就做不来 对吧?
...there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Right?

7
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,893
拜托!你们男人可以站着小便
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.

8
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,353
我们可以吗? 好 我会试试
We can? Okay, I'm trying that.

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,686
知道我想到什么了吗?
You know what blows my mind?

10
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:30,144
女人随时可以看胸部
Women can see breasts anytime they want.

11
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,527
只要往下一看 就在那里
You just look down, and there they are.

12
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,280
真不懂你们怎会有心工作
How you get any work done is beyond me.

13
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,281
我不懂 男人怎能做出许多残忍的事情...
What I don't get is the way guys can do so many mean things...

14
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:43,911
却完全不在乎
and then not even care.

15
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,917
多重高潮!
Multiple orgasms!

16

The One With the East German Laundry Detergent

21
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,520
周六夜 大日子!
So, Saturday night, the big night.

22
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,894
约会的日子! 周六夜 周六夜!
Date night! Saturday night. Saturday night!

23
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,277
你没节目 对吧?      一个也没有!
No plans, huh?        Not a one.

24
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,412
连跟珍妮丝分手的计划也没有?
Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?

25
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,821
对 对 闭嘴
Oh, right, right. Shut up.

26
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,300
钱德 没人喜欢分手
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone.

27
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:12,212
只是你非做不可      我知道 不过真的很难
You just gotta do it.         l know. But it's just so hard.

28
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,507
你就跟她坐在一起 她浑然不觉
You're sitting with her. She has no idea what's happening.

29
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,218
终于你鼓起勇气开始行动
You finally get up the courage to do it.

30
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,760
当你把纸条给她时 气氛真的很尴尬
There's that awkward moment when you've handed her the note.

31
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,720
你干嘛非得跟她分手?
Why do you have to break up with her?

32
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,555
像个男人 不要再打电话就好了
Be a man. Just stop calling.

33
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,109
如果你需要的话 我可以跟你一起做
If you want, I'll do it with you.

34
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,989
谢谢 不过她会觉得 我们在联合起来对付她
Thanks, but she'd feel like we were ganging up on her.

35
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,858
不 我是说是你和珍妮丝分手 我和东尼分手
No, I mean you break up with Janice. And I'll break up with Tony.

36
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,530
你要跟东尼分手?
You're breaking up with Tony?

37
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,451
我知道 他很好 不过已经不好玩了
I know. He's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore.

38
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,996
我不知道原因在我 或在于他的绝食抗议
I don't know if it's me or his hunger strike. I don't know.

39
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,871
还有人要点些什么吗?
Does anybody want anything else?

40
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,237
对了 你们上礼拜有一种有很好吃的核桃 
Yeah. Last week you had a wonderful nutty,

41
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:58,626
巧克力 蛋糕 或派的一种...
chocolatey, kind of cakey pie thing that...

42
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,803
不用了 我没事
Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.

43
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,390
怎么了? 干嘛苦瓜脸?
What's the matter? Why so scrunchie?

44
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,057
是我爸 他要给我一辆奔驰敞篷车
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.

45
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,186
那家伙 真让我火大
That guy, he burns me up.

46
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,773
对 是奔驰 只要我搬回家去
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home.

47
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,943
太可恶了! 他还叫我"年轻的女士"
It was horrible! He called me "young lady"

48
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,567
我讨厌我爸那样叫我
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that

49
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,947
他是否又说些 "你不可能办到"之类的?
Did he give you that whole "You're not up to this" thing again?

50
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,158
对 这次是带着三重唱的加长版
Yeah, I got the extended disco version with three choruses of:

51
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,243
"你永远不能自立"
"You'll never make it on your own."

52
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,833
嘿 乔伊
Hi, Joey.

53
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,256
哦 我的天!安琪拉!
Oh, my God. Angela.

54
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,680
哇!被你甩掉对她显然是好事
Wow. Being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.

55
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,799
你要过去吗?      不
Are you gonna go over there?        No.

56
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,093
好 不
Yeah. No.

57
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,226
待会再说 我不想显得太饥渴
Okay, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager

58
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,853
一下下 两下下...
One Mississippi, two Mississippi...

59
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,318
三下下 这样似乎就很酷了
...three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.

60
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:07,990
嘿 安琪拉
Hey, Angela.

61
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,325
乔伊
Joey.

62
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,705
你看起来很性感
You look good.

63
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,246
那是因为我穿着一件突显我胸部的衣服
Because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.

64
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,963
可不是吗
You don't say.

65
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,430
那 瑞秋 你晚上有何计划?
So, Rachel, what are you doing tonight?

66
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:31,142
晚上可精彩了 我跟摩妮卡要去洗衣店
Big glamour night. Me and Monica at Launderama.

67
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,140
你想听一个巧合吗?
You wanna hear a freakish coincidence?

68
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,190
猜猜还有谁也会去洗衣店?
Guess who's doing laundry there too?

69
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,355
谁?      我
Who?        Me.

70
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,987
这样还不够清楚吗?
Was that not clear?

71
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,654
何不...?
Hey, why don't?

72
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,988
我何不加入你们?
Why don't I just join you both there?

73
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,665
你的公寓不是有一间洗衣室?
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?

74
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,333
对
Yes.

75
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,547
我的公寓有洗衣室
I do have a laundry room in my building.

76
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,259
不过 那里有老鼠出没
Urn, but there's a rat problem.

77
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:08,722
他们显然对烘干机的芳香片很有兴趣
Apparently, they're attracted to the dryer sheets.

78
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,801
他们进去的时候都还好好的 出来的时候就...
They're going in fine, but they're coming out all...

79
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,597
蓬蓬的了
...fluffy.

80
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,685
总之 七点左右好吗?
Anyway, say, sevenish?

81
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,061
当然
Sure.

82
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,321
少来 我现在跟鲍柏在一起了
Forget it, Joey. I'm with Bob now.

83
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,865
鲍柏?鲍柏是谁?
Bob? Who the hells Bob?

84
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,483
鲍柏很棒
Bob is great.

85
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,866
他很聪明 见过世面 而且有真正的工作
He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job.

86
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:36,036
你一个月试镜三次 就说自己是演员 但是鲍柏...
You go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor. But Bob...

87
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,290
拜托!我们在一起时很快乐
Come on. We were great together.

88
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:43,917
不只是享乐的时候 比如说 谈话的时候也不错
And not just at the fun stuff, but, like talking, too.

89
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,092
抱歉 你说过 "我们做朋友就好"
Sorry, Joey. You said, "Let's just be friends."

90
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,806
那么
So guess what?

91
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,134
怎样?      我们就只是朋友
What?        We're just friends.

92
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,056
好吧 好吧
Fine. Fine.

93
00:05:56,314 --> 00:06:00,057
今天我们四个人 何不一块吃饭?就像朋友一样
So why don't the four of us go out and have dinner tonight? You know, as friends.

94
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,649
哪四个?
What "four of us"?

95
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,361
你跟鲍柏 我跟我的女朋友...
You and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, urn...

96
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,152
摩妮卡
...Monica.

97
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,280
摩妮卡 我告诉你 这家伙很适合你
Monica, I'm telling you, this guy is perfect for you.

98
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,237
甭想!
Forget it!

99
00:06:12,237 --> 00:06:15,284
自从你那会喷出字母块的表兄后 我就不信你了
Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.

100
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:20,043
拜托 这家伙很棒 他叫鲍柏 他是安琪拉的...
Come on, this guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's...

101
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,412
兄弟
...ahem, brother

102
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,667
他很聪明又见过世面...
He's smart, he's sophisticated...

103
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,665
而且他有真正的工作
and he has a real job.

104
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,840
我一个月试镜三次 就说我是个演员 但他是...
Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...

105
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,679
老天爷啊      干嘛?
Oh God, help us.        What?

106
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,429
丑陋裸男在铺厨房地砖
Ugly Naked Guy is laying kitchen tile.

107
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,639
我是在请你帮忙
Look, I'm asking a favor here.

108
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,350
只要我帮她兄弟这个忙
I'm thinking if I do this for her brother,

109
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,443
安琪拉也许就会回到我身边
maybe Angela will come back to me.

110
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,985
你是怎么了? 你的女朋友加起来有几卡车
What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.

111
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,656
我知道 不过...
I know, but...

112
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:57,115
我犯了一个大错 我不该和她分手
Look, I made a huge mistake. I never should've broke up with her.

113
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,666
你帮帮我好吗?拜托?
Will you help me? Please?

114
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,544
好 再见
Okay. Bye.

115
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:12,387
摩妮卡不去了 只剩下我跟端秋
Monica's not coming. It's just gonna be me and Rachel.

116
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,850
等等 老兄 你确定你仔细想过了吗?
Hold on there, camper You sure you've thought this through?

117
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,266
只是去洗衣服 不太需要用到大脑吧
It's laundry. The thinking through is pretty minimal.

118
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,515
只有你跟瑞秋? 只有你们两个?
It's just you and Rachel? Just the two of you?

119
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,018
这是约会 你们要去约会了
This is a date. You're going on a date.

120
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,863
你觉得呢?
What are you saying?

121
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,533
我该再刮一下胡子 或拿瓶酒过去吗?
I should shave again? Pick up some wine? What?

122
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,124
嗯 你也许需要 再考虑一下你的脏内裤
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.

123
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,538
这将是她首次目睹你的内裤 你希望是脏脏的吗?
It's the first time shell see your underwear. You want it to be dirty?

124
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:51,967
不希望
No.

125
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,801
还有衣物柔顺剂呢?
And the fabric softener?

126
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,804
我的柔顺剂又怎么了?
Okay, okay now, what is wrong with my Snuggles?

127
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:04,060
怎样?这代表我是一个敏感 温暖的男人
What? It says I'm a sensitive, warm kind of guy.

128
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,774
知道吗?就像一只毛绒绒的小熊
You know, like a little fuzzy bear

129
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,359
我在路上再买别的好了
I can pick something else up on the way.

130
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,284
这才对
Thank you.

131
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,492
这个鲍柏长什么样子? 他是高还是矮?
So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall, short?

132
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,616
对
Yep.

133
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,455
到底怎样?
Which?

134
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,161
什么怎样?
Which what?

135
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,790
你也没见过鲍柏 对吧?
You've never met Bob, have you?

136
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,090
没有 不过...
No, but...

137
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,710
老天 这家伙可能长得很...
Oh my God, Joey, for all we know, this guy could be horribly

138
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,136
嘿 乔伊!
Hey, Joey

139
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:39,095
很迷人 我现在就闭嘴
Horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.

140
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,390
他们人呢?人呢?
Where are they? Where are they?

141
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,300
太棒了 我们从来没有 单独做过什么事
This is nice. We never do anything,

142
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,942
就我们两个
just the two of us.

143
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:54,736
太好了 也许我们明天 可以租辆车去撞一些小狗
That's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car, run over some puppies.

144
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,483
我不想那样
Ew. I don't wanna do that.

145
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,989
开始了      祝分手顺利
Here we go.        Have a good breakup.

146
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:07,370
嘿 珍妮丝      我的天 我很高兴你打电话给我
Hey Janice.        My God I am so glad you called me.

147
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,831
我今天真是衰到家了
I had the most supremely awful day.

148
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,466
那可不妙
That's not good.

149
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,887
能拿杯意式浓缩咖啡和拿铁过来吗?
Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?

150
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,053
我们拿到那些和蔬菜照相的样本了
We got the proofs from that photo shoot with the vegetables.

151
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,300
拍得很糟
They sucked.

152
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,554
我的整个下午就这样毁了 我去逛街
I blew off the rest of the afternoon. I went shopping.

153
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,727

That's so sweet.        I knew you had the Rockys.

162
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,714
你可以穿鹿兄配鹿兄
So you could wear Buliwinkle and Buliwinkle...

163
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,050
或鼠弟配鼠弟 或混着穿
or wear Rocky and Rocky, or you can mix and match.

164
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,127
麋鹿跟飞天鼠
Moose and squirrel.

165
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,213
随你搭配
Whatever you want.

166
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,932
我还要一杯意式浓缩咖啡 你还要拿铁吗?
I'm gonna get another espresso. More latte?

167
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:09,723
不用了
No.

168
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:13,151
不 我还在喝这一杯
No, I'm still working on mine.

169
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:18,819
就这样?
That's it?

170
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,487
真的很困难
Yeah, it was really hard.

171
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,865
对 那个拥抱看起来真残忍
Yeah. the hug looked pretty brutal.

172
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,825
你不是当事人!
Okay, you weren't there.

173
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,052
别挡路 让开 让开!
Coming through! Move! Move!

174
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,637
不好意思!我在用这台洗衣机
Excuse me! I was kind of using that machine.

175
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,310
对 嗯 现在你好像没在用了
Yeah, well, now you're kind of not.

176
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,394
不过我已经占了位子了 我把篮子放在上面了
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.

177
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,112
真对不起 这是你的篮子?      对
I'm sorry. Is that your basket?        Yes.

178
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,358
很漂亮 可惜的是 我没看到洗衣粉!
It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds!

179
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:04,902
什么?
What?

180
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:09,287
没有洗衣粉就不能占位 好吗?
No suds, no save, okay?

181
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,628
怎么了?      嗨
What's going on?        Hi.

182
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,583
没什么 那个讨厌的女人抢了我的洗衣机
Nothing. This horrible woman just took my machine.

183
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,342
你的篮子有放在上面吗?
Was your basket on top?

184
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,803
有 不过没放洗衣粉      那又怎样?
Yeah, but there were no suds.        So?

185
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,546
你知道...没洗衣粉就不算保留
You know, no suds, no save.

186
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,764
没洗衣粉就不...不好意思
No suds, no...Excuse me.

187
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,600
等一下!
Hold on a second!

188
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,973
这是我朋友的洗衣机
This is my friends machine.

189
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,392
喂 喂 喂! 她的东西没放在里面!
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it!

190
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,643
喂 喂 喂! 你明知规矩不是那样的!
Hey, hey, hey! That's not the rule, and you know it!

191
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,701
好 戏演完了
All right. Show's over.

192
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,876
没什么好看的了
Nothing to see here.

193
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,460
好 我们开始洗衣服了
Okay. Let's do laundry.

194
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:02,464
太厉害了! 我连我点的汤都不敢退
That was amazing! I can't even send back soup.

195
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:07,216
那是因为你是如此甜美 温柔...
Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle...

196
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,810
你...
Do you,uh...

197
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,430
哦 嘿 你一定需要洗衣粉
Oh, hey. You must need detergent.

198
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,359
那是什么?      超白牌洗衣粉
What's that?        Uberweiss.

199
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:23,440
是新的 德国货 超强力!
It's new. It's German. It's extra tough!

200
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,743
端秋 你准备分开洗吗
Rach, do you? Are you gonna separate those?

201
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,788
哦 天
Oh, God. Ugh.

202
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,950
我像个洗衣白痴 对不对?
Am I being like a total laundry spaz?

203
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:38,046
我是否该把上衣跟裤子分别放入不同的洗衣机?
Am I supposed to use one machine for shirts and another for pants?

204
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,677
你从来没洗过衣服吗?
Have you? Have you never done this before?

205
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:48,048
好吧 我没有 可是我认识一些洗过衣服的人
Well, not myself. But I know other people that have.

206
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,889
好吧 被你逮到了 我"第一次"洗衣服
Okay. You caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.

207
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,648
不要害怕 我会慢慢来
Don't worry. I'll use the gentle cycle.

208
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,064
好吧
Okay...

209
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,983
基本上 你得把所有白色的衣服放在一台机器里
Basically, you wanna use one machine for all your whites.

210
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,195
白色的      好
Whites.        Okay.

211
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,702
有颜色的放入另一台      有颜色的
A whole other machine for your colors.        Colors.

212
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,705
还要第三部洗你的...
And then a third for your, uh...

213
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,331
贴身衣物 也就是你的胸罩...
delicates. And that would be your bras...

214
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,830
你的小内裤之类的
..and your underpanty things.

215
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:26,052
这些是白色的棉质内裤
Okay, well, these are white cotton panties.

216
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,755
是要跟白色的衣物放一起 还是跟贴身衣物呢?
Would they go with whites or with delicates?

217
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,474
这得靠你自己判断了
That would be a judgment call.

218
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,435
他好可爱!
He's so cute!

219
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,067
你们在哪里长大的?
So where did you guys grow up?

220
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,404
布鲁克林高地      克里夫兰
Brooklyn Heights.        Cleveland.

221
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,820
怎么会这样?      我的天!
How did that happen?        Oh, my God!

222
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,612
怎么了?
What?

223
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,362
我突然有一种...
I suddenly had the feeling I was...

224
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,204
往下掉的感觉
falling.

225
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,578
现在没有了
But I'm not.

226
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,049
你跟安琪拉在一起 是吧?
So you and Angela, huh?

227
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,514
没错 就是这样
Yep. Pretty much.

228
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,390
你是个幸运的男人      是啊
You're a lucky man.        Yeah.

229
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,556
知道我最想念她哪里吗?
You know what I miss the most about her?

230
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:20,056
她吃东西时发出的可爱的小噪音
That cute nibbley noise she makes when she eats.

231
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,359
就像一只快乐的小松鼠...
Like a happy little squirrel...

232
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,691
或是鼬
...or a weasel.

233
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,526
我从没注意到
I never really noticed.

234
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:31,155
哦 有 有 你要注意听
Oh, yeah, yeah. Listen for it.

235
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,029
摩妮卡 摩妮卡很好
Monica. Monica is great.

236
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,531
对 她是啊
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

237
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,954
不过 不会长久
But it's not gonna last.

238
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,003
我心有余而力不足
She's too much for me in bed.

239
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,206
嘿咻方面
Sexually.

240
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,797
我得告诉你 鲍柏简直太棒了
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.

241
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,343
可不是?
Yeah, isn't he?

242
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,468
能遇到一个聪明 有趣
It's so great to meet a guy who's smart and funny...

243
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,061
成熟度超过八岁的男人真好
and has an emotional age beyond 8.

244
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,807
还有你知道吗? 他在床上的表现让人难以置信!
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed!

245
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,026
我哥从没告诉我他几岁失去童贞
My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.

246
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,444
那很好啊
That's nice.

247
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,668
你可以的 就像扯下绷带一样
You can do this. It's like pulling off a Band Aid.

248
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,915
动作快点 伤口就会露出来了
Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.

249
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,666
快!快去!
Go! Go!

250
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,385
珍妮丝
Janice...

251
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,722
嗨 珍妮丝
Hi, Janice.

252
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,610
好 开始了 我想我们不该再交往下去了
Okay, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore.

253
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,947
珍妮丝
Janice.

254
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,611
好的
All right.

255
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,289
好吧
Well...

256
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,080
好 你说了
Well, there you go.

257
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,495
停 停 停
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

258
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,299
我知道说来有点蠢...
Okay, I know this is gonna sound really stupid...

259
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,797
不过我觉得 如果我今天能成功...
but I feel that if I can do this...

260
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,925
如果我真的能洗我自己的衣服...
if I can actually do my own laundry...

261
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,010
这世上就没有我办不到的事了
there isn't anything I can't do.

262
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,347
我怎么觉得这句话一点也不蠢
That does not sound stupid to me.

263
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:29,732
就像卡萝离开我后 我第一次自己做晚饭时...
No. It's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself after Carol left me...

264
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:33,940
对不起 我们的时间到了 下次再谈罗斯
I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross.

265
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,570
好
Okay.

266
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:36,951

U hoh.        What "uhoh"?

267
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,320
啊哦...
Uhoh...

268
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,451
啊哦 衣服洗好了
Uhoh, the laundry's done.

269
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,621
这是一首歌
It's a song.

270
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,710
我们在洗衣服时唱的
The laundry song that we sing.

271
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:51,090
啊哦!衣服洗好了
Uhoh, the laundry's done

272
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:52,963
怎么了嘛?
What's the matter?

273
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,301
没什么
Nothing. Nothing.

274
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,886
衣服洗好了
The laundry's done

275
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,220
快让我看
Come on, show me.

276
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:01,559
只是你的白衣服里有一只红袜子 所以就...
It's just that you left a red sock in with your whites, and now...

277
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,480
所有衣服变的有点粉红了
...everythings kind of pink.

278
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,309
都是粉色的了?
Everything's pink?

279
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,312
除了那只红袜子 还是红的
Except for the red sock, which is still red.

280
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,273
别难过 这种事大家都会遇到的
Don't be upset. It can happen to anyone.

281
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,400
可是这次发生在我身上
But it didn't. It happened to me.

282
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:21,246
天哪 我会变成只粉红凯蒂猫!
God, I'm gonna look like a big Marshmallow Peep!

283
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,288
我在干什么?
What am I doing? What am I doing?

284
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,706
我爸爸说的对! 我无法独立
My father is right! I can't live on my own.

285
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,412
我连洗衣服都不会!
I can't even do laundry!

286
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,800
那个超狗气球出状况了
Something went wrong with Underdog...

287
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,269
他们又没办法帮狗头充气
and they couldn't get his head to inflate.

288
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,188
总之...
So anyway...

289
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,230
狗头就在百老汇上 直直滚下去 对吧?
...his head is, like, flopping down Broadway.

290
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,444
我就在想
And I'm thinking...

291
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,400
这真的是不对劲
how inappropriate this is.

292
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:02,779
我的眼里有东西 乔伊 我们到灯光下看看好吗?
I've got somethings in my eye. Joey, could we check it in the light, please?

293
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,537
哦 我的天!      干嘛?
Oh, my God!        What?

294
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,502
我们坐在同一桌吗? 就像是...
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like...

295
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,001
近亲乱伦
cocktails in Appalachia.

296
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,800
他们很亲密      亲密?
Come on, they're close.        Close?

297
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,677
她的舌头都跑到他耳朵里了
She's got her tongue in his ear

298
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:26,469
好像你跟罗斯就没胡闹过
Like you've never got a little rambunctious with Ross.

299
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,399
乔伊 这是病态的 很恶心 很...
Joey, this is sick. It's disgusting. It's...

300
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,897
这不是真的 对不对?
...not really true, is it?

301
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,816
谁知道什么才是真的?
Who's to say what's true?

302
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,153
你在想什么?
What were you thinking?

303
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,945
好吧 我也不喜欢这样 好吗?
Look, I'm not proud of this, okay?

304
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,612
嗯 也许是有一点啦
Well, maybe I am a little.

305
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,571
我要走了!      等一下!
I'm out of here!        Wait! Come on

306
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,656
你喜欢他 我要她
You like him. I want her.

307
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,328
他喜欢你
He likes you.

308
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,085
真的?      对
Really?        Yeah.

309
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,965
如果我们团结起来 就凭我们二人...
I'm thinking, if we put our heads together between the two of us...

310
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,259
一定可以拆散他们
we can break them up.

311
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,510
对不起 真不敢相信我会出这种差错
I'm so sorry. I can't believe I did this.

312
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:07,226
你那个作家诺曼梅勒的故事 让我笑到不行
I just couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.

313
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,811
服务生?我们还要一盘鸡翅
Waiter? One more plate of chicken wings over here.

314
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,494
就像这样 我们根本不一样
Here's the thing. It's like we're different.

315
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,956
我是那种乒乒乒的人 你则是砰砰砰
I'm the bing, you're the boom

316
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,788
哦 我的天!      我很抱歉!
Oh, my God!        Ow! I'm so sorry!

317
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,619
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

318
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,876
只是我的隐形眼镜 我的镜片不见了
It's just my lens. It's my lens.

319
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,133
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

320
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,846
我打中她的眼睛! 打中她的眼睛!
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye

321
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,592
这是世界上最糟糕的分手!
This is the worst breakup in the history of the world!

322
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,593
哦 我的天!
Oh, my God.

323
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,188
你到底喝了几杯?
How many of those have you had?

324
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,603
我不晓得 一百万杯吧!
I don't know. A million!

325
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,729
钱德 放轻松 放轻松 想想你快乐的时光
Chandler shh. shh. Easy, easy. Go to your happy place.

326
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,651
我很好 我很好      好吧
I'm fine, I'm fine.        All right.

327
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,702
我不好 她来了
I'm not fine. Here she comes.

328
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,746
在这里等好吗?呼吸
Wait here, okay? Breathe.

329
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,059
你怎么办到的?
How do you do that?

330
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,348
就像一种天赋
It's like a gift.

331
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,357
以后我们一定要一起分手
We should always, always break up together.

332
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,726
我喜欢!
I'd like that.

333
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,982
衣服干净了 这才是最重要的
You got the clothes clean. That's the important part.

334
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,568
我想也是 可惜现在全部看起来都像睡衣
I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.

335
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,658
对不起
Whoa, I'm sorry.

336
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,411
抱歉 这推车是我们的
Excuse me. We had this cart.

337
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,839
我的腰以前也只有二十四英寸 人生总是有得有失
I had a 24 inch waist. You lose things.

338
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,337
好了 别挡我的路
Now, come on. Get out of my way.

339
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:07,214
对不起 也许我没有说清楚 这推车是我们的
I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't being clear. This was our cart.

340
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,472
喂 喂 喂! 刚才又没有衣服在推车里!
Hey, hey, hey. There aren't any clothes in it!

341
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,305
喂 喂 喂! 不要乱订规则!
Hey, hey, hey! Quit making up rules!

342
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:16,021
放手!快 这是我的推车 你知道是我先看到的
Let go! Come on, this is my cart. You know I saw it first.

343
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,399
给我听好 女人 如果你要这推车...
Listen, Mitzi, if you want this cart.

344
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,148
就连我一起推走!
you're gonna have to take me with it!

345
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,319
赞!你看到了没?
Yes! Did you see that?

346
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,787
你太厉害了
You were incredible.

347
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,490
各位先生 各位女士 看看这位全新的女性
A brandnew woman ladies and gentlemen.

348
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,076
谢谢 没有你的话 我根本办不到的
I could not have done this without you.

349
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:44,754
好...
Okay, urn...

350
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,802
干衣机里还有衣服吗?
Uh...More clothes in the dryer?

351
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,175
一我没事 没事      你确定吗?
I'm fine. I'm fine.        Are you sure?

352
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,184
你确定你没事?      确定
Are you sure you're okay?        Yeah.

353
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,816
还会痛吗?      会
Does it still hurt?        Yeah.

354
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:06,947
好主意!你所有的衣服都搭配上了 我也要这样做
What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.

355
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,989
嗨 还顺利吗?
Hi! How'd it go?

356
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,240
太棒了!
Excellent!

357
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:16,741
我们把那一对拆开了 然后各自保留一半
We ripped that couple apart and kept the pieces for ourselves.

358
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,334
好浪漫的故事
What a beautiful story.

359
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,081
对了 我没事
I'm fine, by the way.

360
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,673
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

361
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,089
钱德呢?      他需要一点疗伤的时问
Where's Chandler?        He needed some time to grieve.

362
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,588
我自由了!我自由了!
I'm free! I'm free!

363
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,266
应该是复原了
That ought to do it.

364
