00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:07,830
强森医生 七线有您电话
Dr.Johnson, you have a call on line 7.

2
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:11,425
她还没到 我孩子的妈还没到
She's not here yet. She's having my baby and she's not here.

3
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:14,504
我相信没事的 羊水破了吗?      我不知道
I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broken yet?        I don't know.

4
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:19,099
我们说话的时候 她说黏液栓子已经脱落了
But when I spoke to her, she said she'd already passed the mucus plug.

5
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,270
我们一定要知道这个吗?
Do we have to know about that?

6
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,189
乔伊 如果你小孩要生了怎么办?
Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?

7
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,814
我会在候诊室分送雪茄
I'm gonna be in the waiting room, handing out cigars.

8
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:34,987
我猜乔伊安排了在50年代的电影里生小孩
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50s.

9
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:39,115
我不敢相信 她有可能生在计程车上
Aah, I don't believe this. I mean she could be giving birth in the cab.

10
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:42,743
罗斯 别紧张 第一次阵痛可能只要2块钱
Oh, Ross, relax. It's only like $2 for the first contraction...

11
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:47,082
然后每次阵痛跳表5毛钱
...and then 50 cents each additional contraction.

12
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:50,630
怎样 钱德开玩笑就无所谓?
What, it's okay when Chandler does it?

13
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,504
你要会选时间
You have to pick your moments.

14
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,302
我错过了吗?
Hi. Did I miss it? Did I miss it?

15
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,509
她还没到      你背吉他干嘛?
No, she's not even here yet.        Oh. What's with the guitar?

16
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,643
我们可能要在这待一会儿 或许用得上音乐
I just thought we might be here for a while, so, you know, things might get musical.

17
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:06,723
你们去哪里了?      我们去了礼品店
Hey, where the hell have you been?        We stopped to the gift shop.

18
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:10,425
我买了玩偶 苏珊买了强奇巧克力棒
I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.

19
00:01:10,425 --> 00:01:13,525
你要生小孩了 买什么强奇巧克力?
You're having a baby. Ok? A baby. Ok? You don't stop for Chunkys.

20
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:16,657
我以前有那种保险杠贴纸
I used to have that bumper sticker.

21
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,534
你们懂我的意思吧?
You see what I mean?

But soon they'll grow up and resent you so much.

70

对你大喊大叫 让你感到不解

Seriously, is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?

84

So, uh, what's the deal with this father?

114
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,969
如果有人怀了我的孩子 我会想要知道的
I mean if someone was having my baby somewhere I'd wanna know about it.

Know what the Celtics'problem is? They let the players run the team.

121
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:45,999
才不是那样
Oh, that is so not true.

It's gonna be okay. We're doing it for Jordy. Keep focusing on Jordy.

127
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,175
乔弟到底是谁?      你儿子
Who the hell is Jordy?        Your son.

128
00:08:03,175 --> 00:08:07,142
我儿子不叫乔弟 我们说好要叫洁米的
I don't have a son named Jordy. We all agreed, my son'sname is Jamie.

129
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,437
苏珊的第一任女友也叫洁米
Well. Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend...

130
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,606
所以我们改回乔弟
We went back to Jordy.

131
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,612
你说什么改回乔弟? 我们从没谈过乔弟这名字
What do you mean, "back to Jordy"? We never landed on Jordy.

132
00:08:16,612 --> 00:08:22,116
在整个取名字的失败过程 我们压根没提过
We just passed by it during the whole Jesse/Cody/Dillon fiasco.

133
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:25,206
怎么了?      喔 小腿抽筋
Ow ow. ow! What? What? What?        Leg cramp, leg cramp.

134
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,462
我来      我来 我在弄了
I got it. I got it.        I got it. I'm doing it.

135
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,960
你能跟她睡觉 小腿给我
You get to sleep with her. I get the cramps.

136
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,295
不 我来
No, you don't.

137
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,797
够了 你们都出去      什么?
That is it. I want both of you out.        What?

138
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,462
她开始的      是他
She started it.        He started it.

139
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:39,049
我不管 我努力想把一个人从身体里生出来
I don't care. I'm trying to get a person out of my body here...

140
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:43,137
你们这不是在帮我! 现在出去!
and you're not making it any easier. Now go!

141
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,897
太感谢了      看你干的好事
Thanks a lot.        See what you did?

142
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,108
听我说...      出去
Yeah. Listen.        Out.

143
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:57,235
呼吸、呼吸、呼吸      喔 不
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.        Oh, no.

144
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,490
那是什么? 有东西爆出来了
What is that? Something exploded.

145
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,334
她只是羊水破了 冷静点
It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?

146
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,788
羊水破了?什么意思? 那是什么?
Water breaking? What do you mean? What's that, water breaking?

147
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,915
呼吸...
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

148
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,137
拜托 都是你的错      为何是我的错?
Oh, please. This is so your fault.        How? How is this my fault?

149
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,675
在你出现以前 卡萝从没把我赶出门过
Look. Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.

150
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:25,474
我还没出现之前 卡萝有很多事没做过
Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.

151
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:30,483
你是在耍聪明?      你觉得我威胁到你...
Are you trying to be clever?        You are so threatened by me.

152
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:31,925
我说的一切都是问题
Everything I say is a problem.

153
00:09:31,925 --> 00:09:34,771
嘿 好了 够了 进去里面
Okay. All right. That's it. Get in here. Come on.

154
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,358
天啊 你们两个 我真不敢相信
My God, you guys. I don't believe you.

155
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,653
这里有很多孩子等着出世
There are children coming into the world in this very building...

156
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:45,456
他们该听到的第一个声音 不是你们负面的争吵
...and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing.

157
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,784
所以你们别吵了! 闭嘴!
So just stop all the yelling! Just stop it!

158
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,294
对 苏珊
Yeah, Susan.

159
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:55,543
别逼我再这么做! 我不喜欢拉高嗓音!
Don't make me do this again! I don't like my voice like this!

160
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,974
谁想听听一件无奈的事?
Okay, who wants to hear something ironic?

161
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,098
拜托      快来人啊
Help!        Come on! Help!

162

你刚说巴黎 那听起来很棒
Anyway, you were telling me about Paris. It sounds wonderful.

169
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:41,388
有一家很棒的点心店 就在我饭店旁边
It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel.

170
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,760

用力挤 一路出来
Push him out, push him out. Way out.

174
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,602
我们抢球的动作要快

He's in a whole other place. Yeah. No, he's gone.

184
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,276

No, no, you don't have to fly back. Really.

185
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,675
什么叫"这可能是你唯一的机会"? 
What do you mean, this might be your only chance?

186
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:45,110
别说了好吗? 我才26岁
Oh. Would you stop? I'm only 26.

187
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,788
我都还没想到孩子的事
I'm not even thinking about babies yet.

188
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,258
你去哪了?      刚生了个孩子
Where have you been?         Oh, I just had a baby.

189
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,264
恭喜了
Mazel toy.

190
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,520
我不知道 有可能是1小时或3小时
I don't know. It could be an hour. It could be three.

191
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,940
但放轻松点 她很好
But relax, she's doing great.

192
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:20,779
所以 你最近有跟人交往吗?
So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?

193
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:26,030
没有 现在没有 没有 你呢?
No. No, not at...At the moment, no, I'm not, no. Are you?

194
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:28,661
不 要找女人跟我约会很难
No,no. It's hard enough to get women to go out with me.

195
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:32,700
是啊 帅的医生都这样
Heh. Right, yeah I've heard that about cute doctors.

196
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:38,539
不 是真的 我猜是因为我花很多时间...
No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know...

197
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,214
在我的工作上
...where I do.

198
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,890
我试着不让工作影响我的个人生活
I try not to let work affect my personal life, but it's hard when you do...

199
00:12:49,474 --> 00:12:51,767
但那很难 做我这样的事就像...
...what I do. It's like, uh...

200
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,395
好吧 比如说 你做哪一行?
Well, for instance, what do you do?

201
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,056
我是服务生      好吧
I'm a waitress.        Okay, all right.

202
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:00,362
难道你没有 当你很晚回到家
Well, aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day...

203
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:06,066
会不想再见到 任何一杯咖啡的经验?
...and you're just like, "If I see one more cup ofcoffee..."

204
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,656
对 我懂
Ahem. Yeah. Gotcha.

205
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:17,202

I'm gonna check up on your friend.        Okay, that's fine.

206
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,385
你怎么知道我在这?      你妈打电话给我
So how did you know I was even here?        Your mom called me.

207
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,757
所以这就是她?
So is this her?

208
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,264
不 这是借来的
No. This is a loaner.

209
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,518
很抱歉我让你孤单生产
Listen, I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.

210
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:43,983
我不孤单 我有医生、护士还有个善心男士
Oh. I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse and a helper guy.

211
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,363
你知道谁赢了比赛吗?
So did you see who won the game?

212
00:13:47,363 --> 00:13:50,948
尼克队赢了10分 他们很烂
Yeah, Knicks by 10. They suck.

213
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,785
他们也没那么烂啦
Eh, they're not so bad.

214
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,724
拜托...
Come on. Come on.

215
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,916
妈的 妈的 都是你的错
Damn it, damn it, damn it. This is all your fault.

216
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,855
这应该是我生命中最美好的一天
This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life.

217
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,949
我儿子要出生了 我应该在场的
My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know?

218
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,155
而不是跟你困在密室里
Instead I'm stuck in a closet with you.

219
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,618
我爱的女人要生了 我跟你一样期待这一天
I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.

220
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,996
相信我 没有人像我这么期待这天的
Believe me, no one has been waiting for this as much as I have, okay?

221
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,497
你知道好笑的是什么吗?
And you know what the funny thing is?

222
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,289
生完后 孩子可以跟你回去 而我剩什么?
When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby. Where does that leave me?

223
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,212
你是孩子的父亲
You get to be the father.

224
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:50,048
大家都知道你是谁 我算什么? 有父亲节、母亲节
Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Father's Day. There's Mother's Day.

225
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,547
没有女同情人节
There's no Lesbian Lover Day.

226
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,300
每天都是女同情人节
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.

227
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,889
这真是太棒了
This is so great.

228
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,147
解释一下好吗?
You wanna explain that?

229
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,439
我是说 我小时候 父亲就丢下我
I mean well, because when I was growing up, you know, my dad left...

230
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,485
我母亲死了 而我继父去坐牢
...and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail.

231
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:17,330
我几乎没有任何父母亲的疼爱
So I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one.

232
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:21,167
而这个宝宝有三个父母
And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents...

233
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:25,250
他们是如此关心他 还为此争吵谁最爱他
...who care about it so much that they fight over who gets to love it the most...

234
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,590
宝宝甚至还没出生呢
...and it's not even born yet.

235
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,712
他是世上最幸运的宝宝
It's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.

236
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,723
对不起 你们在吵架
I'm sorry. You were fighting.

237
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,010
他们在哪?
Where are they?

238
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,105
他们很快就会来的      他们不会错过这一刻的
I'm sure they'll be here soon.        Honey, they wouldnt miss this.

239
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:47,694
放轻松 你只开了9公分 宝宝还不会出来
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters, and the baby's at zero station.

240
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,611
你真令我感到害怕
Okay, you are really frightening me.

241
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:58,242
救救我好吗? 有人要挖出我的心脏
Somebody wanna help me? Trying to rip out my heart.

242
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,957
太好了 有人看到奶头吗?
Oh, that's great. Anybody see a nipple?

243
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,374
10公分了 开始了
All right. Ten centimeters. Here we go.

244
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,879
甜心 要开始用力了      但他们还没到
All right, honey, time to start pushing.        But they're not here yet.

245
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:15,217
抱歉 宝宝不能等的      喔 天啊
Sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.        Oh, God.

246
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,488
好了 通气孔打开了
Okay, got the vent open.

247
00:16:20,488 --> 00:16:22,762
嗨 我是班
Hi. I'm Ben.
